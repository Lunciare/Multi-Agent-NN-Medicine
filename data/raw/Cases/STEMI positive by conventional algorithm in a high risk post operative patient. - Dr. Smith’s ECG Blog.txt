Case Summary

A man in his late 60s was hospitalized following bilateral lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. His medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid use, both risk factors for coronary artery disease.

On postoperative day 2, an ECG was obtained.

Initial ECG (ECG 1)

The automated GE algorithm interpretation was “ACUTE MI / STEMI.”

ECG findings:

Sinus tachycardia

Concave ST elevation in multiple leads

Markedly asymmetric T waves (gentle upslope, sharper downslope)

ST segments that are very flat initially, then turn sharply upward into a narrow-based T wave

Additional observations:

ST elevation in I and aVL

No reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads

Presence of ST elevation in lead II

These findings were considered atypical for LAD occlusion.

Clinical Context

The patient denied chest pain

Bedside echocardiogram showed normal wall motion

Physical examination revealed a prominent pericardial friction rub

When analyzed by the Queen of Hearts AI model:

Result: No OMI, but low confidence

AI score was near the positivity threshold (approximately 0.53 on a 0–1 scale)

Given the clinical context + ECG morphology, immediate cath lab activation was deferred.

Follow-Up and Additional Data
Repeat ECG (ECG 2, next day)

Persistent but improving ST segment abnormalities

Overall trend toward normalization

Biomarkers

Initial high-sensitivity troponin I: 2676 ng/L

Repeat value: 2080 ng/L (downtrending)

Final Interpretation

The overall picture was most consistent with post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS) following surgery involving pericardiotomy as part of lung transplantation.

This represents an immunologically mediated pericarditis / myopericarditis, rather than acute coronary occlusion.

Supporting Features for PCIS / Pericarditis

Recent cardiac-adjacent surgery

Absence of chest pain

Normal wall motion on echocardiography

Audible pericardial friction rub

Concave ST elevation

High ST/T wave ratio in lateral leads (e.g., V6)

PR segment elevation and ST depression in aVR and V1

Improving ECG and troponin trend

Key Learning Points

Automated STEMI algorithms have high false-positive rates, especially in postoperative and inflammatory states

Concave ST elevation with narrow-based T waves can mimic OMI

Clinical context is essential: ECG interpretation must not occur in isolation

Pericarditis and PCIS can present with significant ST elevation

AI tools are valuable, particularly for reducing false-positive cath lab activations, but must be interpreted in context

Bottom Line

Despite being STEMI-positive by conventional ECG algorithms, this high-risk postoperative patient did not have acute coronary occlusion. The ECG findings, troponin trend, physical exam, and imaging were most consistent with post-cardiac injury syndrome, and immediate invasive intervention was appropriately avoided.
