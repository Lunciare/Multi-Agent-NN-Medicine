The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

Two clinical scenarios are considered:

Scenario 1: Presentation with 24 hours of substernal chest pain.
Scenario 2: Presentation with 6 days of increasing dyspnea.

The second scenario was the actual presentation.

Initial ECG Interpretation

The ECG shows sinus rhythm at approximately 94 beats per minute.
QRS complexes are narrow.
The frontal plane QRS axis is close to vertical at approximately 90 degrees.

There is ST segment elevation in both the precordial and inferior limb leads.

Precordial Lead Findings

Leads V2 and V3 show minimal R waves followed by deep S waves and ST elevation.
Lead V4 shows a QS complex followed by ST elevation.
Leads V3 and V4 each demonstrate approximately 6 mm of ST elevation.
There is some R wave present in the lateral precordial leads.

Although QS waves raise consideration of left ventricular aneurysm, the ST-to-QRS ratio and T-wave-to-QRS ratio are far too large and not compatible with left ventricular aneurysm.

There is substantial area under the ST segment and T waves, consistent with significant ECG “acuity” and potentially salvageable myocardium.

Hyperacute T waves are present, which are a sign of acute infarction even in the presence of Q waves.

The presence of Q waves does not rule out acute occlusion myocardial infarction and may represent acute infarction superimposed on an old infarct.

Inferior Lead Findings

Inferior lead ST elevation does not have a typical ischemic appearance.
The ST segments are upwardly concave with distinct J waves in leads II and aVF.
There is slight PR segment depression.

These findings are more consistent with pericarditis.

Post-infarction regional pericarditis is typically localized to the infarct territory rather than diffuse.

Diagnostic Considerations

The ECG findings may represent:

Acute anterior wall myocardial infarction with early Q-wave development, or

Subacute transmural myocardial infarction complicated by post-infarction regional pericarditis.

Clinical correlation is essential for appropriate management.

Clinical History and Final Interpretation

Due to severe dementia, the patient was unable to provide a reliable history.
His wife reported a brief episode of chest discomfort six days prior, followed by progressive dyspnea.
He was evaluated four days earlier and treated empirically for pneumonia without improvement.

The ECG and clinical history are consistent with a subacute transmural infarction in the left anterior descending artery territory, complicated by post-infarction regional pericarditis.

Persistently large upright anterior T waves and inferior ST elevation are consistent with subacute infarction and pericardial inflammation.

Patients should not be denied revascularization solely based on symptom duration, as myocardial viability may persist due to transient reperfusion or collateral circulation.

ECG, clinical history, and echocardiography together should guide catheterization decisions.

Post-Infarction Regional Pericarditis (PIRP)

Post-infarction regional pericarditis is a complication of transmural myocardial infarction and is more common with delayed or absent reperfusion.

ECG features suggestive of PIRP include:

Persistently upright T waves more than 48–72 hours after myocardial infarction

Premature reversal of inverted T waves to upright deflections in the presence of well-formed Q waves

Upright T waves beyond 72 hours after acute myocardial infarction should prompt consideration of PIRP.

Pseudonormalization of T waves may be due to:

Re-occlusion of the infarct-related artery

Post-infarction regional pericarditis

Echocardiographic Findings and Mechanical Complications

Bedside echocardiography demonstrated regional wall motion abnormality involving the distal septum and apical left ventricle.

The myocardium appeared thickened due to edema, consistent with pseudohypertrophy.

High-velocity turbulent flow through the distal interventricular septum was identified, consistent with ventricular septal rupture.

A new harsh holosystolic murmur was present.

Ventricular septal rupture results in left-to-right shunting, reduced cardiac output, pulmonary edema, and shock.

Prognosis and Pathophysiology

Ventricular septal rupture following myocardial infarction carries an extremely poor prognosis without surgical correction.

Mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, free wall rupture, and papillary muscle rupture are more likely in elderly patients, those with delayed or absent reperfusion, and first myocardial infarction without prior ischemic preconditioning.

Ventricular septal rupture typically occurs 1–14 days after myocardial infarction, with bimodal peaks within 24 hours and again at 3–5 days.

Necrotic myocardium is fragile, with maximal tissue breakdown around day 7. Surgical timing must balance hemodynamic stabilization with tissue integrity.

Learning Points

QS waves with persistent ST elevation and/or hyperacute T waves may represent either acute myocardial infarction or subacute completed infarction with post-infarction pericarditis.

Post-infarction regional pericarditis implies complete transmural infarction and increased risk of myocardial rupture.

Mechanical complications of transmural infarction are rare but carry high morbidity and mortality.

A new harsh systolic murmur in a patient with subacute myocardial infarction suggests ventricular septal rupture or papillary muscle rupture until proven otherwise.

Clinical correlation is essential in all cases.
