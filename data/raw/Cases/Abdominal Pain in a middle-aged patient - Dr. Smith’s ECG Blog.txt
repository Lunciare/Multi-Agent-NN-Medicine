Abdominal Pain in a middle-aged patient

Dr. Kalra texted me this ECG on a Sunday morning:
Patient with abdominal pain. No chest pain. hs-Trop I is 15,000. I think it is OMI. Taking her to the cath lab.

My response: “This looks like a subacute (possibly spontaneously reperfused) first diagonal. Could be LAD. But it is definitely OMI. T-wave inverted in aVL and starting to invert in V2.”

This ECG has the “South Africa Flag Sign.”

The sign indicates STE or hyperacute T-wave in V1, I, aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in lead III. It is a sign of first diagonal occlusion, or sometimes LAD occlusion proximal to the first diagonal.

I sent the ECG to the Queen of Hearts PMCardio AI Model for diagnosis.

Today’s initial ECG is clearly diagnostic of an acute OMI that very strongly suggests a culprit in the 1st or 2nd diagonal branch of the LAD.

The South African Flag Sign is present when there is:
i) ST elevation in leads I, aVL, V2
ii) Reciprocal ST depression in lead III (and often II, aVF)
iii) No ST elevation in any chest lead except V2

PEARL #1: Acute proximal LAD OMI may initially look like diagonal branch OMI because early STE may be limited to V2 and only later spread to V1–V4.

PEARL #2: Only V2 shows ST elevation — therefore it fails STEMI criteria requiring 2 contiguous anterior leads. Recognizing the South African Flag Sign alerts the angiographer where the culprit is likely to be.

Comparison between the reference ECG and today’s ECG:
Both show the S. African Flag Sign, but today’s ECG also shows reperfusion T-waves (T-wave inversion in I, aVL, V2; peaked terminal T wave in III), indicating spontaneous reperfusion after earlier occlusion.
