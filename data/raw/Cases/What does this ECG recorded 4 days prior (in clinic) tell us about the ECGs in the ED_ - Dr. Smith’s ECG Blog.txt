Case Summary

An 84-year-old male (HTN, HLD; never smoker) awoke at 02:30 with new, severe (8/10), pressure-like chest pain radiating across the chest and toward the epigastrium, with shortness of breath. Pain was unrelenting until arrival to the ED (~05:00). Initial vitals were hypertensive (~160/80). Symptoms improved on arrival and fully resolved after nitroglycerin + aspirin 325 mg + clopidogrel 600 mg + heparin infusion.

Workup for “can’t miss” diagnoses:

CXR: no acute findings

CT PE: negative

CT abdomen/pelvis: no acute findings
Incidental findings: penetrating aortic atherosclerotic ulcer at renal level, bilateral aneurysmal common iliac arteries.

Initial hs-troponin T at 06:09: 21 ng/L (within male reference threshold used in the case).

Key Question of the Case

What does an ECG recorded 4 days earlier in cardiology clinic tell us about the ED ECGs today?
Core concept: ACS is dynamic, and symptom improvement before the first ED ECG may reflect spontaneous reperfusion, producing deceptively modest ECG findings (including pseudonormalization).

ECG 1 (ED, 05:18) — Chest Pain Improving

Main features:

High voltage with intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD)

ST-T changes:

Subtle ischemic ST depression in V3–V6, described as concordant with deep/wide S waves (especially V3; also V4–V6)

ST depression in I and aVL looked non-ischemic, consistent with LVH/IVCD repolarization abnormalities

Not classic for acute OMI; more consistent with subendocardial ischemia (SEI) in this snapshot

AI:

Queen of Hearts: negative for OMI

Smith notes a newer internal model output consistent with SEI and highlights pseudonormalization of T waves in III and aVF compared with the clinic ECG.

Clinical pearl:

Even if not diagnostic for occlusion on this frame, sleep-awakening chest pain carries very high pretest probability, and a single ECG can look “too normal” depending on timing.

ECG 2 (Clinic, 4 days prior) — “Baseline” but Highly Informative

Although recorded when the patient was reportedly without symptoms, the fact that it was obtained and a nuclear stress test was ordered suggests possible antecedent concern.

Interpretive significance in the context of today’s presentation:

Described as extremely suspicious (bordering on diagnostic) for reperfused inferoposterior occlusion MI

Key pattern described:

Terminal T-wave inversion in lead III

Reciprocal “down-up” T waves in I and aVL

Overly upright T waves in V1–V2 consistent with posterior reperfusion (reciprocal changes)

Concept:

Likely unstable lesion with recurrent occlusion and spontaneous reperfusion (“stuttering” course).

ECG 3 (ED, 05:53) — After NTG + DAPT + Heparin

This ECG showed dynamic reperfusion changes, and is treated as the “diagnostic moment” in the narrative:

Inferior biphasic reperfusion T-wave changes

Overly upright T waves in V2–V3, interpreted as reciprocal posterior reperfusion T waves

Queen of Hearts identified a reperfusion pattern

Interpretation:

Inferoposterior pattern, suggestive of RCA culprit, now reperfusing.

Troponin Trend (hsTnT)

Demonstrated evolving infarction despite initial “normal” value:

09:36: 77 ng/L

14:45: 309 ng/L

17:53: 532 ng/L

Next day 01:11: 647 ng/L

Key lesson: initial troponin can be normal early in ACS, especially if the patient is in a transient reperfusion phase at first sampling.

Angiography / Outcome

Coronary angiography showed a critical RCA lesion with TIMI 3 flow (consistent with reperfusion rather than fully persistent occlusion at that moment).

Patient underwent successful PCI to RCA.

TTE showed inferior wall motion abnormality with EF ~35–40%.

Discharged on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, DAPT, and rosuvastatin, with close outpatient follow-up.

ECG 4 (Post-PCI)

Showed more reperfusion evolution: inferior biphasic T waves progressed to deep T-wave inversion, consistent with reperfusion progression.

Learning Points (Condensed)

Pretest probability can outweigh a “negative” ECG, especially with classic high-risk chest pain history.

OMI can present with unimpressive or even near-normal ECGs, depending on timing (pseudonormalization window).

Always obtain serial ECGs (ideally within 15–20 minutes when concern is high) plus serial troponins.

Recognize reperfusion evolution:

biphasic T waves → progressively deeper inversion

overly upright anterior T waves (V2–V3) can be reciprocal posterior reperfusion T waves (“posterior Wellens-type” concept).
