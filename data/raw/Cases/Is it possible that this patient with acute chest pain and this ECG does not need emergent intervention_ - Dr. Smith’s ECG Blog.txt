84-year-old male with significant cardiac history (CABG + multiple stents) awoke at 05:00 with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. He arrived to a rural ED ~06:30. Because he was recovering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and screened positive at triage, his symptoms were initially attributed to viral illness, but an ECG was obtained at 06:49.

Initial ECG (06:49) — Why This Does Need Emergent Intervention

Despite baseline artifact, findings were consistent with infero-posterior OMI:

Sinus bradycardia

Convex ST elevation in lead III

Reciprocal ST depression in aVL

Possible anterior ST depression (V2–V3) → posterior involvement

Interpretation: Inferior + posterior occlusive event → inferoposterior OMI until proven otherwise.

Key concept: STEMI criteria are insensitive for OMI; failure to meet STEMI thresholds does not mean “no cath”.

Early Management Pitfalls
Troponin error

Initial hs-cTn negative (11 ng/L). This falsely reassured the team.

Troponin can be normal in early OMI (especially <2 hours from onset).

In the presence of a diagnostic ECG, an initial normal troponin is not actionable for ruling out occlusion.

Nitroglycerin

Two sprays of SL nitro did not improve pain but caused transient hypotension (SBP <90).

Hypotension after nitro in suspected inferior MI raises concern for preload dependence (possible RV involvement).

Right-sided leads may be considered clinically, but this does not change the need for cath when OMI is present.

Objective Deterioration (Several Hours Later)

Repeat troponin returned >600 ng/L.

At this point, even without ECG interpretation skills:

Persistent chest pain + elevated troponin = high-risk ACS needing urgent invasive strategy.

Repeat ECG (11:19) — Reperfusion Pattern But Ongoing Danger

Repeat ECG showed evidence of reperfusion:

Less ST elevation inferiorly

More T-wave inversion in inferior leads

Loss of T-wave bulk in V4–V6

But: patient still had pain → reperfusion ECG does not equal “safe” if symptoms persist.

Posterior Leads (15-lead ECG at 12:10) — Not Required and Can Mislead

A 15-lead ECG was obtained because posterior MI was suspected.

Core message from the case:

Posterior leads are not necessary to diagnose posterior OMI.

Any ST depression in V1–V3 in chest pain is posterior OMI until proven otherwise.

Posterior leads can be falsely negative due to reduced amplitudes through back musculature.

In this case, V9 was misplaced, further reducing reliability.

Best posterior OMI clue: Maximal ST depression in V2–V3 (very high specificity), plus mirror-test morphology.

Treatment and Outcome

Treated under “NSTEMI protocol” (ASA, enoxaparin, ticagrelor)

Transferred to cardiac center

Still had persistent 4/10 chest pressure, but appeared comfortable

Underwent PCI: 100% RCA occlusion stented

LCx open but small, supplied little posterior wall

Receiving cardiologist described case as “challenging”

Key ECG Pattern (Posterior OMI)

This case demonstrates classic pattern:

Inferior STE with reciprocal STD in aVL (may be subtle, not meeting STEMI criteria)

ST depression maximal in V2–V3 → posterior OMI (high specificity)

Increasing anterior R-wave progression can support posterior infarction

Inferior T-wave inversion can indicate reperfusion or ongoing ischemia depending on symptoms

System-Level Learning Points

High pretest probability matters
Elderly + known CAD + ischemic symptoms waking from sleep → assume acute coronary pathology.

Do not anchor on ILI
Viral illness does not exclude MI and can precipitate plaque rupture.

Do not wait for troponin when ECG is diagnostic
Early troponin can be negative even in true occlusion.

Posterior leads can be falsely negative and can be placed wrong
Posterior OMI is best diagnosed using V1–V3 mirror findings.

“NSTEMI” label can delay life-saving cath
Many NSTEMI patients have an occluded artery; delays lead to preventable myocardial loss.

Bottom Line (One Sentence)

In a high-risk chest pain patient, convex STE in III with reciprocal STD in aVL plus maximal STD in V2–V3 is infero-posterior OMI until proven otherwise — and requires emergent cath regardless of initial troponin or symptom attribution to ILI.
