A sick elderly patient with nonspecific symptoms

An elderly woman summoned EMS for generalized weakness and multiple vague complaints. She was confused and ill-appearing.

Her EMS ECG:

Without other ECGs, the rhythm differential could include junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, or ventricular paced rhythm with small or filtered-out pacing spikes.

Most importantly, the QRS duration is **greater than 200 msec** (computer QRSd = 218 msec).

When QRS > 200 msec, even during ventricular pacing, the differential is very small:

1. Preexisting severe cardiomyopathy with baseline QRSd > 200
2. Acute hyperkalemia and/or acute sodium channel blockade

No common BBB pattern or paced rhythm should cause a QRS duration > 200 msec. Hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockade should be assumed until proven otherwise. The T waves have a peaked hyperkalemic morphology in many leads.

Her ED ECG:

Now pacer spikes are visible, with the same QRS morphology as the first ECG, meaning the initial ECG was also paced.

A prior ECG from one month ago:

This showed ventricular pacing with QRS duration 186 msec—on the wider end for baseline paced rhythms. Today, something (likely hyperkalemia) has caused further QRS widening.

Potassium returned at **7.4 mEq/L**.

QRS duration improved after hyperkalemia treatment (follow-up ECG unavailable). She was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Final outcome unavailable.

Key Point:
When QRS duration exceeds **200 msec** and is not known to be baseline, assume **severe hyperkalemia and/or sodium channel blockade toxicity** until proven otherwise.

Other cardiology-related hyperkalemia cases:

* Cardiac arrest with ROSC and RBBB
* Elderly patient with syncope, dyspnea, weakness, mild hyperK
* “Simple paced rhythm?” — actually a paced sine wave with K = 6.8
* RBBB with K = 7.9 and QRS 194 ms
* Dialysis patient with vomiting and LBBB (QRS 220 ms)
* Weakness and dyspnea with sine-wave pattern (not hyperK)
