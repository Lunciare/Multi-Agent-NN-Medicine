A man in his 40s called emergency medical services for acute symptoms including chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.

An EMS ECG was obtained.

Initial ECG Interpretation

Critical hyperkalemia with a sine wave appearance.

The ECG machine produced a false positive “STEMI” alert.

The Queen of Hearts model did not identify this ECG as STEMI.

Prehospital Management and Repeat ECG

Paramedics administered 2 grams of calcium gluconate and continuous albuterol nebulization.

A repeat ECG showed improvement in QRS width and morphology, though additional improvement was anticipated with further calcium administration.

Emergency Department Findings

On arrival to the emergency department, a bedside venous blood gas revealed a potassium level of 9.1 mEq/L.

An older ECG from weeks prior was available for comparison.

The patient had missed dialysis due to a dysfunctional arteriovenous graft.

Additional calcium was administered, along with insulin and glucose.

A subsequent ECG showed further improvement.

Definitive Management and Outcome

An emergent dialysis access catheter was placed.

Dialysis was performed successfully.

The patient survived.

ECG Interpretation and Teaching Points

If a patient presents with stable vital signs and an ECG that appears excessively wide or unreal in morphology, the most likely explanations are artifact or hyperkalemia.

In this case, hyperkalemia was the cause of marked QRS widening with absence of atrial activity.

There is no need to verify serum potassium levels before administering empiric intravenous calcium when the ECG is diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia.

ECG findings of severe hyperkalemia include:

Marked QRS widening

Absent P waves

Tall, peaked, symmetric T waves with narrow bases

Occasionally inverted peaked T waves

Brugada phenocopy patterns

Selected patients may remain alert and hemodynamically stable despite critically elevated serum potassium levels.

Comparison with a baseline ECG recorded during normal potassium levels highlights the dramatic ECG changes caused by hyperkalemia.
