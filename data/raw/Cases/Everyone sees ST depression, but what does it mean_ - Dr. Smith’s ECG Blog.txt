A man in his 70s with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute chest pain that awakened him from sleep around midnight. The pain was substernal, non-radiating, and rated 7/10 in intensity. An ECG was obtained at approximately 4:00 AM.

Initial ECG (ECG #1)

The initial ECG was clearly abnormal, though it did not meet classic STEMI criteria.

Key findings:

ST depression in inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V4–V6)

ST elevation and hyperacute T waves in V1, V2

ST elevation and hyperacute T wave in aVL

Reciprocal ST depression in III

Loss of normal gentle ST elevation in V3

Pattern consistent with a combination of:

Precordial swirl

South African Flag sign

This constellation of findings is diagnostic of acute LAD occlusion, involving:

Septal perforators (precordial swirl)

A major diagonal branch (South African Flag pattern)

This ECG represents acute occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) and warrants immediate cardiac catheterization, regardless of troponin level or symptom improvement.

The Queen of Hearts AI diagnosed OMI with very high confidence (0.99).

Initial Management and Misinterpretation

The ECG was interpreted clinically as showing only “mild ST depression”. The patient received:

Aspirin 325 mg

Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg

Documentation stated that the patient’s pain “resolved,” but no short-interval repeat ECG was obtained to confirm electrical resolution.

Initial troponin I was mildly elevated (0.049 ng/mL, reference <0.033).

Clinical Deterioration

At 8:10 AM, repeat troponin I was 3.788 ng/mL, indicating a substantial infarction. A repeat ECG (ECG #2) showed improvement compared to ECG #1, but remained clearly abnormal, raising concern for ongoing ischemia.

Despite this:

The ECG was again described as showing only ST depression

Pain was documented as “2/10” and later “resolved”

The distinction between partial improvement and complete resolution was not acted upon

Echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated:

Apical akinesis

LVEF approximately 45%

The pattern could superficially resemble takotsubo, but ECG and clinical context were diagnostic of LAD OMI.

Cardiac Catheterization

Cardiac catheterization was delayed approximately 8 hours after the initial diagnostic ECG.

Findings:

Severe LAD vasospasm involving septal perforators and a major diagonal branch

Very poor flow in the LAD

No acute plaque rupture

This was classified as a Type 2 MI (ischemia due to vasospasm rather than atherosclerotic plaque disruption).

Intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered around 12:30 PM, resulting in resolution of vasospasm. Troponin continued to rise, reaching 6.607 ng/mL.

Final Diagnosis

Acute LAD occlusion myocardial infarction due to coronary vasospasm

Mechanism: non-atherosclerotic (vasospastic OMI)

Resulted in a supervised, in-hospital anterior wall infarction due to delayed intervention

Key Clinical Insights

ST depression is not a diagnosis; it is a finding that must be interpreted in pattern and context

Precordial swirl and South African Flag patterns are STEMI-equivalents

Symptom improvement is not sufficient to defer cath unless:

Chest pain is completely resolved

Ischemic ECG changes are completely resolved

“Much better” or “2/10 pain” still represents refractory ischemia

The initial ECG alone is sufficient to mandate cath when clearly abnormal

Troponin values do not guide the initial decision to cath in suspected OMI

Vasospastic and microvascular causes of MI are frequently missed without angiography

Learning Points

Acute coronary occlusion can present without classic STEMI criteria

Coronary vasospasm often occurs at night or early morning

Failure to recognize OMI patterns leads to preventable myocardial injury

If a patient presents with ACS symptoms and a diagnostic ECG for OMI, they belong in the cath lab

Delay based on symptom improvement or fear of false activation can result in large, avoidable infarctions
