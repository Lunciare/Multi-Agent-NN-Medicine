Case Summary

A middle-aged man experienced sudden syncope after a brief episode of light-headedness while standing at home. He awoke on the ground, uncertain of the duration of loss of consciousness. Initial inpatient evaluation and telemetry were unremarkable, and he was discharged with a 4-week event monitor and EP follow-up.

During nearly the entire monitoring period, no significant abnormalities were recorded — except for one short rhythm strip capturing a brief pause.

Event Monitor Finding

The monitor captured:

A single episode with 3 consecutive blocked P waves

Resulting in a ventricular pause of several seconds

Onset and termination of AV block triggered by ventricular extrasystoles

No significant change in sinus rate before or during the block

Key Question

Is one short episode of AV block on a 4-week monitor enough to justify permanent pacing?

Answer

YES.

Even a single episode of cardiac syncope, if it occurs at the wrong moment (e.g., while driving), can be fatal. The goal of pacing is prevention of catastrophic recurrence, not frequency reduction.

Differential Diagnosis of AV Block with Syncope
1. Vagotonic (Vagal) AV Block

Due to transient parasympathetic surges

Typically associated with:

Progressive sinus slowing

Lengthening PR interval

Prodromal symptoms (nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness)

Often benign

Permanent pacing usually not indicated

2. Intrinsic Paroxysmal AV Block (Phase 4 Block)

This is the mechanism in this case.

Also called:

Phase 4 AV block

Pause-dependent AV block

Bradycardia-dependent block

This form is:

Due to diseased His–Purkinje system

Potentially lethal

Indication for permanent pacemaker

Mechanism: Phase 4 (Pause-Dependent) AV Block

A premature ventricular or atrial beat partially depolarizes the His-Purkinje system

This occurs at a vulnerable time during phase 4 diastolic depolarization

The His-Purkinje system becomes refractory

Subsequent sinus P waves fail to conduct

AV block persists until another extrasystole resets conduction

ECG Hallmarks

AV block initiated by an extrasystole

AV block terminated by an extrasystole

Minimal or no sinus rate slowing

Often associated with:

Wide QRS

First-degree AV block during conducted beats
(though up to one-third of patients have normal baseline ECGs)

Why This Is Not Vasovagal Syncope
Evidence Against Vagal Block

No progressive sinus slowing before block

No increasing PR interval

No prodrome

Block behavior depends on extrasystoles, not autonomic tone

Evidence from Vasovagal Pacemaker Trials
VPS (1999)

Showed dramatic reduction in syncope with pacing

Flawed due to lack of sham control

VPS II (2003)

Properly blinded, sham-controlled trial

No benefit of pacing

Demonstrated strong placebo effect

Clinical Implication

Vasovagal syncope ≠ indication for pacing

Intrinsic paroxysmal AV block = pacing indicated

Management and Outcome

Patient instructed to avoid driving and operating machinery

Diagnosis: Paroxysmal AV block due to intrinsic His-Purkinje disease

Permanent pacemaker implantation scheduled

Key Learning Points

Even a single episode of intrinsic AV block with syncope warrants pacing

Phase 4 (pause-dependent) AV block is:

Rare

Underdiagnosed

Potentially fatal

Recognize the difference between:

Vagal AV block (usually benign)

Intrinsic paroxysmal AV block (malignant)

Long-term monitoring can be lifesaving

Absence of frequent events does not imply low risk

Bottom Line

This case highlights a high-risk but easily missed cause of syncope. A single captured episode of phase 4 paroxysmal AV block is sufficient to justify permanent pacing, as failure to intervene may result in sudden and preventable death.
