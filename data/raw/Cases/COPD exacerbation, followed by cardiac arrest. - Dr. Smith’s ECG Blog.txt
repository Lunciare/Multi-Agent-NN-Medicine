An elderly woman with a history of COPD called emergency services for severe shortness of breath. On EMS arrival, she was cyanotic with increased work of breathing. During transport, she developed a bradycardic cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved.

A bedside echocardiogram showed a markedly enlarged right ventricle and a very small left ventricle. Based on the clinical presentation and echo findings, a provisional diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made.

Initial ECG Findings

The first ECG showed:

Atrial fibrillation

Right bundle branch block (RBBB)

Right axis deviation (deep S wave in lead I with R/S ratio < 1)

Findings consistent with a probable left posterior fascicular block

Very large R-wave amplitudes in the right precordial leads

These ECG findings are consistent with acute right ventricular strain.

Key Diagnostic Considerations

In a patient with sudden respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, a dilated right ventricle on echocardiography, and an ECG showing acute right heart strain (RBBB, right axis deviation, tall R waves in V1–V2), massive pulmonary embolism must be strongly considered.

However, severe COPD exacerbation with dynamic hyperinflation can also produce:

Acute RV dilation

Reduced LV preload and apparent LV “collapse”

Marked ECG changes mimicking acute pulmonary embolism

Clinical Insight

Acute cor pulmonale from severe obstructive lung disease can closely mimic massive pulmonary embolism both clinically and electrocardiographically. Differentiation requires integration of:

Clinical context

Echocardiographic findings

ECG features

Response to ventilation and oxygenation

Misattributing RV strain solely to pulmonary embolism without considering severe COPD-related pathophysiology can lead to diagnostic anchoring.

Learning Points

Severe COPD exacerbation can cause:

Acute RV pressure overload

Profound hypoxia and hypercapnia

Electrical patterns resembling massive PE

Cardiac arrest in COPD patients is often driven by hypoxia and dynamic hyperinflation rather than primary coronary occlusion.

ECG patterns of right heart strain are not specific for pulmonary embolism and must be interpreted in full clinical context.

Bedside echocardiography is critical but should not be interpreted in isolation.
