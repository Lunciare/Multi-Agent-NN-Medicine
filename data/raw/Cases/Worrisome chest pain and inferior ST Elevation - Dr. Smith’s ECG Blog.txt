Worrisome chest pain and inferior ST elevation — OMI or not?

Clinical Context

Patient:

Male, ~30s

7 days of constant left substernal chest pressure

Non-radiating, non-exertional

Possible positional component

Intermittent shortness of breath

History of asthma

Key detail: symptoms are prolonged (1 week) and ongoing, not episodic.

Initial ECG

Inferior ST elevation

Sent with the note that PMCardio Queen of Hearts = NOT OMI

Because of AI result, clinicians waited for troponin

Troponin undetectable

Given 7 days of chest pain, a negative troponin makes acute MI less likely, but does NOT make the ECG “safe.”

Core Tension in This Case

ECG looks concerning

AI says NOT OMI

Troponin negative

Symptoms atypical for classic MI

Dr. Smith’s reaction:

“It looked pretty scary and I would be on the fence.”

This is a gray-zone ECG where context matters more than any single test.

Key Teaching Points
1. Duration of Symptoms Matters

7 days of continuous pain + undetectable troponin
→ argues strongly against acute ongoing infarction

However:

Could represent subacute, healed, or non-ischemic pathology

ECG abnormalities may persist long after ischemia

2. Inferior ST Elevation ≠ STEMI by Default

Important non-OMI causes of inferior STE include:

Pericarditis

Benign early repolarization

Normal variant

Myocarditis

GI or musculoskeletal pain with incidental ECG changes

The absence of evolving biomarkers and lack of classic ischemic symptom pattern lowers MI probability.

3. AI Is an Aid, Not an Arbiter

Queen of Hearts labeled this Not OMI

But:

AI does not explain reasoning

AI is trained for acute occlusion, not every dangerous ECG

Clinician discomfort is still valid

A negative AI result should reduce confidence, not replace judgment.

4. Troponin Is a Time-Sensitive Test

With 7 days of symptoms, a true MI should almost always have:

Elevated or falling troponin

A completely negative troponin at this stage makes:

Acute MI very unlikely

Practical Clinical Framing

This ECG falls into the category of:

“Concerning ECG + low probability acute MI”

Which means:

Do not reflexively activate cath lab

Do not ignore the ECG either

Appropriate actions:

Serial ECGs

Careful history for pericarditis/myocarditis clues

Echocardiography

Consider inflammatory markers

Cardiology input if uncertainty persists

Bottom Line

Inferior ST elevation can be scary without being OMI

7 days of constant pain + undetectable troponin ≠ acute MI

AI saying “Not OMI” is supportive, not definitive

This is a case where clinical reasoning overrides pattern recognition

Key Takeaway

Not every scary ECG is an occlusion.
Not every negative AI is reassurance.
Time course + biomarkers + symptoms decide the truth.
