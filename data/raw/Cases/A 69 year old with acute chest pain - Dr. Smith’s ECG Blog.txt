A 69 year old with acute chest pain

This ECG was emailed to me by Sam Ghali.
“69 year old woman with chest pain.”

I responded: “Suggestion of inferior OMI, but not quite diagnostic.”

There is an incomplete RBBB. There is minimal ST elevation in lead III with an inverted T-wave, suggesting acute MI with some degree of reperfusion. Same in aVF. There is minimal reciprocal ST depression in aVL. There is a normal amount of discordant ST depression in V2.

Queen of Hearts interpretation:
OMI with low confidence.

The patient’s pain was getting much better. Echo views were difficult. Prior ECGs looked very similar but previously appeared to reflect an SGA-RCA issue. The patient was instructed to report immediately if pain returned.

Pain did return and a repeat ECG was recorded. This ECG was diagnostic of inferior OMI.
The patient went for immediate angiogram.

Angiography showed RCA occlusion (SVG graft to RCA in a patient with previous CABG). The artery appeared completely occluded and then reopened, described as TIMI-1 flow.

Learning Points:

1. Use serial ECGs
2. Consider OMI even with subtle initial findings

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/20/2024)

Interpretation of ECGs in patients with known coronary disease and conduction abnormalities is challenging, especially without prior tracings for comparison. In this case, despite lack of prior ECGs, the initial tracing should be considered highly suspicious for acute OMI given new chest pain.

ECG #1 showed sinus rhythm at 60–65 bpm, a wide QRS (~0.12 s), and an atypical RBBB pattern. There was no chamber enlargement. Small narrow Q waves in leads I and aVL were likely normal septal Q waves. No true Q waves were present in leads III or aVF.

ST-T wave abnormalities were most notable in the inferior leads. Lead aVF showed straightened ST takeoff with slight but real ST elevation and terminal T-wave inversion. Lead III showed subtle ST elevation with definite terminal T-wave inversion. Lead II demonstrated abnormal J-point elevation supportive of inferior OMI.

Lead aVL showed equivocal but potentially reciprocal ST depression. Chest lead assessment was difficult without prior ECGs, though lead V1 showed higher-than-expected ST elevation for RBBB, raising suspicion for associated pathology.

Overall, ECG #1 was interpreted as suspicious for acute inferior OMI until proven otherwise, with T-wave inversions possibly reflecting spontaneous reperfusion as chest pain was decreasing.

When chest pain returned, ECG #2 showed clear progression with increased ST elevation and hyperacute ST-T wave changes in leads III and aVF, persistent abnormal ST elevation in lead II, and definitive reciprocal ST depression in aVL. These findings confirmed acute inferior OMI.

Subsequent angiography confirmed the culprit lesion. The case highlights the importance of serial ECGs, careful inferior lead assessment, and maintaining a high index of suspicion for OMI in patients with chest pain and known coronary disease.
