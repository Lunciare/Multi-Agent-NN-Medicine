A woman in her 70s was hospitalized with undifferentiated shock after being found down. Several days into hospitalization, she had intermittent sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia, with periods of Mobitz I AV block and 2:1 AV block. Her care team initiated transcutaneous pacing (TCP).

Telemetry Findings

Telemetry strips (lead V1) showed:

Regular pacing spikes at ~70/min

Sharp electrical artifacts following each pacing spike

Native P waves and native QRS complexes continuing independently of pacing

When the arterial pressure waveform was displayed alongside the ECG, it became clear that:

The arterial waveform correlated only with the patient’s native QRS complexes

There was no hemodynamic response to pacing spikes

This indicates complete failure of capture.

Key Error Identified

The pacing spikes produced electrical artifact that was mistakenly interpreted as QRS complexes. In reality:

The pacing output was below capture threshold

The myocardium was not depolarized

The patient received painful electrical shocks with no benefit

Meanwhile, the patient’s native sinus bradycardia was providing adequate perfusion.

When pacing was turned on:

The native rhythm continued unaffected

Later, the native rate exceeded the pacing rate

Cardiology discontinued TCP and recommended observation only.

Clinical Implication

This patient did not require pacing. However:

If she had required pacing, failure to recognize non-capture could have been fatal

How to Confirm True Capture During Transcutaneous Pacing

Electrical capture alone is insufficient. Mechanical capture must be confirmed.

Reliable methods:

Arterial line: Each pacing spike should produce a corresponding arterial pulse

Bedside ultrasound: Visualize myocardial contraction synchronized with pacing

Palpation of a pulse:

Prefer femoral artery

Skeletal muscle twitching can mimic pulses

It is safe to touch a patient during TCP

Important note:

TCP can be painful even without capture

Practical Troubleshooting Guidance

Do not confuse pacing artifact with myocardial capture

If capture is uncertain:

Increase output (mA) aggressively

Outputs up to 200 mA may be required

Always confirm perfusion:

Blood pressure

Pulse oximetry waveform

End-tidal CO₂ (should rise with effective pacing)

ECG-Based Clues to True vs False Capture

True capture:

Wide QRS complex following pacing spike

Broad, discordant T wave

Hemodynamic response present

False capture (artifact):

Narrow deflection after spike

No T wave

No pulse or BP change

Electrical artifact may persist beyond pacer “blanking” periods and masquerade as capture.

Learning Points

Pacing artifact ≠ myocardial capture

Always confirm mechanical capture

Pain does not indicate effectiveness

When in doubt, increase output

Failure to recognize non-capture during TCP can be lethal
