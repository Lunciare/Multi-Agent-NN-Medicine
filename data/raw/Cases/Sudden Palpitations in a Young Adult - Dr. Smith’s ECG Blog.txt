Case Summary

A young adult male presented with sudden-onset palpitations lasting approximately 3 hours. He was hemodynamically stable when the initial ECG was recorded by EMS and transmitted for expert interpretation. Vital signs were otherwise normal.

Initial ECG (ECG #1)

The ECG showed:

Very rapid tachycardia (~200–204 bpm)

Wide complex tachycardia (WCT)

No clearly visible P waves

Marked QRS polymorphism

Subtle but real irregularity of R–R intervals

In the ED, this rhythm was initially interpreted as ventricular tachycardia (VT), and theСM decision was made to treat with IV amiodarone, given the patient’s stability.

Critical Re-Interpretation

Closer analysis revealed key diagnostic features:

The rhythm is irregularly irregular

R–R intervals vary significantly, including very short intervals (~160–170 ms)

QRS complexes are polymorphic, but frontal plane axis does not change

Ventricular rates at times exceed 300–350 bpm

These findings are pathognomonic for atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation (AF with WPW).

Key Diagnostic Insight

Nothing other than AF with WPW produces such short R–R intervals and extreme ventricular rates.
This immediately rules out VT and polymorphic VT.

Repeat ECG During Amiodarone Infusion (ECG #2)

The second ECG further confirmed the diagnosis:

Irregularly irregular wide complex tachycardia

Extremely wide QRS complexes (>160 ms)

Persistent QRS polymorphism

Shortest R–R interval ~170 ms (≈350 bpm)

This ECG was considered diagnostic of AF with WPW.

Pathophysiology Review

In normal AF, the AV node limits ventricular rate due to decremental conduction

In WPW, an accessory pathway (AP) bypasses the AV node

AF impulses conduct rapidly over the AP, producing:

Extremely short R–R intervals

Very high ventricular rates

Risk of R-on-T phenomenon and ventricular fibrillation

Clinical Danger

The shorter the R–R interval, the higher the risk of degeneration into VF.

Management Considerations
AV Nodal Blockers

AV nodal blockers (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, adenosine, amiodarone):

Reduce conduction through the AV node

Force more impulses down the accessory pathway

Increase VF risk

Although limited data suggest IV amiodarone may be tolerated in select stable patients, it is not preferred.

Preferred Acute Management

Immediate sedation and synchronized cardioversion

Safe

Rapid

Definitive

Outcome

The patient ultimately underwent synchronized DC cardioversion

Post-cardioversion ECG showed:

Sinus rhythm

Short PR interval

Delta waves consistent with WPW

Definitive Treatment

Electrophysiology study induced pre-excited AF

Anterolateral left ventricular free-wall accessory pathway identified

Successful catheter ablation performed

Follow-Up ECG

Sinus rhythm

Narrow QRS complexes

No delta waves

Key Learning Points

Always assess regularity in wide complex tachycardia — use calipers if needed

Irregular wide complex tachycardia with very short R–R intervals = AF with WPW

Ventricular rates >220 bpm strongly suggest pre-excitation

Do NOT reflexively treat WCT as VT

Avoid AV nodal blockers in AF with WPW

Synchronized cardioversion is the safest acute treatment

Catheter ablation is definitive therapy

Bottom Line

This case illustrates how AF with WPW can masquerade as VT, even to experienced clinicians. Recognition hinges on detecting irregularity and extremely short R–R intervals. Rapid, correct diagnosis is critical, as inappropriate treatment can precipitate ventricular fibrillation, while appropriate management is highly effective and curative.
