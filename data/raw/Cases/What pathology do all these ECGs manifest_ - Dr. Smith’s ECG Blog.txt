Multiple ECGs showing the same pathology: Hyperkalemia, including a key teaching point that hyperkalemia T-waves may be small (not tall).

Core Diagnosis

All ECGs in the post manifest hyperkalemia (HyperK).

Lab potassium values referenced across examples include ~6.2–7.1 mmol/L (examples: 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1).

Signature ECG Concept (Main Learning Point)

The “peaked T-waves” of hyperkalemia are not always tall.

They may appear as very small, sharply pointed symmetric triangles (“small triangles”).

Smith: T-waves like this are essentially not seen in anything else and can be almost pathognomonic for hyperkalemia.

Grauer: If you see multiple symmetrically peaked T waves (even if small) → strongly consider hyperkalemia, especially if clinically plausible.

Why HyperK Recognition Is Often Missed

Classic teaching suggests a predictable progression (“sequence”) of ECG changes as K rises, but real patients vary; any combination may occur at many K levels.

Severe hyperkalemia can present without obvious textbook findings, and may even present as cardiac arrest without classic warning patterns.

HyperK can mask ischemia/infarction patterns because the ECG reflects the net effect of hyperK plus other active pathology.

Subtle / Variable “ECG Identities” of Hyperkalemia (Grauer summary)

QRS widening can occur, often with unusual morphology that may mimic ventricular rhythms.

P waves may shrink or disappear → possible sinoventricular rhythm.

Bradyarrhythmias and AV block are common and may behave atypically.

Brugada phenocopy: hyperkalemia is described as a common cause of a Brugada-1–like pattern; it usually resolves after K correction.

A regular wide rhythm without visible P waves may be VT, or may be sinus/junctional rhythm with P-wave loss from hyperkalemia.

Selected ECG-specific Notes Mentioned

ECG 1: HyperK recognized immediately. Example labs: K 6.3, ionized Ca 4.0 (slightly low); low Ca helps explain a long ST segment (noted as typical in dialysis context). Extra: right axis deviation + R/S > 1 in V1 → suggests RVH in addition to HyperK.

ECG 3: HyperK 7.1; can mimic OMI (“pseudo-OMI”), leading to false cath activation.

ECG 4: HyperK 6.3; interpreted as “normal”; patient arrested.

ECG 5: HyperK 7.1; easier due to bradycardia; illustrates that even then, T waves may still not look “tall” in the usual way.

Practical Recognition Clues (from the post)

Look for diffuse T-wave peaking across many leads (often not limited to one territory).

HyperK T waves tend to be symmetric, pointed, with a narrow base (“Eiffel Tower” appearance).

T-wave peaking can be negative in some leads (not always upright).

Consider proportionality: even if the T waves are not tall in absolute size, they may be large relative to a tiny QRS, and still form symmetric triangles.

Safety Message

Failure to identify and treat significant hyperkalemia is potentially lethal.

Hyperkalemia may be misread as normal or as ischemia/OMI, so diffuse symmetric triangular T waves (even small) should trigger urgent consideration of HyperK.
