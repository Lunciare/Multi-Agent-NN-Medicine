Case Summary

A young man presented with altered mental status (AMS) and seizure-like activity. EMS was called by police after the patient was observed ingesting powder and pills, followed by erratic behavior. He was actively seizing on ED arrival; seizures resolved after 5 mg midazolam (Versed) administered prehospital.

During secondary survey, a large amount of white powder was noted both in a bag and free-form around the genital area, raising concern for acute drug toxicity.

Initial ECG Findings (ECG #1)

Sinus rhythm, borderline tachycardia

Markedly wide QRS: ~178 ms

Large R wave in aVR

Terminal right axis deviation

Brugada-type morphology in V1–V2

This ECG pattern is pathognomonic for sodium channel blockade.

Although hyperkalemia can cause wide, bizarre QRS complexes, the combination of findings (large R in aVR + Brugada phenocopy + extreme QRS widening) strongly favors toxic sodium channel blockade, requiring immediate antidotal therapy.

Etiology: Drugs Causing Sodium Channel Blockade

Common causes include:

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Class I antiarrhythmics (especially flecainide, procainamide)

Cocaine

Given the history of white powder ingestion and seizure, cocaine toxicity was the leading diagnosis in this case (though TCA overdose must always be considered in similar presentations).

Management and ECG Response
Immediate Treatment

IV sodium bicarbonate administered immediately

Each “amp”: 100 mL of 8.4% NaHCO₃ = 100 mEq sodium + 100 mEq bicarbonate

Serial ECG Changes with Treatment

QRS narrowed from 178 ms → 160 ms

After additional bicarbonate doses:

QRS → 130 ms

Eventually normalized to ~110 ms (upper limit of normal)

Brugada morphology gradually resolved

Acid–Base Status

Initial venous blood gas:

pH 6.96

pCO₂ 64

HCO₃⁻ 14

Repeat after treatment:

pH 7.21

pCO₂ 47

HCO₃⁻ 18

Severe combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis likely contributed to sodium channel toxicity and arrhythmogenic risk.

Clinical Course

Required intubation for airway protection and persistent stupor

Bicarbonate infusion planned but ultimately not required as QRS remained normalized

Urine drug screen positive for cocaine and fentanyl

Discharged from ICU three days later with good outcome

Key ECG Features of Sodium Channel Blockade

QRS ≥ 100 ms

In TCA toxicity, QRS > 100 ms is 100% sensitive for seizure risk

Large R wave in aVR

R ≥ 3 mm or R/S ratio > 0.7

Terminal right axis deviation

Brugada phenocopy (V1–V2)

QT prolongation

Bizarre QRS morphology

Important Differential Consideration

Hyperkalemia can mimic sodium channel blockade

When uncertain, it is reasonable to give both IV calcium and IV sodium bicarbonate until diagnosis is clarified

Key Learning Points

Wide QRS + large R in aVR = sodium channel blockade until proven otherwise

Treat immediately with sodium bicarbonate — do not wait for labs

Serial ECGs are essential to guide therapy

Drug-induced Brugada phenocopy is a known manifestation of sodium channel blockade

Severe acidosis worsens sodium channel toxicity and must be corrected

Bottom Line

This case demonstrates classic sodium channel blockade toxicity, most consistent with cocaine ingestion, diagnosed by pathognomonic ECG findings and successfully treated with aggressive sodium bicarbonate therapy.
