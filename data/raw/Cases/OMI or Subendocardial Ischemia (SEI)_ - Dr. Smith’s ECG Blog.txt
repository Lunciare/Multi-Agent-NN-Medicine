Case Summary

A 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a benign brain tumor was awakened from sleep by chest pain and dyspnea. She reported similar but transient episodes over several months, but this time the symptoms persisted. Her primary care physician noted ST-segment depression (initial ECG not available) and referred her to the emergency department.

Vital signs on arrival:

BP: 159/87 mmHg

SpO₂: 99%

RR: 19/min

Afebrile

An ECG was recorded in the ED.

ECG Interpretation (ECG #1)

The ECG showed sinus rhythm.

Key ischemic features:

ST-segment depression maximal in V3–V4

Inferior ST depression

Reciprocal pattern suggesting subtle ST elevation in aVL

Distribution consistent with posterior and high lateral ischemia

This pattern is not diffuse, but regional and anatomically coherent.

Diagnostic Reasoning

This ECG pattern is strongly suggestive of Occlusion MI (OMI) rather than subendocardial ischemia (SEI):

Maximal ST depression in V3–V4 is highly suspicious for posterior OMI

Inferior ST depression appears reciprocal, not global

Subtle high-lateral involvement (aVL) supports a circumflex (LCx) culprit

Clinical presentation (persistent chest pain awakening the patient from sleep) has high pretest probability for acute coronary occlusion

Smith’s interpretation:
This represents a posterior and high lateral OMI, most consistent with acute circumflex artery occlusion, and should prompt emergent cath lab activation.

OMI vs Subendocardial Ischemia (SEI)

Key distinctions in this case:

Findings supporting OMI:

Regional ST depression with a clear anatomic pattern

Maximal STD in V3–V4 (posterior wall)

Reciprocal changes (inferior ↔ high lateral)

Persistent ischemic symptoms

Findings arguing against SEI:

No diffuse, global ST depression

No clear ST elevation in aVR dominating the pattern

Symptoms are not transient or supply–demand related

No obvious non-coronary trigger (e.g., sepsis, anemia, tachyarrhythmia)

Key Learning Points

Posterior OMI often presents as ST depression in V1–V4, not ST elevation

Maximal STD in V3–V4 is posterior OMI until proven otherwise

SEI typically produces diffuse ST depression, often with ST elevation in aVR

Persistent chest pain + regional ischemic ECG changes = treat as OMI

Do not wait for troponin when the ECG and symptoms are diagnostic

Circumflex occlusions are frequently missed because they often do not meet STEMI criteria

Bottom Line

This ECG pattern represents posterior and high lateral Occlusion MI, most likely due to acute circumflex artery occlusion, and warrants immediate invasive management, not conservative NSTEMI-style treatment.
