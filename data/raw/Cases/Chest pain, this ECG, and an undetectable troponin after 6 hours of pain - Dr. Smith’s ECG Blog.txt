A middle-aged male presented with acute chest pain.

An initial ECG was recorded.

There are definite hyperacute T-waves in leads V4 and V5. This ECG is diagnostic of LAD occlusion.

A prior ECG from 9 months earlier was available for comparison. The T-waves on the current ECG are hyperacute compared to the prior tracing.

A repeat ECG was recorded. The T-waves appeared bulkier and fatter. This was unequivocally diagnostic of LAD occlusion (OMI).

The physician activated the cath lab, which required transfer to another hospital.

Shortly thereafter, the initial troponin returned undetectable. The physician became concerned that this was a false activation. Angiography did not show an unequivocal occlusion but revealed an 80% LAD stenosis with an unstable-appearing plaque. The undetectable troponin increased skepticism that this was OMI, despite the ECG findings.

It was emphasized that an initial undetectable troponin is not unusual in acute OMI, even after several hours of chest pain.

A second troponin I later returned at 4461 ng/L. No further troponins were measured at that time.

A post-PCI ECG was recorded and showed residual hyperacute T-waves.

Several hours later, another ECG suggested possible re-occlusion, with recurrent hyperacute T-waves and new ST elevation in leads V4–V6 meeting criteria for occlusion.

Ultimately, the LAD reperfused, with subsequent ECGs showing T-wave inversion in the affected leads consistent with reperfusion.

Peak troponin I reached 10,220 ng/L.

Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60–65% with mild septal wall hypokinesis.

Learning Points

When an ECG is diagnostic of OMI, do not wait for troponin results:

Myocardial tissue is lost while waiting.

An initially negative troponin may delay definitive care.

Six hours of chest pain does not necessarily mean six hours of infarction. Ischemia may be intermittent, and sustained infarction may begin later.

An undetectable initial troponin has high negative predictive value only in the setting of a normal or non-diagnostic ECG. In the presence of a diagnostic ECG, an undetectable troponin is unreliable.

ECG Interpretation Insights

Hyperacute T-waves are characterized by disproportionately tall, bulky, and wide-based T-waves that may appear large enough to obscure the R wave.

Hyperacute T-waves in contiguous anterior leads strongly indicate acute LAD occlusion, even when other leads are non-diagnostic.

Misplacement of precordial leads can obscure or confuse interpretation, but does not negate diagnostic findings in correctly placed leads.

In the setting of new chest pain and diagnostic ECG changes, immediate activation of the cath lab is warranted regardless of initial troponin results.
