Case Summary

A man in his 50s presented with palpitations, fever, and hypotension (BP ~80/40). Ultrasound showed low intravascular volume (flat IVC), good LV function, and no pulmonary edema. He had a history of atrial fibrillation with prior ablation, and had recently been in sinus rhythm. IV fluids were given.

Because of a very rapid heart rate (~190 bpm), an ECG was obtained.

Initial ECG Interpretation

The ECG showed a narrow complex tachycardia at ~156 bpm with no clearly visible P waves.

Key features:

Narrow QRS → supraventricular origin

Not irregularly irregular → not atrial fibrillation

Regularly irregular rhythm with two alternating RR intervals (approximately 360 ms and 400 ms)

Each RR interval had a slightly different QRS amplitude

Differential diagnosis included:

Atrial flutter

AVNRT

AVRT

Atrial tachycardia

No flutter waves were identified. Sinus tachycardia at this rate would be very unusual for a patient of this age.

The alternating RR intervals suggested reentry SVT, most consistent with AVNRT, possibly involving multiple AV nodal pathways.

Initial Management

Given the rapid rate and narrow-complex SVT, adenosine was administered.

Adenosine converted the rhythm to sinus, but the patient rapidly reverted back to SVT

Adenosine was repeated two more times, each with transient conversion followed by immediate recurrence

Electrical cardioversion was attempted twice, with the same result (brief sinus rhythm, then reversion)

Amiodarone bolus and infusion were started on cardiology recommendation, with no effect

Despite IV fluids, the patient remained hypotensive.

Reassessment and Management Strategy

Because the SVT consistently reverted after adenosine and cardioversion, further use of short-acting therapies was deemed futile.

Key principles:

Adenosine and electricity terminate reentry SVT transiently but do not prevent recurrence

Persistent SVT requires a longer-acting AV nodal blocker

Calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are effective if LV function is good

These agents can worsen hypotension, so blood pressure support may be required first

Amiodarone was discontinued.

To support blood pressure without beta-agonist stimulation, a phenylephrine infusion was started. Once BP improved to ~105/70, a diltiazem bolus was administered.

Outcome

Immediate and sustained conversion to sinus rhythm

Sinus rate ~66 bpm

A diltiazem infusion was started for maintenance

Chest X-ray showed pneumonia, explaining the fever and hypotension.

Despite hypotension, the patient did not mount an appropriate sinus tachycardic response due to AV nodal blockade from diltiazem, and therefore required continued phenylephrine support.

The patient ultimately recovered and did well.

Key Learning Points

Narrow-complex SVT with alternating RR intervals strongly suggests reentry SVT (AVNRT/AVRT)

Immediate conversion with adenosine confirms a reentry mechanism

Rapid recurrence after adenosine or cardioversion means these therapies should be stopped

Use a long-acting AV nodal blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) if LV function is preserved

Avoid calcium channel blockers in patients with poor LV function

Support blood pressure before AV nodal blockade if hypotension is present

Always record a long rhythm strip after adenosine, as conversion may be very brief and easily missed
