Case Summary

A woman in her late 70s presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. An ECG was obtained.

Initial ECG (ECG 1)

The rhythm was regular, narrow complex tachycardia and was initially interpreted as atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block. The patient received metoprolol 5 mg IV and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm.

Reconsidering the Diagnosis

Metoprolol does not cardiovert atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation; it only slows AV nodal conduction. While spontaneous conversion is possible, successful conversion after metoprolol strongly suggests the rhythm was not atrial flutter.

Alternative diagnoses for a regular narrow-complex tachycardia include:

AVNRT

AVRT

Atrial tachycardia

To differentiate SVT mechanisms, comparison of QRS morphology between sinus rhythm and tachycardia is useful to detect concealed atrial activity.

Key ECG Clue (Lead V3)

Side-by-side comparison of lead V3 showed:

Loss of the R wave during tachycardia (possibly lead position–related)

A terminally positive deflection at the end of the QRS during tachycardia

This terminal deflection cannot be explained by lead placement and is most consistent with atrial activity.

Using marching calipers showed no additional P wave halfway between beats, excluding 2:1 flutter conduction.

This terminal deflection represents a “pseudo R′”, a classic finding of typical AVNRT (often best seen in V1, but in this case visible in V3).

Mechanism of Typical AVNRT

Typical AVNRT occurs in patients with dual AV nodal pathways:

A fast pathway

A slow pathway

During sinus rhythm:

Impulses enter both pathways

The fast pathway reaches the ventricles first

Slow pathway conduction arrives when the His–Purkinje system is refractory and is electrically silent (“concealed conduction”)

Clinical Course

The patient was discharged on amiodarone and therapeutic anticoagulation.

Several days later, she re-presented with dizziness. ECG showed junctional bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s. Amiodarone was held and she was admitted.

Telemetry Findings

Telemetry heart rate trend showed an abrupt rate change, prompting rhythm review.

Rhythm Interpretation (Laddergram Explanation)

Initial beats were junctional escape beats with antegrade ventricular conduction and retrograde conduction up both AV nodal pathways, with concealed conduction via the slow pathway.

A brief burst of atrial ectopy occurred (P waves 5–9).

Early atrial impulses conducted via the fast pathway.

Subsequent impulses found the fast pathway refractory and conducted via the slow pathway, producing progressively longer PR intervals (decremental conduction).

One atrial impulse conducted extremely slowly down the slow pathway; by the time it reached the distal AV node, the fast pathway had recovered, initiating re-entry.

Because the resulting rate was <100 bpm, this was termed atrioventricular nodal reentrant arrhythmia, rather than tachycardia.

Definitive Management

The patient underwent electrophysiology study, which demonstrated easily inducible AVNRT. She underwent successful ablation.

Learning Points

Compare QRS morphology between sinus rhythm and SVT to detect concealed atrial activity, especially a pseudo R′.

Telemetry heart rate trend lines are valuable for identifying arrhythmia onset and termination.

Abrupt termination of a narrow-complex tachycardia with AV nodal blockers strongly favors a node-dependent mechanism (AVNRT or AVRT).
