An ECG was obtained from a 65-year-old man with ongoing chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and tobacco use and is otherwise healthy. There was no prior ECG for comparison.

ECG #1

The quality of the ECG is not optimal due to significant baseline wander, which makes interpretation of ischemic changes more challenging.

There is sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 bpm. The QRS is slightly wide (approximately 120 ms), consistent with a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. The PR interval is short, but there are no clear delta waves.

Despite the baseline wander, there is appreciable concordant ST-segment elevation in lead III. There is likely very slight concordant ST elevation in lead aVF. Leads I and aVL show reciprocal ST depression, with lead aVL showing concordant ST depression.

The S-wave in lead V2 measures 17 mm, and the ST segment in lead V2 is isoelectric. With a slightly prolonged QRS and a significant S-wave, discordant ST elevation would be expected in lead V2. The presence of an isoelectric ST segment in V2 is inappropriate.

Taken together, these findings are very concerning, if not diagnostic, for inferior and posterior occlusion myocardial infarction.

These findings were not appreciated by providers. Due to the nature of the symptoms, the patient was treated for acute coronary syndrome and admitted.

ECG #2 (45 minutes later, chest pain resolved)

There is sinus rhythm with short PR interval and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay.

The concordant ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads has resolved. There is now very slight ST elevation in V2, representing appropriate discordant ST elevation relative to the preceding predominantly negative QRS complex.

The artery has reperfused.

There was no comment by providers regarding the dynamic ECG changes.

Clinical Outcome

The patient remained chest-pain free and underwent coronary angiography the following day.

Coronary angiography revealed a 99% thrombotic lesion of the proximal right coronary artery, which was stented.

Due to rapid spontaneous reperfusion, high-sensitivity troponin I peaked at just under 5000 ng/L.

This occlusion myocardial infarction went unrecognized and the patient was diagnosed with NSTEMI. Had spontaneous reperfusion not occurred, the patient could have suffered a very large myocardial infarction.

AI Interpretation

The Queen of Hearts AI model identified ECG #1 as occlusion myocardial infarction with high confidence and ECG #2 as not occlusion myocardial infarction following reperfusion.

Discussion

Occlusion myocardial infarction findings can be subtle, especially when the QRS is wide and baseline wander is present.

Approximately 33% of cases that would be called STEMI reperfuse spontaneously before emergent angiography. About 20% have TIMI-3 flow.

Of all occlusion myocardial infarctions, approximately 43% present with diagnostic ST elevation, while 57% do not and are labeled NSTEMI. Many of these will have spontaneous reperfusion by the time of next-day angiography.

At next-day angiography, 25% of NSTEMI have TIMI-0 flow and 34% have TIMI-0–1 flow without collateral circulation.

It is not possible to know at presentation which patients will reperfuse spontaneously. Therefore, all occlusion myocardial infarctions must be treated emergently.

Many subtle occlusion myocardial infarctions are not diagnosed until next-day angiography, at which point substantial myocardium is lost, resulting in higher mortality and worse left ventricular function.

Recognition of subtle occlusion myocardial infarction at presentation requires expert or AI-assisted ECG interpretation.

Learning Points

With training, occlusion myocardial infarction can be identified despite baseline wander and a wide QRS complex.

The Queen of Hearts AI model can identify these cases reliably and improve management of acute coronary syndrome.

Repeat ECG acquisition is advisable whenever ECG quality is poor, though sometimes clinical decisions must be made using imperfect tracings.

Dynamic ST-T wave changes on serial ECGs are diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion and should be actively sought by comparing tracings side-by-side.
