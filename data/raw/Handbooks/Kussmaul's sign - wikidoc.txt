Kussmaul's sign 
Overview
Kussmaul's sign is the observation of a jugular venous pressure (JVP, the filling of the jugular vein)
that rises with inspiration. It can be seen in some forms of heart disease. It is usually indicative of
right ventricular dysfunction along with hypotension and "dry lungs" (absence of pulmonary
edema).
Ordinarily the JVP falls with inspiration due to reduced pressure in the expanding thoracic cavity.
Kussmaul's sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to either fluid in the pericardial
space or a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium.
Historical Perspective
Kussmaul's sign is named after the German doctor who first described it, Adolph Kussmaul (1822-
1902).[1] He is also credited with describing Kussmaul breathing.
Causes
Possible causes of Kussmaul's sign include:
• Cardiac tumors
• Constrictive pericarditis
• Pericardial effusion
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy
• Right heart failure
• Right ventricular infarction
• Tricuspid Stenosis
