Overview
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a spectrum of conditions resulting from acute myocardial ischemia and/or infarction that is most often due
to an abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow. The most common symptom prompting diagnosis of ACS is chest pain, often radiating to the left arm
or angle of the jaw, pressure-like in character, and associated with nausea and sweating. ACS should be distinguished from stable angina, which is
chest pain that develops during exertion and resolves at rest. Traditionally, ACS has been classified into non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(NSTEMI), ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and unstable angina. Unstable angina is differentiated from NSTEMI by the absence of elevated cardiac
biomarkers. The basic pathology in both conditions involves a non-occlusive thrombus formation from a previously disrupted atherosclerotic plaque
causing an inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle. Though ACS is usually associated with coronary thrombosis, it can also be associated with
other causes such as cocaine use. Cardiac chest pain can also be precipitated by anemia, bradycardias or tachycardias.
Classification
• Traditionally, ACS has been classified into:
• Unstable angina (UA)
• Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
• ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
• According to this classification, unstable angina was defined as clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocardial ischemia in the
absence of an elevated troponin level.
• However, the widespread use of the high-sensitivity troponin assays made UA and NSTEMI indistinguishable since it was shown that almost all
patients previously named UA actually have increased high-sensitivity troponin levels.
• In other words, it is very unlikely that patients with clinical and ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia have normal high-sensitivity troponin levels.
[1]
• Consequently, in recent guidelines, the acute coronary syndromes are classified into two broad categories: [2] [3]
• Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), encompassing :
• Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
• Unstable angina
• ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
• Therefore, acute coronary syndromes can be classified as follows:

Angiography to Define Anatomy and Assess Lesion Severity
The standard procedure for defining coronary anatomy and assessing the degree of coronary artery stenosis is still coronary angiography[4].
• Severe Stenosis: diameter stenosis severity of 70% for non-left main disease and 50% for left main illness [4].
• A diameter stenosis severity of 40% to 69% is referred to as an angiographically intermediate coronary stenosis, and it usually necessitates
further examination to determine its physiological significance [4].
• Longer lesions may cause more ischemia than a single severe lesion [4].
Causes
• ACS is characterized by a sudden imbalance between myocardial oxygen consumption and demand, which is usually the result of coronary artery
obstruction. [3]

• Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and subsequent coronary thrombus
• Other conditions may also cause an imbalance, including:
• Excessive myocardial oxygen demand (in the setting of a stable flow-limiting lesion)
• Coronary artery spasm causing vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina
• Coronary embolism
• Coronary arteritis
• Noncoronary causes of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch :
• Hypotension
• Severe anemia
• Hypertension
• Tachycardia
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Severe aortic stenosis
• Nonischemic myocardial injury:
• Myocarditis
• Cardiac contusion
• Cardiotoxic drugs
• Multifactorial causes:
• Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy)
• Pulmonary embolism
• Severe heart failure (HF)
• Sepsis
