Cardiac marker
Overview
Medical tests that are often referred to as cardiac
markers include:
Kinetics of cardiac markers in myocardial
• cardiac troponin (the most sensitive and specific test for
infarction with or without reperfusion
myocardial damage)
treatment.
• creatine kinase (CK, also known as phosphocreatine
kinase or creatine phosphokinase)
• Aspartate transaminase (AST, also called Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (GOT/SGOT) or
aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT))
• lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
• Myoglobin (Mb) has low specificify for myocardial infarction and is used less than the other
markers.
Cardiac markers are substances released from heart muscle when it is damaged as a result of
myocardial infarction. Depending on the marker, it can take between 2 to 24 hours for the level to
increase in the blood. Additionally, determining the levels of cardiac markers in the laboratory -
like many other lab measurements - takes substantial time. Cardiac markers are therefore not
useful in diagnosing a myocardial infarction in the acute phase. The clinical presentation and
results from an ECG are more appropriate in the acute situation.

Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA) can be detected via the albumin cobalt binding (ACB) test, a
limited available FDA approved assay. Myocardial ischemia alters the N-terminus of albumin
reducing the ability of cobalt to bind to albumin. IMA measures ischemia in the blood vessels and
thus returns results in minutes rather than traditional markers of necrosis that take hours. ACB
has low specificity therefore generating high number of false positives and must be used in
conjunction with typical acute approaches such as ECG and physical exam. Additional studies are
required.
