Anatomy and Physiology
of the Cardiovascular System
by Luke Chan, with Mr Vipin Zamvar
1.1 Introduction
The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the circulatory system.
At a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, a human heart will contract approximately
100 800 times a day, more than 36 million times a year and nearly 3 billion times during
an 80-year lifespan.
Figure 1.1 – The anatomy of the heart.

1.2 Chambers of the heart
Cardiac chambers In A Heartbeat
Right • Receives venous blood from SVC, IVC, coronary sinus, anterior cardiac veins
atrium • Separation of smooth and rough areas by crista terminalis
• Fossa ovalis on interatrial septum
Right • Tricuspid valve: anterior, posterior and septal cusps
ventricle • Pulmonary valve: three semilunar cusps
• Lined by trabeculae carneae
• Moderator band conveying right bundle branch to ventricular muscle
Left • Receives oxygenated blood from four pulmonary veins
atrium • Smaller but thicker wall than right atrium
Left • 3× thicker wall than right ventricle (normal thickness 6–10 mm)
ventricle • Lined by trabeculae carneae
• Mitral valve: anterior and posterior cusps
• Aortic valve: anterior, right and left posterior cusps
The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles that function to return
deoxygenated blood to the lungs and oxygenated blood to the rest of the circulation.
Figure 1.2 – The internal anatomy of the heart.
1.2.1 Right atrium
• Forms the entire right border
• Receives venous blood from the:
superior vena cava superiorly, draining the azygos, subclavian and jugular veins
inferior vena cava inferiorly, draining the lower body
coronary sinus inferiorly, draining the heart
anterior cardiac veins anteriorly, draining the anterior heart
2

1.2 // ChAMberS of the heArt
• Anterior part of wall is smooth
• Posterior part of wall is rough with trabeculations known as musculi pectinati (pectinate
muscles) derived from the true fetal atrium
• Crista terminalis is a muscular ridge that runs vertically downwards, separating the
smooth and rough parts
• Right auricle/atrial appendage is a cone-shaped muscular pouch-like extension of the
right atrium
• Fossa ovalis is a shallow oval depression in the interatrial septum
an embryonic remnant of the fetal foramen ovale.
1.2.2 Right ventricle
• Forms most of the inferior border and anterior surface of the heart
• Connected to the right atrium by the tricuspid valve which has three cusps: anterior,
posterior and septal
• Connected to the pulmonary trunk by the pulmonary valve comprising three semilunar
cusps
• Each cusp is connected to its corresponding papillary muscle by chordae tendinae
(heart strings)
• Trabeculae carneae are irregular ridges lining the wall
• Moderator band is a muscular bundle connecting the interventricular septum to the
anterior wall
conveys the right bundle branch to the ventricular muscle
• Infundibulum is the smooth-walled outflow tract directed upwards and right towards
the pulmonary trunk.
Figure 1.3 – Superior view of heart valves.
1.2.3 Left atrium
• Forms most of the base of the heart
• Smaller, but thicker walled than right atrium
3

ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM
• Receives oxygenated blood from the four pulmonary veins which open into the cavity on
its posterior wall (two from each lung: superior and inferior)
• Left auricle/atrial appendage is an ear-shaped muscular pouch extending forwards and
to the right
this is a common site for thrombus formation
• Mainly smooth-walled except for ridges in the auricle due to underlying pectinate
muscles.
1.2.4 Left ventricle
• Forms most of the left border and the apex of the heart
• Longer, more conical and thicker walled than the right atrium (three times thicker,
between 6 and 10 mm in a normal heart)
• Wall is lined by thick trabeculae carneae
• Joined to left atrium by mitral valve
• Mitral valve has two cusps: anterior and posterior
• Chordae tendinae connects each cusp to its corresponding papillary muscle
• Communicates with aorta via the aortic valve:
3 semilunar cusps: anterior, right and left posterior
anterior and left posterior aortic sinuses above the valve give rise to the right and left
coronary arteries respectively.
// PRO-TIP //
• ‘Pectinate’ means ‘like a comb’ in Latin
• The mitral valve gains its name from its resemblance to a bishop’s mitre
• A patent foramen ovale is found in 20% of adults and is usually asymptomatic
• Rupture of any papillary muscle, such as following a myocardial infarction, will cause the
valve cusp to prolapse, resulting in severe regurgitation.
1.3 Coronary circulation
Coronary circulation In A Heartbeat
Right • Originates from anterior aortic sinus, runs along atrioventricular (AV) groove
coronary • Major branches: sinoatrial nodal, posterior descending, AV nodal,
artery marginal
Left • Originates from left posterior aortic sinus
coronary • Major branches: left anterior descending, left circumflex
artery
Coronary • Great, middle, small and oblique cardiac veins drain into the coronary
veins sinus then into the right atrium
1.3.1 Coronary arteries
The heart has a high oxygen demand from continuous pumping of blood. This demand is
met by the left and right coronary arteries.

1.3 // CoronAry Cir CuLAtion
Figure 1.4 – The coronary vessels.
Right coronary artery
• Originates from the anterior aortic sinus
• Passes forwards between pulmonary trunk and right auricle
• Runs along the atrioventricular (AV) groove
• Continues to the inferior border of heart to anastamose with the circumflex branch of
the left coronary artery
• Major branches:
sinoatrial (SA) nodal artery runs posteriorly between the right auricle and aorta,
supplying the SA node
marginal artery along the inferior border of the heart
posterior descending/posterior interventricular artery descends in the posterior
interventricular groove to anastamose with the left anterior descending artery
at the apex
AV nodal artery arises from the characteristic loop where the posterior descending
artery originates to supply the AV node.
5

ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM
Left coronary artery
• Originates from the left posterior aortic sinus
• Larger than the right coronary artery
• Left main stem varies in length (4–20 mm)
known as the ‘widowmaker’ as occlusion leads to rapid death
• Initially passes behind then to the left of the pulmonary trunk
• Reaches the left part of the AV groove
• Runs laterally around the left border as the left circumflex artery to reach the posterior
interventricular groove
• Major branches:
left anterior descending (LAD)/anterior interventricular:
– descends in the anterior interventricular groove to anastamose with the posterior
descending artery at the apex
left circumflex (LCX):
– continues round the left side of the heart in the atrioventricular groove, giving off
various ventricular and atrial branches
– anastamoses with the terminal branches of the right coronary artery.
// PRO-TIP //
Knowledge of the major and minor branches of the coronary arteries is essential for
coronary angiogram interpretation. Figure 1.5 is a schematic of the arteries as visualised in
a typical coronary angiogram.
RCA = right coronary LAD = left anterior descending
RDP = posterior descending D1 = first diagonal branch of LAD
RPL = right posterolateral branch M1 = first marginal branch of LCX
LCX = left circumflex MO1 = first marginal obtuse branch of LCX

1.3 // CoronAry Cir CuLAtion
Anatomical variations
• 90% of the population are ‘right dominant’ – where the posterior descending/posterior
interventricular artery branches from the right coronary artery. In the ‘left dominant’
10%, the left coronary and circumflex arteries may be larger and branch off the posterior
descending artery before anastomosing with an unusually smaller right coronary artery.
• The SA node is supplied by the right coronary in 60% and the left circumflex artery in
nearly 40% of the population. Dual supply is present in 3%.
• The AV node is supplied by the right coronary artery in 90% of the population, with the
remaining 10% by the left circumflex.
// PRO-TIP //
• The coronary arteries originate from the aortic sinuses – small openings superior to the
cusps of the aortic valve. This makes coronary arteries the first branches of the aorta
• Coronary blood flow is about 250 ml/min at rest (5% of cardiac output) and rises to
1 L/min during exercise
• During systole (contraction), the aortic valves open and blood is ejected into the aorta.
When the aortic valves close during diastole (when the heart is at rest), blood in the
aorta flows into the aortic sinuses then into the coronary arteries to supply the heart
• Coronary flow takes place mainly during diastole. It is reduced during systole when the
intramyocardial arteries are compressed by the contracting muscle
• Therefore, diastolic perfusion time is important for the coronary circulation. This is
shortened by a rapid heart rate which may result in inadequate perfusion.
1.3.2 Coronary veins
Most of the heart’s venous drainage is fulfilled by the tributaries of the coronary sinus.
The coronary sinus runs in the posterior atrioventricular groove. It opens into the right
atrium just to the left of the opening of the inferior vena cava. Its orifice is guarded by the
Thebesian valve. Its tributaries are:
• the great cardiac vein in the anterior interventricular groove
• the middle cardiac vein in the inferior interventricular groove
• the small cardiac vein that accompanies the marginal artery along the inferior border
of the heart
• the oblique vein which descends obliquely on the posterior side of the left atrium.
The remaining venous drainage is fulfilled by:
• the anterior cardiac veins (3 or 4 of them) draining a large proportion of the anterior
surface of the heart directly into the right atrium
• small veins (venae cordis minimae) within each chamber wall draining directly into their
respective chambers.

1.4 Conducting system of the heart
Conducting system In A Heartbeat
SA node depolarisation → atrial contraction → AV node activation (0.1 s delay) → bundle
of His → left and right bundle branches → Purkinje fibres → ventricular contraction
Figure 1.6 – The conducting system of the heart.
The sinoatrial (SA) node (the ‘pacemaker of the heart’) is situated at the junction of the
superior vena cava and the right atrium. This is where the electrical cycle begins.
1. The SA node initiates contraction by depolarising both atria, causing them to contract
and pump blood into the ventricles.
2. The atrial action potential activates the AV node which lies in the interatrial septum
immediately above the opening of the coronary sinus.
3. The AV node introduces a delay of 0.1 seconds before relaying the impulse to the bundle
of His. This delay allows the ventricles to fill.
4. Depolarisation then spreads through the bundle of His (which then divides into the left
and right bundle branches) and Purkinje fibres to reach the ventricular muscle.
5. This activates the ventricles and causes them to contract.
In a normal heart, the total time taken for the action potential to travel from the SA
node to the end of the Purkinje fibres is about 0.22 seconds. A normal sinus rhythm is
approximately 72 beats per min, which equates to 0.83 seconds for each cardiac cycle.

1.5 Nerve supply of the heart
• While the conductive system of the heart has its proprietary intrinsic pacemaker, the
autonomic nervous system is important in the rate of impulse formation, conduction
and contraction strength
• The heart’s nerve supply is derived from the vagus nerve (parasympathethic cardio-
inhibitor) and the C1-T5 sympathetic ganglia (cardio-accelerator) via the superficial
and deep cardiac plexuses
• Many drugs used in cardiology target the receptors shown in Table 1.1 (e.g. beta-blockers).

Sympathetic stimulation via β-adrenoceptors Parasympathetic stimulation via M receptors

↑ Heart rate ↓ Heart rate
↑ AV conduction ↓ AV conduction
↑ Contractility ↓ Contractility
↑ Excitability ↓ Excitability
// Why? //
Cardiac pain is not found exclusively in the chest but often radiates down the medial side of
the left arm and up to the neck and jaw. This is because radiation occurs to areas that send
sensory impulses to the same level of the spinal cord that receives cardiac sensation.
The sensory fibres from the heart travel up to T1-4, hence radiating to the medial left arm
via dermatomes T1-4. Cardiac vagal afferent fibres synapse in the medulla and descend to
the upper cervical spinothalamic tract cell, contributing to the pain felt in the neck and jaw.
1.6 The cardiac cycle
The cardiac cycle In A Heartbeat
Four phases:
Ventricular diastole (relaxation)
Isovolumetric Ventricular filling
ventricular relaxation
• Ventricles relax • AV valves open
• Aortic & pulmonary valves close – • Atria contract, filling ventricles
S “dub” • Maximally filled volume = end-diastolic volume

ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM
Ventricular systole (contraction)
Isovolumetric Ventricular ejection
ventricular contraction
• Ventricles contract • Aortic & pulmonary valves open
• AV valves close – S “lub” • Blood flows into aorta & pulmonary trunk
1
• Residual volume after ejection = end-systolic
volume
• Isovolumetric means that the ventricles contract or relax with no corresponding change
in ventricular volume. There are periods during these phases when all valves are closed.
Conversely, there is never a point in the cardiac cycle when all valves are open.
Figure 1.7 – The Wiggers diagram, named after Dr Carl Wiggers who in 1915 described the events occurring
during each cardiac cycle.

1.8 Cardiac muscle contraction
Cardiac muscle contraction In A Heartbeat
Contraction: Calcium-induced calcium release
Depolarisation → Little Ca2+ enters cytosol → Ca2+ enters sarcoplasmic reticulum →
SR releases more Ca2+ into cytosol → Ca2+ binds to troponin → cross-bridge formation
between actin-myosin → contraction
Relaxation:
Ca2+ is pumped from cytosol back into SR → Ca2+ levels drop → Ca2+ dissociate from
troponin → relaxation
12

1.8 // CArdiAC MuSCL e ContrACtion
Cardiac muscle cells are known as cardiac myocytes. Following depolarisation, calcium
(Ca2+) enters the cell through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemma.
This supplies only 20% of the Ca2+ required, insufficient for muscle contraction. The rest is
released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where Ca2+ is stored in high concentration
in a calcium-induced calcium release process (see Figure 1.8) unique to cardiac muscle.
The sequence of events is as follows:
Initiation of contraction
• Depolarisation causes Ca2+ to enter the myocyte via L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
• This causes a rise in Ca2+ concentration in the gap between sarcolemma and SR
• This activates Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors) in the SR
• Ca2+ floods into the cytoplasm down its concentration gradient. This releases a large
amount of Ca2+, sufficient to initiate contraction.
Contraction
• Calcium ions in the sarcoplasm then interact with troponin C to initiate cross-bridge
formation
• When Ca2+ binds to troponin C, the actin binding site is exposed, allowing the myosin
head to bind to the actin filament
• Just as in skeletal muscle contraction, using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis,
the myosin head pulls the actin filament towards the centre of the sarcomere.
Relaxation
• When the concentration of Ca2+ exceeds resting levels, ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps
(Ca2+-ATPase) in the tubular part of the SR are activated and pump Ca2+ from the
cytosol back into the SR
• As the action potential (AP) repolarises and Ca2+ channels inactivate, this mechanism
reduces Ca2+ towards resting levels, Ca2+ disassociates from troponin C and the
muscle relaxes.
Figure 1.8 – Calcium-induced calcium release process in a cardiac myocyte leading to contraction of
cardiac muscle.

1.9 Cardiac output
Cardiac output In A Heartbeat
Cardiac output (CO) • SV × HR
• Mean arterial pressure (MAP)/systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
Stroke volume (SV) • Volume pumped by each ventricle per beat
• End diastolic volume (EDV) – end systolic volume (ESV)
Heart rate (HR) • 60–100 bpm normal, <60 bpm bradycardia, >100 bpm tachycardia
• Sympathetic ↑ HR, parasympathetic ↓ HR
Preload • Degree of wall stress at end-diastole
• Frank–Starling mechanism: ↑ preload → ↑ cardiac output
Afterload • Degree of wall stress during systole
• Forces that oppose ejection of blood out of ventricles
• ↑ afterload → ↓ cardiac output
Contractility • Force of myocardial contraction
1.9.1 Definitions
• The cardiac output is the volume of blood ejected by each ventricle per minute
Cardiac output (CO) = Stroke volume (SV) × heart rate (HR)
= Mean arterial pressure ÷ systemic vascular resistance
• At rest, the average cardiac output is about 5 L/min
• During exercise, this can exceed 25 L/min as the heart rate increases two to three times
and stroke volume doubles.
• The stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per beat
• It is about 75 ml in a normal heart and may double during exercise
Stroke volume (SV) = End diastolic volume (EDV) – end systolic volume (ESV)
• End diastolic volume (EDV) = maximum ventricular volume immediately before systole
(~120 ml)
• End systolic volume (ESV) = minimum ventricular volume (~40 ml) immediately before
diastole.
• The ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage (%) of blood ejected by the ventricle relative
to its filled volume
1.9.2 Regulation of cardiac output
Adequate cardiac output is important for ensuring that each organ receives its minimum
required blood flow. The body regulates cardiac output by regulating heart rate and stroke
volume.
14

1.9 // CArdiAC outPut
Heart rate
• A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm
<60 bpm is bradycardia
>100 bpm is tachycardia
• This is affected by the heart’s intrinsic rhythmicity and extrinsic stimulation by the
autonomic nervous system
Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate
Parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart rate.
Stroke volume
The stroke volume is affected by preload,
afterload and contractility.
Preload
• The preload is the degree of heart muscle
stretching (wall stress) at end-diastole
(when the ventricle is completely relaxed)
• The Frank–Starling law (Figure 1.9)
dictates that the contraction of a cardiac
muscle fibre is proportional to the initial
length of the muscle fibre
• Thus, the greater the stretch on the
ventricle during diastole, the greater its
force of contraction during systole Figure 1.9 – The Frank–Starling law of the heart.
• This allows the heart to alter its force of
contraction in response to changes in venous return (see Figure 1.10)
• Impairment of this mechanism is involved in the development of heart failure (for further
discussion, see Chapter 10).
Figure 1.10 – An increase in venous return leads to a rise in cardiac output.
Afterload
• Afterload is the degree of heart muscle stretching (wall stress) during systole
• It is inversely related to stroke volume
• It is affected by the forces that oppose ejection of blood out of the ventricles
• Factors increasing afterload include:
raised aortic pressure
aortic stenosis
increased systemic vascular resistance such as during hypovolaemic shock
ventricular dilatation
• Factors decreasing afterload include:
vasodilator drugs e.g. nitrates, calcium channel blockers (non-rate limiting)
vasodilator metabolites in septic shock.
15

ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM
Contractility
• The contractility of the heart is the force of myocardial contraction
• The ejection fraction on echocardiography can be used as a measure of contractility
• Factors increasing contractility include:
increased preload (Frank–Starling mechanism)
sympathetic stimulation
raised extracellular calcium
drugs e.g. inotropes, digoxin
hormones e.g. catecholamines, thyroxine, growth hormone, glucagon
• Factors decreasing contractility include:
reduced preload (Frank-Starling mechanism)
parasympathetic stimulation
decreased extracellular calcium
cardiac ischaemia
hypoxia
hypercapnia
acidosis
drugs e.g. beta-blockers, anaesthetics, antiarrhythmics.
1.10 Blood pressure
Blood pressure In A Heartbeat
• Blood pressure sensed by baroreceptors (carotid sinus, aortic arch)
• Low BP → baroreceptor reflex → ↑ vasoconstriction, ↑ HR, ↑ contractility
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system:
• renin → angiotensin I → angiotensin II → vasoconstriction + water retention → ↑ BP
1.10.1 Definitions
• Blood pressure is the pressure exerted by circulating blood against the vessel walls
• It can be calculated using the formula:
Blood pressure (BP) = Cardiac output (CO) × systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
• The systolic pressure is the maximum pressure recorded during systole
• The diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure recorded during diastole
• The pulse pressure is the systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure
can be examined when feeling a patient’s pulse
at a normal blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, the pulse pressure is 40 mmHg
a narrow or wide pulse pressure is pathological (refer to Chapter 2).
1.10.2 Regulation of blood pressure
Blood pressure regulation is an important part of homeostasis to ensure adequate
perfusion to all parts of the body and preserving organ function. Blood pressure is
regulated by regulating cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.
