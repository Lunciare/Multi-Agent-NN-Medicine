Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory
biventricular heart failure
1 Recommendations
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of total artificial heart implantation
as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure
is limited in quality and quantity. Therefore, this procedure should only be used
with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research.
Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures
guidance page.
1.2 Clinicians wishing to do total artificial heart implantation as a bridge to
transplantation for end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure should:
• Inform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts.
• Ensure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety
and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's
information for the public is recommended.
• Audit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having total artificial heart
implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory
biventricular heart failure (see section 6.2).
1.3 Clinicians should enter details about all patients having total artificial heart
implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory biventricular
heart failure onto an appropriate registry and review local clinical outcomes.
1.4 Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary team experienced in

 
managing end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure in patients needing a
heart transplant, for whom a donor organ is not expected to be available before
their own heart fails completely.
1.5 This technically challenging procedure should only be done in centres
specialising in heart transplantation. Only cardiothoracic surgeons with specific
expertise and training in inserting the device should carry it out.
1.6 NICE encourages further research into total artificial heart implantation as a
bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure,
including well matched comparative studies. NICE may update the guidance on
publication of further evidence.
2 Indications and current treatments
2.1 Biventricular heart failure results from structural or functional abnormalities of the
heart. It leads to reduced blood flow to body tissues and oedema in the lungs
(causing breathlessness) and the periphery (causing swelling of the legs). Other
symptoms include reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue and malaise.
2.2 Medical treatment of heart failure involves drugs, such as diuretics and inotropic
agents, to improve heart function. Invasive therapies, such as
electrophysiological interventions, coronary revascularisation, valve replacement
or repair, may also be used for patients with end-stage refractory biventricular
heart failure. When these therapies no longer work, left ventricular or
biventricular assist devices or heart transplantation may be considered.
3 The procedure
3.1 A total artificial heart (TAH) can be implanted to provide circulatory support with
the aim that the patient survives while waiting for a donor heart to become
available (a technique known as 'bridge to transplantation'). In this procedure, the
device replaces the heart function completely.

 
3.2 Implantation of a TAH is done with the patient under general anaesthesia and on
cardiopulmonary bypass. The native left and right ventricles, and all 4 cardiac
valves are excised. The TAH device is implanted and attached to the atria, for
blood inflow, and pulmonary artery and aorta, for blood outflow. Depending on
the type of TAH, power is supplied either by drive lines connected
percutaneously to an external biventricular pneumatic pump (which may be
portable or static) or by batteries that are implanted internally and can be
recharged through the skin using a transcutaneous energy transfer system. When
the device begins to pump and restores blood flow around the body,
cardiopulmonary bypass is stopped and the chest incision is closed.
4 Efficacy
This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee
considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on
the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.
4.1 In a non-randomised prospective comparative study of patients at risk of
imminent death from irreversible biventricular heart failure, total artificial heart
(TAH) implantation (n=81) was compared with no TAH implantation (matched
historical controls; n=35). The rates of survival to heart transplantation were 79%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 68% to 87%) in the TAH group compared with 46%
in the control group (p<0.001). The 1-year survival to heart transplantation rates
were 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%) and 31% respectively (p<0.001).
In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study (United Network of Organ
Sharing [UNOS] database analysis) comparing TAH support (n=212) with
biventricular assisted device (BIVAD) support (n=366) as a bridge to
transplantation (BTT) in adult patients, device support survival rates were similar
in both groups (p=0.8): 95% compared with 93% at 30 days and 77% compared
with 69% at 1 year.
In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study comparing TAH support
(n=81) with paracorporeal BIVAD support (n=67) as a BTT in 148 adult patients,
device support survival rates were similar between the groups (p=0.87): 76%
compared with 72% at 30 days; 63% compared with 61% at 2 months; and 46%

 
compared with 53% at 6 months respectively.
In a case series of 101 patients at risk of imminent death from irreversible
biventricular heart failure and eligible for transplant, survival to heart
transplantation with TAH implantation as a BTT was 68% (69/101). In a case
series of 90 patients with biventricular failure treated by TAH implantation as a
BTT, actuarial survival on device was 74±5%, 63±6% and 47±8% at 30, 60 and
180 days after implantation respectively. In a case series of 27 patients with TAH
implantation as a BTT, 44% (12/27) of patients were discharged from hospital
within a median of 88 days after implantation (range 35 to 152 days). Support
time between discharge and transplantation was spent out of hospital in 87% of
patients.
4.2 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients with
TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), the survival
rates at 1 and 5 years after transplantation in the TAH group were 86% and 64%
compared with 69% and 34% in the control group respectively (p values not
reported). In the non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS
database analysis) comparing TAH support with BIVAD support, survival rates
after transplantation were 88% compared with 93% at 30 days, 78% compared
with 83% at 1 year, and 67% compared with 73% at 3 years respectively (p=0.06).
In the non-randomised comparative study of 148 patients, survival rates after
transplantation in the TAH group (n=51) and the paracorporeal BIVAD group
(n=39) were similar (p=0.60): 77% compared with 76% at 1year; 72% compared
with 70% at 3 years; and 70% compared with 58% at 5 years. In the case series of
101 patients with TAH implantation, survival after transplantation at 1, 5 and
10 years was 77%, 61% and 41% respectively. In the case series of 90 patients
with TAH implantation, actuarial survival rates after transplantation were 78±6%,
71±6% and 63±8% at 1, 5 and 8 years respectively. In the case series of
27 patients with TAH implantation, survival after transplantation (n=12) at a
median 20-month follow-up was 91%.
4.3 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients who
had TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), the overall
survival rate at 1 year was 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%) and 31% respectively
(p<0.001). In the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation, the overall
survival at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 55% (n=56), 43% (n=35), 28% (n=18), and

 
26% (n=3) respectively.
4.4 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients with
TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), quality of life in
the TAH group improved significantly: 75% of patients were out of bed 1 week
after implantation and mobility (defined as ability to walk more than 100 feet) was
seen in 61% of patients (method of measurement not reported). In the case series
of 27 patients with TAH implantation, the quality of life results for 12 patients at
home (measured using a modified ED-5D defined by INTERMACS) showed that
only 1 young patient was able to return to school. Patients and families reported
the console's noise as bothersome.
4.5 The specialist advisers listed the key efficacy outcomes as survival to hospital
discharge, survival and successful BTT at 6 and 12 months, and survival after
transplantation.
5 Safety
This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the committee
considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on
the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview.
5.1 In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study of 578 patients (United
Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] database analysis), rates of deaths were not
significantly different between total artificial heart (TAH) and biventricular
assisted device (BIVAD) groups: 10% (22/212) compared with 12% (45/366),
p=0.7 while on support; and 30% (64/212) compared with 30% (111/366), p=0.9
after transplantation. The causes of death while on device support (infection,
multi-organ failure, stroke or haemorrhage) and after heart transplantation (acute
rejection, infection, cardiac arrest, multi-organ failure and stroke) for both groups
were also similar. In a non-randomised prospective comparative study of
130 patients, rates of death before transplantation were 21% (17/81) in the TAH
group compared with 54% (19/35) in the control group (p value not reported).
Causes of the 17 deaths before transplantation in the TAH group were multi-
organ failure (7), procedural or technical complications (4), bleeding (2), sepsis
(2), congestive heart failure (1) and pulmonary oedema (1). In the same group

 
after transplantation, there were 6 deaths (3 graft failure, 1 sepsis, 1 procedural
or technical complication and 1 multi-organ failure). Rates of deaths in a non-
randomised retrospective comparative study of 148 patients were not
significantly different between TAH and BIVAD support groups while on support
(37% compared with 39%; p=0.87). Death occurred in 32% (32/101) of patients in
a case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation; 70% were within the first
14 days. Causes of deaths were multi-organ failure (13), pneumonia or pulmonary
oedema (6), sepsis (5), neurologic injury (4, including 1 stroke, 1 hypoxic damage
from hypotension and 2 intracranial haemorrhage), pancreatic abscess (1), small
intestinal ischaemia (1), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (1), and
disseminated coccidiodomycosis (1).
5.2 Bleeding events were reported in 62% (59/95) of patients in the TAH group in the
non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Of these events,
50% occurred during TAH implantation and were mainly tamponade or
mediastinal bleeding (needing surgery and blood transfusion) within 21 days. Two
patients died from bleeding: 1 during TAH implantation and 1 during heart
transplantation). Bleeding (from various sites) at a mean of 4 days was reported
in 43% (43/101) of patients in the case series of 101 patients. Reoperations for
haemorrhage (mediastinal explorations) were done in 25% (25/101) of patients.
The surgical revision rate for bleeding or haematoma was significantly lower in
the TAH group than the BIVAD group in the non-randomised comparative study
(23% [17/81] compared with 42% [28/67] respectively; p=0.03). Surgical re-
exploration for bleeding, haematoma or infection was reported in 39% (35/90) of
patients while on device support in the case series of 90 patients. Haemorrhagic
events (at a median time of 249 days) were reported in 14% (7/47) of patients in
the case series of 47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year. These
included cerebral haemorrhage (n=3), subarachnoid haemorrhage (n=2), and
gastrointestinal bleeding (n=2).
5.3 Device malfunction events were reported in 17% (16/95) of patients in the TAH
group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. One
patient died because of perforation in 1 of the layers of the device's left
ventricular diaphragm on day 124. Fitting complications were reported in 5% (5/
95) of patients in the TAH group in the same study; 2 patients died because of
poor fitting and 3 patients had repeat surgery to reposition the device. Device
failure was reported in 10% (5/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients

 
with TAH support for more than 1 year; there were 3 membrane ruptures
(2 patients died), 1 air hole in the driveline and 1 lower pump output. Device
malfunction (technical problems with the alarm and computer monitoring system
needing console change) was reported in 1 patient during hospitalisation in the
case series of 27 patients. Malfunctions were reported in 25% (3/12) of patients
discharged home after TAH implantation. In 2 patients, an air leak occurred in the
driveline to the ventricle, which was sealed with a silicon band. In 1 patient, alarm
triggering was caused by auricular compression during some movements
(stretching and yawning) and the patient was advised to avoid them.
5.4 The renal failure rate was significantly higher in the TAH support group than the
BIVAD support group after implantation (24% [52/212] compared with 10% [35/
366]; p<0.0001) and after transplantation (26% [56/212] compared with 14% [49/
366]; p=0.0001) in the non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS
database analysis). Renal failure (needing postoperative renal replacement
therapy) was reported in 64% (30/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients
with TAH support for more than 1 year. Recovery of renal function occurred in
73% (22/47) of patients but therapy continued in 17% (8/47) of patients.
5.5 The infection rate after implantation was significantly lower in the TAH group than
the BIVAD group (22% [46/212] compared with 28% [104/366]; p=0.005) in the
non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS database analysis).
Infections (7 blood, 50 respiratory, 5 mediastinal, 28 genitourinary,
12 gastrointestinal, 17 driveline and 6 in catheters) were reported in 77% (73/95)
of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative
study of 130 patients. Infections contributed to death in 7 patients and delayed
transplantation in 5 patients. Infections (commonly in the lungs and urinary tract)
were reported in 64% (64/101) of patients in the case series of 101 patients. Rates
of postoperative mediastinitis (TAH 12% [9/81] compared with BIVAD 5% [3/67];
p=0.14) or driveline infections (1 patient with TAH compared with 2 patients with
BIVAD; p=0.61) were similar in both groups during support in the non-randomised
comparative study of 148 patients.
5.6 Neurologic events (10 stroke, 4 transient ischaemic attack, 5 anoxic
encephalopathy, 1 metabolic encephalopathy, 4 seizure and 1 syncope) were
reported in 27% (26/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised
prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Transplantation was delayed in

 
6 patients. Neurologic events were reported in 16% (16/101) of patients in the
case series of 101 patients. Strokes were reported in 8% (8/101) of patients (5
within 9 days). Peripheral emboli (1 celiac artery, 2 spleen, 1 superior mesenteric
artery, 2 kidney, 2 retina) were reported in 8% (8/101) of patients, 4 of whom
died. Strokes rates were not significantly different between the TAH and BIVAD
groups during support in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of
148 patients (TAH 12% [9/81] compared with BIVAD 24% [16/67]; p=0.08). Strokes
were reported in 10% (9/90) of patients while on device support in the case
series of 90 patients with TAH implantation. Thromboembolic events (at a median
time of 500 days) were reported in 19% (9/47) of patients in the case series of
47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year; 6 had a transient ischaemic
attack and 3 had a major cerebrovascular accident with hemiparesis or aphasia.
5.7 Technical or procedural problems (obstruction of the mechanical tricuspid valve
of the TAH because of migration of the central venous catheter) were reported in
3% (3/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective
comparative study of 130 patients. This caused death in 1 patient. Catheter
entrapment of a central line in the tricuspid valve was reported in 2 patients in
the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation. Both these patients had
irreversible brain damage from device arrest and died.
5.8 In addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are
asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and
about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur,
even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers did not
describe any anecdotal or theoretical adverse events.
6 Further information
6.1 Patient commentary was sought but none was received.
6.2 This guidance requires that clinicians doing the procedure make special
arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has
developed NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (which is for use
at local discretion).
