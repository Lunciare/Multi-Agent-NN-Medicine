Endoaortic balloon occlusion for cardiac surgery
1 Recommendations
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endoaortic balloon occlusion for
cardiac surgery is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that
normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance.
1.2 The procedure should only be carried out by a highly experienced team and with
the use of continuous transoesophageal echocardiography.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications and current treatments
2.1.1 Endoaortic balloon occlusion is performed to achieve temporary obstruction of
the aorta during cardiac surgery, including mitral valve repair or replacement and
coronary artery bypass grafting.
2.1.2 Occlusion of the aorta is required in a number of cardiac operations. This is
normally achieved by external application of an aortic cross-clamp, either during
conventional open surgery or during minimally invasive cardiac procedures.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 This procedure is usually employed during minimally invasive cardiac operations
(also known as port-access surgery) that require endovascular aortic occlusion,
cardioplegia and left ventricular decompression.

 
2.2.2 A balloon catheter is inserted through the skin into an artery (normally the
femoral artery in the groin) and manipulated towards the aortic root. The balloon
at the tip of the catheter is filled with saline to occlude the aorta and prevent
blood flow. Various devices can be used for this procedure.
2.2.3 Continuous transoesophageal echocardiographic monitoring is used to detect
balloon migration along with other forms of monitoring such as radial arterial
pressure monitoring and direct monitoring of the surgical field, as necessary.
2.3 Efficacy
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the
published literature and which the committee considered as part of the evidence about
this procedure. For more details, see the overview.
2.3.1 There were no outcomes reported in the literature that related directly to the
efficacy of endoaortic balloon occlusion alone.
2.3.2 The specialist advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to include efficiency of
cardioprotection, reduced length of hospital stay, duration of cardiac arrest and
avoidance of the use of a cross-clamp from outside.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 In a case series of 306 patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion, the
30-day mortality rate was 1% (3 out of 306) and the rate of late deaths (mean
follow-up 20 months) was 2% (6 out of 306). A case series comparing 117
patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion with 117 matched controls
treated with conventional aortic cross-clamping reported one perioperative death
in each group. In four case series, 5% (11 out of 209), 4% (6 out of 151), 1% (1 out
of 127) and 25% (13 out of 52) of patients who were treated with endoaortic
balloon occlusion died in hospital.
2.4.2 The three case series of 306, 209 and 117 patients treated with endoaortic

 
balloon occlusion all reported aortic dissection in 1% (3 out of 306, 3 out of 209,
and 1 out of 117) of patients. One aortic dissection in the case series of 151
patients was judged by the authors to be unrelated to the endoaortic balloon
occlusion device. In the case series that described 58, 120 and 127 patients, no
aortic dissections occurred.
2.4.3 In a case series of 449 patients, there were no significant differences in the
incidences of arrhythmias, pulmonary dysfunction, bleeding, renal failure or low
cardiac output between those treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion and
those treated with transthoracic clamping. However, the rates of neurological
complications were higher in patients who had endoaortic balloon occlusion
(p<0.05; absolute numbers not given). (Neurological complications were defined
as stroke and transient hemiplegia.)
2.4.4 In five case series, stroke or transient ischaemic attack was reported in 4% (2 out
of 52), 2% (2 out of 127), 0.4% (1 out of 306), 1% (1 out of 117) and 1% (1 out of
151) of patients.
2.4.5 In seven case series, re-exploration for bleeding or tamponade was required in
10% (6 out of 60), 9% (26 out of 306), 7% (14 out of 209), 6% (9 out of 151), 4% (5
out of 117), 4% (1 out of 23) and 2% (3 out of 127) of patients treated with
endoaortic balloon occlusion.
2.4.6 In the case series of 306 and 151 patients, myocardial infarction was reported in 1
and 2 patients, respectively.
2.4.7 The specialist advisers reported anecdotal adverse events including aortic
dissection, balloon puncture, balloon migration, damage to aortic intima, device
movement causing loss of occlusion, femoral artery damage, difficulty positioning
the balloon, death due to failure to deliver cardioplegia, and inability to complete
planned surgery due to occlusion failure. Additional theoretical adverse events
noted by the advisers were stroke, inadequate myocardial protection and
cerebral ischaemia due to balloon misplacement and arterial embolism. The
advisers noted that this procedure has the potential to reduce stroke risk in
patients who have a very calcified aorta.
