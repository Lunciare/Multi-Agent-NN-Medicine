ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Diabetes:

The Risk Of Cardiovascular Events
Is High With Diabetes
Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and heart failure, compared with patients who do not have diabetes. In addition,
patients with diabetes may develop severe damage to other organs such as the kidneys (chronic kidney
disease) and this also increases the risk of cardiovascular events.
In patients with diabetes, detecting heart and kidney diseases is of critical importance to ensure that the
most appropriate treatments and support are given to improve prognosis.
Diagnosis Of Cardiovascular
Diseases And Diabetes
Based on the ESC Guidelines, all patients with diabetes should be checked for the symptoms or signs
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, for heart failure and for chronic kidney disease. Similarly, all
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should have a test to see if they have diabetes.
If you do not know already, you should ask your doctor or healthcare provider to assess your
cardiovascular risk:
If you have diabetes, you should know if you have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heart failure
• Your healthcare provider can check for symptoms or signs of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease and heart failure
If you have diabetes, you should know if you have chronic kidney disease
• Your healthcare provider can check if your kidneys are working properly (measured by estimated
glomerular filtration rate) and if there is any damage (measured by urine albumin/creatine ratio)
If you have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, you should know if you have diabetes
• Your healthcare provider can check for diabetes e.g. using a blood test for fasting plasma
glucose and HbA1c
If you have type 2 diabetes and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or kidney disease, you
should know if you are at high risk of these diseases in the future
• Your healthcare provider can check your 10-year cardiovascular risk using a scoring system called
SCORE2-Diabetes. You may be given treatments to reduce levels of glucose and/or cholesterol
depending on your estimated risk.

Medications To Lower
Cardiovascular Risk
The ESC Guidelines recommend certain heart-protective medications based on whether you have
diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease. These
medications are added to your existing treatments, regardless of your glucose control or glucose-
lowering therapies given for diabetes.
If you have type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it is recommended that
you receive both a GLP-1 RA and an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce
cardiovascular risk
If you have type 2 diabetes and heart failure, it is recommended that you receive an SGLT2 inhibitor
with proven cardiovascular benefit to reduce hospital stays due to worsening heart failure
• You should receive an SGLT2 inhibitor regardless of the type of heart failure that you have
If you have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, it is recommended that you receive an
SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce the cardiovascular and kidney failure risk
• To further reduce the risk, finerenone is also recommended if you have chronic kidney disease

atherosclerotic CVD? got heart failure?

These treatments are added to your existing medication and are not related to glucose control.
SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs and finerenone are not approved for patients with type 1 diabetes. The
guidelines mention that this is an important knowledge gap since patients with type 1 diabetes need to
know if these medications can help them too.

Therapeutic Lifestyle Modification
The ESC Guidelines recommend lifestyle changes as another type of therapy to reduce cardiovascular
risk in patients with diabetes including:
• Weight control – reduction in weight is recommended when necessary
• Increasing physical activity and exercise – any increase in steps per day will help your physical
and mental wellbeing
• Smoking cessation – stopping smoking is a key way to reduce cardiovascular risk in all people
• Controlling cardiovascular risk factors – lowering high levels of blood pressure and cholesterol is
recommended in patients with or without diabetes
Making lifestyle changes should not delay starting recommended medications.
Other Important Information
Some parts of the management of cardiovascular diseases are similar in patients with type 1 diabetes or
type 2 diabetes and in patients without diabetes.
Your doctor or healthcare provider should regularly check for an abnormal heart rhythm, such as atrial
fibrillation, by taking your pulse or doing an “ECG” to measure the electrical activity of the heart.
Your doctor or healthcare provider should also regularly check if there are any problems with the blood
supply to your legs (your “ankle-brachial index”) to see if you have lower-extremity artery disease.
Remember, if you have any questions, you can ask your doctor or healthcare provider.
Effective communication with your doctor or healthcare provider helps you to receive “person-
centred care” – this means working together to get the right recommended treatments and the right
support for you as an individual to reduce your cardiovascular risk, improve your prognosis and
improve your quality of life.
