Endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms is limited
in quantity but shows no major safety concerns. Evidence on efficacy is
inadequate because it is limited to the short-term. Therefore, this procedure
should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent
and audit or research.
1.2 Clinicians wishing to undertake endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal
aneurysms should take the following actions
• Inform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts.
• Ensure that patients and their carers understand the uncertainty about the
procedure's long-term efficacy and provide them with clear written
information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is
recommended.
• Audit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having endovascular stent-
grafting of popliteal aneurysms (see section 3.1).
1.3 Patient selection for this procedure should be carried out by a multidisciplinary
team which should include a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist
with specific training and experience in the technique.
1.4 NICE encourages further research into endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal
aneurysms and may review this procedure on publication of further evidence.

 
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications and current treatments
2.1.1 Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common peripheral aneurysms. They can
cause leg ischaemia by embolism or thrombosis and may rupture. Current
treatment is usually by open surgical bypass grafting. Postoperative antiplatelet
therapy is generally given.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Endovascular repair stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms is carried out with the
patient under local or general anaesthesia. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a stent-
graft device is inserted into the femoral artery using standard catheter and
guidewire techniques. Care is taken to ensure adequate length of anchoring stent
in the normal vessel, both proximally and distally, to bridge the popliteal
aneurysm and fully exclude the aneurysm from the circulation.
2.2.2 A range of different stents are available for this procedure.
2.3 Efficacy
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature
that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more
detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.
2.3.1 A meta-analysis of 320 patients treated by endovascular repair reported primary
and secondary patency rates at 1 year of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79%
to 88%) and 86% (95% CI 82% to 91%) respectively. In the same meta-analysis,
comparative data were available for 159 patients: the primary patency rate at 1
year for endovascular repair was 84% (36 out of 43), compared with 85% (99 out
of 116) for open repair (p=0.46). Secondary patency rates at 1 year were 86% (37
out of 43) for endovascular repair and 95% (110 out of 116) for open repair

 
(p=0.07). A non-randomised comparative study of 43 patients (56 limbs; 15
endovascular and 41 open repair) reported primary patency rates of 83% and
88% respectively at 24-month follow-up (p=not significant). A case series of 60
patients at 24 months were 100% and 92% for endovascular and open repair
respectively (p=not significant). A case series of 60 patients reported that the
primary patency rate was 77% at 3 years and 70% at 5 years. Primary patency is
defined as uninterrupted patency following revascularisation. Secondary patency
implies that re-intervention has been required to restore patency.
2.3.2 A case series of 50 patients reported that 98% (56 out of 57) of aneurysms were
completely excluded after endovascular repair.
2.3.3 The case series of 50 patients reported a limb salvage rate of 97% (55 out of 57).
2.3.4 A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 42 patients treated by endovascular or
open repair reported that 14% (3 out of 21) of patients in the endovascular group
required open repair because of endograft occlusion during a mean follow-up of
47 months. In the case series of 50 patients, stent-graft occlusion occurred in
16% (9.57) of aneurysms (2 were successfully treated by thrombolysis, 5 were
treated by femoropopliteal bypass, 1 patient was asymptomatic and was not
treated, and in the remaining patient, treatment of the occlusion was delayed
leading to severe limb ischaemia requiring amputation).
2.3.5 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as successful exclusion of
the aneurysm, long-term prevention of thrombosis and distal embolisation,
prevention of rupture, and limb salvage.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 Endograft thrombosis occurred in 10% (2 out of 21) of patients treated by
endovascular repair the day after the procedure in the RCT of 42 patients. In 1
patient, intra-arterial thombolytic therapy followed by an additional endovascular
procedure was successful. The other patient required open repair after 72 hours.
Acute thrombosis was reported in 6% (2 out of 23) of aneurysms within 24 hours
of the procedure in the case series of 29 patients; both aneurysms were
successfully recanalised with catheter-directed thrombolysis and balloon

 
angioplasty or rheolytic thrombectomy. In this study, a further 4 patients were
diagnosed with thrombosis during follow-up (1 was described as acute and 3 as
subacute).
2.4.2 Stent fracture in 4% (3 out of 73) of aneurysms (2 leading to occlusion) and stent
migration in 12% (9 out of 73) of aneurysms were reported in the case series of
60 patients. Stent migration was reported in 7% (4 out of 57) of procedures in the
case series of 50 patients.
2.4.3 Stenosis was reported in 3% (2 out of 73) of procedures (timing of events not
stated) in the case series of 60 patients. These were treated by percutaneous
transluminal angioplasty.
2.4.4 There was 1 report of distal embolisation necessitating amputation in the case
series of 50 patients.
2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers listed anecdotal adverse events as stent occlusion
leading to acute limb ischaemia, stent-graft thrombosis, graft failure due to
repeated mechanical stress, endoleak and puncture-site arterial bleeding. They
considered theoretical adverse events to include stent-graft infection and loss of
aneurysm control.
3 Further information
3.1 This guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special
arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has
developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).
