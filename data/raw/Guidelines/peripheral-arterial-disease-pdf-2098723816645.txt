Quality statement 1: Identification and
assessment of peripheral arterial disease
Quality statement
People who have symptoms of, or who are at risk of developing, peripheral arterial disease
(PAD) are offered a clinical assessment and ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI)
measurement.
Rationale
Early identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PAD means that treatment can
begin earlier, potentially slowing disease progression and improving quality of life through
better mobility and reduced pain. Early identification and treatment of PAD and its risk
factors may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the need
for lower limb amputation. A comprehensive assessment should include both a clinical
assessment with structured history taking, and ABPI measurement with a hand-held
doppler ultrasound scan to ensure an accurate diagnosis and quantification of disease
severity.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that hand-held doppler ultrasounds are adequately available;

 
that staff are trained to recognise the symptoms of PAD; and that people who have
symptoms of PAD or who are at risk of developing it are offered a clinical assessment and
ABPI measurement.
Health and social care practitioners ensure that they are aware of the symptoms of PAD
and the need to have these symptoms assessed; that they are aware of the risk factors for
PAD; and that healthcare practitioners ensure that they offer a clinical assessment and
ABPI measurement to people who have symptoms of PAD or who are at risk of developing
it.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that have an adequate supply of
hand-held doppler ultrasounds, and have staff trained to carry out clinical assessments
and ABPI measurements in people who have symptoms of PAD or who are at risk of
developing it.
People with possible peripheral arterial disease, and people who are at risk of developing
peripheral arterial disease receive a thorough assessment to find out whether or not they
have it, in which they are asked about their symptoms, their legs and feet are examined,
their pulses are checked, and the blood pressures in their arms and ankles are compared.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Symptoms of PAD
Symptoms include:
• non-healing wounds on the legs or feet
• unexplained leg pain
• pain in the leg when walking that resolves when stopping (intermittent claudication),
pain in the foot at rest, often made worse by elevation (for example, in bed at night

 
disturbing sleep and relieved by hanging the foot down)
• tissue loss (ulceration or gangrene).
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease]
People at risk of PAD
These include people who:
• have diabetes or
• are being considered for interventions to the leg or foot (for example, podiatric and
orthopaedic foot surgery and chiropody) or
• need to use compression hosiery.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, recommendation 1.3.1]
Clinical assessment
This should include:
• asking about the presence and severity of possible symptoms of intermittent
claudication and critical limb ischaemia using a structured questionnaire
• examining the legs and feet for evidence of critical limb ischaemia, for example, tissue
loss (ulceration and/or gangrene)
• examining the femoral, popliteal and foot pulses.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, recommendation 1.3.2]
ABPI measurement
Recommendation 1.3.3 in NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease provides guidance
on how this should be done.

 
Quality statement 2: Comorbidity
assessment
Quality statement
People with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are offered an assessment for cardiovascular
comorbidities and modifiable risk factors.
Rationale
People with both asymptomatic and symptomatic PAD have an increased risk of mortality
from cardiovascular disease, mainly due to heart attack and stroke. It is therefore
important to assess people with PAD for other cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable
risk factors, so that appropriate evidence-based treatment, advice and support can be
given to reduce this risk.

cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable risk factors.

 
Denominator: the number of people with PAD.
Data source: Local data collection. Data on the percentage of patients with PAD in whom
the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or
less, the percentage of patients with PAD in whom the last measured total cholesterol
(measured in the preceding 12 months) is 5 mmol/l or less, and the percentage of patients
with PAD with a record in the preceding 12 months that aspirin or an alternative
antiplatelet is being taken, are available in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)
indicators PAD002, PAD003 and PAD004.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that staff are trained to carry out assessments for
cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable risk factors.
Healthcare practitioners ensure that they offer people with PAD an assessment for
cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable risk factors.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services so that staff are trained on how to
assess for cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable risk factors.
People with peripheral arterial disease are offered an assessment to check their risk of
having a heart attack or a stroke, and identify any lifestyle factors that they can alter to
reduce their risk (for example, eating healthily, reducing alcohol consumption, stopping
smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly).

Quality statement 3: Supervised exercise
programmes
Quality statement
People with intermittent claudication are offered a supervised exercise programme.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Intermittent claudication
A walking- or exercise-induced pain in the lower limbs caused by diminished circulation.
[NICE's full guideline on peripheral arterial disease]
Supervised exercise programmes
This may involve the following components:
• 2 hours of supervised exercise a week for a 3-month period
• encouraging people to exercise to the point of maximal pain.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, recommendation 1.5.2]

 
Quality statement 4: Imaging
Quality statement
People with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) being considered for revascularisation who
need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound are offered magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA).
Rationale
Imaging should only be performed in people with PAD if it is likely to provide information
that will influence their management. Duplex ultrasound followed by MRA, where clinically
appropriate and if needed, offers the most accurate, safe and cost-effective imaging
strategy for people with PAD. However, local training and expertise and the availability of
imaging equipment may be variable.

duplex ultrasound are offered MRA.
Healthcare practitioners ensure that they offer MRA to people with PAD who are being
considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound
imaging.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services with adequate availability of
imaging equipment and which offer MRA to people with PAD being considered for
revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound.
People with peripheral arterial disease whose healthcare practitioner thinks surgery might
help to improve their blood flow, are offered imaging tests (for example, an ultrasound) to
see whether surgery would be suitable.
Source guidance

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Revascularisation
Any procedure that is used to restore blood flow to an area of the body that is supplied by

 
narrowed or blocked arteries. This can be done either by making the narrowed arteries
wider (angioplasty, stenting), or by using another blood vessel to bypass the blocked or
narrowed artery (bypass surgery).
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, information for the public]
People being considered for revascularisation
This includes people:
• with intermittent claudication, who should be offered angioplasty only when:
－ advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been reinforced (see
recommendation 1.2.1 in NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial diseaseand
－ a supervised exercise programme has not led to a satisfactory improvement in
symptoms and
－ imaging has confirmed that angioplasty is suitable for the person
• being considered for primary stent placement, for treating people with intermittent
claudication caused by complete aorto-iliac occlusion (rather than stenosis)
• with critical limb ischaemia who need revascularisation, who should be offered
angioplasty or bypass surgery, taking into account factors including:
－ comorbidities
－ pattern of disease
－ availability of a vein for grafting
－ patient preference
• being considered for primary stent placement, for treating people with critical limb
ischaemia caused by complete aorto-iliac occlusion (rather than stenosis).

1.5.5, 1.6.2 and 1.6.4]

 
Quality statement 5: Angioplasty for
intermittent claudication
Quality statement
People with intermittent claudication are offered angioplasty only when imaging has
confirmed it is appropriate, after advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been
given, and after a supervised exercise programme has not improved symptoms.
Rationale
Angioplasty can be used to treat intermittent claudication, but it is an invasive procedure
and should only be used after non-invasive options (including reinforcement of the
importance of lifestyle changes and participation in supervised exercise programmes)
have not improved symptoms, and imaging has confirmed that angioplasty is suitable.
Greater use of non-invasive treatments may reduce the need for angioplasty and improve
overall outcomes for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
Quality measures
Structure

Process
Proportion of people with intermittent claudication receiving angioplasty who have had
imaging to confirm angioplasty is appropriate, received advice on the benefits of

 
modifying risk factors and undergone a supervised exercise programme that did not
improve symptoms.
Numerator: the number of people in the denominator who have had imaging to confirm
angioplasty is appropriate, received advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors and
undergone supervised exercise programme that did not improve symptoms.
Denominator: the number of people with intermittent claudication who receive angioplasty.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that supervised exercise programmes are adequately available
and have local protocols in place to ensure healthcare practitioners only offer angioplasty
to people with intermittent claudication when imaging has confirmed it is appropriate,
advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been given and a supervised exercise
programme has not improved symptoms.

Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which people with intermittent
claudication are only offered angioplasty when imaging has confirmed it is appropriate,
advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been given and a supervised exercise
programme has not improved symptoms.
People who have pain when walking because of poor circulation are offered angioplasty
(a procedure in which a small balloon is inserted into the narrowed artery and inflated to
widen the artery) only when an imaging test has confirmed that angioplasty is suitable,
and advice on the risk factors of peripheral arterial disease and a supervised exercise
programme have not improved symptoms.
