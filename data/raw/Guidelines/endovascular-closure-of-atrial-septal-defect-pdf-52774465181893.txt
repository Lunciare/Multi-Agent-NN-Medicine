Endovascular closure of atrial septal defect 
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endovascular closure of atrial
septal defect appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided
that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical
governance.
1.2 The procedure should be performed in units where there are arrangements for
cardiac surgical support in the event of complications.
1.3 The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research runs the UK Central
Cardiac Audit Database (UKCCAD) and clinicians are encouraged to enter all
patients into this database.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications
2.1.1 An atrial septal defect is the persistence of a hole (the foramen ovale) in the wall
(septum) between the right atrium and left atrium of the heart. The foramen ovale
usually closes spontaneously after birth; an atrial septal defect is present when
this closure does not occur. In the most common type, called an ostium
secundum atrial septal defect, the septum between the atria fails to form properly
during foetal development, resulting in a permanent hole. An atrial septal defect
allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, thereby increasing
the flow of blood to the lungs. This is known as a shunt. Patients with atrial septal
defects are usually asymptomatic through infancy and childhood. Symptoms such

 
as exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations and syncope can occur and
increasing age carries a higher risk of stroke. Some patients may develop
congestive heart failure.
2.1.2 Not all atrial septal defects require treatment, but it is generally agreed that larger
defects and those associated with either symptoms or significant enlargement of
the heart should be closed electively. Conventional surgery for atrial septal
defect is performed through an incision in the front of the chest. After
establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, the right atrium is opened to gain access to
the interatrial septum. The defect is then repaired using a patch or stitches.
Patients usually stay in hospital for several days after the operation.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Endovascular closure of an atrial septal defect involves making a small incision in
the groin to introduce a guidewire and delivery sheath into the femoral vein. An
occluder device is then introduced through the delivery sheath on a semi-rigid
cable and expanded within the atrial septal defect to close it. Echocardiography
and fluoroscopic guidance are used to determine the size and position of the
defect and to place the occlude device. A balloon may be used to measure the
diameter of the defect. Patients can usually go home the next day. Small residual
shunts after the procedure often resolve as endothelial tissue grows over and
around the device. The claimed advantages compared with open surgery are
shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activities and fewer complications.
2.3 Efficacy
2.3.1 Three non-randomised controlled studies reported successful closure rates
immediately after the endovascular procedure of 96% (423 out of 442), 98% (60
out of 61) and 97% (28 out of 29), compared with rates of 100% (154 out of 154),
98% (60 out of 61) and 100% (64 out of 64), respectively, for conventional
surgery. A large case series of 3,460 patients reported that 97% (3,301 out of
3,391) of atrial septal defects were successfully closed immediately after the
procedure. Of the 4% (147 out of 3,460) of patients followed up for 2 years in this

 
study, all maintained successful closure. A further case series reported that 1% (4
out of 314) of patients had a significant residual shunt immediately after the
procedure and 93% (99 out of 107) of patients had a successful closure 1 year
after the procedure. For more details, see the overview.
2.3.2 The Specialist Advisors noted that a small proportion of patients might be left
with a residual shunt.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 The reported complication rates were low. They included malpositioning of the
device, requiring endovascular or surgical retrieval 1% (6 out of 417) to 5% (16 out
of 334); arrhythmia 0.4% (2 out of 459) to 5% (3 out of 61); embolisation of the
device 0.4% (14 out of 3,460) to 4% (14 out of 334); thrombus formation 0.4% (1
out of 258) to 3% (1 out of 37); brachial plexus injury 3% (1 out of 39); right iliac
vein dissection 0.6% (1 out of 159); stroke 0.1% (5 out of 3,460) to 0.3% (1 out of
334); cardiac tamponade 0.1% (2 out of 3,460); cardiac perforation 0.03% (1 out
of 3,460); and endocarditis 0.03% (1 out of 3,460). For more details, see the
overview.
2.4.2 The Specialist Advisors listed arrhythmias, stroke, device embolisation and
cardiac tamponade as potential adverse effects of the procedure.
2.5 Other comments
2.5.1 There is the potential for long-term adverse effects and clinicians should report
these to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
2.5.2 These recommendations were based on evidence on the use of the Amplatzer,
CardioSEAL, STARFlex and Helex devices for the endovascular closure of atrial
septal defect. NICE may review the procedure if further data relating to other
devices become available.
