Acute heart failure (QS103)
Quality statement 1: Single measurement
of natriuretic peptide
Quality statement
Adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single
measurement of natriuretic peptide.
Rationale
Natriuretic peptide testing (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) is an important tool for rapidly assessing adults
presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure. It can be used to rule out a
diagnosis of heart failure or to see if further investigation with echocardiography is
needed. It can save time and distress for the adult presenting with new suspected acute
heart failure.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

Acute heart failure (QS103)
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (cardiac service providers) ensure that adults presenting to hospital
with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide
that is undertaken by the cardiac team to rule out a diagnosis of heart failure. Also,
hospitals in England to which people may present with suspected acute heart failure
ensure they use appropriate assay thresholds of plasma BNP less than 100 ng/litre and
plasma NT-proBNP less than 300 ng/litre.
Healthcare professionals ensure that adults with new suspected acute heart failure have a
single measurement of natriuretic peptide on presentation to hospital to rule out a
diagnosis of heart failure.
Commissioners ensure that adults with new suspected acute heart failure have a single
measurement of natriuretic peptide on presentation to hospital to rule out a diagnosis of
heart failure.
Adults presenting at hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have their
natriuretic peptide (also known as BNP or NT-proBNP) level in their blood measured. This
test is a quick way for doctors to find out whether the person is likely to have heart failure
or if they need further assessment to see if their symptoms are caused by something else.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Natriuretic peptide
A protein substance secreted by the wall of the heart when it is stretched or under
increased pressure. It has several forms and its level can be raised in a number of
conditions, including heart failure. A normal natriuretic peptide level means that heart
failure is unlikely, and its measurement can be used to exclude a diagnosis of heart failure.

Appropriate assay thresholds of plasma BNP to assist in ruling
out the diagnosis of heart failure
• Plasma BNP less than 100 ng/litre
• Plasma NT-proBNP less than 300 ng/litre.

doppler 2D echocardiography
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic
peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of
admission.
Rationale
Performing a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of hospital
admission for adults with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide
levels will enable earlier diagnosis and appropriate management in terms of
pharmacological treatment, location of care and relevant input from the specialist heart
failure team.

Adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have their natriuretic
peptide levels (also known as BNP or NT-proBNP) in their blood measured. If the level is
raised, they have an echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission to help find out if there
is something wrong with their heart.

Definition of terms used in this quality statement
Transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is a test that uses ultrasound waves to measure the pumping action
and structure of the heart, including the heart valves. A probe is moved over the surface of
the chest and picks up echoes of sound (similar to an ultrasound scan used in pregnancy),
which are shown as a picture on a screen.

Acute heart failure (QS103)
Quality statement 3: Organisation of care
– early specialist input
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure have input within 24 hours of
admission from a dedicated specialist heart failure team.
Rationale
A dedicated specialist heart failure team with early involvement is important for
cost-effective care. It can also positively contribute to rapid diagnosis, reduced
readmissions and better quality of life. Ongoing input of the dedicated specialist heart
failure team will also help to ensure appropriate care and make subsequent readmission
less likely.

Input within 24 hours of hospital admission
Review and address the needs of acute heart failure patients within 24 hours of hospital
admission. [Expert consensus]
Dedicated specialist heart failure team
This specialist inpatient team includes doctors, nurses (including heart failure specialist
nurses), pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists, and has access to a palliative
care specialist and other expertise as required. The team is led by a consultant specialist
with a sub-speciality interest in heart failure. This team is based on a cardiology ward but
also provides outreach services to heart failure patients on all other wards within the
hospital. It is also part of a broader multidisciplinary specialist team working across
primary and secondary care, as outlined by NICE guidance. [Adapted from NICE's
guideline on chronic heart failure and expert consensus]

Acute heart failure (QS103)
Quality statement 4: Starting or
continuing beta-blocker treatment
Quality statement
Adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are started on, or
continue with, beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission.
Rationale
In-hospital introduction of beta-blockers is associated with increased use of beta-blockers
at follow-up and better long-term outcomes such as fewer adverse events and reduced
mortality. Also, it is important that beta-blocker treatment is continued for adults who are
already taking it.

The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
