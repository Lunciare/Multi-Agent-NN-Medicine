Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes
1 Recommendations
This guidance replaces NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the
treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention.
1.1 Prasugrel 10 mg in combination with aspirin is recommended as an option within
its marketing authorisation, that is, for preventing atherothrombotic events in
adults with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina [UA], non-ST segment
elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction [STEMI]) having primary or delayed percutaneous coronary
intervention.

 
2 Clinical need and practice
2.1 Acute coronary syndromes refers to a group of symptoms associated with acute
myocardial ischaemia with or without infarction. It encompasses a spectrum of
disorders or syndromes including acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina
pectoris. Acute coronary syndromes are usually the result of an acute or sub-
acute primary reduction of myocardial oxygen supply provoked by disruption of
an atherosclerotic plaque (build-up of material in a heart vessel) associated with
inflammation, thrombosis, vasoconstriction and microembolisation.
2.2 The presence of ST-segment-elevation on an electrocardiogram usually indicates
total occlusion of the affected artery, resulting in necrosis of the tissue supplied
by that artery or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This
condition is treated immediately with reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or
percutaneous coronary intervention). Acute coronary syndrome without STEMI is
classified as either unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI). NSTEMI differs from unstable angina primarily in the severity
of myocardial ischaemia. In NSTEMI, the ischaemia is severe enough to result in
the release of biochemical markers of myocardial injury into the blood. Immediate
treatment for these conditions aims to prevent progression to total occlusion of
the artery and, for people at high risk of myocardial infarction, may include
coronary revascularisation, either by means of percutaneous coronary
intervention or coronary artery bypass graft.
2.3 Acute coronary syndromes become more prevalent with increasing age and
incidence is higher in men than women. There were around 32,000 hospital
admissions for unstable angina in England in 2012 to 2013, and it is estimated
that there are about 82,000 myocardial infarctions in the country every year. Of
the 80,974 hospital admissions with a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction
recorded between April 2012 and March 2013 in the Myocardial Ischaemia
National Audit Project (MINAP), 40% were STEMIs and 60% were NSTEMIs. The
average age of people with STEMI and NSTEMI was 65 years and 72 years
respectively. Twice as many men had myocardial infarctions as women.
2.4 Long-term management of acute coronary syndromes includes the use of aspirin
in combination with a thienopyridine (clopidogrel, prasugrel) or

 
acyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine (ticagrelor). NICE has produced guidelines on
myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation: The acute management of
myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation (now replaced by NICE's
guideline on acute coronary syndromes) and unstable angina and NSTEMI: early
management (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes).
NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation (now
replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) recommends that
after STEMI, patients treated with clopidogrel in combination with low-dose
aspirin during the first 24 hours after the myocardial infarction should continue
with treatment for at least 4 weeks. Thereafter, standard treatment, including
low-dose aspirin, should be given unless there are other indications to continue
clopidogrel in combination with aspirin. In its guideline on unstable angina and
NSTEMI: early management (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary
syndromes), NICE recommends that clopidogrel in combination with low-dose
aspirin should be continued for 12 months after the most recent acute episode of
NSTEMI. Thereafter, standard care, including treatment with low-dose aspirin
alone, is recommended unless there are other indications to continue clopidogrel
in combination with aspirin.
2.5 NICE recommends prasugrel in combination with aspirin as an option for
preventing atherothrombotic events in people with acute coronary syndromes
having percutaneous coronary intervention, only when: immediate primary
percutaneous intervention for STEMI is necessary; stent thrombosis has occurred
during clopidogrel treatment; or the person has diabetes (NICE's technology
appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary
syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention). NICE also recommends
ticagrelor in combination with low-dose aspirin for up to 12 months as an option
for people with STEMI who are to be treated with percutaneous coronary
intervention, NSTEMI or unstable angina (NICE's technology appraisal guidance
on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes).
2.6 Since the publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel
for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary
intervention in October 2009, generic formulations of clopidogrel have become
available and NICE has published its appraisal of ticagrelor (NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes).

 
3 The technology
3.1 Prasugrel (Efient, Eli Lilly and Company/Daiichi-Sankyo) is an oral inhibitor of
platelet activation and aggregation. It works by the irreversible binding of its
active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of adenosine diphosphate receptors on
platelets. It has a marketing authorisation when co-administered with aspirin for
the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with acute coronary
syndrome (that is, unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial
infarction [NSTEMI] or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI])
undergoing primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention.
3.2 The summary of product characteristics for prasugrel states that it should be
started with a single 60 mg loading dose and then continued at 10 mg once a
day. People taking prasugrel should also take 75 mg to 325 mg aspirin daily.
Treatment for up to 12 months is recommended unless stopping prasugrel is
clinically indicated.
3.3 According to the summary of product characteristics, the use of prasugrel in
people 75 years or older is generally not recommended. However, if treatment is
deemed necessary a reduced maintenance dose of 5 mg should be prescribed.
For people who weigh less than 60 kg, the summary of product characteristics
states that the 10 mg maintenance dose is not recommended and the 5 mg
maintenance dose should be used. For people with unstable angina or NSTEMI, if
coronary angiography is performed within 48 hours after admission, the summary
of product characteristics states that the loading dose should only be given at
the time of percutaneous coronary intervention.
3.4 The summary of product characteristics lists the following adverse reactions for
prasugrel: increased bleeding risk, hypersensitivity reactions including
angioedema, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. For full details of
adverse reactions and contraindications, see the summary of product
characteristics.
3.5 The price of prasugrel is £47.56 per 28-tab pack (excluding VAT, BNF edition 67).
The cost of treatment for 12 months is £628.47 (excluding VAT). Costs may vary
in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.

 
4 Evidence and interpretation
The Appraisal Committee considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of
enzalutamide and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG).
4.1 Clinical effectiveness
Prasugrel compared with clopidogrel
4.1.1 The manufacturer and the Assessment Group both identified 1 randomised
controlled trial (TRITON-TIMI 38) and 1 publication related to the core clinical
cohort from TRITON-TIMI 38 (Wiviott et al. 2011) from a systematic search of the
literature. Both the randomised controlled trial and the publication were also
considered for the original appraisal of prasugrel (NICE's technology appraisal
guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with
percutaneous coronary intervention). The Assessment Group commented that no
new evidence had been identified since the original appraisal was published.
4.1.2 TRITON-TIMI 38 was a randomised double-blind trial that compared prasugrel
with clopidogrel in 13,608 patients with moderate- to high-risk acute coronary
syndromes (unstable angina, non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction
[NSTEMI] or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) who were
scheduled to have percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were given
aspirin (at a recommended daily dose of between 75 mg and 162 mg) in
combination with the drugs studied. Patients were randomised to receive a
loading dose of 60 mg prasugrel followed by 10 mg prasugrel daily or a loading
dose of 300 mg clopidogrel followed by 75 mg clopidogrel daily for up to
15 months (the median treatment period was 14.5 months).
4.1.3 The primary efficacy end point for TRITON-TIMI 38 was a composite of the rate
of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and death from
cardiovascular causes during the entire follow-up period. A range of secondary
composite end points were also included. Major safety end points included
thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding not related to
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), non-CABG-related TIMI life-threatening

 
bleeding, and TIMI major bleeding (a fall in haemoglobin of 5 g/100 ml or more) or
minor bleeding (a fall in haemoglobin of 3 g to less than 5 g/100 ml).
4.1.4 Wiviott et al. (2011) reported the results for a core clinical cohort of the
TRITON-TIMI 38 population (n=10,084). This cohort consisted of patients
younger than 75 years, weighing 60 kg or more, and with no history of stroke or
transient ischaemic attack. This subpopulation was described in NICE's
technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention as the 'target
population' or 'licensed population' for treatment with prasugrel.
Manufacturer's submission
4.1.5 The manufacturer's submission focused on the results of the overall cohort
population of TRITON-TIMI 38. At 15 months, the composite primary end point for
the overall cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38 (n= 13,608) occurred
statistically significantly more frequently in the clopidogrel group than in the
prasugrel group (clopidogrel 781 of 6,795 patients [12.1%] and prasugrel 643 of
6,813 patients [9.9%], hazard ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI}
0.73 to 0.90], p<0.001). In the clopidogrel group there were also statistically
significantly more non-fatal myocardial infarctions (clopidogrel 620 of
6,795 patients [9.5%] and prasugrel 475 of 6,813 patients [7.3%], hazard ratio
0.76 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.85], p<0.001); deaths from cardiovascular causes, non-
fatal myocardial infarctions or urgent target vessel revascularisation (clopidogrel
798 of 6,795 patients [12.3%] and prasugrel 652 of 6,813 patients [10.0%], hazard
ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.89], p<0.001); stent thromboses (clopidogrel 142 of
6,795 patients [2.4%] and prasugrel 68 of 6,813 patients [1.1%], hazard ratio 0.48
[95% CI 0.36 to 0.64], p<0.001); and deaths from cardiovascular causes, non-
fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal stroke or rehospitalisations for ischaemia
(clopidogrel 938 of 6,795 patients [14.6%] and prasugrel 797 of 6,813 patients
[12.3%], hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.76 to 0.92], p<0.001) than in the prasugrel
group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in
the number of deaths from cardiovascular causes (clopidogrel 150 of 6,795
patients [2.4%] and prasugrel 133 of 6,813 patients [2.1%], hazard ratio 0.89 [95%
CI 0.70 to 1.12], p=0.31); non-fatal strokes (clopidogrel 60 of 6,795 patients [1.0%]
and prasugrel 61 of 6,813 patients [1.0%], hazard ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.45],

 
p= 0.93); or deaths from any cause (clopidogrel 197 of 6,795 patients [3.2%] and
prasugrel 188 of 6,813 patients [3.0%], hazard ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.78 to 1.16],
p=0.64).
4.1.6 In the overall cohort, statistically significantly fewer patients in the clopidogrel
group than in the prasugrel group met the primary safety end point
(non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding) during the 15-month follow-up period
(clopidogrel 1.8% and prasugrel 2.4%, hazard ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.68],
p=0.03). The net clinical benefit (composite of death from any cause, non-fatal
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and non-CABG-related non-fatal TIMI
major bleed) statistically significantly favoured prasugrel (clopidogrel 13.9% and
prasugrel 12.2%, hazard ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, p=0.004]).
4.1.7 The manufacturer presented an analysis of pre-specified subgroups for the
overall cohort in its submission. These subgroups included STEMI, unstable
angina or NSTEMI, people with diabetes and types of stent placements. The
analysis showed that there was no evidence to suggest that the overall treatment
effect was different in the subgroups compared with the overall cohort.
4.1.8 The manufacturer also provided post-hoc subgroup analyses from other
publications, which included the following:
• A subgroup analysis of the 1218 myocardial infarctions that occurred during
TRITON-TIMI 38 based on a paper by Morrow et al. (2009) showed that there
was a consistent reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarctions with
prasugrel compared with clopidogrel for myocardial infarctions of every size
as measured by biomarker elevation, with the greatest absolute reduction
seen in those myocardial infarctions associated with the greatest extent of
myocardial necrosis. The manufacturer highlighted that this analysis showed
that prasugrel statistically significantly reduced spontaneous and procedural
myocardial infarction compared with clopidogrel, and that this was consistent
across myocardial infarctions of varying type, size and timing.
• A subgroup analysis of the 3,146 patients with diabetes in TRITON-TIMI 38
(Wiviott et al. 2008) showed that patients with diabetes tended to have a
greater reduction in ischaemic events without an observed increase in non-
CABG-related TIMI major bleeding, and therefore showed a greater net
treatment benefit with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel.

 
Assessment Group's report
4.1.9 The Assessment Group's report focused on the results of the core clinical cohort
population of TRITON-TIMI 38, as reported in Wiviott et al. (2011). The
Assessment Group explained that during NICE's technology appraisal guidance
182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with
percutaneous coronary intervention, the Appraisal Committee agreed that the
core clinical cohort population was the most relevant because the excluded
patients were either explicitly excluded from the marketing authorisation or were
not supported by trial evidence (because the trial was based on the full 10 mg
dose). The Assessment Group noted that the authors of the Wiviott et al. study
stated that the core clinical cohort was identified post hoc and defined by
regulatory criteria, and that the study should therefore be considered as an
exploratory analysis.
4.1.10 The Assessment Group stated that the patients in the overall trial population of
TRITON-TIMI 38 and the core clinical cohort as reported in Wiviott et al. (2011)
appeared to be similar in terms of baseline characteristics. These included the
proportion of patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI (74% and 73%
respectively), the proportion of males (74% and 79%), and the proportion of
patients with diabetes (23% and 22%). The Assessment Group noted that the
proportions of patients reported were not presented by treatment trial arm.
However, it also noted that Wiviott et al. stated that patients in the core clinical
cohort randomised to prasugrel and clopidogrel were well matched, and that 50%
of the core clinical cohort was randomised to prasugrel.
4.1.11 For the patients in the core clinical cohort, prasugrel showed a clinically
significant and robust reduction in the primary end point compared with
clopidogrel (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or
non-fatal stroke; clopidogrel 569 of 5,383 patients [11.0%] and prasugrel 433 of
5,421 patients [8.3%], hazard ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.84], p<0.001) with a
favourable net clinical outcome (composite of death from any cause, non-fatal
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and non-CABG-related non-fatal
thrombolysis in myocardial infarction [TIMI] major bleed; clopidogrel 641 of
5,383 patients [12.5%] and prasugrel 522 of 5,421 patients [10.2%], hazard ratio
0.80 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89], p<0.001). There was no statistically significant
difference between the 2 groups in terms of the number of patients with
non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding (clopidogrel 73 of 5,337 patients [1.5%]

 
and prasugrel 91 of 5,390 patients [1.9%], hazard ratio 1.24 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.69],
p=0.17). The Assessment Group commented that the results for both composite
outcomes appeared to be driven by the number of non-fatal myocardial
infarctions.
4.1.12 The Assessment Group stated that for the core clinical cohort, prasugrel was
more effective than clopidogrel on the primary end point at 30 days (clopidogrel
7.0% and prasugrel 5.0%, hazard ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.82], p<0.0001) as
well as at the 15-month follow up (clopidogrel 4.5% and prasugrel 3.6%, hazard
ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.97], p=0.027).
4.1.13 The Assessment Group stated that no statistically significant difference in
non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding was noted in the core clinical cohort
between patients in the prasugrel and clopidogrel treatment arms. However,
there was a statistically significant difference in favour of clopidogrel when major
and minor bleeding events were combined (clopidogrel 3.0% and prasugrel 3.9%,
hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.57], p=0.03). The Assessment Group
commented that analysis of the net clinical benefit outcome (death from any
cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or non-CABG-related
non-fatal TIMI major bleeding) favoured the use of prasugrel in the core clinical
cohort (clopidogrel 641 of 5,383 patients [12.5%] and prasugrel 522 of
5,421 patients [10.2%], hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89], p<0.001).
4.1.14 The Assessment Group stated that statistically significant differences in favour of
prasugrel were reported for the outcomes of definite stent thrombosis (hazard
ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.29 to 0.60], p<0.001) and definite or probable stent
thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.62], p<0.001) in the core clinical
cohort. There were also statistically significantly fewer myocardial infarctions in
the prasugrel group compared with the clopidogrel group (clopidogrel 9.4% and
prasugrel 6.7%, hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.62 to 0.81], p<0.001).
4.1.15 The Assessment Group reviewed a Forest plot from the Wiviott et al. publication
that showed the relative effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel
across a range of subgroups within the core clinical cohort. The Assessment
Group noted that the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel appeared to be
consistent across the range of subgroups presented, including STEMI, unstable
angina or NSTEMI and patients with and without diabetes. It highlighted that no

 
specific clinical-effectiveness data were available for patients with STEMI and
diabetes, STEMI without diabetes, unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes, or
unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes. The Assessment Group also
highlighted that it was able to extract economic data about these subgroups from
the manufacturer's economic model.
4.1.16 In summary, the results for the core clinical cohort of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial
demonstrated statistically significant differences in favour of prasugrel compared
with clopidogrel across a range of outcomes and clinical subgroups. In terms of
safety (bleeding events), there was no statistically significant difference between
the prasugrel and clopidogrel groups for non-CABG-related major bleeding. Only
1 statistically significant difference between prasugrel and clopidogrel was noted
and this was for the combined outcome of TIMI major and minor bleeding, for
which statistically significantly more events occurred with prasugrel than with
clopidogrel.
4.1.17 The Assessment Group reported the efficacy, bleeding and net clinical benefit for
patients aged 75 years and older, weighing less than 60 kg or with a history of
stroke or transient ischaemic attack. There were no statistically significant
differences between the 2 groups for the primary efficacy end point (death from
cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) or the
primary safety end point (non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding). The results for
the primary efficacy end point were 16.0% in the clopidogrel group and 16.1% in
the prasugrel group (hazard ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.84 to 1.24], p=0.83). The results
for the primary safety end point were 3.3% in the clopidogrel group and 4.3% in
the prasugrel group (hazard ratio 1.42 [95% CI 0.93 to 2.15], p=0.10).
4.1.18 Overall, the Assessment Group considered that the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial was
robustly designed and of strong methodological quality. The Assessment Group
highlighted, that during the original appraisal of prasugrel, the Appraisal
Committee identified 3 areas of uncertainty about the generalisability of the
results from TRITON-TIMI 38 to people in England and Wales. These were:
• The loading dose of clopidogrel administered in the trial was 300 mg,
whereas a loading dose of 600 mg may be administered in clinical practice in
England and Wales.
• The majority (74%) of patients in the trial received the clopidogrel loading

 
dose during the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. In clinical
practice in England and Wales, patients undergoing planned percutaneous
coronary intervention receive the clopidogrel loading dose before the
procedure.
• The clinical efficacy in the trial was largely driven by statistically significant
differences in non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Non-fatal myocardial
infarctions included both clinical myocardial infarctions (symptomatic) and
non-clinical myocardial infarctions (shown by biomarkers and
electroencephalograph [ECG] readings).
The Assessment Group considered that the size and timing of the loading
dose of clopidogrel and the impact these factors have on the primary
outcome of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial remain unclear. However, the
manufacturer's re-analysis of myocardial infarctions (see section 4.1.8)
provided a convincing case that prasugrel is effective across all types of
myocardial infarction when compared with clopidogrel.
4.1.19 The Assessment Group noted that health-related quality of life was assessed in a
sub-study of TRITON-TIMI 38 using the Angina Frequency and Physical
Limitations Scores scales of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the London School
of Hygiene Dyspnoea Questionnaire score, the EQ-5D self-report questionnaire
and the EQ visual analogue scale. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at
days 30, 180, 360 and 450 after the baseline measurement was taken, or at the
last visit. Improvements in quality of life were observed early (between baseline
and 30 days) and these improvements remained at 12 months. There were no
statistically significant differences between prasugrel and clopidogrel. The
Assessment Group also noted that the study had recruited fewer people than
was initially planned (475 compared with 3000), and raised concerns about how
representative the sub-study was of the TRITON TIMI 38 trial population. The
Assessment Group was therefore unable to draw any conclusions about the
health-related quality of life of patients treated with prasugrel or clopidogrel in
the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial.

 
Prasugrel compared with ticagrelor
4.1.20 The Assessment Group noted that there were no trials directly comparing
prasugrel with ticagrelor. It considered performing an indirect comparison
between prasugrel and ticagrelor using data from TRITON-TIMI 38 and the
PLATO trial, with clopidogrel as the common comparator.
4.1.21 NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes recommends ticagrelor as a treatment option (in
combination with low-dose aspirin) for up to 12 months in adults with acute
coronary syndromes, including people with STEMI who are to be treated with
percutaneous coronary intervention, people with NSTEMI or people with unstable
angina. These recommendations were based on a single randomised controlled
trial (PLATO). The PLATO trial was an international, multicentre, double-blind,
double-dummy phase 3 trial comparing ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel
plus aspirin in 18,624 patients admitted to hospital with acute coronary
syndromes with or without STEMI. Patients were randomised to the trial
irrespective of planned intervention and therefore the patient population included
patients with acute coronary syndromes who were to be medically managed as
well as those who were to have percutaneous coronary intervention. The trial
follow up was for 12 months, but the trial protocol stipulated that once the
requisite number of events (1780) had accrued, patients had to leave the trial
after their 6-month or 9-month visit.
4.1.22 In the overall trial population, a statistically significant benefit of ticagrelor was
found for the primary composite end point (ticagrelor 9.8% and clopidogrel
11.67%, hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.77 to 0.92], p<0.001). When the individual
components of the composite end point were disaggregated, the reduction in the
primary end point was driven by statistically significant reductions in death from
vascular causes (hazard ratio 0.79 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.91], p=0.001) and myocardial
infarction (hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.75 to 0.95], p=0.005). There were no
statistically significant differences between the 2 arms of the trial for the end
points of major bleed (primary safety end point) and major fatal or
life-threatening bleed. However, statistically significant differences in favour of
clopidogrel were evident for the end points of total major and minor bleed
(hazard ratio 1.11 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.20], p=0.008) and non-CABG-related major
bleed (hazard ratio 1.19 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.38], p=0.03).

 
4.1.23 The Assessment Group stated that the TITRON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials were
not comparable, and so a comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor based on
these trials was inappropriate. It noted that TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO were
similar in many ways: both trials were conducted in a population with acute
coronary syndromes, used clopidogrel as a comparator and reported the same
primary composite efficacy end point (death from cardiovascular causes,
non-fatal myocardial infarctions, or non-fatal stroke during the follow-up period).
However, there were substantial differences in several characteristics of the
studies. TRITON-TIMI 38 included patients with acute coronary syndromes who
were early invasively managed and scheduled for percutaneous coronary
intervention within 72 hours of symptom onset, whereas PLATO included a broad
acute coronary syndromes population with symptom onset within 24 hours.
TRITON-TIMI 38 only allowed a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel whereas
PLATO allowed a 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose. TRITON-TIMI 38 had a
15-month follow-up period, whereas PLATO had a 12-month follow-up period.
4.1.24 The Assessment Group highlighted that the manufacturer of prasugrel had not
provided an indirect comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor in its submission for
this appraisal. Although the Assessment Group considered an indirect
comparison to be inappropriate, it identified 4 publications reporting an indirect
comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor based on TRITON-TIMI 38 and the PLATO
trials. These publications reported that there were no statistically significant
differences in overall death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or
their composite. Prasugrel was associated with a statistically significantly lower
risk of stent thrombosis, and ticagrelor was associated with a statistically
significantly lower risk of any major bleeding and major bleeding associated with
cardiac surgery.
4.1.25 The Assessment Group identified an ongoing trial designed to assess whether
ticagrelor is superior to prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and
planned invasive strategy (ISAR-REACT 5). This study is due to complete in
October 2018 (the final data collection date for primary outcome measure is
October 2016). The results of this study should allow a formal comparison of the
efficacy of prasugrel compared with ticagrelor.

 
Submission statements from other consultees
4.1.26 A professional group commented that although evidence supporting the use of
prasugrel in STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention is
unclear, the data supporting the use of prasugrel for STEMI treated by a variety
of means (as still occurs in the UK) remain strong. As such, there is no robust new
evidence to challenge the original guidance defining the patient population for
whom prasugrel should be a treatment option. The group stated that the benefit
of prasugrel therapy is limited to patients younger than 75 years, weighing more
than 60 kg and without a history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke. It
commented that data produced after NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182
on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous
coronary intervention do not support extending the use of prasugrel to all
patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes, whether treated
medically or by urgent revascularisation. It noted evidence from subgroup
analyses for efficacy of prasugrel over clopidogrel in the reduction of stent
thrombosis in patients receiving an intracoronary stent for treatment of acute
coronary syndromes.
4.1.27 The professional group commented that since the publication of NICE's
technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention, few further data
have become available about prasugrel in the context of non-ST-elevation acute
coronary syndromes and that no new data are available for STEMI. It stated that
although prasugrel reduces major adverse cardiac events and stroke in patients
with acute coronary syndromes at high risk of receiving percutaneous coronary
intervention with stents, there is no evidence that prasugrel reduces mortality.
The professional group commented that prasugrel should not be offered to
people aged 75 years or older, weighing less than 60 kg or with a past history of
transient ischaemic attack or stroke. However, it stated that prasugrel should
remain a treatment option in patients with STEMI treated by primary
percutaneous coronary intervention or by other means and in patients with
diabetes and acute coronary syndromes of any variety (STEMI, NSTEMI or
unstable angina).

 
4.2 Cost effectiveness
Manufacturer's economic model
4.2.1 The manufacturer submitted an economic model similar to the model described in
NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention. The economic
model had a Markov model structure with 2 phases. The first phase spanned the
duration of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and the second phase extrapolated
outcomes and costs beyond the trial, up until death or a time horizon of 40 years.
Rather than using data from the trial directly in the model, separate risk equations
for primary end point events were obtained from individual patient data from the
TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. These risk equations were then used to model events and
hospitalisation. Mortality was modelled based on adjustment of population life
tables, to reflect the impact on longer-term mortality of the events modelled over
the short term. Patients entered the model at the point of experiencing an acute
coronary syndromes event, immediately before having percutaneous coronary
intervention. Some aspects of the submitted economic model had been updated
based on feedback during the original appraisal of prasugrel. These revisions
included:
• the sensitivity analysis encompassing the entire population as opposed to a
'typical' patient profile
• scenario analysis using the Evidence Review Group's suggestions for utility
values, amended long-term relative risk of mortality and reduced incidence of
non-fatal myocardial infarction
• the (reduced) price of generic clopidogrel
• updated costs.
4.2.2 Although the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial included a health-related quality of life
sub-study, the manufacturer stated that it was not possible to provide robust
health-related quality of life estimates because of the very small numbers of
patients with events included in the analysis. Therefore, the manufacturer
conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies relevant to the
modelled trial population. Mean utility decrements for acute coronary syndromes

 
(0.041) and stroke or myocardial infarction (0.052) were taken directly from a US
study (Sullivan et al., 2006) that was designed to produce a specific list of
preference weights for use in economic evaluations; the study used the US
version of the EQ-5D. To calculate utility weights for use in the economic
evaluation, background UK population norms (free of disease) varied by age and
sex, as described by Kind et al. (1999), were applied to all patients in the study.
The utility decrements for acute coronary syndromes and stroke or myocardial
infarction were then used alongside these background utility estimates. Finally,
the manufacturer assumed that for a major bleed a decrement of 25% of the
population (utility) norm was applicable for a 14-day period.
4.2.3 The key categories of cost estimates in the manufacturer's submission were
related to hospitalisations and drug costs. Only hospitalisations related to end
points or to serious adverse events needing re-hospitalisation and potentially
related to the acute coronary syndrome condition or the percutaneous coronary
intervention were included in the manufacturer's cost analysis. Re-
hospitalisations were valued at a weighted average unit cost per hospitalisation
(using NHS reference costs) and differences in hospitalisation rates were applied
by geographic location. The weighted average unit cost per hospitalisation was
£3,070 for clopidogrel and £3,081 for prasugrel. Patients were assumed to be
treated with either aspirin and clopidogrel or aspirin and prasugrel for 12 months.
The cost for prasugrel was calculated at £10.20 per day for the loading dose and
£1.70 per day for the maintenance dose (MIMS August 13, based on £47.56 per
pack of 28 tablets). The cost of clopidogrel was calculated at £0.24 per day for
the loading dose and £0.07 per day for the maintenance dose (NHS Drug Tariff,
based on £1.83 per pack of 28 75 mg tablets). The cost of aspirin was calculated
as £0.01 per day for the maintenance dose.
4.2.4 The manufacturer considered 5 subgroups in its cost-effectiveness analysis,
resulting in the following incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs):
• For the all acute coronary syndromes licensed population (excluding prior
stroke or transient ischaemic attack and including patients who are now
recommended to be treated with a 5 mg maintenance dose), the ICER was
£11,660 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
• For the core clinical cohort (excluding prior stroke or transient ischaemic
attack and those weighing less than 60 kg, or aged 75 years or older), the

 
ICER was £11,796 per QALY gained.
• For the unstable angina or NSTEMI licensed population (excluding patients
with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack and including patients who are
now recommended to be treated with a 5 mg dose), the ICER was £15,452
per QALY gained.
• For the STEMI licensed population (excluding patients with prior stroke or
transient ischaemic attack and including patients who were recommended to
be treated with a 5 mg dose), the ICER was £6,987 per QALY gained.
• For the acute coronary syndromes licensed population with diabetes
(excluding patients with prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack and
including patients who were recommended to be treated with a 5 mg dose)
the ICER was £4,675 per QALY gained.
4.2.5 The manufacturer carried out a series of one-way deterministic sensitivity
analyses on the core clinical cohort population (excluding prior stroke or transient
ischaemic attack and those 75 years or older or weighing less than 60 kg). The
following changes to the model resulted in ICERs of more than £13,000 per QALY
gained (an increase of more than £1,000 from the base-case ICER):
• discounting at 6% for both costs and effects (ICER £16,475 per QALY gained)
• relative risks for all-cause mortality associated with clinical events reduced
by 50% (ICER £20,619 per QALY gained)
• clopidogrel pre-loading adjustment set at 70% (ICER £13,959 per QALY
gained).
4.2.6 The manufacturer did not carry out probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
4.2.7 The manufacturer also carried out a series of scenario analyses for each of the
following:
• using alternative values obtained from the Health Outcomes Data Repository
(HODaR) database
• amending the long-term relative risks of mortality (by ignoring the impact of
acute coronary syndromes before events that occurred in the TRITON-

 
TIMI 38 trial)
• reducing the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions such that the
underlying rate was 50% of that of the trial.
The results of the scenario analyses showed that when using alternative
utility values, relative risks for mortality and myocardial infarction, the ICER
for prasugrel compared with clopidogrel remained below £20,000 per QALY
gained.
Assessment Group's assessment of the manufacturer's economic
model
4.2.8 The Assessment Group provided a critique of the manufacturer's economic
model. It stated that in the long-term component of the model, there was an
assumption that differences established between the prasugrel and clopidogrel
treatment arms of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial will be preserved indefinitely at the
level observed at the end of the trial. However, the Assessment Group considered
that there is no reason to believe that further serious non-fatal events will not
continue to occur to patients in both cohorts. It stated that if events during the
trial are presumed to influence later survival, then it is also likely that any such
events in subsequent periods will also have important effects. Because active
treatment with clopidogrel or prasugrel will have stopped, it can be expected that
event rates will be similar in both treatment arms. The Assessment Group
commented that as a result of this process, it is likely that over time the disease
histories of patients will converge, and so any initial advantage for either
treatment will progressively decrease.
Assessment Group's economic model
4.2.9 The Assessment Group carried out a systematic review to identify existing
economic evaluations of prasugrel. Of the 15 potentially eligible references
identified, none of the papers met the full inclusion criteria that had been set. The
review identified the 3 studies included in the manufacturer's review of
cost-effectiveness evidence – two from a US perspective and one which used the

 
economic model originally submitted during NICE's technology appraisal
guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with
percutaneous coronary intervention but these were excluded by the Assessment
Group.
4.2.10 The Assessment Group developed a 2-phase economic model: a short-term
statistical model of the data from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and a long-term model
projecting outcomes and costs at the end of the first phase up to a maximum of
40 years. The model compared dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months from time
of percutaneous coronary intervention with either clopidogrel in combination with
low-dose aspirin or prasugrel in combination with low-dose aspirin. As a result of
the lack of clinical evidence available, the Assessment Group did not compare
prasugrel with ticagrelor.
4.2.11 The Assessment Group accepted the manufacturer's statistical model for the
initial phase (up to 12 months) but replaced the long-term projection with a more
detailed representation of subsequent cardiovascular events, accumulating
patient histories, alteration in health states and associated care costs, as well as
health-related quality of life.
4.2.12 The Assessment Group's decision model assessed 4 mutually exclusive
subgroups of the core clinical cohort (that is, all patients with acute coronary
syndromes, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, excluding those
with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, those aged 75 years or
older or weighing less than 60 kg). The 4 subgroups were:
• treated for STEMI and with diagnosed diabetes
• treated for STEMI and without diagnosed diabetes
• treated for unstable angina or NSTEMI and with diagnosed diabetes
• treated for unstable angina or NSTEMI and without diagnosed diabetes.
Specific clinical data relating to patients with STEMI, unstable angina or
NSTEMI or diabetes in the core clinical cohort were not available from the
manufacturer's submission or the most recent publication. In place of these
data, the Assessment Group extracted the outcomes from the manufacturer's
short-term model for the 4 mutually exclusive subgroups of the core clinical

 
cohort and used these as the initial conditions for surviving patients entering
the Assessment Group's long-term state-transition model.
4.2.13 For the long-term projection, the Assessment Group used a modified version of
the economic model described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on
clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive
vascular events. This model used data provided by the manufacturer of
clopidogrel from the CAPRIE clinical trial, supplemented by data provided by the
manufacturer of dipyridamole from the PROFESS clinical trial. The Assessment
Group stated that the myocardial infarction subpopulation analysis submitted for
NICE's technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release
dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular events addresses issues
similar to those in this appraisal and was based largely on data from the
myocardial infarction subpopulation in the CAPRIE trial. In order to reduce the
time in generating model results from an individual patient simulation approach,
the Assessment Group restructured the economic model submitted for NICE's
technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole
for the prevention of occlusive vascular events into a long-term Markov chain for
the purpose of this appraisal.
4.2.14 In the Assessment Group's long-term model the initial health state was
determined by the worst previous event (none, myocardial infarction or stroke),
the number of prior events (none, 1, 2, or 3 or more) and whether the event was
disabling or not. Moving into another health state was determined by whether the
patient experienced non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal haemorrhagic
stroke (disabling or non-disabling), or ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic
attack (disabling or non-disabling). The patient may also have experienced no
event during the year, and therefore stay in the same health state, or may have
died if they experienced fatal myocardial infarction, fatal haemorrhagic stroke,
fatal ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other vascular death, or
non-vascular death.
4.2.15 The main source of data used to populate the Assessment Group's long-term
model was the CAPRIE clinical trial. The Assessment Group stated that its clinical
adviser had confirmed that CAPRIE data was an appropriate trial source for
extrapolating long-term vascular events and that no better source had become
available since 2010. The CAPRIE trial was a double-blind placebo comparison of

 
clopidogrel with aspirin involving 19,185 patients with atherosclerotic vascular
diseases manifested as either ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or
symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Only CAPRIE data from 5,741 patients
with myocardial infarctions and without a history of other vascular events were
used to populate the Assessment Group's long-term model. The manufacturer of
clopidogrel carried out extensive re-analyses of the CAPRIE trial data as
requested by the Assessment Group in order to estimate independent event
hazards adjusted to age, sex and event history.
4.2.16 The Assessment Group's economic model included costs calculated from the
pack price for 28 tablets of clopidogrel, prasugrel and low-dose aspirin as stated
in the NHS Drug Tariff (November 2013; clopidogrel and low-dose aspirin) and
the BNF (October 2013, edition 66; prasugrel). Clopidogrel has a pack price of
£1.71, giving a cost of £0.24 per loading dose, £18.43 for a 12-month supply
(adjusted for treatment duration), and £29.37 for the total dual antiplatelet
therapy cost in year 1. Prasugrel has a pack price of £47.56, giving a cost of
£10.19 per loading dose, £511.67 for a 12-month supply (adjusted for treatment
duration) and £532.56 for the total dual antiplatelet therapy cost in year 1. Low-
dose aspirin has a pack price of £0.82, giving a cost of £10.70 for a 12-month
supply and annual maintenance cost.
4.2.17 The Assessment Group used the same unit costs as used in NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the
prevention of occlusive vascular events, updated to 2012 prices using the
Hospital and Community Health Services inflation index. The unit cost of a fatal
myocardial infarction is £2,373.68 (standard error £121.11, 95% CI
£2,136.31 to £2,611.05), a non-fatal myocardial infarction is £6,165.21 (standard
error £314.55, 95% CI £5,548.69 to £6,781.73), a fatal stroke is £9381.43
(standard error £478.64, 95% CI £8,443.29 to £10,319.57), a non-fatal
non-disabling stroke is £6,858.64 (standard error £349.93, 95% CI
£6,172.77 to £7,544.50), a non-fatal disabling stroke is £14,602.70 (standard error
£754.04, 95% CI £13,142.43 to £16,062.97), and a non-vascular or other vascular
death is £2,407.50 (standard error £122.83, 95% CI £2,166.75 to £2,648.25). The
annual cost in the event-free or myocardial infarction-only health state is £618.03
(standard error £31.53, 95% CI £556.23 to £679.84). In the non-disabling stroke
health state it is £1,804.06 (standard error £92.04, 95% CI
£1,623.66 to £1,984.47) and in the disabling stroke health state it is £5,537.72

 
(standard error £282.54, 95% CI £4,983.95 to £6,091.50).
4.2.18 The Assessment Group obtained the continuing health-state EQ-5D utility value
for patients who were event-free or suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction
(but no strokes) and who were alive 12 months after percutaneous coronary
intervention from the economic sub-study of the PLATO clinical trial. The values
were based on the weighted average of patients meeting those criteria. Utility
parameters reflecting sex differences and mild versus severe strokes for patients
suffering at least 1 stroke or transient ischaemic attack were obtained from a
study of EQ-5D observations as part of the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC). The
Assessment Group used an annual loss of utility estimated from the UK
population EQ-5D norms, which was calculated by fitting a linear regression trend
line to all people aged 35 years or older. The results were used to adjust the initial
health state utilities of each subgroup for the differences in mean age between
the TRITON-TIMI 38 cohort and OXVASC data. This decrement was also applied
annually to the results of the model to reflect the average decline of utility score
with increasing age.
4.2.19 The Assessment Group commented that 7 events in its model would be expected
to result in additional utility decrement in the first year of follow up during early
recovery. The Assessment Group identified a specific value for non-fatal
myocardial infarction using an analysis of UK Prospective Diabetes Study trial
results which compared utility values for events occurring within 12 months
against those occurring earlier. Sources for non-fatal stroke parameters gave
contradictory figures, suggesting that there is no clear additional early disutility
effect beyond the long-term continuing effect of a stroke. As a result, the
Assessment Group set these parameters to zero and conducted one-way
sensitivity analyses on these parameters instead. No sources were identified for
utility values for fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, other vascular death or
non-vascular death. The Assessment Group assigned these parameters a
notional value of −0.1 and conducted sensitivity analyses.
4.2.20 The Assessment Group discounted costs and outcomes annually at 3.5% and
carried out one-way sensitivity analyses using 0% and 6% discount rates for both
costs and outcomes. The Assessment Group's model generated results at the
end of every year from trial randomisation. However, deterministic results were
reported at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 years, and probabilistic results at 5 and 40 years.

 
4.2.21 The Assessment Group assumed that follow-up secondary prophylaxis was
limited to low-dose aspirin. The Assessment Group stated that it made this
assumption for convenience and to avoid the possibility of obscuring the primary
comparison between prasugrel and clopidogrel use. For the same reason, the
Assessment Group did not incorporate other post-stroke and post-myocardial
infarction care including surgery and other medication options. The Assessment
Group did not incorporate the adverse effects of aspirin therapy, the possibility
that people stop aspirin treatment or the risk of bleeding events associated with
long-term prophylaxis, because all these issues would affect patients in both
treatment arms and the incremental difference would be expected to be minimal.
4.2.22 The Assessment Group considered that it was inappropriate to calculate an ICER
for the overall core clinical cohort. It reported separate results from the model for
the 4 patient subgroups: STEMI with diabetes, STEMI without diabetes, unstable
angina or NSTEMI with diabetes and unstable angina or NSTEMI without
diabetes. For each subgroup, deterministic cost-effectiveness results were
presented at 1, 15, 10, 20 and 40 years after the initial percutaneous coronary
intervention. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness results were presented at 5-year
and 40-year follow up.
4.2.23 For the STEMI with diabetes subgroup, the ICER was £31,915 per QALY gained at
year 1 of follow up (incremental cost £230, incremental QALYs 0.007). The ICER
decreased to £4,603 per QALY gained at year 5 (incremental cost £269,
incremental QALYs 0.059), £2,139 per QALY gained at year 10 (incremental cost
£275, incremental QALYs 0.129), and at year 40 it was £1,640 per QALY gained
(incremental cost £447, incremental QALYs 0.272). The Assessment Group
conducted one-way sensitivity analyses, the results of which indicated that
uncertainty from individual model parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in
this subgroup. Varying discount rates for costs and outcomes had the largest
effect on the ICER, but it remained within the range of £1,000 to £2,500 per QALY
gained. Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up for this subgroup resulted in
a higher estimated ICER of £1,732 per QALY gained (incremental cost £515 and
incremental QALYs 0.297).
4.2.24 For the STEMI without diabetes subgroup, the ICER at year 1 of follow up was
£224,302 per QALY gained (incremental cost £422, incremental QALYs 0.002).
The ICER decreased to £29,607 per QALY gained at year 5 of follow up

 
(incremental cost £465, incremental QALYs 0.016), £13,370 per QALY gained at
year 10 (incremental cost £482, incremental QALYs 0.036), and at year 40 the
ICER had decreased to £6,626 per QALY gained (incremental cost £555,
incremental QALYs 0.084). The Assessment Group conducted one-way sensitivity
analyses, the results of which indicated that uncertainty from individual model
parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in this subgroup. Varying discount
rates for costs and outcomes had the largest effect on the ICER, but it remained
within the range of £4,000 to £9,000 per QALY gained. Probabilistic analysis at
40 years of follow up resulted in a higher estimated ICER of £7,073 per QALY
gained obtained from small incremental cost and QALY estimates (incremental
cost £609 and incremental QALYs 0.086).
4.2.25 For the unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes subgroup, the ICER at year 1 of
follow up was £76,856 per QALY gained (incremental cost £259, incremental
QALYs 0.003). At year 5 of follow up, the ICER for prasugrel decreased to £2,846
per QALY gained (incremental cost £96, incremental QALYs 0.034). From year 10
and beyond prasugrel dominated (that is, was less costly and more effective
than) clopidogrel (at year 40 of follow up: incremental cost −£77, incremental
QALYs 0.176). The Assessment Group undertook one-way sensitivity analyses,
which indicated that uncertainty from event incidence and fatality rates had the
largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between −£1,000 and £400 per
QALY gained). Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up confirmed that
prasugrel dominated clopidogrel with a small net cost saving and positive
incremental benefit (incremental cost −£120 and incremental QALYs 0.191).
4.2.26 For the unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes subgroup the ICER for
prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was £1,101,662 per QALY gained at the end
of the first year, as a result of the inclusion of the full additional cost of treatment
(incremental cost £413, incremental QALYs 0.00037). The ICER for prasugrel
decreased to £52,288 per QALY gained at year 5 of follow up (incremental cost
£346, incremental QALYs 0.007), £14,276 per QALY gained at year 10
(incremental cost £280, incremental QALYs 0.020) and at year 40 the ICER
decreased to £4,667 per QALY gained (incremental cost £248, incremental
QALYs 0.053). The Assessment Group undertook one-way sensitivity analyses,
which indicated that uncertainty from event incidence and fatality rates had the
largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between £2,500 and £6,500 per
QALY gained). Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up resulted in a lower

 
estimated ICER of £4,154 per QALY gained (incremental cost £212 and
incremental QALYs 0.051).
Summary of the deterministic base-case results from the
manufacturer and the Assessment Group
4.2.27 Table 1 illustrates the differences in the cost-effectiveness estimates for the 3
different models: the Evidence Review Group's exploratory analyses from NICE's
technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention, the manufacturer's
model, and the Assessment Group's model for the current appraisal.

The differences between the cost-effectiveness results submitted during the original
appraisal of prasugrel and those in the current appraisal (as shown in table 1) are a result
of the different economic models used. In particular, in the current appraisal both the
manufacturer and the Assessment Group used the whole licensed population in their
models, rather than the typical/median patient profile used in the model for the original

 
appraisal (see sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.11). Also, in the current appraisal the Assessment
Group used data from the CAPRIE trial in its long-term model rather than data from
TRITON-TIMI 38 (see section 4.2.15).
4.3 Consideration of the evidence
The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost
effectiveness of prasugrel, having considered evidence on the nature of acute coronary
syndromes and the value placed on the benefits of prasugrel by people with the condition,
those who represent them, and clinical specialists. It also took into account the effective
use of NHS resources.
Clinical effectiveness
4.3.1 The Committee discussed the clinical management of acute coronary syndromes.
The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that current management is in
line with NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment
of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention as well as
NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute
coronary syndromes, Myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation: The acute
management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation (now replaced
by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) and Unstable angina and
NSTEMI: early management (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary
syndromes). The Committee understood that, in England, treatment options for
people with STEMI are prasugrel in combination with aspirin, ticagrelor in
combination with low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel in combination with low-dose
aspirin, along with percutaneous coronary intervention followed by dual
antiplatelet treatment. It also understood that people in England with NSTEMI are
offered treatments depending on their Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events
(GRACE) or TIMI score. Medical management using aspirin is an option for people
at the lowest risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, whereas people at
higher risk are offered percutaneous coronary intervention along with either
ticagrelor, or clopidogrel and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy with
clopidogrel and aspirin. In patients with NSTEMI and diabetes, prasugrel is an
alternative to clopidogrel or ticagrelor. The Committee heard from patient experts
and clinical specialists that, overall, prasugrel is a useful addition to the treatment
options available. It has a potentially key advantage over clopidogrel because of

 
its faster antiplatelet action. However, the Committee also noted that prasugrel
increased the chance of (potentially fatal) bleeding compared with clopidogrel.
The Committee also heard from the clinical specialists that there was variation in
opinion among clinicians in England as to which of prasugrel, ticagrelor or
clopidogrel should be considered the standard treatment for all patients with
STEMI who have a percutaneous coronary intervention because of the chance of
increased bleeding with these treatments. The Committee recognised that
antiplatelet therapy such as prasugrel was a valued treatment option.
Prasugrel compared with clopidogrel
4.3.2 The Committee considered the evidence presented by the manufacturer and the
Assessment Group on the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel compared with
clopidogrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes in people having
percutaneous coronary intervention. The Committee noted that both the
manufacturer and the Assessment Group had identified 1 randomised controlled
trial (TRITON-TIMI 38) and that this trial had been the main source of evidence
for NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of
acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention. The
Committee noted that both the manufacturer and the Assessment Group had
stated that no significant new evidence had become available since the
publication of the previous appraisal comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel. The
Committee heard from one of the clinical specialists that although there were no
new data comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel, new data had become available
on prasugrel in patients with NSTEMI: specifically the ACCOAST and TRILOGY
trials. The clinical specialist highlighted that the results from ACCOAST (designed
to assess the effectiveness of pre-treatment with prasugrel in patients with
NSTEMI prior to angiography and at time of percutaneous coronary intervention
compared with no pre-treatment) indicated that pre-treatment with prasugrel did
not reduce the rate of occurrence of the primary end point (composite of death
from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent
revascularisation or glycoprotein llb/lla inhibitor rescue therapy), but that the rate
of major bleeding complications was statistically significantly increased. The
Committee was aware that since the publication of the ACCOAST results, the
summary of product characteristics for prasugrel had been updated to explicitly
state that in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, if angiography is

 
performed within 48 hours of admission, the loading dose should only be given at
the time of percutaneous coronary intervention. The clinical specialist highlighted
that the results from TRILOGY (designed to compare the effectiveness of
prasugrel plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with NSTEMI who
were treated with medical management) demonstrated that for the primary end
point of the trial (composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial
infarction or stroke in patients under the age of 75 years) there was no
statistically significant difference between the groups treated with prasugrel or
clopidogrel and that similar frequencies of bleeding events were reported for
both treatment groups. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that
because the patients recruited to TRILOGY were not treated with percutaneous
coronary intervention, data from the trial was peripheral to this appraisal.
Although the Committee accepted that new data on prasugrel had become
available since the publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on
prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous
coronary intervention, it concluded that these new data were not particularly
generalisable to the population being appraised (that is, people with acute
coronary syndromes who are to be treated with percutaneous coronary
intervention) and so could not be considered by Committee.
4.3.3 The Committee discussed the overall trial population and the subpopulation of
the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial presented by both the manufacturer and the
Assessment Group. It noted that the manufacturer and the Assessment Group
had presented clinical-effectiveness results for the overall cohort of patients in
the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and also for the core clinical cohort (which excluded
patients aged 75 years or older, those who weighed less than 60 kg, and those
with a history of stroke and transient ischaemic attack). The Committee
concluded that the core clinical cohort population was the most relevant for
decision-making because it only included those people specified in the summary
of product characteristics for prasugrel for whom the full 10 mg dose was
considered appropriate, that is, those younger than 75 years and with a body
weight of 60 kg or more.
4.3.4 The Committee identified 2 main areas of uncertainty in the evidence for the
clinical effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the
TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Firstly, the Committee heard from clinical specialists that, in
clinical practice, clopidogrel is administered several hours before percutaneous

 
coronary intervention (preloading) in most non-urgent procedures carried out in
England. Additionally, the preloaded dose of clopidogrel is often 600 mg. This
dose and timing of clopidogrel therefore differed from that used in
TRITON-TIMI 38 in which 300 mg (as in the marketing authorisation for
clopidogrel) was given without preloading (see section 4.1.2). The Committee
discussed the dose of clopidogrel. It heard from the manufacturer of prasugrel
that the CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial (published after the original appraisal of
prasugrel (NICE technology appraisal 182) and designed to assess the
effectiveness of a standard or double dose of clopidogrel in patients with acute
coronary syndromes) showed that there was no statistically significant difference
in the results for the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular
causes, myocardial infarction or stroke) for those having a higher dose of
clopidogrel (600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2 to 7, and then 75 mg daily)
compared with those having a lower dose (300 mg on day 1 then 75 mg daily).
The Committee accepted that the results from the CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial
suggested there was no clear benefit from the 600 mg dose of clopidogrel
compared with the 300 mg dose and agreed that the efficacy results seen in
TRITON-TIMI 38 with a 300 mg loading dose were unlikely to have differed
materially from those seen if the 600 mg dose was used (although a higher rate
of bleeding in the clopidogrel group may have been seen). The Committee then
discussed the timing of the loading dose of clopidogrel. It heard from the
manufacturer of prasugrel that the results of TRITON-TIMI 38 showed that the
benefit seen with prasugrel was relatively consistent over time, as shown through
the similarity of the hazard ratios for the primary efficacy end point in the
prasugrel group throughout the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. This implied a relative
advantage for prasugrel could have arisen even after the pre-loading of
clopidogrel. The Committee also heard from the manufacturer that the
management of patients with NSTEMI in clinical practice has changed since the
publication of the original appraisal of prasugrel (NICE technology appraisal 182)
as the 'door-to-needle time' for patients in England decreases, so too does the
time for pre-loading with clopidogrel. The Committee agreed that there is still
limited evidence on the importance of the timing of the clopidogrel loading dose
and so its effect on patient outcomes remains an issue. The Committee therefore
considered that more cardiovascular events could have occurred in the
clopidogrel group in the trial than might be experienced in a similar cohort of
patients having percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice in
England. As a result, the advantages of prasugrel over clopidogrel in preventing

 
cardiovascular events may have been overstated in the overall trial population
and core clinical cohort population of the TRITON-TIMI 38 study.
4.3.5 A second source of uncertainty concerning the clinical data from TRITON-TIMI 38
was the use of a composite end point that included non-clinically detected
myocardial infarctions (shown by biomarkers and ECG readings). The Committee
noted that the main positive result in favour of prasugrel was a decrease in non-
fatal myocardial infarctions including non-clinical myocardial infarctions, which
would have increased composite end point event rates for clopidogrel reported in
the trial. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that non-clinical
myocardial infarctions are often included in composite end points of cardiology
studies to ensure that the trials are statistically powered to detect differences in
outcomes. The Committee considered whether any statistically significant
differences would remain between prasugrel and clopidogrel if only clinical
myocardial infarctions (symptomatic) were included. The Committee noted the
evidence submitted by the manufacturer on the definition of myocardial infarction
and the Assessment Group's review of the evidence, which suggested that there
was a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions with prasugrel compared
with clopidogrel for myocardial infarctions of varying type, size and timing.
However, the Committee heard differing opinions from the clinical specialists
about whether non-clinical myocardial infarctions have a similar impact to clinical
myocardial infarctions on clinical effectiveness and if they can therefore be
considered equally. The Committee considered that the similarity of the clinical
effectiveness between the treatments was unproven, and because of the
difficulty in relating results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial to clinical practice in
England, the relative effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was
uncertain.
4.3.6 The Committee concluded that, despite being well conducted, the TRITON-TIMI
38 trial was not wholly applicable to current clinical practice in England. When
considering the absence of preloading with clopidogrel, the limitations of the end
points used, and the greater incidence of bleeding adverse events (when major
and minor bleeding events were combined) with prasugrel, the Committee agreed
that there was uncertainty about whether prasugrel was clinically superior to
clopidogrel in terms of net clinical benefit for either the overall trial population or
the Committee's preferred population, the core clinical cohort (see section 4.3.3).
The Committee therefore considered whether there were any identifiable

 
subgroups of patients for whom prasugrel might show superiority over
clopidogrel with less uncertainty.
4.3.7 The Committee considered the clinical evidence for prasugrel in the subgroup of
patients with STEMI. In clinical practice, there is only a short time between
diagnosis and primary percutaneous intervention in these patients. The
Committee considered the subgroup results presented by the Assessment Group
for the core clinical cohort which indicated a trend towards benefit for prasugrel
compared to clopidogrel in patients with STEMI across end points. The
Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the onset of antiplatelet
activity was more consistent and faster with prasugrel than with clopidogrel. The
delayed onset of antiplatelet activity with clopidogrel was of particular concern
when immediate percutaneous coronary intervention was needed because there
would be little or no time to give a preloading dose of clopidogrel. Having taken
all the above factors into consideration, the Committee agreed that prasugrel
could have an advantage over clopidogrel for patients with STEMI who need
immediate primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
4.3.8 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel
in patients with diabetes in the core clinical cohort who were having
percutaneous coronary intervention. It noted that in these patients, prasugrel
reduced the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or death from
cardiovascular causes compared with clopidogrel to a greater extent than for the
licensed population of patients (including those without diabetes). The
Committee, aware of the views expressed by the clinical specialists, considered
that the lack of a preloading dose in the trial may have underestimated the
effectiveness of clopidogrel in the population with diabetes. It agreed, however,
that diabetes represented an important and definable risk factor for more severe
cardiovascular disease and greater risk of cardiovascular events during and after
percutaneous coronary intervention. The Committee therefore concluded that it
would be appropriate to consider prasugrel for the treatment of people with
diabetes having percutaneous coronary intervention in its decision-making.
4.3.9 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel in patients who are
clopidogrel-resistant (that is, patients whose platelet levels do not respond
adequately to the dosage of clopidogrel with which they are treated). The
Committee understood that these patients may be at risk of further events if their

 
treatment is not adjusted adequately, but the Committee was aware that it was
not routine clinical practice to test for platelet response to clopidogrel. The
Committee heard from the clinical specialists that in around a quarter of patients
having percutaneous coronary intervention, stent thrombosis can occur despite
clopidogrel treatment. The Committee recognised that these patients could
reasonably be considered to be at high risk of further cardiovascular events, are
clearly identified and so could benefit from the option of treatment with
prasugrel. Because of this, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to
consider patients with clopidogrel resistance in its decision-making.
4.3.10 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel
in the subgroup of patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It noted that in the core clinical cohort, the
clinical effectiveness of prasugrel in these patients appeared to be consistent
with the effectiveness in patients with STEMI. The Committee, aware of the views
expressed by the clinical specialists, considered that the lack of a preloading
dose in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial may have underestimated the effectiveness of
clopidogrel in this subgroup. The Committee therefore concluded that there was
uncertainty about whether prasugrel was clinically superior to clopidogrel in
patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI. The Committee therefore concluded it
was appropriate to consider patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI as a
separate subgroup in its decision-making.
4.3.11 The Committee also discussed patients excluded from its preferred core clinical
cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38, that is, patients with a history of a stroke
or transient ischaemic attack, patients aged 75 years or older and patients
weighing less than 60 kg. The Committee noted that a history of stroke or
transient ischaemic attack is listed as a contraindication in the summary of
product characteristics for prasugrel and that the summary of product
characteristics also recommends a lower maintenance dose of 5 mg prasugrel for
patients aged 75 years or over and for patients weighing less than 60 kg. It heard
from the clinical specialists that, in clinical practice, prasugrel is not used in these
groups because of a higher bleeding risk. The Committee noted comments
received during consultation that new data had become available on the 5 mg
dose since the publication of the original appraisal of prasugrel, which included
data from the TRILOGY trial (see section 4.3.2). The Committee was aware that
safety data for the 5 mg dose of prasugrel from the TRILOGY trial had led to an

 
update of the information on the 5 mg dose in the drug's summary of product
characteristics. However, the Committee noted that it had not been presented
with any evidence for the efficacy of the lower dose of prasugrel and, therefore,
agreed that it would be inappropriate to make a recommendation for prasugrel in
patients aged 75 years or over and patients weighing less than 60 kg.
Prasugrel compared with ticagrelor
4.3.12 The Committee noted that there were no trials directly comparing prasugrel with
ticagrelor and that neither the manufacturer nor the Assessment Group had
presented an indirect comparison of the 2 treatments. The Committee was aware
of the rationale provided by both the manufacturer and the Assessment Group for
not undertaking the indirect comparison, specifically differences in the trial
design, patient population, and outcome measures used in the prasugrel
(TRITON-TIMI 38) and ticagrelor (PLATO) trials. However, given that ticagrelor is
in established use in clinical practice, that it is recommended for the treatment of
acute coronary syndromes in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor
for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes, and that it was included as a
comparator in the final scope issued by NICE, the Committee agreed that an
indirect comparison should have been performed, recognising that it would have
been imperfect. It noted that the clinical specialists stated that ticagrelor is used
in clinical practice in England and that prasugrel and ticagrelor are considered
similarly effective for treating patients with STEMI. However, the clinical
specialists were unable to comment similarly on the comparative effectiveness of
prasugrel with ticagrelor in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, because
prasugrel is not often used in these groups. The Committee noted that the
Assessment Group had highlighted several published indirect comparisons in its
report and that the Assessment Group considered the results from these
publications to be unreliable given the differences in the trials. Nonetheless, the
Committee discussed the results of the published indirect comparisons of
prasugrel and ticagrelor, which reported that there were no statistically
significant differences in overall death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal
stroke or their composite. The publications also reported that although prasugrel
was associated with a significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis, ticagrelor was
associated with a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding and major
bleeding associated with cardiac surgery. The Committee concluded that, on

 
balance, it was not able to distinguish the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel and
ticagrelor in patients with STEMI, unstable angina, or NSTEMI. However, in the
case of STEMI only, there was some support for the possibility of clinical
equivalence.
Cost effectiveness
4.3.13 The Committee considered the economic models submitted by the manufacturer
and the Assessment Group. The Committee considered the cost-effectiveness
results for the comparison of prasugrel and clopidogrel. The Committee noted
that the manufacturer and the Assessment Group had presented
cost-effectiveness results (for the 10 mg dose of prasugrel only) for different
populations and so the results could not be directly compared, although all of the
results for prasugrel 10 mg compared with clopidogrel were below £20,000 per
QALY gained at a time horizon of 40 years. The Committee then discussed which
of the cost-effectiveness data it should consider in its decision making. Bearing in
mind its considerations on clinical effectiveness (see sections 4.3.7, 4.3.8, 4.3.9,
and 4.3.10), the Committee agreed that an advantage of prasugrel over
clopidogrel was plausible in patients without an increased risk of bleeding (under
the age of 75 and weighing more than 60 kg) if they had ST-segment-elevation or
had diabetes (with STEMI or NSTEMI). However, in people with NSTEMI without
diabetes, it was less certain whether there was an advantage of prasugrel over
clopidogrel. The Committee noted that the Assessment Group had presented
cost-effectiveness results for these subgroups and concluded that these results
were the most appropriate for the cost-effectiveness decision-making.
4.3.14 The Committee considered the cost-effectiveness results from the Assessment
Group's economic model. It noted that the Assessment Group had provided
cost-effectiveness results for each of the subgroups at time horizons of 1, 5, 10
and 40 years. It noted that all of the ICERs at 10 or 40 years were below £20,000
per QALY gained (ranging from prasugrel dominating [that is, it was less costly
and more effective than clopidogrel] to £14,276 per QALY gained at 10 years, and
from prasugrel dominating to £6,626 per QALY gained at 40 years), however, at
5 years the ICERs for people with STEMI without diabetes and NSTEMI without
diabetes were over £20,000 per QALY gained (£29,607 and £52,288 per QALY
gained respectively). The Committee noted that the QALY gains for prasugrel

 
over the 40-year time horizon for the STEMI without diabetes and the unstable
angina or NSTEMI without diabetes subgroups were small (0.084 and 0.053
respectively), as was the difference in costs between prasugrel and clopidogrel
treatment (STEMI without diabetes: clopidogrel total cost £21,167, prasugrel total
cost £21,722, incremental cost £555; UA/NSTEMI without diabetes: clopidogrel
total cost £20,328, prasugrel total cost £20,576, incremental cost £248). It
accepted that, as a result, the cost effectiveness of prasugrel was highly
sensitive to changes in key model assumptions. The Committee therefore
considered which time horizon was the most appropriate for its decision-making.
The Committee noted that the clinical data used in the second phase of the
Assessment Group's economic data were obtained from the CAPRIE study, which
had a maximum follow up of 3 years, and that these data were used to
extrapolate results of the health economic analysis up to 40 years. The
Committee agreed that, although the extrapolation of short-term clinical data
over longer time horizons could only increase overall uncertainty, it is necessary
in economic modelling and longer time horizons are generally preferable. The
Committee noted that the time horizon within which the results would fall to
within the range usually considered to be cost effective by NICE (£20,000 to
£30,000 per QALY gained) is likely to be much less than 40 years. The
Committee considered that despite uncertainty in the ICERs arising from this
40 year extrapolation, the results were sufficiently robust to permit their use, and
concluded that the 40 year time horizon was the most appropriate for decision
making.
4.3.15 The Committee considered the ICERs for a 10 mg dose of prasugrel compared
with clopidogrel in patients with STEMI with and without diabetes. The
Committee noted that, for patients with STEMI and diabetes, the 40-year ICER
from the Assessment Group's model was £1,600 per QALY gained. For patients
with STEMI and without diabetes, the 40-year ICER from the Assessment Group's
model was £6,600 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that prasugrel
was a cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with clopidogrel for treating
people with STEMI with and without diabetes.
4.3.16 The Committee considered the ICER for a 10 mg dose of prasugrel compared with
clopidogrel in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI with and without
diabetes. The Committee noted that for patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI
and diabetes, prasugrel dominated clopidogrel at the 40-year time horizon. For

 
patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes, the 40-year ICER from
the Assessment Group's model was £4,700 per QALY gained. It accepted that the
difference between the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and clinical practice in the time
delay between diagnosis and treatment meant that there is uncertainty about
whether the results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial can be generalised to patients
with unstable angina or NSTEMI in England. However, taking into account the
slight advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel beyond the period when
preloading is relevant, and that the ICERs are well within the range usually
considered to be cost effective by NICE (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained),
the Committee concluded that prasugrel can be considered a cost-effective use
of NHS resources compared with clopidogrel for treating people with unstable
angina or NSTEMI with and without diabetes.
4.3.17 Regarding the cost-effectiveness of prasugrel compared with ticagrelor, the
Committee noted that neither the Assessment Group nor the manufacturer had
included ticagrelor in their economic modelling. Given the lack of a
cost-effectiveness analysis, the Committee concluded that it was unable to
calculate a precise ICER for this comparison. It agreed, however, that given the
similar cost-effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel and that of
ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, and their similar treatment costs, it was
reasonable to accept that prasugrel is similarly cost-effective to ticagrelor.

 
5 Implementation
5.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution
and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions)
Regulations 2013 requires integrated care boards, NHS England and, with respect
to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the
recommendations in this evaluation within 3 months of its date of publication.
5.2 The Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing
NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal guidance
recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in
Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 2 months of the
first publication of the final draft guidance.
5.3 When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is
available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. This means that if a
person has acute coronary syndromes and the healthcare professional
responsible for their care thinks that prasugrel is the right treatment, it should be
available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations.
