Quality statement 1: Identifying adults
who are likely to be at high risk
Quality statement
General practices use a systematic strategy to identify adults likely to be at high risk of
cardiovascular disease. [new 2025]
Rationale
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in the UK, and is a
major cause of illness, disability and poor quality of life. To improve primary prevention,
adults at increased risk of CVD need to be identified using a systematic strategy so that
their risk factors can be managed in the most effective way. This should not prevent
people being identified opportunistically but may help to ensure that those with the
highest risk of CVD are reviewed in an effective and efficient way. Factors routinely
recorded in electronic patient records can be used to estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk
assessment tool, and those at high risk should be invited for full formal risk assessment.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
a) Evidence that general practices use a systematic strategy to identify adults who are
likely to be at high risk of CVD.
Data source: Data can be collected from local implementation plans.
b) Evidence that general practices use the QRISK3 tool to estimate CVD risk, or QRISK2 if
QRISK3 is not currently embedded in electronic clinical systems.

 
Data source: Data can be collected from local implementation plans.
Process
The systematic strategies used by different localities will focus on different groups of
people depending on the individual GP practice and so example process measures have
not been provided. Some localities may want to focus on known local health inequalities or
NHS England's Core20PLUS5, for example, by disaggregating data by socioeconomic
status, ethnic family background, sex or presence of a learning disability. Measures could
also focus on adults with modifiable risk factors or coexisting conditions that increase CVD
risk.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary care providers) ensure that they use a systematic strategy to
identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD. The strategy could use general
practice records or systematic searches in pre-identified areas or with specific
populations.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses and pharmacists) identify adults who are
likely to be at high risk of CVD using risk factors already in patient records. They review
estimates of CVD risk on an ongoing basis for adults aged over 40.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that use systematic strategies to
identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD using CVD risk factors already
recorded.
Adults who are likely to have a high risk of CVD are identified by their healthcare provider
so that their risk factors can be managed in the most effective way.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Factors routinely recorded in electronic patient records
Factors routinely recorded in general practice patient records that could be used as part
of a systematic strategy to identify adults with an increased CVD risk, include, but are not
limited to:
• age
• sex
• family history of CVD
• ethnicity
• smoking status
• presence of other conditions known to associate with higher CVD risk such as
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, severe mental illness, migraine and erectile dysfunction
• use of antipsychotic, immunosuppressant or steroid medication
• blood pressure
• lipid levels
• BMI.
[Adapted from NICE's clinical knowledge summary on risk factors for CVD and expert
opinion]
Adults likely to be at high risk of CVD
Adults with an estimated 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more. [NICE's guideline on
cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, section
1.1 and recommendation 1.1.4]

 
Equality and diversity considerations
CVD risk can be estimated based on factors routinely recorded in general practice.
However, the accuracy of estimated risk scores will be adversely affected if relevant data
is not accurately recorded in GP records, which is especially likely for vulnerable and
underserved populations. To mitigate perpetuating or exacerbating existing health
inequalities, 'batch coding' without clinical judgement should be avoided. Additionally,
resultant data should be disaggregated by deprivation, ethnicity, age and gender to help
reduce the risk of widening health inequalities.
Clinical judgement should inform interpretation of results from CVD risk tools because
tools may underestimate the risk for certain groups of people, including, but not limited to:
• people treated for HIV
• people already taking medicines to treat CVD risk factors
• people who have recently stopped smoking
• people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia, such as immunosuppressant
drugs
• people with severe mental illness
• people with autoimmune disorders, and other systemic inflammatory disorders.
When using a QRISK3 risk score to inform treatment decisions in these populations,
particularly if it is near the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that
may predispose the person to premature CVD that may not be included in calculated risk
scores. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and
reduction, including lipid modification, recommendation 1.1.10]

 
Quality statement 2: Diet and lifestyle
advice for primary prevention
Quality statement
Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more receive tailored advice
on diet and lifestyle changes within 3 months of their cardiovascular disease risk
assessment score being recorded. [2015, updated 2025]
Rationale
Making improvements to diet, stopping smoking, increasing physical activity, managing
weight and reducing alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Healthcare professionals should offer advice to adults with a 10-year CVD risk
score of 10% or more after a full formal risk assessment, based on their individual needs,
preferences and circumstances.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Process
Proportion of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more who receive advice on diet
and lifestyle changes within 3 months of their CVD risk assessment score being recorded.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who receive advice on diet and lifestyle
changes within 3 months of their CVD risk assessment score being recorded.
Denominator – the number of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare

 
professionals and provider organisations, for example from electronic patient records.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as primary care services) ensure that systems are in place for
adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more to be given advice on diet and lifestyle
changes within 3 months of their cardiovascular risk assessment score being recorded.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses, healthcare support workers, and
pharmacists) give advice on diet and lifestyle changes for the primary prevention of CVD
to adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more within 3 months of their cardiovascular
risk assessment score being recorded. They take the person's individual needs,
preferences and circumstances into account when giving advice.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that can deliver diet and lifestyle
advice to adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more within 3 months of their
cardiovascular risk assessment score being recorded.
Adults with a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing CVD in the next 10 years (a 10-year
risk of 10% or more) are given advice on diet and lifestyle changes, such as stopping
smoking, losing weight, eating a healthy diet and exercising when they are found to be at
risk. These changes may help to reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke in
the future. The advice reflects their needs, preferences and circumstances.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Diet and lifestyle changes
Diet and lifestyle changes include:
• stopping smoking
• healthy eating
• reaching and maintaining a healthy weight
• increasing physical activity
• reducing alcohol consumption.

A person's sex will affect their CVD risk assessment score, and this should be considered
when estimating risk for trans people. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular
disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, rationale and impact
section on full formal risk assessment].

 
Quality statement 3: Lipid-lowering
treatment for primary prevention
Quality statement
Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more are prescribed a high-
intensity statin or other lipid-lowering treatment if a high-intensity statin is contraindicated
or not tolerated. [2015, updated 2025]
Rationale
High-intensity statins are the most clinically effective treatment option for the primary
prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). After a full formal risk assessment that
estimates an adult without CVD has a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more and following a
discussion with a healthcare professional about the risks and benefits of starting statin
treatment, an adult may choose statin treatment to reduce their risk of CVD. Atorvastatin
20 mg is recommended as the preferred high-intensity statin, but other lipid-lowering
treatment could be used if atorvastatin 20 mg is contraindicated or not tolerated.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Process
Proportion of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more who are prescribed a lipid-
lowering treatment.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who are prescribed a lipid-lowering treatment.
Denominator – the number of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more.

 
Data source:CVDPREVENT indicator CVDP006CHOL reports the proportion of patients
with no GP recorded CVD and a GP-recorded QRISK score of 10% or more, who are
currently treated with lipid-lowering therapy. The indicator also reports data for inequality
markers including sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation level and presence of a learning
disability.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary care services) ensure that systems are in place for adults with
a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more to be offered a high-intensity statin or other lipid-
lowering treatment, if required, to achieve their individual lipid target of a greater than 40%
reduction in non-high density (HDL) cholesterol.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses and pharmacists) offer a high-intensity
statin to adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more, or other lipid-lowering treatment
if required, to achieve their individual lipid target of a greater than 40% reduction in non-
high density (HDL) cholesterol. They are aware of strategies to address adverse effects of
high-intensity statins when reported by an adult on a high-intensity statin. They could use
the NHS England statin intolerance pathway to address statin intolerance.
Commissioners ensure that lipid-lowering treatment is available for adults with a 10-year
risk of CVD of 10% or more.
Adults with a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing CVD in the next 10 years (a 10-year
risk of 10% or more) are offered medicine to lower their cholesterol. They can use the
NICE patient decision aid on should I take a statin? to talk about options with their doctor,
nurse or pharmacist.

preference, presence of comorbidities, whether they are on multiple medications, whether
they are frail, their cognitive status, and their life expectancy. [NICE's guideline on
cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification,
recommendations 1.5.2 and 1.6.9 and expert opinion]

 
Quality statement 4: Assessing response
to lipid-lowering treatment
Quality statement
Adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment have a full lipid profile and their liver
transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months. [2015, updated 2025]
Rationale
Repeating lipid profiles and measuring liver transaminases after starting or changing lipid-
lowering treatment (and after a baseline blood sample has been taken), is important for
patient safety and to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. A repeat lipid profile can
be used to determine whether the expected lipid levels have been met and can indicate
the need for escalation of treatment. Measurement of liver transaminase is important to
detect any increased levels of these enzymes, which may indicate problems with liver
function.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Process
Proportion of adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment who had a full lipid
profile and their liver transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who had a full lipid profile and their liver
transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months.
Denominator – the number of adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment.

 
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example from electronic patient records.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as primary care services or secondary care services) ensure that
adults on lipid-lowering treatment have a full lipid profile and their liver transaminases
measured 2 to 3 months after starting or changing treatment.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, doctors, nurses and pharmacists) measure a full
lipid profile and liver transaminases 2 to 3 months after adults start or change lipid-
lowering treatment.
Commissioners ensure that adults on lipid-lowering treatment have a full lipid profile and
liver transaminases measured 2 to 3 months after starting or changing treatment.
Adults taking medicine to reduce their chance of a heart attack or stroke have a blood
test 2 to 3 months after starting or changing medicine to check that it is reducing their
cholesterol levels and not affecting their liver.
Source guidance

guideline NG238 (2023), recommendation 1.11.1
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Full lipid profile
This involves taking a blood sample to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and
triglyceride levels and then calculating non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (a fasting
sample is not mandated). LDL cholesterol results may not be reported in participants with
triglyceride levels more than 4.5 mmol per litre or 9 mmol per litre depending on the
formula used by local laboratories. [NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk
assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, terms used in this guideline]

 
Quality statement 5: Secondary
prevention of cardiovascular disease
Quality statement
Adults with cardiovascular disease have a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of
2.0 mmol per litre or less, or a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level of
2.6 mmol per litre or less. [new 2025]
Rationale
Management of LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol is important to reduce the risk of
future cardiovascular events in adults with existing cardiovascular disease. High-intensity
statins are the most clinically effective treatment option for the secondary prevention of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) by reduction of lipid levels. Atorvastatin 80 mg is
recommended as the preferred high-intensity statin, but other lipid-lowering treatments
could be used if atorvastatin 80 mg is contraindicated, not tolerated or the target
cholesterol level is not achieved. A non-HDL cholesterol target can be used if an LDL
cholesterol level has not been requested or calculated.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Outcome
Proportion of adults with CVD in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL cholesterol level
(measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for LDL cholesterol, or
2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol.
Numerator – the number in the denominator in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL
cholesterol level (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for

 
LDL cholesterol, or 2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol.
Denominator – the number of adults with CVD.
Data source:CVDPREVENT indicator CVDP012CHOL reports the proportion of patients
with GP-recorded CVD (narrow definition which includes coronary heart disease [CHD],
non-haemorrhagic stroke and stroke cause not specified, transient ischaemic attack [TIA]
and peripheral arterial disease), whose most recent blood cholesterol level is LDL
cholesterol less than or equal to 2.0 mmol per litre or, non-HDL cholesterol less than or
equal to 2.6 mmol per litre in the preceding 12 months. The indicator also reports data for
inequality markers including sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation level and presence of a
learning disability.
QOF indicator CHOL004 reports the percentage of patients on the QOF CHD, PAD or
stroke/TIA register with the most recent cholesterol measurement in the preceding
12 months, showing as 2.0 mmol per litre or less if it was an LDL (low-density lipoprotein)
cholesterol reading or 2.6 mmol per litre or less if it was a non-HDL (high-density
lipoprotein) cholesterol reading.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (for example primary care services and secondary care services) ensure
that systems are in place for adults with CVD to achieve their lipid target, for example
ensuring that LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol can be measured, and that lipid-
lowering treatment can be offered.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses, doctors, and specialist nurses) are aware
of treatment targets for secondary prevention of CVD and offer adults with CVD treatment
with atorvastatin 80 mg, or other lipid-lowering treatment if required, to achieve the target.
They could use NHS England's summary of national guidance for lipid management. They
discuss lifestyle change with the patient at the same time. Treatment and any changes to
treatment should be made after an informed discussion between the healthcare
professional and the adult with CVD. They are aware of strategies to address adverse
effects of high-intensity statins if reported by the adult on a high-intensity statin and could
use NHS England's statin intolerance pathway to address statin intolerance. They repeat
measurement of LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol in adults with CVD after 2 to

 
3 months of treatment and consider escalation of treatment with alternative lipid-lowering
treatment if the target is not achieved.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which adults with CVD have
treatment to achieve their target lipid level.
Adults with CVD are aware of their target cholesterol level and receive treatment, and
advice on lifestyle changes, that lower their bad cholesterol (non-high-density lipoprotein
[non-HDL], which is mainly composed of low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) to a
level that reduces their chances of having a heart attack or stroke in the future after
discussion with their healthcare professional.
