Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guidance represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, health
professionals are expected to take this guidance fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients. The application of the
recommendations in this guidance is at the discretion of health professionals and their
individual patients and do not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to
make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation
with the patient and/or their carer or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to provide the funding required to
enable the guidance to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients
wish to use it, in accordance with the NHS Constitution. They should do so in light of their
duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance
equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
1 Recommendations
1.1 Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is recommended within its marketing authorisation, as an
option for preventing atherothrombotic events in adults with coronary artery
disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are at high risk of
ischaemic events.
1.2 For people with coronary artery disease, high risk of ischaemic events is defined
as:
• aged 65 or over, or
• atherosclerosis in at least 2 vascular territories (such as coronary,
cerebrovascular, or peripheral arteries), or
• 2 or more of the following risk factors:
－ current smoking
－ diabetes
－ kidney dysfunction with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of
less than 60 ml/min (note that rivaroxaban is contraindicated if the eGFR
is less than 15 ml/min)
－ heart failure
－ previous non-lacunar ischaemic stroke.
1.3 Assess the person's risk of bleeding before considering rivaroxaban. Treatment
should only be started after an informed discussion with them about the risks
and benefits of rivaroxaban, weighing up the risk of atherothrombotic events
against the risk of bleeding. The risks and benefits of continuing treatment with
rivaroxaban should be regularly reviewed.
Why the committee made these recommendations
People with chronic coronary artery disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease can
have atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
A clinical trial of people at high risk of ischaemic events shows that, compared with aspirin
alone, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduces the risk of having an ischaemic stroke, myocardial
infarction or dying from cardiovascular disease. However, it increases the risk of bleeding.
The benefits and risks of rivaroxaban plus aspirin are only known for the specific
population in the trial; that is, people at high risk of ischaemic events as defined by the
inclusion criteria of the trial. A person's risk of bleeding should be assessed before
rivaroxaban is considered. The decision to start treatment should be taken after an
informed discussion about the risks and benefits, weighing up the risk of ischaemic events
against the bleeding risk.
The cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban is within the range that is considered an acceptable
use of NHS resources. Aspirin plus rivaroxaban is therefore recommended as a treatment
option for people at high risk of having atherothrombotic events, who are not identified as
having an increased risk of bleeding.

3 Committee discussion
The appraisal committee considered evidence submitted by Bayer, a review of this
submission by the evidence review group (ERG), and the technical report developed
through engagement with stakeholders. See the committee papers for full details of the
evidence.
The appraisal committee was aware that several issues were resolved during the technical
engagement stage, and agreed that:
• It is more clinically plausible to substitute transition probability values used in the
economic model that were numerically zero with non-zero values taken from the
REACH registry.
• The company's economic model underestimates the effect of varying the stratified
mortality outcome 'cardiovascular death' in its sensitivity analyses. The company used
the hazard ratio (HR) value for 'all cardiovascular death' from the COMPASS trial and
assumed the same HR for all stratified death events in its model. Each mortality HR
was then varied separately in the deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
Because each death rate only included a small proportion of all cardiovascular deaths,
the effect of varying the HRs individually in the sensitivity analyses was
underestimated. This issue had no effect on the results of the base-case analysis and
only related to the uncertainty in the sensitivity analyses.
The committee recognised that there were remaining areas of uncertainty associated with
the analyses presented (see technical report, table 2, page 7), and took these into account
in its decision making. It discussed the following issues (issues 1, 2 and 3), which were
outstanding after the technical engagement stage.
Clinical need and current management
Patients rely on clinicians to discuss with them the benefits and
risks of treatment options
3.1 The patient expert explained that people with coronary or peripheral artery

Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
disease have serious concerns about the risk of having events such as heart
attack and stroke. They noted that coronary or peripheral artery disease is a
challenging condition requiring significant lifestyle adjustments, including diet and
exercise, which can affect the whole family. It is important that people
understand why they are being offered a dual therapy and how the drugs work,
because this can help with adherence to treatment. The patient expert explained
that patients rely on clinicians to discuss with them the best treatment options.
All options should be discussed, weighing up the potential benefits and risks of
potentially long-term medication. The committee concluded that patients rely on
clinicians to present the best treatment options to them, and all potential benefits
and risks should be fully discussed.
Patients would welcome an additional treatment option with an
acceptable benefit-risk ratio for the prevention of
atherothrombotic events
3.2 NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction: cardiac rehabilitation and prevention of
further cardiovascular disease (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute
coronary syndromes) recommends dual antiplatelet therapy for people who have
had an acute myocardial infarction. NICE's guideline on management of stable
angina recommends considering aspirin 75 mg daily for secondary prevention of
cardiovascular disease. NICE's technology appraisal guidance recommends
ticagrelor in combination with aspirin for preventing atherothrombotic events in
people who have had a myocardial infarction and are at high risk of a further
event. The clinical experts noted that despite widespread use of aspirin in both
acute and secondary care, the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and dying from
cardiovascular disease remains high for these patients. An additional treatment
option that could reduce this risk would be welcomed by patients. The potential
clinical benefit from treatment would need to be assessed, taking into
consideration the potential risk of major bleeding events. The committee
concluded that people with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease
would welcome an additional treatment option with an acceptable benefit-risk
ratio for the prevention of atherothrombotic events.

artery disease (TA607)
Clinical evidence
It is appropriate to consider the overall COMPASS population for
decision making
3.3 COMPASS is a double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing rivaroxaban plus
aspirin against aspirin alone in people with stable coronary artery disease or
peripheral artery disease who are at high risk of ischaemic events. The company
presented data for the overall trial population and also for 3 subpopulations that it
identified as being at especially high baseline risk of ischaemic events: people
with coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, people with coronary
artery disease and heart failure, and people with coronary artery disease and
poor kidney function. The risk of ischaemic events is related to the person's
medical history and the extent of atheroma. People with heart failure, diabetes,
poor kidney function or diffuse atherosclerosis affecting several areas (such as
the coronary and peripheral arteries) are at higher risk of events. However other
factors also increase risk including diabetes, high body mass index and smoking.
At technical engagement, it was queried whether the company's subgroups are
clinically relevant and represent people at highest risk of atherothrombotic events
who are likely to benefit most from treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin. The
clinical experts agreed that although these subgroups are clinically identifiable
and relevant, there are other groups of people who are also at high risk. These
include people who have had myocardial infarction or stroke, and those with
multi-vessel coronary disease and diabetes. These people could derive similar
benefit from rivaroxaban plus aspirin as seen in the 3 subgroups, because there
was no between-group heterogeneity in relative treatment effects reported in
COMPASS. The committee acknowledged the company's attempt to predict
people with higher baseline risk using the 3 subgroups but noted that although
the subgroups are illustrative of people at high risk, they do not identify all people
at highest absolute risk of ischaemic events. The clinical experts also highlighted
the difficulty in identifying people who are at greatest risk in clinical practice and
agreed that, because there is no inter-group difference in treatment effects in
COMPASS, the results from the overall population should be considered for
decision making. However, the committee was aware that, within the overall
eligible population, clinicians are likely to identify people at highest absolute risk
of ischaemic events and offer rivaroxaban to those who are likely to have the

artery disease (TA607)
highest potential absolute benefit. People at high risk of ischaemic events and no
known increased bleeding risk will have the most favourable benefit−risk profile.
The committee concluded that the efficacy results from the whole COMPASS
population should be considered rather than the 3 subpopulations identified by
the company, and it did not consider the subgroups further.
Rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular
events
3.4 The primary efficacy outcome in COMPASS was a composite of 3 major
cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and 'cardiovascular
death'. The committee noted that rivaroxaban plus aspirin showed a statistically
significant relative risk reduction of 24% in major cardiovascular events compared
with aspirin (HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.86; p<0.001). Two of
the individual components of the primary composite outcome also showed
statistically significant relative risk reductions in the treatment arm: 42% for
ischaemic stroke (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.76; p<0.001) and 22% for
cardiovascular death (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; p=0.02). The committee
concluded that rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events
compared with aspirin alone, and that the greatest effect is for ischaemic stroke.
Rivaroxaban plus aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding
3.5 The primary safety outcome in COMPASS was major bleeding based on a
modification of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)
criteria. Major bleeding was defined as a composite of fatal bleeding, and/or
symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ (such as intracranial, intraspinal,
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular or pericardial, intramuscular with
compartment syndrome, or bleeding into the surgical site requiring re-operation),
and/or bleeding leading to hospitalisation (with or without an overnight stay). The
risk of major bleeding, as defined by the modified ISTH criteria, increased by 70%
in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group compared with aspirin alone (HR 1.70, 95%
CI 1.40 to 2.05; p<0.001). The bleeds in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group were
mostly gastrointestinal, with non-significant differences for the other components
of the primary safety outcome. The committee concluded that rivaroxaban plus

Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone.
Rivaroxaban should only be used in people at high risk of
ischaemic events defined by the inclusion criteria of COMPASS
3.6 The clinical experts highlighted that COMPASS is a highly selected population
that includes people at high risk of ischaemic events but excludes people with a
known increased bleeding risk. The committee noted that the benefits and risks
of rivaroxaban plus aspirin are only known for the specific population of people in
COMPASS; that is, people with a high risk of ischaemic events as defined by the
inclusion criteria of the trial. The committee recalled that the clinical benefits and
risks associated with rivaroxaban plus aspirin are finely balanced (see section 3.4
and section 3.5). The committee noted that rivaroxaban plus aspirin is
contraindicated in cases of active clinically significant bleeding and in people with
lesions or conditions considered to be a significant risk factor for major bleeding.
It agreed that a person's risk of bleeding should be assessed before rivaroxaban
is considered as a treatment option. The decision to start treatment should only
be taken after an informed discussion about the risks and benefits of rivaroxaban,
weighing up the risk of ischaemic events against the bleeding risk. The
committee concluded that rivaroxaban should only be considered a treatment
option for people at high risk of ischaemic events as defined by the inclusion
criteria of COMPASS.
Comparators
Clopidogrel is not a relevant comparator for the overall COMPASS
population
3.7 The company did not present evidence for rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared
with clopidogrel. The clinical experts explained that clopidogrel is the preferred
antiplatelet treatment for people with peripheral artery disease (based on NICE's
technology appraisal guidance for the prevention of occlusive vascular events),
but it is not a relevant comparator for the whole COMPASS population. This is
because aspirin is the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of

--- Страница 12 ---
Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
cardiovascular disease in people with stable coronary artery disease, and
clopidogrel is only recommended when aspirin is unsuitable because of
contraindication or hypersensitivity. The committee concluded that clopidogrel is
not a relevant comparator for the overall COMPASS population and that it is
appropriate to base its recommendation on a comparison of rivaroxaban plus
aspirin with aspirin alone.
The indirect comparison of rivaroxaban against ticagrelor does
not provide reliable estimates of relative effectiveness or risk of
bleeding
3.8 To estimate the relative efficacy of rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with
ticagrelor plus aspirin, the company did an indirect treatment comparison of
COMPASS against data from another trial (PEGASUS). The ERG highlighted that
the indirect comparison is methodologically sound, but there are important
differences between the patients included in the 2 trials. The proportion of
people who had had a myocardial infarction was 100% in PEGASUS, but 62% in
COMPASS. Also, the time since a myocardial infarction was between 1 and
3 years in PEGASUS, but in COMPASS people could have had a myocardial
infarction at any time within the past 20 years. A clinical expert also noted that
people in PEGASUS and COMPASS did not necessarily have the same baseline
bleeding risk, and the trials used different methods to define significant bleeding
(modified ISTH in COMPASS and TIMI in PEGASUS), making it difficult to compare
the rates of bleeding in the 2 trials. The committee noted that the company did
not use the results of the indirect comparison in its economic model. It concluded
that COMPASS and PEGASUS have too many differences to allow a reliable
estimate of the relative efficacy or bleeding risk of rivaroxaban plus aspirin
compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin.
The company's economic model
The model is appropriate for decision making
3.9 The company modelled cost effectiveness using a Markov model with 5 states

Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral
artery disease (TA607)
(event-free, non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, intracranial
haemorrhage and death). These were subdivided into acute event (0 to 3 months
after an acute event), post-event (3 or more months after an acute event) and
second acute event. The efficacy and clinical parameters in the model were
derived from COMPASS for the comparison of rivaroxaban plus aspirin against
aspirin alone. For the comparison against ticagrelor plus aspirin, the results from
the indirect comparison of COMPASS and PEGASUS were not directly used to
inform the economic model. Instead, the model used HRs from the COMPASS and
PEGASUS trials, which the committee considered appropriate. The committee
concluded that the structure of the company's model is appropriate for decision
making.
Cost-effectiveness estimates
Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is cost effective compared with aspirin
alone
3.10 The company's base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for
rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone is £14,185 per quality-
adjusted life year gained. The committee noted that the ICER is in the range
normally considered cost effective and therefore concluded that rivaroxaban plus
aspirin is a cost-effective use of NHS resources in people who are at high risk of
ischaemic events as defined by the inclusion criteria of COMPASS (see
section 3.6).

4 Implementation
4.1 Section 7(6) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution
and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions)
Regulations 2013 requires clinical commissioning groups, NHS England and, with
respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the
recommendations in this appraisal within 3 months of its date of publication.
4.2 The Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on implementing
NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal
recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in
Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 2 months of the
first publication of the final appraisal document.
4.3 When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is
available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. This means that, if a
patient has coronary artery disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and
the healthcare professional responsible for their care thinks that rivaroxaban plus
aspirin is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's
recommendations.
