Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

each type of intervention). At current growth rates, the combined target will be reached by about 2005. 3 The technology 3.1 This appraisal is a review of previous NICE technology appraisal guidance on ischaemic heart disease – coronary artery stents (TA4) covering bare metal stent (BMS), and a new appraisal of drug-eluting stent (DES). BMS have already been described in section 2 as part of existing practice. The rest of this section is devoted to methods of reducing restenosis and, in particular, to the use of DES as a means of achieving this. 3.2 Methods of reducing restenosis include: coating the stent with an appropriate drug; introducing an emitter of radioactive particles at the stenting site (brachytherapy); and creating the slow release of a drug from the stent, making the stent 'drug-eluting'. For DES, the drug is held temporarily in place within a polymer 'painted' onto the metallic stent. Other than 1 trial (the ELUTES trial), there is little evidence in favour of coating the stent directly with an active drug (without a polymer); this technology, and brachytherapy, are outside the scope of this appraisal. 3.3 Although a number of drugs have been tested in the context of DES, only
