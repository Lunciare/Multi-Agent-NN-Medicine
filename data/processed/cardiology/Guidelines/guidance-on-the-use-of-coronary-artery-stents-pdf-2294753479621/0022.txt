whom the absolute differences in restenosis rates are greatest. 4.2.8 The addendum to the Assessment Report showed that, for single-vessel disease, PCI using a DES was estimated to be cost-saving compared with PCI using a BMS at 12 months for patients with diabetes and long lesions; the estimated cost per QALY for patients without diabetes and long lesions was £15,000 and, for all patients with narrow vessels, it was £16,000. These estimates were derived from patient-level data derived from the TAXUS II trial. For the total population of patients with single-vessel disease, the cost per QALY was £94,000. This estimate was derived from registry data. 4.2.9 These estimates are sensitive to 5 factors: • the percentage point reduction in the risk of revascularisation • the price differential between BMS and DES • the proportion of repeat interventions needing CABG • the disutility caused by recurrent symptoms • the average waiting time for repeat intervention. 4.2.10 There are no RCT data for 2-vessel disease. The estimated incremental cost per QALY for 2-vessel disease gained from PCI using a DES compared with PCI using a BMS for all non-diabetic patients is £195,000. This estimate is derived from registry data. 4.3 Consideration of
