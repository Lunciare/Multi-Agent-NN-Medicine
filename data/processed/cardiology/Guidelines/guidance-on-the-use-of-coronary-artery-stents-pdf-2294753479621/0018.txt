Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

with diabetes as a whole was higher than for the non-diabetes group, but the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, the analysis did not control for artery calibre or length. 4.1.15.5 According to the joint professional submission, for every 10 mm increase in the length of the stent, the difference in restenosis rate between a Cypher DES and Cypher BMS increased by between 1 and 1.6 percentage points. 4.2 Cost effectiveness 4.2.1 The most recent evidence of cost effectiveness comes from models supplied by 4 manufacturers and 1 from the Assessment Group, including an addendum. The manufacturer models show that PCIs with a BMS are cost effective compared with PCIs without stents and also compared with CABG. However, these models are relatively short-run, ranging from 6 months to 2 years. The manufacturers of the Cypher and of the Taxus stents each provided a model which examined the cost effectiveness of their own DES compared with the corresponding BMS. Each of these models showed that the DES is cost effective compared with the corresponding BMS. The Assessment Group's model showed that the Cypher and Taxus stents, as a group, are cost effective compared with BMS. PCI with BMS versus PCI
