Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

disease, resulting from the narrowing of coronary arteries ('stenosis') caused by deposition of atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary artery stenosis may be asymptomatic or may lead to angina, a chest pain that may be severe enough to restrict or prevent exertion. A critical reduction of the blood supply to the heart may result in MI or death. 2.2 CAD causes about 2,100 deaths annually per million of the population in England and Wales (about 110,000 deaths in total), 1 of the highest rates in the world. CAD is also the cause of considerable morbidity and loss of ability to lead a normal life. Approximately 1.4 million people in England and Wales suffer from angina, the most common form of such morbidity. 2.3 Stenotic lesions are categorised as A, B1, B2 and C. A denotes a relatively short (less than 10 mm) and easily accessible lesion. C denotes lesions that: are relatively long (greater than 20 mm); may be less accessible, tortuous and/or have side branches; and may be totally occluded. 2.4 CAD may affect 1 or more arteries, which may be of different calibres. Occlusion may be partial or total. 2.5 The symptoms and health risks that are associated with a stenosed
