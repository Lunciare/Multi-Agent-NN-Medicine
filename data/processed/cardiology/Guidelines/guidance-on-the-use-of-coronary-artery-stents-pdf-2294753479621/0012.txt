Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

of PCI with BMS has significant advantages over the use of PCI without stents, in terms of lower rates of restenosis at 6 and 12 months. 4.1.6 According to the joint professional submission, the likelihood of restenosis is greater in small vessels, because a given tissue regrowth will have a greater proportionate effect in a vessel of smaller calibre. In 8 out of 9 studies that looked at vessels of a small calibre (less than 3 mm), restenosis rates were lower in the BMS arm than in the PCI without stent arm, and in 2 of these studies, the difference was statistically significant. A meta-analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for PCI with BMS. However, restenosis rates were still high in this group. 4.1.7 According to the joint professional submission, the restenosis rate increased by an estimated 8 to 13 percentage points with every 10-mm increase in the length of BMS required. PCI with BMS versus CABG 4.1.8 There were 6 RCTs in the meta-analysis. None of the trials involved a DES. 4.1.9 For single-vessel disease, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different at 6 months' follow-up in 2 trials involving a total of 300 patients: 12.6% for CABG versus
