between DES and BMS for people with diabetes is not statistically significantly different from that of people without diabetes. 4.1.15 Sirolimus-eluting stents 4.1.15.1 The MACE rate for PCIs using a sirolimus DES (Cypher and non-CE-marked stents) was not statistically significantly lower at 36 days, but it was lower at 9 months and at 1 year; at 9 months the rate was 7.4% for DES versus 18.9% for BMS (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47), and at 1 year it was 7.8% for DES versus 21.8% for BMS (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.43). Most of the MACE events refer to restenosis. The trials of the Cypher sirolimus DES (which has a CE mark) showed a statistically significantly lower MACE rate compared with trials of BMS at 9 months (OR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45), 12 months (OR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.43), and 24 months (OR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.97). 4.1.15.2 Sirolimus-eluting stents in general have not been shown to have either a mortality or acute MI advantage over BMS in trials, and neither do the DES within the subset of Cypher stent trials. 4.1.15.3 According to the joint professional submission, in larger arteries,
