Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

For disease in a single artery, PCI with a stent has been the more frequent treatment; for disease in 2 arteries, patient numbers for PCI with a stent and CABG have been similar; and for more than 2 affected arteries, CABG has been used much more frequently. 2.9 The major problem with PCI is restenosis of the artery, which has 3 main causes. The first, recoil of the artery, happens when the balloon is deflated. It usually occurs immediately or within 24 hours of completion of the procedure, and may require emergency CABG. Stents essentially eliminate recoil of the artery. The 2 subsequent problems, mostly arising during the first 6 months, are contraction of the adventitia secondary to an injury reaction (3 to 6 months), and proliferation of smooth muscle cells within the arterial wall (4 to 6 months). A repeat procedure is consequently required in approximately 20% of patients with simple lesions. This rate of reintervention is much higher (up to 50%) for arteries of small calibre, saphenous vein grafts, long lesions, total occlusions and in people with diabetes. 2.10 Recent advances in stent technology have reduced some of the problems of restenosis, as well as lowering the cost
