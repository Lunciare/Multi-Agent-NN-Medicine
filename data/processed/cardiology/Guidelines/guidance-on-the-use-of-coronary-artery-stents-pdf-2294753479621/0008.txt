Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

drug (without a polymer); this technology, and brachytherapy, are outside the scope of this appraisal. 3.3 Although a number of drugs have been tested in the context of DES, only 3 have been granted CE (Conformite Europeene) marking for use within EU countries: paclitaxel, which inhibits cell division, elutes from the Taxus stent; sirolimus (previously known as rapamycin), an immunosuppressive agent that reduces inflammation, elutes from the Cypher stent; and dexamethasone, a synthetic adrenocortical steroid that reduces inflammation, elutes from the BiodivYsio stent. These drugs may elute at different rates, depending on the presence or absence of additional polymer coatings on the stent. Because the performance of a DES depends critically on the particular drug being used, each DES should be regarded as a separate technology. However, as yet, studies directly comparing different DES have not been performed. 3.4 Both types of stent (BMS and DES) require the use of an antiplatelet drug in addition to aspirin. Such drugs should be used after the implantation of a stent, in accordance with the device-specific instructions for use (IFU). 3.5 List prices for both BMS and DES differ between manufacturers, and some manufacturers produce more than 1 stent in each class, at
