Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

Taxus DES stent (which has a CE mark), involving 583 patients, yielded a statistically significantly lower MACE rate at 6 months: 7.2% for DES versus 18.4% for BMS (OR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.59); and at 12 months: 9.7% for DES versus 20.5% for BMS (OR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67). 4.1.14.2 Paclitaxel DES have not been demonstrated to show an advantage over BMS in either mortality or prevention of MI. However, in a series of trials of the Taxus stent (the TAXUS trials), the MI rate for PCIs using a paclitaxel DES was statistically significantly lower at 6 months: 1.7% for DES versus 5.9% for BMS (OR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.99). The statistical significance of this result was not maintained at 12 months: 2.8% for DES versus 5.8% for BMS (OR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.23 to 1.37). 4.1.14.3 Multivariate analysis of data from the TAXUS trials shows that once the effect of small-calibre arteries and long lesions has been allowed for, the difference in performance between DES and BMS for people with diabetes is not statistically significantly different from that of people without diabetes. 4.1.15 Sirolimus-eluting stents 4.1.15.1 The MACE rate for PCIs using a
