PCI procedures were undertaken in the UK in 2001, equating to 663 per million of the population – a rate that had increased at an average of 14% per year over the previous 10 years. The rate for the UK remains below that of the European Union (EU) average, which exceeds 1,000 per million of the population. 2.14 In the UK, the proportion of PCI procedures using stents rose steeply between 1993 and 1999, from below 10% to nearly 80%. It has continued to increase, although more slowly, to about 85% in 2001. 2.15 The number of CABG procedures performed each year in the UK has increased from 15,700 in 1991 to 24,700 in 1999 to 2000, or from 292 to 464 per million of the population. The rate of increase has slowed since the first half of the 1990s. 2.16 The National Service Framework for Coronary heart Disease target, set in March 2000 for revascularisations (PCIs and CABGs), is at least 1,500 per million of the population (750 for each type of intervention). At current growth rates, the combined target will be reached by about 2005. 3 The technology 3.1 This appraisal is a review of previous NICE technology
