This estimate is derived from registry data. 4.3 Consideration of the evidence 4.3.1 The Committee reviewed the evidence available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of PCIs using a BMS and DES, having considered evidence on the nature of the condition and the value placed by users on the benefits of BMS and DES from clinical experts and those who represent patients with angina. It was also mindful of the need to ensure that its advice took account of the efficient use of NHS resources. PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents 4.3.2 The Committee considered that no new evidence had been found since the previous appraisal to change its view that where PCI is being undertaken, the use of stents is likely to be both clinically and cost effective. BMS versus DES 4.3.3 The Committee noted that there were no head-to-head trials of the sirolimus- eluting Cypher stent and the paclitaxel-eluting Taxus stent, and the clinical experts advised that there was no evidence that would allow them to favour 1 of these drug-eluting agents over the other. 4.3.4 The
