Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

compared with the corresponding BMS. The Assessment Group's model showed that the Cypher and Taxus stents, as a group, are cost effective compared with BMS. PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents 4.2.2 For patients with moderate or severe angina, PCI has been shown to be a cost- effective alternative to conventional medical treatment. Since the previous appraisal in 2000 of PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents, several further studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of stents in a number of patient populations and clinical settings, including elective stenting and stenting immediately following an acute MI. PCI with BMS versus CABG 4.2.3 Comparative data on PCI using BMS versus CABG are available for only 3 years of follow-up. There are no data beyond 3 years and little data from years 2 to 3. The best available data are up to 2 years. Long-term models are needed to determine cost effectiveness because most patients who have stents fitted live longer than 5 years, and it is impossible to give a proper answer to the question of cost effectiveness by taking a short-term perspective. 4.2.4 The Assessment Group's model extrapolates the results to 5 years based on the currently available 3-year
