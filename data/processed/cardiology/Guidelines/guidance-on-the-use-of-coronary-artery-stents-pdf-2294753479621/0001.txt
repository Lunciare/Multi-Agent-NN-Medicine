1 Recommendations 1.1 Stents should be used routinely when percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the clinically appropriate procedure for people with stable angina. For recommendations on drug-eluting stents for people with unstable angina, non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), see recommendation 1.1.18 and recommendation 1.2.18 in NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2020] 1.2 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease. [2008] 1.3 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease. [2008] 1.4 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease. [2008] 1.5 This guidance specifically relates to the present clinical indications for PCI and excludes conditions (such as many cases of stable angina) that are adequately managed with standard drug therapy. [2003] 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 CAD is by far the most common cause of heart disease, resulting from the narrowing of coronary arteries ('stenosis') caused by deposition of atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary artery stenosis may be asymptomatic or may lead to angina, a chest pain that
