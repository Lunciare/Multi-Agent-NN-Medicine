Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

or acute MI advantage over BMS in trials, and neither do the DES within the subset of Cypher stent trials. 4.1.15.3 According to the joint professional submission, in larger arteries, PCIs using a sirolimus DES have shown very low rates of restenosis, approaching zero. In small-calibre arteries, PCIs using a sirolimus DES have shown lower rates of restenosis than PCIs using a BMS (for example, 7% versus 20% restenosis at 9 months in the SIRIUS trial for vessels of mean calibre 2.3 mm). 4.1.15.4 In patients with diabetes and those with longer lesions, rates of restenosis following PCIs using a sirolimus DES have been higher than those of the 'average' patient, but still much lower than following PCIs using the BMS control. Subsequent post hoc subgroup analysis from 1 of the manufacturers from a trial involving patients who received a DES was considered by the Committee. The analysis compared the restenosis rate for people with diabetes with that for people without diabetes. It showed that the restenosis rate for those with diabetes as a whole was higher than for the non-diabetes group, but the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, the analysis did not control for artery calibre or
