with the device-specific instructions for use (IFU). 3.5 List prices for both BMS and DES differ between manufacturers, and some manufacturers produce more than 1 stent in each class, at different prices. Prices for BMS range from about £600 to £900 and for DES from about £1,300 to £1,500 per stent. For bare-metal and drug-eluting stents that are the same apart from their drug-eluting properties, the difference in cost is about £500 to £600. Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts. 4 Evidence and interpretation The Appraisal Committee considered evidence from a number of sources. 4.1 Clinical effectiveness 4.1.1 The Assessment Report presents 3 sets of comparison: PCI without stents versus PCI with BMS; PCI with BMS versus CABG; and BMS versus DES. 4.1.2 Assessment of the relative clinical effectiveness of stents considers the likelihood of restenosis discovered on follow-up and the requirement for repeat intervention (revascularisation). Repeat intervention may occur: (i) because of a requirement of the trial protocol, specifying a repeat angiographic examination at a predetermined interval (so-called 'protocol-driven' reintervention); or (ii) following a recurrence of symptomatic angina in the patient (that is, 'clinically driven' reintervention). The frequency of protocol-driven reinterventions is higher than
