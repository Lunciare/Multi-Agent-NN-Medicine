Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

a DES. 4.1.9 For single-vessel disease, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different at 6 months' follow-up in 2 trials involving a total of 300 patients: 12.6% for CABG versus 25.8% for PCI with BMS (OR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.74). The higher MACE rate for PCI with BMS reflects the higher rate of restenosis following this procedure. 4.1.10 For multiple-vessel disease, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different at 12 months' follow-up in 2 trials involving a total of 2,300 patients: 12.3% for CABG versus 24.5% for PCI with BMS (OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.54). 4.1.11 At 36 days' follow-up, the rate of acute MIs was statistically significantly lower following PCI with BMS, but the difference between the 2 procedures was not statistically significant at 6 and 12 months. 4.1.12 No statistically significant differences were reported for deaths, because the trials were not powered to detect differences in these uncommon events. BMS versus DES 4.1.13 There were 12 RCTs comparing BMS with DES. Of these, 7 involved paclitaxel, 4 sirolimus, 1 everolimus and 1 actinomycin stents. The first 2 sets of trials (paclitaxel and sirolimus) are considered separately below, and the last 2 trials have not
