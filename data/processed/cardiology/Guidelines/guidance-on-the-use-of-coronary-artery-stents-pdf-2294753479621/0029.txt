In none of the cases considered was there sufficient evidence of effect to be able to reach any conclusion. 5 Recommendations for further research 5.1 Ongoing trials for paclitaxel-eluting stents include TAXUS I (follow-up of a small initial study of slow-release formulation versus BMS in patients with either previously untreated lesions or restenosis), TAXUS II (follow-up of a larger study of both slow- and moderate-release formulations versus BMS in patients with previously untreated lesions), TAXUS IV (a large trial of slow-release formulation versus BMS stratified by presence or absence of diabetes and by vessel diameter), TAXUS V (focussing on small vessels, long lesions, bifurcations and in- stent restenosis) and TAXUS VI (moderate release for long lesions). For sirolimus- eluting stents, ongoing trials include RAVEL (small-diameter vessels), SIRIUS (high risk for cardiovascular disease progression and restenosis due to the diabetes, exposure to multiple stent implantation and use of overlapping stents) and E-SIRIUS (previously untreated single vessels of diameter 2.5 to 3 mm and for lesions between 15 and 32 mm in length); and FUTURE (previously untreated vessels between 2.75 and 4 mm, less than 28 mm long) for everolimus-eluting stents.
