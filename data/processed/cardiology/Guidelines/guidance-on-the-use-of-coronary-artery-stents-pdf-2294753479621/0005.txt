Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

grafts, long lesions, total occlusions and in people with diabetes. 2.10 Recent advances in stent technology have reduced some of the problems of restenosis, as well as lowering the cost of stents. In addition, the use of antiplatelet drugs and other therapeutic strategies to prevent thrombosis have improved long-term outcomes. 2.11 One of the main criteria for assessing the clinical effectiveness of PTCA with stents compared with standard PTCA (without stents) is the ability to reduce the incidence of subsequent attacks of angina as well as major adverse coronary events (MACE), which include death, MI and the need for further revascularisation procedures (CABG or repeat PCI). 2.12 Patients for whom both a CABG and a PCI involving stenting are appropriate techniques would, other things being equal, choose PCI in almost all cases, even though the chances of restenosis are greater. This is because the procedure is less invasive, has a lower chance of death during the operation, and involves a much shorter and less painful recuperation time. 2.13 Approximately 39,000 PCI procedures were undertaken in the UK in 2001, equating to 663 per million of the population – a rate that had increased at an average of 14% per year
