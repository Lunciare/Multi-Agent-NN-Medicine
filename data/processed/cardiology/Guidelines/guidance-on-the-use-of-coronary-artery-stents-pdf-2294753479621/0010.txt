a predetermined interval (so-called 'protocol-driven' reintervention); or (ii) following a recurrence of symptomatic angina in the patient (that is, 'clinically driven' reintervention). The frequency of protocol-driven reinterventions is higher than that of clinically driven reinterventions, because angiography is usually mandatory at 6 months in the trial protocol whereas in clinical practice it is carried out only after recurrence of symptoms. Accordingly, the absolute differences observed between the treatment and control arms of clinical trials are likely to be higher than would be expected to occur in clinical practice. PCI with BMS versus PCI (without stents) 4.1.3 Fifty randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were analysed comparing the use of PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents. Because of differences in, and completeness of, the reporting of these trials, the number of trials on which meta-analyses are based is a subset of these 50 trials. In a meta-analysis comprising 12 trials involving 5,700 patients with non-specified ischaemic heart disease, where a composite endpoint of revascularisation, MI or death (MACE) was reported, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different at 6 months' follow-up: 23.0% for the PCI without stents group versus 15.4% for the PCI with BMS group, with an odds ratio (OR) of
