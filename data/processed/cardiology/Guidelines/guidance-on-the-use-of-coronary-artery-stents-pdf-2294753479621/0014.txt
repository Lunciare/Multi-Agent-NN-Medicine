involved paclitaxel, 4 sirolimus, 1 everolimus and 1 actinomycin stents. The first 2 sets of trials (paclitaxel and sirolimus) are considered separately below, and the last 2 trials have not been considered here because they involved products that have not been granted CE marking. No RCT for the third DES with a CE mark (eluting dexamethasone) has yet been reported. 4.1.14 Paclitaxel-eluting stents 4.1.14.1 Based on 4 trials with a paclitaxel DES (Taxus and non-CE-marked stents), involving almost 1,000 patients, the MACE rate for PCIs using a paclitaxel DES was not statistically significantly lower at 36 days or at 1 year, but it was statistically significantly lower at 6 months: 7.4% for DES versus 15.4% for BMS (OR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.73). From a random effects model (which takes account of heterogeneity of results between trials), the 6-month data for the MACE rate were not statistically significant (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.43). Most of the MACE events refer to restenosis. However, the 2 trials of the Taxus DES stent (which has a CE mark), involving 583 patients, yielded a statistically significantly lower MACE rate at 6 months: 7.2% for DES versus 18.4% for BMS (OR 0.35;
