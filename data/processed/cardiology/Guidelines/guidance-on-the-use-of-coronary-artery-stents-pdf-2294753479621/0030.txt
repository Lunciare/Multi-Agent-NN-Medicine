Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

between 15 and 32 mm in length); and FUTURE (previously untreated vessels between 2.75 and 4 mm, less than 28 mm long) for everolimus-eluting stents. REALITY, a head-to-head trial of the Cypher sirolimus DES and Taxus paclitaxel DES, is under way. 5.2 Until now, trials have been restricted to single-artery studies for the sake of simplicity and ease of interpretation. Extrapolation of results to more than 1 artery critically depends on untested assumptions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the use of DES in more than 1 artery concurrently are therefore required, in order to confirm or refute the appropriateness of the extrapolations used in the modelling. 5.3 To compare long-term outcomes, particularly with respect to stents against CABG, much longer trial follow-ups are required. 5.4 New BMS designs should be tested against current BMS and DES designs. 5.5 Head-to-head RCTs of those DES that have been CE marked and have been shown to be clinically superior to the corresponding BMS are required. 5.6 Studies to determine whether diabetes is a risk factor for increased rate of restenosis following PCI, independent of lesion length and artery calibre, are required. Much of this work could be performed by an analysis of patient-level
