Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

Committee considered that this evidence was not sufficient to affect its recommendations in section 1. It would, however, wish to include further evidence on new developments in BMS design as part of the next review of the use of coronary stents. PCI with BMS versus CABG 4.3.10 Having reviewed the Assessment Group's model and the submissions from manufacturers, together with the views of cardiologist consultees, the Committee concluded that the guidance offered in 2000 should be maintained. While it was clear that models with outcomes up to 2 years favoured stents in terms of cost effectiveness, the conclusions to be drawn from longer-term models depended critically on whether a survival advantage accrues to CABG. The Committee concluded that no convincing case had been made on this matter. Its considerations ranged over what may happen to patients requiring 1 or other of these procedures in different age ranges, and whether the conclusions about the most appropriate procedure would be the same for younger patients (who are more likely to need a repeat procedure) as for older ones. In none of the cases considered was there sufficient evidence of effect to be able to reach any conclusion. 5 Recommendations for further research
