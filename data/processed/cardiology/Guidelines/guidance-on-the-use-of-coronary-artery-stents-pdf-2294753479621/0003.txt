Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents

may affect 1 or more arteries, which may be of different calibres. Occlusion may be partial or total. 2.5 The symptoms and health risks that are associated with a stenosed artery may be treated medically – by modification of risk factors (for example, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and hyperglycaemia) and/or by drug treatment (for example, beta-adrenergic blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet agents and statins). 2.6 If these medical treatments fail or are inappropriate, 2 invasive therapies are available. The first, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), involves major cardiac surgery. The second, so-called balloon angioplasty, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), involves a non-surgical widening from within the artery using a balloon catheter. When inflated, the balloon increases the calibre of the artery. 2.7 Recently, most PTCA procedures have involved the use of stents. Stents are thin wire-mesh structures that act as permanent prosthetic linings to keep the artery inflated and maintain its patency. PCI is a generic term to encompass PTCA with or without adjunct techniques such as stenting. 2.8 For disease in a single artery, PCI with a stent has been the more frequent treatment; for disease in 2 arteries, patient numbers for PCI with a stent and CABG
