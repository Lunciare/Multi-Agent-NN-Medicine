without a grey zone) led to slightly more revascularisations compared with FFR (40.2% revascularisations using FFR compared with 42.0% for QAngio QFR and 43.2% using the grey-zone strategy). Both methods prevented broadly the same number of major adverse cardiovascular events (FFR may prevent more major adverse cardiovascular events but only for 1 in 1,000 people). However, the committee noted that the simulation study made numerous assumptions, so its results were uncertain. Clinical outcome data from large endpoint studies for QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are needed 4.8 The clinical experts noted the lack of prospective outcome data when a QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR-based approach was used to guide revascularisation decisions after invasive coronary angiography. The clinical experts explained that there was a need for clinical outcome data from large endpoint studies comparing these imaging software with FFR or invasive coronary angiography-guided treatment. There are already multiple tests in the care pathway, and it was unclear how QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR could offer additional clinical benefit. There are currently 2 ongoing clinical trials of QAngio QFR. The FAVOR III Europe- Japan study will compare QFR with standard FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention, and the FAVOR III China study will compare
