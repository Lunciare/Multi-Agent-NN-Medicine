The estimates suggest that, compared with FFR and iFR, CAAS vFFR is less cost effective and QAngio QFR is slightly cheaper but less clinically effective. There are multiple tests in use that assess coronary stenosis and it is not clear what clinical benefits QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR offer over these. Therefore, QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are not recommended for use in the NHS, and further research is recommended. 2 The diagnostic tests Clinical need and practice 2.1 Angina is chest pain caused by insufficient blood supply to the heart (myocardial ischaemia). Stable angina is brought on by physical activity or emotional stress and goes away with rest. It is the key symptom of coronary artery disease, which is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in economically developed countries. 2.2 Options for managing stable angina include lifestyle advice, drug treatment and revascularisation using percutaneous (stent placement during percutaneous coronary intervention) or surgical techniques (such as coronary artery bypass surgery). Choosing the appropriate management option relies on correctly detecting and characterising coronary stenosis. Therefore, the diagnostic pathway for stable angina: • confirms a diagnosis of stable angina • defines the severity of coronary stenosis, which provides prognostic
