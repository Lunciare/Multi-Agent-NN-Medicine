identifying the appropriateness for revascularisation, the tests can have health benefits through greater symptom relief and, therefore, higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Because the base-case analysis assumed that there was no treatment effect of revascularisation on major adverse cardiovascular events, the improvement in symptom relief was the only benefit. The HRQoL effects of revascularisation were based on the FAME trials. Both were randomised, parallel, open-label clinical trials. FAME I compared invasive coronary angiography with FFR for guiding percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. FAME II compared clinical outcomes, safety and cost effectiveness of FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention with optimal medical treatment alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease. These trials showed that HRQoL improved significantly from baseline after percutaneous coronary intervention. 3.46 In the diagnostic model a one-off procedural disutility was applied for people having invasive FFR or iFR and for those who had revascularisation. In the prognostic model, a one-off utility decrement was also applied for people who had a non-fatal myocardial infarction or needed an unplanned revascularisation. A separate utility decrement was applied to the post-myocardial infarction health state, to reflect a decrease in HRQoL for those with a history of myocardial
