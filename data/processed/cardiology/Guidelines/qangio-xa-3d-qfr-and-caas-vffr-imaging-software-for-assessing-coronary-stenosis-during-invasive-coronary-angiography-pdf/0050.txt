rates in clinical practice would be beneficial (see research recommendation 5.2). QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are more cost effective than invasive coronary angiography alone, but the results are uncertain 4.11 In the base case QAngio QFR was within the range NICE considers cost effective compared with invasive coronary angiography alone in both the deterministic and probabilistic analyses. However, the clinical experts commented that the strategy of invasive coronary angiography alone was not representative of clinical practice, where the results of previous tests and people's preferences would also influence a treatment decision (see section 4.6). The committee noted that similar results were seen for CAAS vFFR but concluded that there was greater uncertainty in this result because of the lack of diagnostic accuracy evidence. More data are needed because the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are uncertain 4.12 Compared with the reference standard of FFR or iFR, QAngio QFR (with and without a grey zone) and CAAS vFFR were less cost effective (generated less quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] but were slightly cheaper) in the base-case analysis. However, the committee noted that a review of the accuracy of FFR or iFR was not done by
