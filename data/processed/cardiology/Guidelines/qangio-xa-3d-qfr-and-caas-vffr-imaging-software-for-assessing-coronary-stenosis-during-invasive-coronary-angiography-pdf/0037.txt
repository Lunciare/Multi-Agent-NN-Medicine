the largest study of vFFR (330 patients). Using accuracy estimates from ILUMIEN I reduced the cost effectiveness of vFFR, but estimates from Jin et al. (2019) increased it. This resulted in vFFR being the second most cost-effective strategy. This highlighted the substantial uncertainty surrounding the cost effectiveness of vFFR in strategy 5. 3.55 When QAngio QFR was considered to have the same diagnostic accuracy as FFR (that is, 100% sensitivity and specificity), the total QALYs and costs for strategy 3 increased by 0.017 QALYs and £6 per person from the base-case scenario. In this scenario strategy 3 became cost effective with the highest net health benefit, largely because of greater total QALYs gained for strategy 3 compared with strategy 2. This difference was mainly because of the procedural disutility associated with FFR or iFR. 3.56 When the procedural disutility of FFR was more than that used in the base case, the net health benefit of strategies 2 and 4 were affected most. The total QALYs for both strategies were reduced, resulting in strategy 2 becoming the second least cost effective and strategy 3 the most cost effective. An FFR disutility of 0.014 QALYs resulted in an equal net health benefit
