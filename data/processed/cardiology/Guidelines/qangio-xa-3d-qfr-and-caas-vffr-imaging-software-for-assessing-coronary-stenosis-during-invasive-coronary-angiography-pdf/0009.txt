other eligible outcomes. Seventeen of the studies were conference abstracts only, 15 of which were included in the diagnostic accuracy review. 3.2 Fifteen of the studies were done in multiple centres. Most studies were done in Asia, including 33 with sites in Japan, 5 in China, 4 in South Korea and 1 site in Singapore. A total of 22 studies had sites in Europe, 3 of which were in the UK. Two of the studies had sites in the US and 2 separate single studies had sites in Brazil and Australia. 3.3 Of the 22 QAngio QFR studies, 11 were at low risk of bias. The main source of bias was related to patient selection. The EAG also noted concerns that a high number of studies had been done retrospectively (offline use of QAngio QFR) rather than as part of invasive coronary angiography and before FFR. 3.4 Of the CAAS vFFR studies, all did CAAS vFFR analyses retrospectively (offline), and 2 were done at a single centre. Only the ILUMIEN I study had a full text manuscript. This study was considered at high risk of selection bias because of the large percentage of lesions excluded. Diagnostic test accuracy CAAS vFFR
