This reduces the need for multiple hospital visits, which has the potential to reduce people's anxiety. A clinical expert explained that according to 2017 to 2018 data from the National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, around 35,000 invasive coronary angiography procedures were done in diagnostic-only settings, compared with around 205,000 in interventional centres. The committee concluded that the future role of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR in a diagnostic-only setting is unclear because diagnostic- only catheter laboratories are likely to decline in number. QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are not recommended for routine use 4.14 The committee noted that QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR were more cost effective than invasive coronary angiography alone. QAngio QFR using the proposed annual licence was slightly cheaper but less clinically effective than FFR or iFR. However, the incremental difference in terms of costs and QALYs between the tests was small. For CAAS vFFR, the committee recalled that the diagnostic accuracy data was highly uncertain so it could not be recommended for routine use. The committee noted further that there were no clinical outcome studies for QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR, which meant that the EAG had to make assumptions about treatment decisions and clinical
