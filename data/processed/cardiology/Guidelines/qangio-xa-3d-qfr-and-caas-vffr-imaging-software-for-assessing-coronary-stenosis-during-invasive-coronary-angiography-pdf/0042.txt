review in the diagnostics assessment report. These included 5,440 patients. These studies showed that QAngio QFR had good diagnostic accuracy to predict the FFR result. The clinical experts explained that there was good agreement between QFR and FFR values particularly at the extremes of measurement. While there was some disagreement between QFR and FFR results within the grey zone, (in the range of 0.78 to 0.84), the clinical experts noted that there is likely to be a limited clinical effect of not identifying someone with an FFR of between 0.76 and 0.80, that is, a false negative result. A more significant effect could occur for people with an FFR result of less than 0.76 who have a negative result on QAngio QFR (0.80 or higher). The EAG noted that modelling suggested around 3% of people with an FFR result of less than 0.76 would be misdiagnosed if using QFR for functional imaging. Clinical experts also explained that with FFR values close to the 0.80 cut-off, it is unclear whether there is any added benefit of revascularisation compared to optimal medical therapy. The committee concluded that there was good agreement between QAngio QFR and FFR values. Although there was some uncertainty
