assumption may not accurately reflect the actual side effects or people's experiences of the procedure. The EAG also looked at different scenario analyses where the disutility of FFR was increased. The committee commented that a disutility equivalent to percutaneous coronary intervention was likely too high. This affected the cost effectiveness of FFR more than might be expected in clinical practice. It noted further that there were important differences between FFR and iFR that were considered the same in the model. Because iFR does not need a hyperaemic agent such as adenosine, it avoids the associated unpleasant side effects. This disutility was a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results, but because of a lack of evidence it was uncertain what disutility should be used. The committee recommended further research into the disutility associated with FFR (see research recommendation 5.1). Test costs may not be accurate because test failure rates are not adequately captured in the model 4.10 Test failure rates were high in the studies, especially the retrospective ones, because the invasive coronary angiography images were not good enough to run QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR. The committee noted that in clinical practice some images may not be of a sufficient
