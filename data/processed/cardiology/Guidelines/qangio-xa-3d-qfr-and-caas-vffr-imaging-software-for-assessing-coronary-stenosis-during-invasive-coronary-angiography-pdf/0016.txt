3.16 QFR, as measured by QAngio, was highly correlated with FFR (r=0.80). In 50% of people, QFR and FFR differed by no more than 0.04. In 95% of people, values differed by no more than 0.14. Grey-zone analysis 3.17 In the grey-zone analysis: • If QAngio QFR is more than 0.84: continue without stenting or bypass and defer FFR (test negative). • If QAngio QFR is 0.78 or less: proceed directly to stenting or bypass without FFR (test positive). • If QAngio QFR is between 0.78 and 0.84: do an FFR and proceed based on that result (at 0.80 cut-off). 3.18 This strategy increased diagnostic accuracy compared with using QAngio QFR alone. The sensitivity was 93.1% (95% CI 90.1% to 94.9%) and the specificity was 92.1% (95% CI 88.3% to 94.5%). A total of 20.1% of people were in the grey zone and would have confirmatory FFR. However, only 30.4% of people with QAngio QFR results in the grey zone had results that differed from their FFR. Invasive coronary angiography 3.19 The EAG identified 5 studies included in the meta-analysis that also reported 2 x 2 table data on the diagnostic accuracy of using 2D or 3D invasive coronary angiography
