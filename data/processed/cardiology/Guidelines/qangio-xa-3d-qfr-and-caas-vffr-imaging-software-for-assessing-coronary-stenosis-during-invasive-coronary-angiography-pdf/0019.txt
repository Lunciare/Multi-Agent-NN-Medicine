of CAAS vFFR). Variability 3.24 There were 8 studies that reported outcomes data on reproducibility of QAngio QFR readings between 2 different analysts (inter-observer variability). QAngio QFR was found to have a moderate to high level of inter-observer reliability. In 2 studies, CAAS vFFR was also found to have a high level of inter-observer reliability. 3.25 There were 8 retrospective studies that reported outcomes data on intra- observer reproducibility of QAngio QFR readings. The time gap between initial and repeated measurements was reported in 4 studies and ranged from 3 days to 2 weeks. Most studies reported a high level of intra-observer reliability for QAngio QFR. One study evaluated both QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR and found high levels of repeatability and no statistically significant changes between repeated tests. Timing 3.26 There were 6 studies of QAngio QFR that reported the time needed to complete QFR analysis. Time to QFR data acquisition ranged from an average of 2 minutes and 7 seconds to 10 minutes (standard deviation 3 minutes). One study of 268 patients reported that time to image acquisition significantly decreased with the number of invasive coronary angiographies analysed, from 5 minutes and 59 seconds to 2 minutes and
