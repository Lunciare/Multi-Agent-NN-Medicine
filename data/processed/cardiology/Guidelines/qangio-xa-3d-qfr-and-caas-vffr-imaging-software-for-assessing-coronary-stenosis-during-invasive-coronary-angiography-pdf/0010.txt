I study had a full text manuscript. This study was considered at high risk of selection bias because of the large percentage of lesions excluded. Diagnostic test accuracy CAAS vFFR 3.5 Of the 4 studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of CAAS vFFR only 1 (ILUMIEN I) reported a 2 x 2 table of diagnostic accuracy, and only 1 presented a Bland–Altman plot (FAST; Masdjedi et al. 2019) from which data were extracted to calculate diagnostic accuracy. Two of the studies were conference abstracts and only reported sensitivity and specificity without confidence intervals (Jin et al. 2019 and FAST EXTEND). One of these studies used an acquisition speed of 7.5 frames per second rather than the 12.5 frames per second recommended in the instructions for use (Jin et al. 2019). There was notable heterogeneity across this small number of studies. The FAST EXTEND study was used in the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis. The ILUMIEN I and Jin et al. (2019) studies were not included in the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis. Instead, they were included in separate scenario analyses to test the sensitivity of the cost- effectiveness results. 3.6 The EAG noted that the meta-analyses of the CAAS vFFR studies should be interpreted with
