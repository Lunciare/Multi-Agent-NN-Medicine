(2003) 3.42 The rate of procedural deaths associated with revascularisation was sourced from UK audit data, which gives a 0.99% death risk for non-emergency coronary artery bypass graft and 0.17% for percutaneous coronary intervention. The mortality rate associated with revascularisation was estimated as a weighted average of the mortality rates for percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft. This was relative to the proportion of percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass graft procedures. In the base case, 87% of revascularisation procedures were assumed to be percutaneous coronary intervention, and 13% were assumed to be coronary artery bypass graft. 3.43 The reported 1-year and long-term (up to 3 years) cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in the IRIS-FFR registry for deferred lesions was used in the model to estimate the baseline risk of major adverse cardiovascular events for the first year and subsequent years. The baseline risk of major adverse cardiovascular events used in the model for people in the group with the highest
