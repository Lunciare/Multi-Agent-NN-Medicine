they can have unpleasant side effects and increase the risk of adverse events, such as damage to the artery. CAAS vFFR and QAngio QFR use X-ray images taken during an invasive coronary angiography to construct a 3D image of the artery. This image is used to estimate the effect of coronary stenosis on blood flow through the artery without the side effects and risk of adverse events of FFR or iFR. Published evidence shows that the diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR is similar to FFR, but the diagnostic accuracy of CAAS vFFR is very uncertain. Whether QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR affect clinical outcomes and improve quality of life is also uncertain. Also, in clinical practice the quality of the images varies depending on if they are done in a diagnostic-only centre or one that offers interventional procedures. Poor image quality might mean the tests fail. The cost-effectiveness estimates for CAAS vFFR and QAngio QFR are uncertain but suggest that they are more cost effective than invasive coronary angiography alone. The estimates suggest that, compared with FFR and iFR, CAAS vFFR is less cost effective and QAngio QFR is slightly cheaper but less clinically effective. There are multiple tests in
