2 ongoing clinical trials of QAngio QFR. The FAVOR III Europe- Japan study will compare QFR with standard FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention, and the FAVOR III China study will compare QFR with angiography-alone guided percutaneous coronary intervention. These trials will be completed in December 2023 and February 2023, respectively. There is 1 ongoing trial of CAAS vFFR. The LIPSIA STRATEGY trial will compare vFFR with FFR for the assessment of intermediate coronary stenosis and is due to be completed in November 2026. The committee concluded that data from trials like these are essential to be confident that revascularisation decisions based on QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR results would improve patient outcomes (see research recommendation 5.3). Cost effectiveness The disutility associated with FFR or iFR used in the model may not be appropriate 4.9 In the model the procedural disutility for FFR was assumed to be the same as for percutaneous coronary intervention. This was because no data were available on the disutility of FFR. The clinical experts explained that this assumption may not accurately reflect the actual side effects or people's experiences of the procedure. The EAG also looked at different scenario analyses where the disutility of FFR was increased.
