or needed an unplanned revascularisation. A separate utility decrement was applied to the post-myocardial infarction health state, to reflect a decrease in HRQoL for those with a history of myocardial infarction. 3.47 The base-case analysis made an assumption that the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss applied for FFR or iFR was representative of both types of pressure wire procedures. The QALY loss estimates associated with each procedure in the diagnostic model are summarised in table 7.

Costs 3.48 The base-case cost of QAngio QFR with a throughput of 200 people per year was £430.61 per person tested. This was based on the purchase of vouchers for 100 people, which covered the cost
