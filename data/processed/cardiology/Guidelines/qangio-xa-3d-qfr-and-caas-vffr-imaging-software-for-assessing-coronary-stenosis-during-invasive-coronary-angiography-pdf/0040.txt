vFFR) during invasive coronary angiography may provide more information to help with decision making. It could also mean that in some cases clinical decisions could be made without needing FFR. Less invasive tests may benefit patients and carers by reducing anxiety, unpleasant side effects and risk of complications 4.2 A patient expert explained the potential benefits of testing using QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR. These included reduced anxiety, discomfort and distress than more invasive testing, which may be needed if a definitive treatment decision cannot be made during the initial invasive coronary angiography. Using an invasive test like FFR with a pressure wire means using an adenosine infusion. The committee noted that around 30% of people may experience chest pain and shortness of breath from this. These side effects usually pass quickly but can be distressing. Around 3% of people may experience discomfort from the pressure wire itself and there is a small risk of rupture of the blood vessel. By avoiding adenosine infusion and a pressure wire, QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR could reduce unpleasant side effects and risk of complications. Clinical effectiveness The diagnostic accuracy evidence for CAAS vFFR is highly uncertain 4.3 The committee noted that there
