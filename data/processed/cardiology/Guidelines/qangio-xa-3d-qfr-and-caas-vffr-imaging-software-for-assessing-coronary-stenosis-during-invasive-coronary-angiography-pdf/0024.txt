in managing coronary artery disease was done. The EAG identified 21 relevant studies and of these, 2 models (Walker et al. 2011 and Genders et al. 2015) were good examples of alternative ways to evaluate diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected stable angina. 3.35 For the economic analysis, the following 5 diagnostic strategies were considered: • invasive coronary angiography alone (strategy 1) • invasive coronary angiography followed by confirmatory FFR or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR; reference standard, strategy 2) • invasive coronary angiography with QAngio QFR (strategy 3) • invasive coronary angiography with QAngio QFR, followed by confirmatory FFR or iFR if QFR is inconclusive (strategy 4) • invasive coronary angiography with CAAS vFFR (strategy 5). Economic model 3.36 The EAG developed a de novo economic model. It was designed to estimate the cost effectiveness of using QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR during invasive coronary angiography to assess the functional significance of coronary stenosis in people with stable angina whose angiograms showed intermediate stenosis. The model had 2 parts, a diagnostic model and a prognostic model. The diagnostic model was used to link the diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR to short- term costs and consequences relating to
