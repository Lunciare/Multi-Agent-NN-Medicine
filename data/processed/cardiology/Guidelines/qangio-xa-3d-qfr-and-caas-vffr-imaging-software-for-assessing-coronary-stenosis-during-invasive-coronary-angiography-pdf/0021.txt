Simulation study of clinical effectiveness 3.29 Because of the lack of published data on QAngio QFR's clinical effectiveness, the EAG did a simulation study to investigate its possible effect on coronary outcomes compared with FFR. 3.30 The sample population was taken from data extracted from published Bland–Altman figures. Only cQFR or non-specified QAngio QFR data were used, for 3,193 people, each with an FFR measurement and its associated QAngio QFR measurement. To predict coronary outcomes, the results of the recent IRIS-FFR registry report were used. This represented 5,846 people who either had revascularisation (stent or bypass surgery) or continued
