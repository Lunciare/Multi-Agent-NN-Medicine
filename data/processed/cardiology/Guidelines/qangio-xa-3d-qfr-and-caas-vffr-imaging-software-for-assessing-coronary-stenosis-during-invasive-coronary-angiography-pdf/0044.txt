may have a high technical failure rate. The committee concluded that because all the data considered were from interventional centres, it was not certain what the technical failure rate would be in diagnostic-only centres. It is unclear how clinical history and symptoms affect clinical decisions based on QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR results 4.6 The NICE guideline on assessment and diagnosis of chest pain of recent onset recommends invasive coronary angiography as a third-line test. People who have invasive coronary angiography should have already had a previous assessment such as 64-slice coronary angiography and non-invasive functional imaging tests, but this may vary between centres. Some people may also have HeartFlow FFRCT which is recommended in the NICE medical technologies guidance on HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating FFR from coronary CT angiography. The clinical experts explained that these previous assessments can rule out the need for interventional treatment. Therefore, it is likely that people who do go on to have invasive coronary angiography have more severe disease than the people in the diagnostic accuracy studies. While the previous functional assessments may be used to guide further testing decisions such as whether to do an FFR, the QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR results
