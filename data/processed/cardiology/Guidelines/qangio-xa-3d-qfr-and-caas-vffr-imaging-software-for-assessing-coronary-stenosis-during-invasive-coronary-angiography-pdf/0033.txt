this test. 3.49 The unit cost for FFR and iFR was estimated as the difference between the activity weighted average of the healthcare resource group codes for complex and standard cardiac catheterisation (£436.80). Assumptions 3.50 The following assumptions were applied in the base-case analysis: • A diagnostic threshold of 0.80 was used to define functionally significant stenosis for QAngio QFR and FFR. • A grey-zone boundary of 0.78 to 0.84 for QAngio QFR was used as suggested by the manufacturer of QAngio QFR. • The baseline risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in the absence of revascularisation depends on disease severity as measured by FFR, while the distribution of FFR values differs by diagnostic strategy. • There is no treatment effect of revascularisation on risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, based on the findings of the ISCHEMIA trial. • Costs of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR were based on an average annual throughput of 200 people. • The base case assumed all diagnostic procedures took place in an interventional setting. The diagnostic-only setting was considered in scenario analyses. • HRQoL benefits of revascularisation and optimal medical therapy observed at 1 year for the true positive and false negative health states
