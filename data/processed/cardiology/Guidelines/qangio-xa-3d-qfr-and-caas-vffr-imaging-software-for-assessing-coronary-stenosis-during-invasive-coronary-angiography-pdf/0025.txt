diagnostic model and a prognostic model. The diagnostic model was used to link the diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR to short- term costs and consequences relating to decisions about revascularisation. The prognostic model took the diagnostic outcomes and modelled the risk of longer- term events, such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and the need for urgent or unplanned revascularisation. 3.37 The population consisted of people with stable coronary artery disease whose invasive coronary angiograms showed intermediate stenosis. The age and sex distribution of the population was derived from the IRIS-FFR registry (mean age of 64 years and 72% men). Model inputs 3.38 The prevalence of functionally significant stenosis in the population was based on studies that reported values of FFR and cQFR or non-specified QFR. It was assumed that the population in these QAngio QFR studies reflected the UK population. This suggested a prior likelihood of functionally significant stenosis of 40.2%, based on the proportion of people in the studies who had an FFR measurement of 0.80 or less. 3.39 The proportion of positive or negative test results when using the QAngio QFR, CAAS vFFR or invasive coronary angiography (strategies 3, 5 and 1) was based
