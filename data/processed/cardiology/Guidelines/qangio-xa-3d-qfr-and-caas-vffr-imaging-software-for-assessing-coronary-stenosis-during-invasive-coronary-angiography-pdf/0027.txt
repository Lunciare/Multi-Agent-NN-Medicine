cQFR, contrast QFR; fQFR, fixed-flow QFR; vFFR, vessel fractional flow reserve. 3.40 The diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR in strategy 4 was based on the joint distribution of QFR and FFR measurements in the extracted individual-level patient data. The probabilities of QAngio QFR test results being positive (QFR less than 0.78), negative (QFR more than 0.84) or inconclusive (QFR of 0.78 to 0.84) are shown in table 5.
