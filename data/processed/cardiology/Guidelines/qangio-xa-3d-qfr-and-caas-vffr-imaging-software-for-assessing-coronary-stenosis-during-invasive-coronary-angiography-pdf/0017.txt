3.19 The EAG identified 5 studies included in the meta-analysis that also reported 2 x 2 table data on the diagnostic accuracy of using 2D or 3D invasive coronary angiography alone. These studies used 50% diameter stenosis as the cut-off and FFR of 0.80 or less as the reference standard. Given the small number of studies, and because 2D and 3D invasive coronary angiography may have very different performance, no bivariate meta-analysis of these data was done. However, the results of the individual studies showed that the diagnostic accuracy of invasive coronary angiography was inferior to QAngio QFR. 3.20 To inform the economic analysis, the EAG did an additional pragmatic search for studies that compared 2D invasive coronary angiography with FFR assessment. Data extracted from these studies showed that compared with QAngio QFR, the correlation of 2D invasive coronary angiography with FFR was much weaker (correlation coefficient -0.432). A bivariate meta-analysis of these extracted data produced summary sensitivity and specificity estimates of 62.6% (95% CI 51.5% to 72.5%) and 61.6% (95% CI 53.1% to 69.4%), respectively. Other intermediate outcomes Test failure 3.21 The most reported (15 studies) causes of exclusion were issues with image acquisition and quality (for example, lack
