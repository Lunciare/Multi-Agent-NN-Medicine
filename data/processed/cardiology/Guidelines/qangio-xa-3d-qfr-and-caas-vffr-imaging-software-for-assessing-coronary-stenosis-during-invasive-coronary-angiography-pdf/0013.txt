as the reference standard, using a cut- off of 0.80, although 1 study used instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as the reference standard. The EAG noted that there was no conclusive evidence of a significant difference between cQFR and fQFR. 3.10 In the univariate meta-analysis for the random-effect analysis, QAngio QFR at a cut-off of 0.80 had good diagnostic accuracy to predict FFR (also at a cut-off of 0.80). cQFR had a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 78% to 90%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI 85% to 95%); fQFR had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 68% to 91%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 77% to 95%). Studies that did not specify the mode of QAngio QFR had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 78% to 89%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 87% to 91%). 3.11 Summary positive predictive values were 77% (95% CI 69% to 83%) for fQFR, 85% (95% CI 80% to 89%) for cQFR and 80% (95% CI 76% to 84%) for non-specified QAngio QFR (see figure 27 in the appendix of the diagnostics assessment report). Summary negative predictive values were 92% (95% CI 89% to 94%) for fQFR, 91% (95% CI 85% to 94%)
