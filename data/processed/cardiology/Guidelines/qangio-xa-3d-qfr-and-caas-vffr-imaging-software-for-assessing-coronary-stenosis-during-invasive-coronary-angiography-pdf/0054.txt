committee noted further that there were no clinical outcome studies for QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR, which meant that the EAG had to make assumptions about treatment decisions and clinical outcomes, which led to uncertainty in the results. The clinical experts commented that these tests may be used to guide high-level clinical decisions about treatment, so clinicians need to be confident when making decisions based on the tests' results. The committee considered that clinical utility is uncertain and more data are needed. There were concerns around the results of the simulation study that showed that QAngio QFR could lead to an increase in revascularisations (see section 4.7). The committee also recalled the trend in clinical practice of moving away from diagnostic-only settings to interventional centres (see section 4.13) and considered that there was too much uncertainty to consider QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR in this scenario. The committee concluded that because of the uncertainty in diagnostic accuracy and clinical evidence, CAAS vFFR was not recommended. Despite having good diagnostic accuracy evidence, QAngio QFR should not be recommended for use until further data showing that it improves patient outcomes are available. 5 Recommendations for further research 5.1 A patient experience study
