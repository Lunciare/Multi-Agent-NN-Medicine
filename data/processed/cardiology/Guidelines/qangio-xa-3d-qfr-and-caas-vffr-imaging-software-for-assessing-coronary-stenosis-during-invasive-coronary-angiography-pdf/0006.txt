analytical software that can be used during invasive coronary angiography to assess the functional significance of coronary stenosis. By avoiding unnecessary invasive measurement of FFR or iFR, these technologies could help avoid the risks associated with passing the pressure wire to the coronary arteries, and with adenosine infusion. The interventions 2.8 Both tests included in the assessment are CE marked and available to the NHS. CAAS vFFR 2.9 The CAAS vFFR software (Pie Medical Imaging) works by building a 3D reconstruction of a coronary artery as well as assessing the pressure drop across the stenosis and calculating a vFFR value. Therefore, it gives both anatomical and functional assessments of the stenosis. It uses 2 standard X-ray angiograms, and is compatible with most X-ray systems (that is, it is vendor independent). The company claims that the total analysis time is about 2 minutes per coronary artery. Thresholds for interpretation of vFFR are not provided in the instructions for use document. QAngio XA 3D QFR 2.10 The QAngio software (Medis Medical Imaging) uses X-ray angiographic images taken during invasive coronary angiography. Two images are needed, which have to be taken with at least 25 degrees difference in viewing angle and with a
