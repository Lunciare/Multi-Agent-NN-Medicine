QFR measurement. To predict coronary outcomes, the results of the recent IRIS-FFR registry report were used. This represented 5,846 people who either had revascularisation (stent or bypass surgery) or continued with current management without surgery based on their measured FFR result. The IRIS-FFR study used major adverse cardiovascular events as its primary outcome. 3.31 Three strategies for deciding whether to revascularise were investigated: • FFR only: do FFR for all and revascularise if FFR is 0.80 or less. • QAngio QFR only: do QAngio QFR for all and revascularise if QAngio QFR is 0.80 or less, without measuring FFR. • Grey zone: do QAngio QFR for all and: － revascularise if QAngio QFR is 0.78 or less － defer if QAngio QFR is more than 0.84 － if QAngio QFR is between 0.78 and 0.84, do FFR and revascularise if FFR is 0.80 or less. 3.32 If using the FFR only strategy 40.2% of people would have revascularisation. Using the QAngio QFR only strategy 42.0% would have revascularisation, and using the grey-zone strategy 43.2% would have revascularisation. Using QAngio QFR therefore moderately increased the revascularisation rate, and using it with a grey zone increased it further. 3.33 These simulations suggest
