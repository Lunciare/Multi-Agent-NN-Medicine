or • stress echocardiography or • first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion or • MR imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. 2.5 If the results of non-invasive functional imaging are inconclusive, invasive coronary angiography is recommended. Invasive coronary angiography shows whether the arteries are blocked or narrowed, and the degree of stenosis. It is usually used as a third-line investigation for stable angina or during the initial stages of percutaneous coronary intervention. However, it is difficult to differentiate between functionally significant and non-significant (not substantially affecting blood supply) coronary stenosis using visual assessment of invasive coronary angiograms. 2.6 If it is necessary to more accurately understand the functional significance of a stenosis, fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurements can be done during invasive coronary angiography. These invasive techniques use a pressure wire with or without a vasodilator drug, such as adenosine, and can only be done in interventional catheter laboratories. 2.7 QAngio XA 3D quantitative flow ratio (QAngio QFR) and CAAS vessel FFR (CAAS vFFR) are analytical software that can be used during invasive coronary angiography to assess the functional significance of coronary stenosis. By avoiding unnecessary invasive measurement of FFR or iFR, these technologies could
