for CAAS vFFR and 0.886 (95% CI 0.807 to 0.940) for contrast QFR (cQFR). QAngio QFR 3.8 The EAG did a meta-analysis of the included studies, focusing on the diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR to detect lesions or vessels needing intervention (defined as having an FFR of 0.80 or less). Two approaches were used. The primary analysis consisted of a meta-analysis of reported diagnostic accuracy data. The secondary analysis used a data extraction approach in which FFR and QAngio QFR values from published plots were extracted and used to calculate diagnostic accuracy. This second approach allowed for a wider range of analyses. 3.9 The EAG identified 26 studies with sufficient diagnostic accuracy data to be included in the primary meta-analysis. Both univariate and bivariate meta- analyses of sensitivity and specificity were done and compared. These were divided into 3 modes of QAngio QFR: fixed-flow QFR (fQFR), contrast QFR (cQFR) and studies in which the type of QAngio QFR was not specified. Most studies included in the primary analysis used FFR as the reference standard, using a cut- off of 0.80, although 1 study used instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) as the reference standard. The EAG noted that there was no conclusive
