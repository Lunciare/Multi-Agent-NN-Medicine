(see figure 27 in the appendix of the diagnostics assessment report). Summary negative predictive values were 92% (95% CI 89% to 94%) for fQFR, 91% (95% CI 85% to 94%) for cQFR and 91% (95% CI 87% to 93%) for non- specified QAngio QFR. 3.12 The results of the bivariate meta-analysis were almost identical to the univariate analyses, with no conclusive evidence of a significant difference between fQFR and cQFR. The results of this analysis are summarised in table 2.

For fQFR the mean difference was 0 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.06), for cQFR the mean difference was -0.01 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.04) and for non-specified QAngio QFR the mean difference was
