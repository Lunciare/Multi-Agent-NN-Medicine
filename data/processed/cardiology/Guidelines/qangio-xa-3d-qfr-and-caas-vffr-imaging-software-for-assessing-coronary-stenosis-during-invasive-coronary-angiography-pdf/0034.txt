The diagnostic-only setting was considered in scenario analyses. • HRQoL benefits of revascularisation and optimal medical therapy observed at 1 year for the true positive and false negative health states applied for a lifetime duration. • Procedural disutility associated with FFR was equivalent to that of percutaneous coronary intervention. Base-case results 3.51 The deterministic and probabilistic cost-effectiveness results for the base-case analysis, expressed in terms of net health benefit at a maximum acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,000 per QALY gained, are shown in tables 8 and 9, respectively. The incremental net health benefit was calculated for each strategy compared with invasive coronary angiography alone. The results were consistent for both the deterministic and probabilistic analysis.
