committee concluded that given the uncertainty in clinical utility the cost- effectiveness results were also uncertain. The potential role of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR in a diagnostic- only setting is unclear 4.13 In a scenario analysis in which the tests were done in a diagnostic-only setting, QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR became the most cost-effective options in the fully incremental analyses. This was because of the additional cost of onward referral for the reference standard tests. However, clinical experts explained that fewer people are having invasive coronary angiography because it is recommended as a third-line test in the NICE guideline on assessment and diagnosis of chest pain of recent onset (see section 4.6). The appropriate use of CT coronary angiography and functional testing has resulted in a fall in the number of people having invasive coronary angiography in diagnostic-only centres. Having an angiographic procedure in an interventional centre means that invasive coronary angiography, FFR or iFR and percutaneous coronary intervention can be done in a single visit, if appropriate. This reduces the need for multiple hospital visits, which has the potential to reduce people's anxiety. A clinical expert explained that according to 2017 to 2018 data from the National
