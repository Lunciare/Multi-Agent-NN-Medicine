invasive coronary angiography images were not good enough to run QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR. The committee noted that in clinical practice some images may not be of a sufficient quality for the software programs to produce a result. Therefore, the cost per test may have been underestimated because test failure rates were not factored into the model. Only people who had a QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR result were included. The EAG did a scenario analysis in which patient throughput was varied, which affected the cost per test. However, the committee noted that this may not have explored a wide enough range to sufficiently capture this effect. It suggested that failure rates in routine clinical practice would be reduced over time as the operator gained experience in using the system. However, the clinical experts explained that this may be dependent on the setting, with sub-optimal angiography images more likely in diagnostic- only centres (see section 4.5). The committee concluded that further research on QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR failure rates in clinical practice would be beneficial (see research recommendation 5.2). QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR are more cost effective than invasive coronary angiography alone, but the results are uncertain
