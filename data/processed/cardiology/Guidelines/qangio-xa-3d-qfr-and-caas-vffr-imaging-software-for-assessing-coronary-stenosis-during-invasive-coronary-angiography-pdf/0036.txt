alone. Abbreviations: ICA, invasive coronary angiography; FFR, fractional flow reserve; QFR, quantitative flow ratio; vFFR, vessel FFR; QALY, quality-adjusted life year; NHB, net health benefit; INHB, incremental NHB. 3.52 Strategy 2 (invasive coronary angiography with FFR) had the highest net health benefit and the highest probability of being cost effective, although the differences between all the strategies were small. Strategy 1 (invasive coronary angiography alone) was the cheapest and had the lowest QALY gain, while strategy 5 (invasive coronary angiography with vFFR) was the most expensive and had the highest QALY gain. Analysis of alternative scenarios 3.53 Results from the scenario analyses showed that the base-case results were generally robust when alterations were made to the sources of data used in the model and when different assumptions were made. However, sometimes these alterations resulted in significant changes to the net health benefit rankings of the different strategies. 3.54 In the base case, the diagnostic accuracy estimates for vFFR were based on the FAST EXTEND study (sensitivity 97.0% and specificity 74.0%), the largest study of vFFR (330 patients). Using accuracy estimates from ILUMIEN I reduced the cost effectiveness of vFFR, but estimates from Jin et al. (2019) increased it. This resulted
