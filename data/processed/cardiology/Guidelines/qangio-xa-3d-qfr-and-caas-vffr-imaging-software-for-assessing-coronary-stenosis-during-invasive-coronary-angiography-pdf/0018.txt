(95% CI 53.1% to 69.4%), respectively. Other intermediate outcomes Test failure 3.21 The most reported (15 studies) causes of exclusion were issues with image acquisition and quality (for example, lack of at least 2 projections with a 25 degree angle in between, or poor image quality). The second most reported reason for exclusion was anatomical features of arteries (for example, excessive overlapping or foreshortening, ostial lesions, severe tortuosity). 3.22 Exclusion rates for QAngio QFR were higher overall in retrospective studies (median 28%, range 6% to 92%) compared with prospective studies (median 17%, range 7% to 52%). This may be partly explained by the fact that invasive coronary angiography images in retrospective studies were less likely to have been collected following manufacturer instructions. 3.23 There were only 2 retrospective CAAS vFFR studies that reported exclusion rates, and these were both high at 63% and 65%. In both studies most exclusions were because of angiographic image processing issues such as lack of suitable projections or poor image quality (rather than directly because of CAAS vFFR). Variability 3.24 There were 8 studies that reported outcomes data on reproducibility of QAngio QFR readings between 2 different analysts (inter-observer variability). QAngio QFR was found to
