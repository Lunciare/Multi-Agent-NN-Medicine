adverse cardiovascular events for the first year and subsequent years. The baseline risk of major adverse cardiovascular events used in the model for people in the group with the highest FFR values (0.91 or more) was 0.64% in the first year and 0.32% per year in subsequent years. The hazard ratios were 1.06 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.13), 1.09 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.14), 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.09) per 0.01 decrease in FFR for cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned or urgent revascularisation, respectively. 3.44 The treatment effect of revascularisation on major adverse cardiovascular events in people with stable coronary artery disease is highly uncertain. The ISCHEMIA trial, a randomised, parallel, open-label clinical trial comparing revascularisation with optimal medical therapy, did not find evidence that revascularisation reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, in the base- case analysis, the diagnostic tests did not benefit major adverse cardiovascular events outcomes. Scenario analyses were done to explore the effect of this assumption. Health-related quality of life 3.45 By identifying the appropriateness for revascularisation, the tests can have health benefits through greater symptom relief and, therefore, higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Because the base-case analysis assumed that there
