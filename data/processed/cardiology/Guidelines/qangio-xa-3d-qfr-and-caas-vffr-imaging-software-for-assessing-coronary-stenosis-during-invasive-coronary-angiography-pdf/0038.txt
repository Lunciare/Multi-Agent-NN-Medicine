resulting in strategy 2 becoming the second least cost effective and strategy 3 the most cost effective. An FFR disutility of 0.014 QALYs resulted in an equal net health benefit for strategies 2 and 3. This procedural disutility was 2.5 times greater than that associated with percutaneous coronary intervention, but less than half the disutility associated with coronary artery bypass graft. 3.57 In terms of how duration of HRQoL affected cost effectiveness, the benefits need to last for at least 7 years to offset the disutility associated with FFR or iFR in the base case for strategy 2 to remain more cost effective than strategy 3. 3.58 The benefits of revascularisation, in terms of improved HRQoL, suggested that the sensitivity of test results was a more important driver of cost effectiveness than specificity. This was because true positive test results translated into higher QALY gains than mismanagement of false negative test results. 3.59 In a diagnostic-only setting, the large additional costs of repeating diagnostic catheterisation at a subsequent appointment in an interventional centre for strategies involving measuring FFR or iFR (strategies 2 and 4) meant that strategies without this testing component were more cost effective. Strategy 3 (QAngio QFR alone)
