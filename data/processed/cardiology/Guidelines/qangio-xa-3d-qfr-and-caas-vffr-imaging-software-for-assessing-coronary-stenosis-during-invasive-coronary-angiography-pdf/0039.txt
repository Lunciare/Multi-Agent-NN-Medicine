an interventional centre for strategies involving measuring FFR or iFR (strategies 2 and 4) meant that strategies without this testing component were more cost effective. Strategy 3 (QAngio QFR alone) became the strategy with the highest net benefit, followed by strategy 5 (CAAS vFFR alone). 4 Committee discussion Clinical need FFR and iFR are not frequently used so QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR may help with decision making during invasive coronary angiography 4.1 Clinical experts explained that in general, physiological testing using fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is available but not frequently used in the UK. People typically have an invasive coronary angiography after a previous functional test (see section 2.4). Sometimes decisions about revascularisation are based on the images from the invasive coronary angiography, results of the previous tests and patient history. If the revascularisation decision is still uncertain after invasive coronary angiography, people may be referred for FFR or iFR. Using QAngio XA 3D quantitative flow ratio (QAngio QFR) and CAAS vessel FFR (CAAS vFFR) during invasive coronary angiography may provide more information to help with decision making. It could also mean that in some cases clinical decisions could be made without needing FFR.
