included in separate scenario analyses to test the sensitivity of the cost- effectiveness results. 3.6 The EAG noted that the meta-analyses of the CAAS vFFR studies should be interpreted with caution because imputation of data (replacing missing data with substituted values) was needed. This was for 2 studies on the prevalence of FFR results below and above the cut-off for revascularisation decisions (0.80 or less), and because of the high heterogeneity across studies. The results of these bivariate meta-analyses are summarised in table 1.

It concluded that diagnostic performance of CAAS vFFR was poorer than for QAngio QFR, with area under the curves of 0.719 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.621 to 0.804) for CAAS vFFR and 0.886 (95% CI 0.807 to 0.940) for contrast QFR (cQFR).
