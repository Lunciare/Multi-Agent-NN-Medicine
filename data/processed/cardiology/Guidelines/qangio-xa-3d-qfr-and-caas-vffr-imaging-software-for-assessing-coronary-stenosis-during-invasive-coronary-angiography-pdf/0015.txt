mean difference was 0 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.06), for cQFR the mean difference was -0.01 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.04) and for non-specified QAngio QFR the mean difference was 0.01 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.05). FFR and QAngio QFR were highly correlated in all studies, with correlation coefficients of 0.78 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.82) for fQFR, 0.78 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.85) for cQFR and 0.79 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83) for non-specified QAngio QFR. 3.14 The secondary analysis allowed for a wider range of analyses, such as considering different QAngio QFR and FFR cut-offs, and the effect of using a grey zone, in which people with intermediate QAngio QFR values go on to have confirmatory FFR. 3.15 A bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy using data extracted from figures gave summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% (95% CI 80.7% to 87.8%) and 87.2% (95% CI 83.4% to 90.3%), respectively. This was similar to the results from the primary analysis when cQFR and non-specified QFR were combined. 3.16 QFR, as measured by QAngio, was highly correlated with FFR (r=0.80). In 50% of people, QFR and FFR differed by no more than 0.04. In 95% of people, values
