1.1 There is not enough evidence to recommend using QAngio XA 3D quantitative flow ratio (QAngio QFR) and CAAS vessel fractional flow reserve (CAAS vFFR) during invasive coronary angiography to assess coronary stenosis in stable angina. QAngio QFR's diagnostic accuracy is considered acceptable for assessing coronary stenosis during invasive coronary angiography, but its clinical effectiveness is uncertain. CAAS vFFR's diagnostic accuracy and clinical effectiveness is uncertain. Further research is recommended in both diagnostic- only catheter labs and interventional catheter labs. 1.2 Further research is recommended (see section 5) on: • people's experiences of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR compared with the reference standard of FFR or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) • test failure rates of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR in clinical practice and how these affect whether revascularisation is done • the clinical benefit of using QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR • the diagnostic accuracy of CAAS vFFR. Why the committee made these recommendations FFR or iFR can be used with invasive coronary angiography to assess coronary stenosis. However, they can have unpleasant side effects and increase the risk of adverse events, such as damage to the artery. CAAS vFFR and QAngio QFR use X-ray images taken during an
