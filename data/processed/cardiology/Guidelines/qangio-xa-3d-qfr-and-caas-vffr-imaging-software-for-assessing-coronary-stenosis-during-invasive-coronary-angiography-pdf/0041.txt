and CAAS vFFR could reduce unpleasant side effects and risk of complications. Clinical effectiveness The diagnostic accuracy evidence for CAAS vFFR is highly uncertain 4.3 The committee noted that there were only 3 studies using CAAS vFFR that matched the inclusion criteria for review in the diagnostics assessment report. These included 500 patients. The external assessment group (EAG) explained that there was notable heterogeneity across this small number of studies and that the meta-analyses of the CAAS vFFR studies should be interpreted with caution. Where reported, there was a high exclusion rate because of angiographic image processing issues. In 2 of the studies, the technology was not used in the way it was intended (ILUMIEN I and Jin et al. 2019). The committee concluded that the diagnostic accuracy of CAAS vFFR was highly uncertain and recommended further research (see research recommendation 5.4). The diagnostic accuracy of QAngio QFR appears to be similar to FFR 4.4 The committee noted that 39 studies using QAngio QFR matched the inclusion criteria for the review in the diagnostics assessment report. These included 5,440 patients. These studies showed that QAngio QFR had good diagnostic accuracy to predict the FFR result. The clinical experts explained that
