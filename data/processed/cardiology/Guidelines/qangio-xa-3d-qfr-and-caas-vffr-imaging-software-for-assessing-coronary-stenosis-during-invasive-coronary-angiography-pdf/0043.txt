is any added benefit of revascularisation compared to optimal medical therapy. The committee concluded that there was good agreement between QAngio QFR and FFR values. Although there was some uncertainty around the grey zone, this was not a particular concern. Technical failure rates in diagnostic-only centres may be higher because of lower quality angiography images 4.5 In the UK, invasive coronary angiography is usually done in diagnostic-only catheter laboratories or in interventional catheter laboratories that can also do percutaneous coronary intervention in the same procedure. Clinical experts explained that the quality of angiography images from diagnostic-only centres was generally lower than those from interventional centres. This is because in the diagnostic centre, invasive coronary angiography is done so the information can be used to guide decisions about what further testing and treatment might be needed. In the interventional centre, invasive coronary angiography is often done to help plan percutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical experts noted that QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR need high-quality angiography images so in diagnostic centres the tests may have a high technical failure rate. The committee concluded that because all the data considered were from interventional centres, it was not certain what the technical failure rate would
