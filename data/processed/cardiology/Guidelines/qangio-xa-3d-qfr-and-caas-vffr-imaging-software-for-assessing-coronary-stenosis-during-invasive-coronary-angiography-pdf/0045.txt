diagnostic accuracy studies. While the previous functional assessments may be used to guide further testing decisions such as whether to do an FFR, the QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR results would be used to guide high-level treatment decisions with substantial consequences. Therefore, clinicians need to be confident that making a decision based on the results of these tests would lead to improved outcomes for patients. The committee commented that the diagnostic accuracy studies did not incorporate clinical history and the effect that symptoms had on decision making based on the QAngio QFR result. Therefore, it is unclear how this additional information combined with a QAngio QFR or CAAS vFFR result affects clinical decision making about revascularisation. QAngio QFR may slightly increase revascularisation rates compared with FFR but this is uncertain 4.7 The EAG did a simulation study analysis to investigate the possible effect of using QAngio QFR compared with invasive coronary angiography and FFR on coronary outcomes such as revascularisation rates and major adverse cardiovascular events. QAngio QFR (with or without a grey zone) led to slightly more revascularisations compared with FFR (40.2% revascularisations using FFR compared with 42.0% for QAngio QFR and 43.2% using the grey-zone strategy).
