correctly detecting and characterising coronary stenosis. Therefore, the diagnostic pathway for stable angina: • confirms a diagnosis of stable angina • defines the severity of coronary stenosis, which provides prognostic information and identifies people who are likely to benefit from myocardial revascularisation, in addition to optimal medical therapy. 2.3 The NICE guideline on assessment and diagnosis of chest pain of recent onset recommends diagnostic testing for people in whom stable angina cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone. It recommends offering 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography as the first-line diagnostic test when: • clinical assessment indicates typical or atypical angina or • clinical assessment indicates non-anginal chest pain but 12-lead resting ECG has been done and indicates ST-T changes or Q waves. 2.4 For people in whom 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography has shown coronary artery disease of uncertain functional significance, or is non-diagnostic, the guideline recommends offering non-invasive functional imaging for myocardial ischaemia. This could be: • myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single-photon emission CT (MPS with SPECT) or • stress echocardiography or • first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion or • MR imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. 2.5 If the results of non-invasive functional imaging are
