quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] but were slightly cheaper) in the base-case analysis. However, the committee noted that a review of the accuracy of FFR or iFR was not done by the EAG and they were assumed in the model to be 100% accurate. It also noted that the difference between the new technologies and the reference standard was small at 0.007 QALYs or £140 per person for QAngio QFR and 0.011 QALYs or £220 per person for CAAS vFFR. Following an update to the price structure of QAngio QFR by the company during consultation, QAngio QFR using an annual licence became slightly cheaper but remained less clinically effective than the reference standard of FFR or iFR. However, given the small difference in costs and outcomes, the committee reiterated the need for clinical outcome data from studies that directly compare QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR with FFR or iFR (see research recommendation 5.3). These data would give clinicians confidence in their decision making based on the results of the tests. The committee concluded that given the uncertainty in clinical utility the cost- effectiveness results were also uncertain. The potential role of QAngio QFR and CAAS vFFR in a diagnostic- only setting
