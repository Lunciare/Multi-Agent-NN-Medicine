study of 268 patients reported that time to image acquisition significantly decreased with the number of invasive coronary angiographies analysed, from 5 minutes and 59 seconds to 2 minutes and 7 seconds between the first and last 50 patients. Morbidity, mortality and major adverse events 3.27 There were 3 cohort studies that reported mortality or major clinical outcomes in eligible patients with QAngio QFR measurements. All found that a clinically significant QAngio QFR predicted a higher incidence of long-term major cardiovascular adverse events. No data were reported for CAAS vFFR. Subsequent use of invasive pressure-wire FFR 3.28 Five studies included in the diagnostic accuracy review retrospectively derived a grey-zone strategy based on their diagnostic accuracy results to model a potential reduction in adenosine and FFR use. These results are summarised in table 3.
