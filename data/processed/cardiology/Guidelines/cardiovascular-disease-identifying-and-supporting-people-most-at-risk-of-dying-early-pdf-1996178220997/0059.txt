Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

screening clinic in a prison indicated a moderate 35% voluntary uptake by the inmates. There were active interventions following the screening for 87 (34%) inmates and 13 (32%) staff screened. These ranged from simple anti-smoking and dietary advice to more formal medical interventions to manage raised blood pressure and cholesterol. Uptake data should be viewed cautiously, as the number of potential participants was not reported. Evidence Statement 10ST Two case studies suggest that offering blood pressure measurements at community sites in areas of deprivation can identify a number of people with elevated blood pressure. No firm conclusion can be made on participation rates as these were not reported in the studies. One UK case study (+) found 221 people out of 758 first-time users of self- reading sphygmomanometers placed in public sites had elevated blood pressure measurements. No firm conclusions can be made regarding physician follow-up as the researchers were unable to contact all of these people. One US RCT (+) providing blood pressure measurements at a range of community sites identified 31.4% with elevated blood pressure and 10.7% with severely elevated blood pressure. Transferability and cost effectiveness of such interventions requires further study. Evidence Statement 11ST There is evidence
