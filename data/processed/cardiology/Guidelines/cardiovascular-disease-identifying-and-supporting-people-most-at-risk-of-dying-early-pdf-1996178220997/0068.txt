(2007) Guidance for the NHS and other sectors on interventions that reduce the rates of premature death in disadvantaged areas: proactive case finding and retention and improving access to services. Cost-effectiveness evidence Smoking cessation The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of smoking cessation interventions for disadvantaged groups is low or very low. It is rarely likely to exceed £6,000. Statins Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD; that is, after a CVD event) among a disadvantaged population costs an estimated £4,000 per QALY gained (£3,100 per QALY for finding the person and £900 per QALY for treating them with statins). Therefore, it is cost effective. Whether or not it is cost effective to provide statins to prevent a first occurrence of CVD among a disadvantaged population depends on the number of people at risk in the baseline population. Data from a USA study of financially disadvantaged women aged 40 to 64 who enrolled in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program was analysed. The analysis found that it is cost effective if more than 14% of the population is at risk. For example, when 40% were at risk of CVD, primary prevention was estimated to cost £8,500 per
