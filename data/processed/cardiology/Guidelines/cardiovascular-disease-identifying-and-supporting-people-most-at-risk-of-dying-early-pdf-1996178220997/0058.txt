Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

blood pressure measurement. Evidence Statement 5ST There is weak quality evidence from 2 case studies (both [-]) to suggest that offering cardiovascular risk assessment opportunistically to African-Caribbean general practice patients, or patients from a range of socioeconomic categories, may identify a number of people at risk of CHD. However, the interventions require further research using well- conducted studies before firm conclusions can be made. Evidence Statement 7ST There is evidence from 3 studies to suggest that workplace cardiovascular screening provided in schools or businesses in multi-ethnic, low-income areas (CBA [-], case study [-]), or for factory workers (case study [+]) is moderately well attended. Results suggest that a number of participants were identified for referral to a physician for follow-up (outcome reported in 2 studies: CBA [-], case study [-]). No firm conclusions can be made on patients' completion of follow-up as this was only reported in 1 poor quality study (case study [-]). Evidence Statement 9ST Evidence from 1 UK case study (-) evaluating the establishment of a health screening clinic in a prison indicated a moderate 35% voluntary uptake by the inmates. There were active interventions following the screening for 87 (34%) inmates and 13 (32%) staff screened.
