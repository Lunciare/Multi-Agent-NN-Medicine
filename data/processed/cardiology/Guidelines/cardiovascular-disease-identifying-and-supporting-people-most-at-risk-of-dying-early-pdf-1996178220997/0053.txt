may have limited applicability to this review. Evidence statement 9SM There is evidence from 3 reviews that training dental professionals to deliver smoking cessation interventions is important, and that this setting has the potential to reach large numbers of smokers and increase cessation rates (1 international systematic review comprising 6 RCTs [-], 1 UK review of mixed-study designs [-] and 1 international review of 7 RCTs [+]). One study took place within the UK and is directly applicable to the review. Two studies took place in the USA and so may have limited applicability to this review. There is limited reference to disadvantaged individuals in any of the reviews and therefore the applicability of this evidence to target populations for this review may be limited. Evidence Statement 10SM Three studies provide some evidence of the potential benefit of drop-in or rolling, community-based sessions to reach smokers and increase cessation rates: 2 UK-based studies involving face-to-face interviews (both [-]) and 1 UK-based observational study (- ). All studies took place within the UK and are directly applicable to the review. Evidence Statement 11SM One cohort study (+) provides evidence of the potential benefits of locating smoking cessation services in the workplace
