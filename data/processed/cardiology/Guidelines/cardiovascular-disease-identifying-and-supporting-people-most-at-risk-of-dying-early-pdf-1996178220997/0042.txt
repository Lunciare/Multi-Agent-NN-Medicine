supplementary cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost- effectiveness reports covered: • Statins: 1 report focused on disadvantaged people, the other looked at the general population. They focused on how to: identify people at risk, improve or increase their access to services, ensure people who require treatment stay in the system and adhere to the treatment protocol. • Smoking cessation: 1 report focused on disadvantaged people, the other looked at the general population. They focused on how to: identify people at risk, improve or increase their access to services, ensure people who require treatment stay in the system and adhere to the treatment protocol. Review of economic evaluations The review was conducted using the databases listed for the effectiveness reviews and the following economic databases: • Econlit • Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED) • NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). The small number of studies involved and the difficulties involved in making direct comparisons across studies (for instance, due to lack of information on the base year used to estimate prices) meant that it was not possible to undertake a quantitative synthesis of the results. Cost-effectiveness analysis An economic model was constructed to incorporate data from the reviews of effectiveness and cost effectiveness.
