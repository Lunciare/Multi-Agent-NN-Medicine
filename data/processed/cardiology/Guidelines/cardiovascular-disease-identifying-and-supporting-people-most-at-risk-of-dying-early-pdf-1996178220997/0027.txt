Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

'effectiveness' in this context relates not only to the size of the effect, but also to the cost effectiveness, duration of effect and harmful/negative effects. 1 Proactive case-finding and retention and access to services Can the research on proactive case-finding and retention and access to services in relation to smoking cessation and the provision of statins be applied to other services aimed at the reduction of premature mortality amongst disadvantaged people? If so, to what extent? 2 Incentives What factors influence the acceptability and effectiveness of incentives to identify, engage and retain people within the health system? Does the use of incentives lead to any adverse consequences? If so, why and under what circumstances? 3 Expansion of small-scale interventions Do cost-effective, small-scale interventions remain cost effective when they are expanded? If so, what is the best way to expand them? 4 Level and nature of disadvantage of the target population To what extent, if any, does the level and nature of disadvantage of the target population affect the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions? 5 Service uptake How does service uptake change when different barriers to service use are addressed either individually or in combination?
