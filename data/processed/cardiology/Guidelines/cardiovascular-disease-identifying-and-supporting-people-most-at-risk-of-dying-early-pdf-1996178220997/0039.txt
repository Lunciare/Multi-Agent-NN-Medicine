improved access to those services (note, the statins search included CVD) • find and help people who smoke (aged 16 years and over) to stop or reduce the habit • provide people who smoke (aged 16 years and over) with smoking cessation services – or improve their access to those services. Studies were excluded if the interventions: • did not aim to reduce or eliminate premature deaths from CHD or other smoking- related causes • tackled the wider determinants of health inequalities (for example, using macro-level policies to tackle poverty and economic disadvantage). Quality appraisal Included papers were assessed for methodological rigour and quality using the NICE methodology checklist, as set out in the NICE technical manual 'Methods for development of NICE public health guidance'. Each study was described by study type and graded (++, +, -) to reflect the risk of potential bias arising from its design and execution. Study type • Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or RCTs (including cluster RCTs). • Systematic reviews of, or individual, non-randomised controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, interrupted time series (ITS) studies, correlation studies. • Non-analytical studies (for example, case reports, case series). •
