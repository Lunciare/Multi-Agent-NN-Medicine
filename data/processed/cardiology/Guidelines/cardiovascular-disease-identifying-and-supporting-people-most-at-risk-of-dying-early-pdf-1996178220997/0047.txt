Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

is numbered '1' in the review 'The use of statins: proactive case finding, retention and improving access to services in disadvantaged areas'. 'MR' is used to indicate that supporting evidence on current practice can be found in the mapping review. As noted in appendix B, study quality provides an overall indication of how well a study was conducted to minimise the likelihood of bias. For example, a quality rating of '++' indicates minimal likelihood of bias, whereas a rating of '-'' indicates a significant likelihood of bias. Some of the studies that informed the evidence statements below were rated '-', due to poor methodology. However, this quality rating does not always apply to the way the studies actually identified, supported and improved individuals' access to services – the areas under investigation for this guidance. See the evidence reviews and economic appraisal for details. Where a recommendation is not directly taken from the evidence statements, but is inferred from the evidence, this is indicated by 'IDE' (inference derived from the evidence) below. Where PHIAC has considered other evidence, it is linked to the appropriate recommendation below. It is also listed in the additional evidence section of this appendix. Recommendation 1: evidence
