absolute terms (and some signs of a widening in the gap in relative terms). In 2006 in Britain, smoking prevalence was twice as high among unskilled workers than among professionals (33% and 16% respectively among routine-and-manual and managerial-and-professional groups respectively [Office for National Statistics 2007]). Factors linked to health inequalities Factors such as poor living conditions, lower educational achievement and behaviours which damage health (such as smoking) lead to a greater than average risk of premature death, greater morbidity and lower life expectancy People in lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to adopt behaviours that may damage their health (Graham and Power 2004; Kawachi and Kennedy 1997; Wilkinson 1996). As a result, there is a steep social class gradient for many different conditions that affect health (DH 2008a). For example, the death rate from coronary heart disease (CHD) is 3 times higher among unskilled workers than among professionals. Similarly, deaths from lung cancer are 4 times higher among unskilled male manual workers of working age than among professional men (reflecting the fact that smoking is much more common among male manual workers than their professional counterparts; Twigg et al. 2004).
