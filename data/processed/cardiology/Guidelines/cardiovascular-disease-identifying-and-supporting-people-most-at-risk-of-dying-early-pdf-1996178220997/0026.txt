Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

rule. • PHIAC considers that evaluation (including evaluation of the impact of services on different subgroups) should be an integral part of new policies and services. • The recommendations made in this guidance aim to support and complement other initiatives to reduce premature mortality. Of particular relevance is the coordinated vascular disease control programme commissioned by the UK National Screening Committee. This is set out in the UK National Screening Committee's handbook for vascular risk assessment, risk reduction and risk management. The aim is to identify and reduce the risk of CVD in the general population. Also of relevance is the Department of Health's vascular checks programme, announced in January 2008. This focuses on everyone aged between 40 and 74. Recommendations for research PHIAC recommends that the following research questions should be addressed in order to the improve the evidence relating to finding, supporting and retaining those most at risk of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other smoking-related diseases and improving their access to services. It notes that 'effectiveness' in this context relates not only to the size of the effect, but also to the cost effectiveness, duration of effect and harmful/negative effects. 1 Proactive case-finding and retention
