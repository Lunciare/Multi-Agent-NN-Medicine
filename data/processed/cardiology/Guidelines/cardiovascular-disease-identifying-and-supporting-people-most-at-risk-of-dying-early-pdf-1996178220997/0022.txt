For example, simply improving services does not guarantee that they will be used by those most in need of them. Nor will it necessarily increase the number of people who follow treatments they have agreed to. Considerations PHIAC took account of a number of factors and issues in making the recommendations. • PHIAC considers a cross-government approach is required to tackle health inequalities and that high quality public services can make an important contribution. Although relatively narrow in scope, PHIAC considers that the interventions in this guidance will make a contribution to reducing health inequalities, particularly if set within wider health promoting policies (such as tobacco control and healthy eating). • The prevalence of diseases with a strong socioeconomic gradient may vary from one location to another. PHIAC recognises that people who are disadvantaged (specifically, those with a higher-than-average risk of premature death from smoking- related diseases and cardiovascular disease [CVD] from other causes) are not necessarily located in areas defined as disadvantaged. The guidance, therefore, is applicable to these people – regardless of where they live. • PHIAC is mindful that a lack of resources
