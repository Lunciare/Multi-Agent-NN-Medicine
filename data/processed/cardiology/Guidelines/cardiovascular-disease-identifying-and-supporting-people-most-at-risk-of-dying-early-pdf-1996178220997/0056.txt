brief versus more intensive intervention (++) and 1 of proactive telephone support (-) provide little evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions. One US descriptive study (-) described the reach of a multifaceted pregnancy campaign but reported no outcomes. The UK studies are directly applicable to the target population, although only 1 of these focused on pregnant smokers in disadvantaged areas. Evidence Statement 1ST There is evidence from 3 case studies suggesting interventions inviting specific populations (South Asians, homeless people or patients with psychosis) to attend risk screening at their GP practice or primary care clinic may identify a number of people at risk of coronary heart disease (outcomes reported in 2 case studies [+], [-]). However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on how well such interventions are attended due to poor reporting of participation rates (outcomes reported in 3 case studies: 2 [+] and 1 [-]). Evidence Statement 2ST There is evidence from 1 small case study (+) that screening long-term psychiatric hospital patients can identify previously undetected CHD. Screening 64 patients identified 1 new case of established CHD and 22 previously undetected test abnormalities. Participation in the intervention was high (66%) but only a small proportion
