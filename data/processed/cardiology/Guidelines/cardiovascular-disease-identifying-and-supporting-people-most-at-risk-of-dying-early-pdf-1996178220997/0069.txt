is cost effective if more than 14% of the population is at risk. For example, when 40% were at risk of CVD, primary prevention was estimated to cost £8,500 per QALY gained (£4,900 per QALY for finding the person and £3,600 per QALY for treating them). This compared with about £125,600 when only 1.6% were at risk (£122,000 per QALY for finding them and £3,600 per QALY for treating them). Fieldwork findings Fieldwork aimed to test the relevance, usefulness and the feasibility of implementing the recommendations and the findings were considered by PHIAC in developing the final recommendations. For details, go to the fieldwork section in appendix B and 'Reducing the rate of premature deaths from CVD and other smoking-related diseases: finding and supporting those most at risk and improving access to services'. Fieldwork participants who work with adults who are disadvantaged (in particular, those who smoke and/or are eligible for statins and/or are at high risk of CVD due to other factors) were very positive about the recommendations. Some said they will support work already being carried out in this area. Participants felt that incentives had a role to play in helping to encourage people who are disadvantaged to
