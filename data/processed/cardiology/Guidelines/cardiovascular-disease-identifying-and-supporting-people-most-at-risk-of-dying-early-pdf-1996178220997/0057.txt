undetected CHD. Screening 64 patients identified 1 new case of established CHD and 22 previously undetected test abnormalities. Participation in the intervention was high (66%) but only a small proportion consented to having blood tests. Evidence Statement 3ST There is evidence from 1 RCT (+) that in an area of deprivation, postal prompts to patients and their GPs following an acute coronary event, improves monitoring of the patient's risk and the likelihood of the patient having at least 1 consultation with their GP or nurse. Evidence Statement 4ST There is evidence from 1 case study (+) to suggest that, in an area of deprivation, a project funding a nurse and exercise worker to develop practice nurse and GP skills in identifying and monitoring patients and facilitate the provision of exercise facilities for CHD patients, may lead to a small improvement in cholesterol testing of patients. 72.5% of control patients reported receiving cholesterol tests in the past year compared to 77.8% of the intervention group, p=0.002. No differences were seen in blood pressure measurement. Evidence Statement 5ST There is weak quality evidence from 2 case studies (both [-]) to suggest that offering cardiovascular risk assessment opportunistically to African-Caribbean general practice patients,
