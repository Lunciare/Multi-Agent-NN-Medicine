Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early

sites identified 31.4% with elevated blood pressure and 10.7% with severely elevated blood pressure. Transferability and cost effectiveness of such interventions requires further study. Evidence Statement 11ST There is evidence from 2 case studies evaluating phase 1 (+) and phase 2 (-) of the Well- Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) programme to suggest that adding cardiovascular screening to state breast and cervical cancer screening programmes reaches financially disadvantaged and minority ethnic women and identifies a number at risk of CHD.

Applicability and transferability of these programmes to a UK setting requires further study. Evidence Statement 12ST Evidence from 3 studies (2 case studies [+] and 1 uncontrolled before- and-after study [+]) suggests that culturally sensitive education sessions that include an element of cardiovascular risk assessment may be effective in the identification of at-risk individuals. Two moderate-quality studies evaluated educational interventions in black and minority community groups (+) and Turkish immigrants at a mosque (+) offering blood pressure measurements. Participation with blood pressure measurements were high, and revealed a number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension or with elevated
