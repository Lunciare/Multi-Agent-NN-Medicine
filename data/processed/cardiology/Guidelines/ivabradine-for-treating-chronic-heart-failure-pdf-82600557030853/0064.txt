Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

to the NHS in Wales on implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE technology appraisal guidance recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 2 months of the first publication of the final draft guidance. 5.3 When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. This means that, if a patient has chronic heart failure and the healthcare professional responsible for their care thinks that ivabradine is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations.
