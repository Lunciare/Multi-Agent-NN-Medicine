Therefore, the committee concluded that ivabradine should only be initiated in people with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, normally shown on an echocardiogram. 4.14 The committee considered how ivabradine will be prescribed in clinical practice. It heard from clinical specialists that a heart failure specialist in secondary care with access to a multidisciplinary team should initiate ivabradine. The clinical specialists also stated that titration and monitoring of ivabradine could then take place in primary care by a GP with a special interest in heart failure or a heart failure specialist nurse, supported by a multidisciplinary team. They highlighted that this may help ensure the appropriate patients are treated with ivabradine after optimising treatment and stabilising patients on maximally tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. However, the manufacturer anticipated that ivabradine would be prescribed by a clinician experienced in managing chronic heart failure as recommended in the summary of product characteristics. The committee discussed the emergence of increasing heart failure expertise outside secondary care. It noted that NICE's previous guideline on chronic heart failure (now replaced by NICE's
