to 4 with systolic dysfunction, for people in sinus rhythm whose heart rate is 75 bpm or more, and in combination with standard therapy including beta- blocker therapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated. The committee heard from the clinical specialists that ACE inhibitors, beta- blockers and aldosterone antagonists used routinely for managing chronic heart failure should always be the initial treatments, because there is robust evidence that they are effective in managing chronic heart failure and improving survival. The clinical specialists all agreed that ivabradine is an additional therapy for a subset of people with chronic heart failure who are in sinus rhythm, and not as a replacement for the recommended standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. They suggested that ivabradine should be considered only when patients are still symptomatic after being stabilised on optimal initial standard therapies at maximally tolerated doses, or when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. The clinical specialists expressed their concerns that introducing ivabradine earlier than specified in the marketing authorisation would limit efforts to optimise the use of other standard drugs, particularly beta-blockers. They stressed the need for enough time to titrate beta-blockers to optimal doses
