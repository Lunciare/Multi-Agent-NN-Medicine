Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

was associated with an improvement in NYHA class in the population covered by the marketing authorisation at their last visit compared with their baseline classification and that it had little impact on the proportion of patients with worsening NYHA classification. 3.21 The ERG noted that treatment-related adverse events occurred more frequently in the ivabradine group (17.8%) than in the placebo group (8.3%) in the main trial population. It felt that this was likely to be the same for the population covered by the marketing authorisation because the most common adverse events were the same as in the main trial population. The ERG highlighted that the reported adverse events (apart from inadequate blood pressure control) were similar to those reported in the BEAUTIFUL trial (10,917 randomised patients), which assessed the effects of ivabradine plus standard care in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 3.22 The ERG carried out an exploratory analysis of the data provided by the manufacturer after the clarification request on the primary and secondary outcomes of the population covered by the marketing authorisation according to their beta-blocker dosage at randomisation (that is, no beta-blocker, less than 25% of target beta-blocker dose, 25% or more
