cardiac resynchronisation therapy, and concluded that the decision will likely be based on the judgement of the treating clinician. 4.13 The committee considered the comments from the consultees and commentators that ivabradine should only be given to people with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less. It noted that the patients in SHIFT had left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was associated with an ejection fraction of 35% or less, and it was aware that this was an entry criterion for the trial. The committee was aware that an ejection fraction level was not specified in the marketing authorisation for ivabradine. However, it considered that ivabradine could not be recommended in people with an ejection fraction that is above 35% because there is no evidence of its effectiveness in that group. The committee discussed how the ejection fraction level will be determined in clinical practice and whether the required tests will be readily available to people who will potentially benefit from ivabradine. It heard that ejection fraction level is usually demonstrated with an echocardiogram and additional tests will not necessarily be required before initiating ivabradine. Therefore, the committee concluded that ivabradine should only be initiated in people with a
