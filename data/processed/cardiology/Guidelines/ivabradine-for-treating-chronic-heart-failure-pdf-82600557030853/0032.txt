Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

effect of ivabradine on quality of life (£6,283 to £9,253 per QALY gained). Changes in hospital length of stay and ivabradine treatment effect on NYHA class had much less impact on the ICER, £6,938 to £8,549 and £7,232 to £8,349 per QALY gained respectively. 3.34 The manufacturer's probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ivabradine plus standard care would have a more than 95% chance of being cost effective compared with standard care alone if the maximum acceptable ICER was £20,000 per QALY gained. 3.35 The manufacturer carried out different scenario analyses to manage uncertainties about some of the assumptions in the base-case model. The scenario analyses explored the effect on the ICER of: varying the treatment duration of ivabradine; ivabradine's treatment effect stopping after 5 and 10 years; using alternative models to estimate the risk of cardiovascular mortality; increasing the median length of hospital stay based on the 'National heart failure audit' data; and excluding the costs of the titration visit and the ECG. The manufacturer also carried out other scenario analyses, including: using a within-trial time horizon; using external data to extrapolate cardiovascular mortality and utility values; including age-adjusted utility values; and assuming a 5% change in the distribution of
