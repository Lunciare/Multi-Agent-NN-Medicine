Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

1 Recommendations 1.1 Ivabradine is recommended as an option for treating chronic heart failure for people: • with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 to 4 stable chronic heart failure with systolic dysfunction and • who are in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (bpm) or more and • who are given ivabradine in combination with standard therapy including beta-blocker therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists, or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated and • with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less. 1.2 Ivabradine should only be initiated after a stabilisation period of 4 weeks on optimised standard therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. 1.3 Ivabradine should be initiated by a heart failure specialist with access to a multidisciplinary heart failure team. Dose titration and monitoring should be carried out by a heart failure specialist, or in primary care by either a GP with a special interest in heart failure or a heart failure specialist nurse. 2 The technology 2.1 Ivabradine (Procoralan, Servier Laboratories) is a heart-rate-lowering agent that selectively and specifically inhibits the cardiac pacemaker If current, which controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in
