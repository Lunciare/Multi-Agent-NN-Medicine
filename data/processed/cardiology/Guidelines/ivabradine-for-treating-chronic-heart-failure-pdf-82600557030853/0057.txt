model reflected UK practice. The committee was aware that the sensitivity analyses conducted by the manufacturer were robust for the base-case estimate, except for the risk of cardiovascular mortality (see sections 3.33 and 3.35), and that the ICERs for all the subgroup analyses were below £11,000 per QALY gained. The committee concluded that the manufacturer's model was robust and the assumptions were realistic and conservative. 4.17 The committee considered the uncertainty around the benefit of ivabradine on cardiovascular mortality given that the ICER ranged between approximately £5,600 and £40,600 per QALY gained when the risk of cardiovascular mortality was varied using the 95% confidence interval around the mean from the trial data. The committee noted the ERG's comments that there were uncertainties associated with the regression analyses for cardiovascular and heart failure mortality used in the economic model presented by the manufacturer. The committee noted that the treatment effect of ivabradine in the regression analysis had a p value of 0.38 for cardiovascular mortality and a p value of 0.06 for heart failure mortality. For the population covered by the marketing authorisation in the clinical effectiveness analysis, the p value for cardiovascular mortality was 0.02, and for heart failure mortality
