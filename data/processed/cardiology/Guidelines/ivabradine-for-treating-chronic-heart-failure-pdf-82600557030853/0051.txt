The committee re-emphasised their conclusion in section 4.9 on the importance of optimising beta-blockers before initiating ivabradine. 4.11 The committee also considered the comments from consultees and commentators that there is a recent analysis that shows that digoxin may confer benefits similar to ivabradine for patients in sinus rhythm and with heart failure caused by left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, the committee noted that digoxin was not included as a comparator in the scope for this appraisal and there was no evidence to support its benefit in this population. The committee concluded that considering digoxin as a comparator to ivabradine is beyond the scope of this appraisal. 4.12 The committee also considered the position of cardiac devices, particularly cardiac resynchronisation therapy, in the treatment pathway for chronic heart failure because the manufacturer proposed positioning ivabradine before them. The clinical specialists were uncertain about this and proposed several different options about the most
