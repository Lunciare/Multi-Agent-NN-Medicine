It also noted that it would be unusual for people with heart failure to have hypotensive symptoms with this level of blood pressure. It noted the ERG's comment that it has been reported that only 3% to 5% of patients eligible for treatment with beta-blockers are unable to tolerate them because of hypotension or bradycardia. The committee concluded that ivabradine plus standard care had a manageable adverse event profile in the population covered by the marketing authorisation. 4.7 The committee examined the exploratory analysis performed by the ERG on the efficacy of ivabradine according to beta-blocker dose received by the population covered by the marketing authorisation in SHIFT. The committee noted the impact of the beta-blocker doses on the effectiveness of ivabradine, particularly in terms of cardiovascular mortality. However, the committee agreed that this
