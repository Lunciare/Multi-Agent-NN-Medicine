Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

for heart failure mortality. For the population covered by the marketing authorisation in the clinical effectiveness analysis, the p value for cardiovascular mortality was 0.02, and for heart failure mortality was less than 0.01. On the other hand, beta-blockers given at 50% or more of the target dose were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular mortality, and beta-blockers at all doses were associated with statistically significant reductions in the risk of heart failure mortality. The committee considered that this further highlights the importance of optimising beta-blocker therapy before treatment with ivabradine. However, the committee noted the ERG's comment that the absence of a statistically significant effect with ivabradine in the model may be a result of the adjustment of patient characteristics not accounted for in the clinical analysis. The committee was also aware that the manufacturer's regression analyses were conservative in favour of placebo, which made the analyses likely to underestimate the risks of cardiovascular and heart failure mortality, and so generated different results from those observed in the population covered by the marketing authorisation of the SHIFT trial. The committee concluded that the additional treatment effect of ivabradine was uncertain compared with the effect
