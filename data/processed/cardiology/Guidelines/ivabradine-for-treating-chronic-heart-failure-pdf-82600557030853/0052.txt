Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

the treatment pathway for chronic heart failure because the manufacturer proposed positioning ivabradine before them. The clinical specialists were uncertain about this and proposed several different options about the most appropriate choice if people still have symptoms after they are treated with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists. The committee noted that very few patients in SHIFT received cardiac resynchronisation therapy. It therefore considered that more evidence would be useful to determine the position of ivabradine in relation to cardiac devices, particularly cardiac resynchronisation therapy, in the treatment pathway. However, the clinical specialists said that choosing whether to treat with ivabradine or cardiac resynchronisation therapy will depend on clinical need and that ivabradine will only be considered if the person is in sinus rhythm as indicated in ivabradine's marketing authorisation. The committee was aware that ivabradine is contraindicated in people whose heart rate is dependent on a pacemaker. The committee recognised that there was some uncertainty about the appropriate choice of treatment when people are eligible for both ivabradine and cardiac resynchronisation therapy, and concluded that the decision will likely be based on the judgement of the treating clinician. 4.13 The committee considered the comments from the consultees and commentators
