Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

problems (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, p<0.0001) • worsening heart failure (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80, p<0.0001) • hospital admission for any cause (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90, p<0.0001). 3.12 In the population covered by the marketing authorisation, heart rate decreased in the ivabradine and placebo groups by 17.4 bpm and 5.7 bpm at day 28 and 14.5 bpm, and 5.8 bpm at the last visit respectively. The manufacturer noted that the greater decrease in heart rate in the population covered by the marketing authorisation was consistent with a higher mean baseline heart rate of 84 bpm in this subgroup compared with 80 bpm in the main trial population. This was confirmed to be in line with previous ivabradine trials, which showed that greater reductions in heart rate are associated with higher resting heart rate. In this subgroup there was a statistically significant improvement in NYHA class in the ivabradine group compared with the placebo group. 3.13 Using the SHIFT-PRO study data, 3 types of quality-of-life analyses were performed. The first (main analysis) used '0' as the last post-baseline value for deceased patients, the second (an analysis of surviving patients) used the last post-baseline
