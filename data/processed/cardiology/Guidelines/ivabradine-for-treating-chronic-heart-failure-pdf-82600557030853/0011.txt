Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

the ivabradine group than in the placebo group (26.6% and 32.8% respectively, p<0.0001). The hazard ratio showed a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 24% in the risk of the composite endpoint for ivabradine compared with placebo (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85). This was in line with the predefined subgroup analysis on median heart rate, which revealed that baseline heart rate modified the treatment effect of ivabradine. 3.11 There was a statistically significant improvement in all secondary outcomes for the population covered by the marketing authorisation, unlike for the main SHIFT population in whom some of the secondary outcomes were not statistically significant. There were statistically significant reductions in all mortality outcomes in the ivabradine group compared with placebo as follows: • cardiovascular death (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97, p=0.0166) • heart failure death (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81, p=0.0006) • all-cause death (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, p=0.0109). Results similarly favoured ivabradine compared with placebo for: • hospital admission for cardiovascular problems (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88, p<0.0001) • worsening heart failure (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80, p<0.0001) • hospital admission for any cause (HR 0.82; 95%
