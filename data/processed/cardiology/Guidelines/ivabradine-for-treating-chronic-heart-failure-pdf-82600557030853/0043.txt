assessed. This included cardiovascular death, which reduced by 17% with ivabradine compared with placebo, unlike in the main SHIFT population, in which the 9% reduction in cardiovascular death was not statistically significant. The committee was aware that baseline resting heart rate was not a stratification factor at randomisation and that this subgroup was identified post hoc, but it was also aware that recommendations could only be made within ivabradine's marketing authorisation. The committee concluded that SHIFT was well conducted and there was it was plausible biologically that a statistically significant mortality benefit will be observed in the subgroup of people with a baseline resting heart rate of 75 bpm or more, which reflects the marketing authorisation of ivabradine. However, they were aware the evidence presented should be interpreted with a level of caution because the subgroup was identified post hoc. 4.5 The committee noted that a previous hospital admission for worsening heart failure in the past 12 months was an inclusion criterion for SHIFT. The committee agreed that this was an important consideration because people with a prior hospital admission in the past 12 months may have more severe chronic heart failure than would be observed in clinical practice, with
