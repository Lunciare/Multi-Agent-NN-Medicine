Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

model, which suggested that ivabradine has a large impact in reducing hospital admissions. The committee agreed that the wide range of sensitivity and subgroup analyses conducted by the manufacturer sufficiently addressed any areas of uncertainty in the economic analysis, including the beta-blocker subgroups, and all produced ICERs below £11,000 per QALY gained. It also considered that the modelled results and most of the model assumptions were conservative and biased against ivabradine. The committee therefore concluded that the manufacturer's ICER estimate of approximately £8,500 per QALY gained was plausible and was likely to represent the expected cost effectiveness of adding ivabradine to standard care for treating chronic heart failure in the population covered by the marketing authorisation. 4.19 The committee recognised the novel mode of action of ivabradine as a heart- rate-lowering agent for patients in sinus rhythm for whom beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. It also considered the manufacturer's comment that ivabradine is the only non-surgical treatment available for people with chronic heart failure whose prognosis remains poor after recommended optimised therapy for chronic heart failure. However, the committee considered that there were no additional gains in health-related quality of life over those already included in the QALY calculations.
