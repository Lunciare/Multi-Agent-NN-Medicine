Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

admission for worsening heart failure was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for beta-blocker intake at randomisation. The hazard ratio (HR) estimate was 0.82; (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.90, p<0.0001), representing a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 18% for ivabradine compared with placebo. This composite endpoint was driven more by the rate of hospital admission for worsening heart failure (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83) than by the rate of cardiovascular death (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03) because people are often admitted to hospital before they die. 3.9 Further analysis was carried out by the manufacturer to assess the impact of baseline beta-blocker dose on the efficacy of ivabradine in the main SHIFT population. For the primary composite endpoint, the relative effects of ivabradine compared with placebo for the 5 categories of beta-blocker intake were: • HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93, p=0.012 (no beta-blocker) • HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92, p=0.007 (less than 25% of target dose) • HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, p=0.029 (25% or more but less than 50% of target dose) • HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07, p=0.193 (50% or more
