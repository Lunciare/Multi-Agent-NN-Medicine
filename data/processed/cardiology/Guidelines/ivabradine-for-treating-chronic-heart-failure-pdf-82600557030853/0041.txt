Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

people with more severe chronic heart failure than the typical chronic heart failure population in the UK. It also noted that only a few people from the UK were included in the trial and the use of cardiac devices in the trial was low. The clinical specialists and the ERG indicated that the differences in age and severity of chronic heart failure may be caused by patient recruitment from specialist heart failure centres, which is common with randomised trials. The committee considered the comments from the clinical specialists and the ERG that the results of the trial could be extrapolated to a UK setting because the standard therapies used in SHIFT could be regarded as optimal and were given at similar dosing levels to UK clinical practice. Despite the differences between the trial and the UK population, the committee concluded that SHIFT was relevant to UK clinical practice. 4.4 The committee examined the clinical evidence from SHIFT, which compared ivabradine plus standard care with standard care plus placebo. The committee noted that it was a well-conducted clinical trial and that the relevant clinical outcomes of mortality and hospital admission were assessed. It also noted that health-related quality-of-life data were collected
