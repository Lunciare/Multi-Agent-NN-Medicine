Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

nurse. 2 The technology 2.1 Ivabradine (Procoralan, Servier Laboratories) is a heart-rate-lowering agent that selectively and specifically inhibits the cardiac pacemaker If current, which controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node that regulates the heart rate. Ivabradine is 'indicated in chronic heart failure NYHA class 2 to 4 with systolic dysfunction, in patients in sinus rhythm and whose heart rate is 75 bpm or higher, in combination with standard therapy including beta-blocker therapy or when beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated'. Ivabradine is administered orally at a recommended starting dose of 5 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased after 2 weeks of treatment to 7.5 mg twice daily if the resting heart rate is above 60 bpm, or decreased to 2.5 mg (half of the 5 mg tablet) twice daily if the resting heart rate is below 50 bpm.
