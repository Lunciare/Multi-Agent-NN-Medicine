Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

failure duration, level of left ventricular ejection fraction, and prior medical history (coronary artery disease and diabetes). The results showed that ivabradine plus standard care was still cost effective when compared with standard care alone. The estimated ICERs for the subgroups were all below £11,000 per QALY gained and ranged from £5,197 to £10,427 per QALY gained. The manufacturer also carried out additional subgroup analyses based on a population representative of a UK chronic heart failure patient group. This population was specified as western European men with a median age of 78 years, receiving at least half the target dose of beta-blockers. The ICER generated for this subgroup was £8,735 per QALY gained, and the ICER for a UK chronic heart failure patient group taking the target dose of beta-blockers was £9,185 per QALY gained. Evidence review group comments 3.37 The ERG was satisfied with the manufacturer's modelling approach, which was transparent, used patient-level data and was consistent with other published economic studies on heart failure treatments. The ERG stated that the manufacturer did not carry out an analysis in a patient population with a disease severity reflective of the UK population. However, it agreed with the manufacturer that using
