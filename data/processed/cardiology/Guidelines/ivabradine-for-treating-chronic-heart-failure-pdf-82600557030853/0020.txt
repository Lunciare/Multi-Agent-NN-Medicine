Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

outcomes of the population covered by the marketing authorisation according to their beta-blocker dosage at randomisation (that is, no beta-blocker, less than 25% of target beta-blocker dose, 25% or more but less than 50% of target beta- blocker dose, 50% or more but less than 100% of target beta-blocker dose and 100% or more of target beta-blocker dose).The ERG highlighted that their exploratory analyses suggest that there is uncertainty around the benefit of ivabradine plus standard care for patients with a resting heart rate of 75 bpm or more and who are receiving at least 25% of beta-blockers. The ERG also explored the efficacy of ivabradine according to NYHA class and in patients aged 70 years or older. It noted that the analysis in the NYHA class 4 subgroup was based on small numbers, creating uncertainty about the benefit of ivabradine observed in this subgroup. Because the input data used in the exploratory analyses were marked as academic-in-confidence by the manufacturer, the results have also been marked as confidential and so cannot be shown here. However, the ERG emphasised that these analyses are speculative and based on subgroups of subgroups and should be interpreted with caution. Cost-effectiveness evidence 3.23 In
