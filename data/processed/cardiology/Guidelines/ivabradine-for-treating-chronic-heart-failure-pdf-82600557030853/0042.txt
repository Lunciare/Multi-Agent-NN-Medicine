noted that it was a well-conducted clinical trial and that the relevant clinical outcomes of mortality and hospital admission were assessed. It also noted that health-related quality-of-life data were collected in SHIFT-PRO using both generic and disease-specific instruments, and was aware that improved quality of life was an important outcome for chronic heart failure patients and that this is considered to be 1 of the main aims of managing chronic heart failure. The committee noted that the committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had asked the manufacturer to identify the heart rate threshold at which there was a significant mortality benefit with ivabradine, because this benefit was not observed in the main SHIFT population. So the manufacturer then examined a post hoc subgroup of people with a baseline resting heart rate of 75 bpm or more, and this subgroup formed the population for whom ivabradine has a marketing authorisation. The committee noted that the results from this subgroup demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in all primary and secondary endpoints assessed. This included cardiovascular death, which reduced by 17% with ivabradine compared with placebo, unlike in the main SHIFT population, in which the 9% reduction in cardiovascular death was not
