analyses, including: using a within-trial time horizon; using external data to extrapolate cardiovascular mortality and utility values; including age-adjusted utility values; and assuming a 5% change in the distribution of NYHA classes (from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 3 to 4) in the post-trial period. After a clarification request, the manufacturer also provided a scenario analysis in which a new regression equation was developed to predict NYHA class distribution. This was adjusted for treatment, time covariates and patient baseline characteristics, and drug prices were updated to those in BNF 63. These scenario analyses all gave ICERs below £9,000 per QALY gained except for the assumptions of the treatment effect of ivabradine stopping after 5 and 10 years and using the within-trial time horizon, which gave ICERs ranging from £13,964 to £15,200 per QALY gained. 3.36 The manufacturer carried out several subgroup analyses based on individual patient characteristics from the population covered by the marketing authorisation. These subgroups were based on age, NYHA class, beta-blocker doses, heart failure duration, level of left ventricular ejection fraction, and prior medical history (coronary artery disease and diabetes). The results showed that ivabradine plus standard care was still cost effective when
