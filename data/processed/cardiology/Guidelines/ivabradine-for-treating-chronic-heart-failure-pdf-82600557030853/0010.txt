Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98, p=0.029 (25% or more but less than 50% of target dose) • HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07, p=0.193 (50% or more but less than 100% of target dose) and • HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24, p=0.913 (100% or more of target dose). There were similar trends in efficacy for ivabradine compared with placebo across the beta-blocker categories for the component outcomes of hospital admission for worsening heart failure and cardiovascular death. The manufacturer noted that this could be a result of lower doses of beta- blockers being associated with higher heart rate because beta-blockers primarily reduce heart rate. There were no statistically significant differences across the beta-blocker categories. These findings suggest that the efficacy of ivabradine is primarily driven by heart rate and not by beta-blocker dose. Population covered by the marketing authorisation 3.10 In the subgroup with a baseline heart rate of 75 bpm or more, the incidence of the primary composite endpoint was statistically significantly lower in the ivabradine group than in the placebo group (26.6% and 32.8% respectively, p<0.0001). The hazard ratio showed a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 24% in the risk of the
