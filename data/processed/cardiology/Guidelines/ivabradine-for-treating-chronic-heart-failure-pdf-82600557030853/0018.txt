Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

ERG was aware that only approximately 26% of the main trial population and the population covered by the marketing authorisation were each treated with the recommended target dose of beta-blocker, and 55.4% of the trial population covered by the marketing authorisation were treated with 50% or more of the recommended dose of beta-blocker despite the recommendations in the SHIFT protocol. It was concerned that the patients who were not treated with the target dose of beta-blocker may not have been optimally treated. The ERG also noted the low use of cardiac devices in SHIFT and considered that this could have resulted from the exclusion of patients with pacemakers from the trial. 3.20 The ERG noted that the greatest benefit of ivabradine compared with placebo was in reducing heart failure deaths (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81, p=0.0006), which supports the observation that the results were generally driven by the cause-specific endpoints of hospital admission for heart failure and heart failure deaths in both populations. The ERG noted that ivabradine was associated with an improvement in NYHA class in the population covered by the marketing authorisation at their last visit compared with their baseline classification and that it had little
