patient profiles from SHIFT to the risk equations sequentially, 1 at a time. It showed that the incremental costs and incremental QALYs gained from treating chronic heart failure with ivabradine plus standard care compared with standard care alone were £2,376 and 0.28 QALYs respectively. This gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £8,498 per QALY gained. 3.33 The manufacturer highlighted that the deterministic, probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses were performed using average covariate values in the regression equations to shorten analysis time and that this may have caused some loss in accuracy in the ICER estimates. The base-case ICER using this method was £7,743 per QALY gained. The one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed on several model parameters using their 95% confidence intervals. The cost-effectiveness result was most sensitive to changes in cardiovascular mortality risk, with the resulting ICERs ranging from £5,655 to £40,638 per QALY gained. The base-case ICER also showed some sensitivity to changes in the rate of hospital admission (£6,384 to £10,424 per QALY gained) and treatment effect of ivabradine on quality of life (£6,283 to £9,253 per QALY gained). Changes in hospital length of stay and ivabradine treatment effect on NYHA class had much less impact
