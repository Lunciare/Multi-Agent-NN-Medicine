Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

those observed in the population covered by the marketing authorisation of the SHIFT trial. The committee concluded that the additional treatment effect of ivabradine was uncertain compared with the effect of beta-blocker doses. 4.18 The committee considered whether the base-case ICER of approximately £8,500 per QALY gained (incremental cost of approximately £2,400 and incremental QALY of 0.28) of adding ivabradine to standard care estimated by the manufacturer was the most plausible ICER. The committee considered that the ICER suggested that ivabradine was cost effective if a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained was applied. The committee considered that the effect of ivabradine on the hospital admission endpoints was the key driver of the cost effectiveness of ivabradine plus standard care compared with standard care alone. It noted that ivabradine plus standard care was more effective and cost more than standard care. Additionally, it noted that ivabradine was still accruing more QALYs when the confidence interval for the hazard ratio for mortality crossed 1 and favoured standard care alone in the model, which suggested that ivabradine has a large impact in reducing hospital admissions. The committee agreed that the wide range of sensitivity and subgroup analyses conducted by the manufacturer sufficiently
