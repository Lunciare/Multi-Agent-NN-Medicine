of quality-of-life analyses were performed. The first (main analysis) used '0' as the last post-baseline value for deceased patients, the second (an analysis of surviving patients) used the last post-baseline value for deceased patients, and the third used the change from baseline to month 12 from the main analysis. For the EQ-5D index score measure, quality of life worsened from baseline to the last assessment in the ivabradine group and the placebo group in the main analysis. However, there was an improvement in quality of life from baseline to the last assessment for the analysis of surviving patients in the 2 groups, with a greater improvement in the ivabradine group. The quality-of-life improvement from baseline to month 12 in both groups was higher in the ivabradine group. The manufacturer suggested that this was because there were fewer deaths during the first 12 months than during the whole study. 3.14 A mixed regression model was used to estimate quality of life using EQ-5D index scores with UK population tariff values. This showed that quality of life improved in the ivabradine group for the population covered by the marketing authorisation. The KCCQ disease-specific measure was also used and it showed a statistically
