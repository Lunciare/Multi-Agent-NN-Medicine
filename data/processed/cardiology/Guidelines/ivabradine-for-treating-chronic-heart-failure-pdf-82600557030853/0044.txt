an important consideration because people with a prior hospital admission in the past 12 months may have more severe chronic heart failure than would be observed in clinical practice, with a higher risk of further hospitalisations, which was the key driver of the clinical and cost-effectiveness estimates. The committee noted that the marketing authorisation for ivabradine depended on the efficacy of ivabradine in a specific post hoc subgroup with more severe heart failure (with a baseline heart rate of 75 bpm or more) to demonstrate a cardiovascular mortality benefit. The committee heard from the clinical specialists that prior hospital admission should not be a factor for considering ivabradine treatment because there are no data to prove that the efficacy of ivabradine is limited to the population who have been admitted to hospital in the previous 12 months. The clinical specialists also highlighted that people had to be stabilised for 4 weeks on standard therapy as an entry criterion into the trial. The committee considered that prior hospital admission did not affect mortality, and the marketing authorisation did not make any reference to prior admission status. The committee was aware that ivabradine was contraindicated for people with unstable heart failure. Therefore,
