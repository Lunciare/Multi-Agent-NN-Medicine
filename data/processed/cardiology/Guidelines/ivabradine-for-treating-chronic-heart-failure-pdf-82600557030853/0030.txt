Ivabradine for treating chronic heart failure

costs in administering ivabradine and the standard care drugs. However, additional costs were included for ivabradine therapy titration (1 specialist visit) and an electrocardiogram (ECG). This increased the total monthly cost in the ivabradine group from £52 to £202 for the first month. 3.31 The hospital admission costs used in the model were estimated using the NHS reference costs for heart failure admissions (general ward: £2,308 and cardiac ward: £3,295), cardiovascular admissions (general ward: £1,942 and cardiac ward: £1,730) and non-cardiovascular admissions (general ward: £2,644). It was assumed that there was an equal probability of being in a general ward or a cardiac ward. Serious adverse events were captured using these hospital admission endpoints, but non-serious adverse events were not included. The monthly cost of managing heart failure, including physician visits, outpatient procedures and diagnostic tests, was estimated to be £27 from British Heart Foundation statistics. 3.32 The base-case results of the economic analysis, which was based on the population covered by the marketing authorisation, was estimated by applying individual patient profiles from SHIFT to the risk equations sequentially, 1 at a time. It showed that the incremental costs and incremental QALYs gained from treating chronic heart failure with ivabradine
