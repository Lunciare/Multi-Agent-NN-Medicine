However, they agreed that, on the basis of the evidence reviewed, it was appropriate to use a threshold of 8 mg/mmol for pregnant women.

Therefore, they made a recommendation to consider repeating the ACR measurement if there was ongoing clinical uncertainty about the diagnosis. No evidence was reviewed that examined the timing of repeat testing for either ACR or PCR, and so no recommendations could be made regarding this.
