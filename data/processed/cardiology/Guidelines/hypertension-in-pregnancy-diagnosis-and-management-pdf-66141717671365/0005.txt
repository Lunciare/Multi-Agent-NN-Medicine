for dipstick screening for proteinuria in pregnant women in secondary care settings. [2019] 1.2.3 If dipstick screening is positive (1+ or more), use albumin:creatinine ratio or protein:creatinine ratio to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women. [2019] 1.2.4 Do not use first morning urine void to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women. [2019] 1.2.5 Do not routinely use 24-hour urine collection to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women. [2019] 1.2.6 If using protein:creatinine ratio to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women: • use 30 mg/mmol as a threshold for significant proteinuria • if the result is 30 mg/mmol or above and there is still uncertainty about the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re-testing on a new sample, alongside clinical review. [2019] 1.2.7 If using albumin:creatinine ratio as an alternative to protein:creatinine ratio to diagnose pre-eclampsia in pregnant women with hypertension: • use 8 mg/mmol as a diagnostic threshold • if the result is 8 mg/mmol or above and there is still uncertainty about the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re-testing on a new sample, alongside clinical review. [2019] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on assessment of proteinuria. Full
