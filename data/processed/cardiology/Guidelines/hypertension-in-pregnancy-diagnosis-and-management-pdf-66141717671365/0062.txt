models can help identify women at different risks of adverse outcomes because of pre-eclampsia. There was more extensive validation of the fullPIERS model, and the validation studies were conducted in populations from a range of healthcare settings. The PREP-S model had been developed using a UK population, and validated using data from similar multinational settings. It was noted that further validation of PREP-S was unlikely to be conducted, because of the cost of conducting these studies. The committee therefore agreed that both models could be considered as options, in addition to a full clinical assessment, to help guide decisions relating to interventions and place of care. The tools predict adverse outcomes in women, but are not designed to predict outcomes for babies. The committee agreed it was important to highlight this. How the recommendations might affect practice The use of a full clinical assessment and validated models to predict risk may improve consistency in current practice with regard to admission to hospital for women with pre- eclampsia. Some centres offer admission to all women with pre-eclampsia, whereas others only offer it to a small proportion of women. The guidance might increase the number of women who are admitted to hospital
