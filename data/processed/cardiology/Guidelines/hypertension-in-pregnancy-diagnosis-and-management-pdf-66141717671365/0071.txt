Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management

2010 guideline to be consistent with those agreed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). The aim of the 2019 guideline is to present updated evidence-based recommendations, relevant to practising clinicians, while identifying outstanding areas of uncertainty that need further research. There is a strong argument for uptake of these new guidelines into clinical practice, in order to minimise unnecessary variance and provide optimal care for women and their babies. In doing this, low rates of maternal mortality should be maintained, and progress on reduction of maternal morbidity and perinatal morbidity and mortality can be pursued.
