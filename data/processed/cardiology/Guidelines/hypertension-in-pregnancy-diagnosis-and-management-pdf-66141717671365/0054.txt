Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management

committee agreed it should not be ruled out entirely. There was good evidence that a PCR of 30 mg/mmol had good diagnostic accuracy, showing high sensitivity and specificity and should be used as the threshold for significant proteinuria. However, the committee recommended retesting for results above 30 mg/ mmol if there is still diagnostic uncertainty (for example, the woman has no other clinical signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia) because there is large variation in protein excretion during the day and from day to day. The committee agreed that this would prevent women being diagnosed with pre-eclampsia on the basis of a single raised PCR result. Evidence from a single study showed high sensitivity and specificity for an ACR result of 8 mg/mmol to diagnose proteinuria. However, the committee were also aware of further results from a large, UK-based study, which provided further evidence for the efficacy of a threshold of 8 mg/mmol in the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia. The committee were aware that this threshold is different to that used for detection of microalbuminuria in the non-pregnant population. However, they agreed that, on the basis of the evidence reviewed, it was appropriate to use a threshold of 8 mg/mmol for
