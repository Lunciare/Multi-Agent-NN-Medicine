who go on to develop complications from undiagnosed pre-eclampsia. Not all secondary care units currently use automated dipstick analysis to screen for proteinuria, so the recommendations might increase the need for automated reagent-strip reading devices. However, the accuracy and reliability of screening will be improved, reducing the need for further investigations for some women and correctly identifying more women who need further testing or investigations. Moving from 24-hour urine collection to spot urine ACR or PCR will save time, with potential for faster diagnosis, and a reduction in inaccuracies because of incomplete samples. It is also likely to improve quality of life, as the process of completing a 24-hour urine collection is time-consuming and awkward. A PCR of 30 mg/mmol is already used routinely as a diagnostic threshold and therefore should not change practice. Currently units may use different ACR levels for diagnosis and so the recommendation to use 8 mg/mmol will standardise practice. Recommendations have been made for the use of either ACR or PCR allowing local decisions to use whichever test is available, so this should not affect practice. Repeating the PCR or ACR test may incur a small additional cost. However, this should reduce the false positive
