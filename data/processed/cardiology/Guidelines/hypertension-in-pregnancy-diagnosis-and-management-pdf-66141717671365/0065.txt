These recommendations were based on those from the previous guideline, and expanded based on international guidelines, which were used by the committee in their clinical practice. Based on the data from HYPITAT-II study, the committee also agreed that pregnancies in women with pre-eclampsia could be managed with continued surveillance to 37 weeks, unless there were specific concerns or indications to offer a planned early birth before then. There was limited evidence to guide the best place of care for women with pre-eclampsia and their babies, so the committee made a research recommendation. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are in line with current best clinical practice, so are unlikely to cause a significant change in practice. Currently, some units admit all women with pre-eclampsia routinely, some only admit women who they believe to be at a high risk of complications, and some admit very few. Standardising practice could therefore increase or reduce the number of
