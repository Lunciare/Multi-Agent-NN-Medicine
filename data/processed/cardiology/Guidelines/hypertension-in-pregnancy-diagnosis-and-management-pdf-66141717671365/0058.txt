some very limited evidence of both benefits and harms for different antihypertensive medicines. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend one treatment over another. As labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa had been recommended in the previous guideline (for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia), and these medicines had been used for many years in pregnancy, the committee agreed they should be preferred treatment options for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Labetalol is specifically licensed for use in pregnancy and so is suggested as the first-line option, with nifedipine as the next alternative, and methyldopa as the third option (as it may lead to more side effects and be the least effective option of the 3).
