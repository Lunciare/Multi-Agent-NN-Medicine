epigastric pain • oliguria and severe hypertension • progressive deterioration in laboratory blood tests (such as rising creatinine or liver transaminases, or falling platelet count). [2010, amended 2019] 1.8.4 Use the Collaborative Eclampsia Trial regimen for administration of magnesium sulfate: • A loading dose of 4 g should be given intravenously over 5 to 15 minutes, followed by an infusion of 1 g/hour maintained for 24 hours. If the woman has had an eclamptic fit, the infusion should be continued for 24 hours after the last fit. • Recurrent fits should be treated with a further dose of 2 g to 4 g given intravenously over 5 to 15 minutes. [2010, amended 2019] The MHRA has issued a warning about the risk of skeletal adverse effects in the neonate following prolonged or repeated use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy. Maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for longer than 5 to 7 days in pregnancy has been associated with skeletal adverse effects and hypocalcaemia and hypermagnesemia in neonates. If use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy is prolonged or repeated, consider monitoring of neonates for abnormal calcium and magnesium levels and skeletal adverse effects. 1.8.5 Do not use diazepam, phenytoin or other anticonvulsants
