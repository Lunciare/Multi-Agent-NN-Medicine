Based on their experience, the committee made recommendations on advice for women who wish to breastfeed while taking antihypertensives, and on the monitoring of babies whose mothers are taking antihypertensives. As there was very little evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antihypertensives for postnatal use, the committee revised the research recommendation made in the 2010 guideline.
