Short-term circulatory support
with left ventricular assist
devices as a bridge to cardiac
transplantation or recovery
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 28 June 2006
www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg177
1 Guidance
1.1 Limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of short-term circulatory
support with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to cardiac
transplantation or recovery appears adequate to support the use of this
procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for audit
and clinical governance.
1.2 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the high
complication rates associated with this procedure and that the
procedure is a temporary measure. In addition, use of NICE's information
for the public is recommended.
1.3 Publication of further research will be useful, particularly on the use of

Short-term circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to cardiac
transplantation or recovery (IPG177)
this procedure in patients with cardiogenic shock following acute
myocardial infarction.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications
2.1.1 The management of patients with end-stage heart failure or acute heart
failure from naturally reversible causes is challenging; it may involve
combination medical therapy (including inotropic support), intra-aortic
balloon pumping and heart transplantation.
2.1.2 Short-term circulatory support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD)
may be indicated for patients with end-stage heart failure (of any
aetiology) who are awaiting a donor heart for transplantation, and for
patients with a severe acute heart failure syndrome from which
myocardial recovery is anticipated (such as acute myocarditis). An LVAD
is sometimes used if weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiac
surgery fails.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 A number of LVADs that increase cardiac output by providing mechanical
support to the failing left ventricle are available. The choice of device
depends on the patient's body size, the length of time support is
required, the degree of support needed and the type of blood flow
desired.
2.2.2 Implantation of an LVAD is done under general anaesthesia through a
chest incision; surgery usually takes several hours. The inflow pipe of the
LVAD is inserted into the left side of the heart, usually the left ventricle,
and the outflow pipe is inserted into the systemic arterial system, usually
the aorta. The LVAD pumps oxygenated blood from the failing left
ventricle into the systemic arterial system under pressure.

2.3 Efficacy
2.3.1 In the active arm of a non-randomised controlled study, 78% (32/41) of
patients survived for a mean of 215 days with LVAD support. In another
comparative study, 81% (13/16) of patients survived to transplant
(duration of support not stated). One case series showed that at 30 days
of bridging to transplantation with an LVAD, survival was 83%, falling to
19% after 24 months' support.
2.3.2 In a non-randomised controlled trial, post-transplant survival of patients
bridged on LVAD support was 66% (21/32) at 41 months, compared with
67% (98/146) of patients at 36 months who had a transplant without
circulatory support, although patients in the latter group were
significantly older. One case series of 243 patients in whom LVADs were
used to bridge to transplantation reported actuarial post-transplant
survival of 91% at 1 year, 70% at 5 years and 40% at 10 years. Results
from case series included in a systematic review showed that between
60% (12/20) and 83% (5/6) of patients survived to transplantation or
were still alive awaiting transplantation on LVAD support.
2.3.3 Of the total cases of bridge to recovery reported, 58% (7/12) of patients
survived to final follow-up; successful explanation of the device or
weaning from support was achieved in all these patients. For more
details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section.
2.3.4 The Specialist Advisers commented that LVADs may improve quality of
life and survival rates in patients with an otherwise fatal condition while
waiting for transplantation.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 Definition of infection varied among the studies identified. In a case
series documented in a systematic review, rates of infection during LVAD
support ranging from 0% (0/10) to 100% (5/5) were reported. A non-
randomised controlled trial noted infection in 8% (1/13) of patients during
LVAD bridging, and one case series reported an infection rate of 18%
(43/243).

2.4.2 Definitions of cerebral events varied between studies, which made
interpretation difficult. Cerebral infarction causing stroke was found to
have occurred in 21% (55/264) of patients in 1 series. In a second case
series, cerebrovascular accident occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients, and
stroke occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients during support time (mean 78
days). In a third series, a neurological event (not defined) occurred in 8%
(1/13) of patients.
2.4.3 In a systematic review, significant haemorrhage was reported in between
10% (1/10) and 30% (6/20) of patients. Re-operation because of bleeding
was required in 31% (4/13) of patients in one series.
2.4.4 Other complications reported during LVAD support were renal failure,
respiratory failure and haemolysis. For more details, refer to the 'Sources
of evidence' section.
2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers noted that adverse events relating to the
procedure include bleeding, infection, device malfunction, haemolysis,
peripheral ischaemia and perforation of a ventricle or the aorta. In
addition, they noted that theoretical complications include device-related
thrombosis and device-related strokes.
2.5 Other comments
2.5.1 This guidance refers to patients for whom other treatments such as
intra-aortic balloon pumping would be ineffective, who are considered
eligible for heart transplantation, or who have acute severe heart failure
that is likely to be reversible (such as acute myocarditis). It was noted
that other patients might potentially benefit from this procedure, such as
patients who cannot be weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass after
cardiac surgery and patients with cardiogenic shock after acute
myocardial infarction.
2.5.2 It was noted that a number of different devices are available for this
procedure and that the technology is evolving rapidly. Some devices
include a right-ventricular assist device (biventricular assist devices).
The Institute may review this guidance upon publication of further
evidence.

2.5.3 It was also noted that implantation of an LVAD could unmask previously
subclinical right ventricular dysfunction.
2.5.4 These recommendations exclude circulatory support with left ventricular
devices as destination therapy.
3 Further information
3.1 NICE has published a guideline on chronic heart failure in adults:
diagnosis and management.
3.2 The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) Programme has produced a report on the Evaluation
of the ventricular assist device programme in the UK (EVAD), which was
published in November 2006.
Sources of evidence

bridge to transplantation or to recovery.
Information for patients
NICE has produced information on this procedure for patients and carers. It explains the
nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with
patient consent in mind.
