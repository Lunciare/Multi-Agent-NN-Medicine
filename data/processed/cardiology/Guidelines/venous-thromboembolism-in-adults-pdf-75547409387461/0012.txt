Venous thromboembolism in adults

about the signs and symptoms of VTE, how to reduce their risk of VTE and how to seek help if VTE is suspected, as well as the benefits and possible side effects of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. People aged 16 and over who have a limb that is affected in a way that means they are unable to bear weight on it when they are sent home from hospital (for example, with a leg in a plaster cast or splint) have an assessment to check whether they need to take medicine temporarily (until they can move their leg normally again) to prevent a blood clot developing. They discuss the result of the assessment with a healthcare professional and make decisions about taking the medicine if it is needed. Their healthcare professional explains and gives them written information about the signs and symptoms of blood clots, how to reduce their risk of getting a blood clot and what to do if they think they have one, as well as the benefits and possible side effects of medicine to prevent blood clots.
