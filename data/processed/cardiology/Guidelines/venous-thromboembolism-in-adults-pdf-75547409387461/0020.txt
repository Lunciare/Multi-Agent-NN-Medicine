4: Venous thromboembolism anticoagulation review Quality statement People aged 18 and over taking anticoagulation treatment after a venous thromboembolism (VTE) have a review at 3 months and then at least once a year if they continue to take it long term. [2013, updated 2021] Rationale The benefits of anticoagulation treatment for VTE prevention become less certain over time, and after 3 months treatment needs to be reviewed and a decision made about whether to continue or stop treatment. Reviewing long-term anticoagulation treatment for people who decide to continue it beyond 3 months ensures that treatment is guided by the person's changing balance of benefits and risks, and changes in their preferences over time. At a review, the information, advice and support provided to people when they started having anticoagulation treatment should be reviewed and updated. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure a) Evidence of local systems to identify and invite people aged 18 and over, taking anticoagulation treatment after a VTE for a review at 3 months.
