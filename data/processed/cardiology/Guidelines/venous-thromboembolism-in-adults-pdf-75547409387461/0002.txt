Statements from the 2010 quality standard for venous thromboembolism in adults: reducing the risk in hospital and the 2013 quality standard for venous thromboembolism in adults: diagnosis and management that are still supported by the evidence may still be useful at a local level. The 2010 and 2013 quality standards are available as PDFs. Quality statement 1: Timing of pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis Quality statement People aged 16 and over who are in hospital and assessed as needing pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis start it as soon as possible and within 14 hours of hospital admission.
