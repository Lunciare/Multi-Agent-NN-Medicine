Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty

patients undergoing angiographic assessment at 6-month median follow-up. A case series of 495 stenosed saphenous vein grafts treated by laser angioplasty reported restenosis in 55% of the 161 patients who had angiographic assessment at 6-month follow- up (absolute figures not stated). 2.3.7 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as procedural success, angiographic success, quality-of-life scores, target vessel revascularisation and cardiac enzyme level post procedure. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 The meta-analysis of 9,222 patients treated by laser angioplasty or balloon angioplasty reported no difference between the groups in the rate of myocardial infarction at 30-day follow-up (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.82). A meta-analysis of 3,012 patients being treated for in-stent restenosis reported that the pooled mean rate of major adverse cardiac events was 35% for laser angioplasty, 29% for balloon angioplasty and 31% for stent-in-stent treatment (absolute figures not stated). 2.4.2 A non-randomised controlled study of 8,932 procedures reported that the rate of arterial perforation was 2% (5 out of 242) for laser angioplasty, less than 1% (11 out of 7,905) for balloon angioplasty and 0% (0 out of 116) for mechanical rotational atherectomy. 2.4.3 The Specialist Advisers listed theoretical adverse events as death, coronary dissection, abrupt vessel closure,
