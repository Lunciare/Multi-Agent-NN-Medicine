Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty

or stenting alone. 2.2.2 A thin, flexible fibre-optic catheter connected to a laser-generating source outside the body is introduced via the femoral artery. The catheter is advanced over a guidewire through the artery to the blockage in the coronary artery, under fluoroscopic guidance. The tip of the catheter system emits pulses of laser light to vaporise the plaque while being slowly advanced across the lesion. 2.2.3 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty has also been done using a laser guidewire system but that method is not now in regular use. 2.2.4 This procedure is often used with adjunctive balloon angioplasty and followed by angiography to document the results. 2.3 Efficacy Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview. 2.3.1 A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 303 patients treated with laser guidewire or mechanical guidewire reported procedural success (defined as the ability to cross the target lesion at the first attempt) in 53% (76 out of 144) and 47% (75 out of 159) of patients respectively (p=0.33). A non-randomised controlled study of 3,733 procedures reported that
