Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty

after laser angioplasty compared with balloon angioplasty in the meta-analysis of 9,222 patients at up to 1-year follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.73). 2.3.4 A case series of 1,862 patients reported that 71% of patients had an improvement in their angina symptoms, 13% had unchanged symptoms and 16% had worse symptoms at 6-month median follow-up (absolute figures not stated). 2.3.5 A meta-analysis of 16 studies including a total of 9,222 patients reported that angiographically measured restenosis occurred more frequently after laser angioplasty than after balloon angioplasty (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.20) at follow-up of between 3 months and 1 year. An RCT of 96 patients treated by laser angioplasty and adjunctive balloon angioplasty or by balloon angioplasty alone reported restenosis in 52% and 47% of patients respectively at 163 days median follow-up (p=not significant; absolute figures not stated). 2.3.6 The case series of 1,862 patients reported restenosis greater than 50% of the artery diameter in 54% (434 out of 797) of eligible patients undergoing angiographic assessment at 6-month median follow-up. A case series of 495 stenosed saphenous vein grafts treated by laser angioplasty reported restenosis in 55% of the 161 patients who
