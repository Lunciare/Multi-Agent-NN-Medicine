1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty is adequate to support the use of this procedure in carefully selected patients for whom conventional angioplasty would otherwise be technically difficult, provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 Coronary artery disease (CAD) refers to the narrowing and occlusion of the coronary arteries as a result of atherosclerosis. This can cause angina, myocardial infarction and heart failure. 2.1.2 Treatment options for patients with CAD with severe stenosis or occlusion include thrombolysis, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, stent placement, percutaneous cutting balloon or coronary artery bypass grafting. 2.1.3 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty has been used for CAD with severe stenosis or atherosclerotic occlusion, when standard techniques for recannalisation are unlikely to succeed or have failed. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty aims to penetrate plaque within coronary arteries that is not amenable to standard techniques such as balloon angioplasty or stenting alone. 2.2.2 A thin, flexible fibre-optic catheter connected to a laser-generating source outside the body is introduced via the femoral artery. The catheter is advanced over a guidewire
