Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty

lesion at the first attempt) in 53% (76 out of 144) and 47% (75 out of 159) of patients respectively (p=0.33). A non-randomised controlled study of 3,733 procedures reported that 'lesion success' assessed angiographically was achieved in 89% and 94% of native vessels treated with laser angioplasty using 2 different laser devices, and in 91% and 95% of saphenous vein grafts for which laser treatment was attempted (absolute figures not stated). A case series of 958 patients reported that among 55 patients who underwent immediate postoperative angiographic assessment, coronary stenosis (assessed by the percentage of artery diameter blocked) decreased from 83% at baseline to 49% following laser angioplasty and to 38% following adjunctive balloon angioplasty (absolute figures not stated). 2.3.2 The RCT of 303 patients treated with laser guidewire or mechanical guidewire reported no major adverse cardiac events in 54% (78 out of 144) and 67% (106 out of 159) of patients respectively at 400-day follow-up (p=0.026). 2.3.3 Major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction or revascularisation) were more frequent after laser angioplasty compared with balloon angioplasty in the meta-analysis of 9,222 patients at up to 1-year follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.73). 2.3.4
