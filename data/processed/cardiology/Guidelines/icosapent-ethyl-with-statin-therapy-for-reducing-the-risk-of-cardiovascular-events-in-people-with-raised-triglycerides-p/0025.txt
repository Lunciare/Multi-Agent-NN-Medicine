similar technology appraisals did not include loss of treatment effect, including TA393, TA394 and TA733. The company provided an analysis of the treatment effect over time, which showed that it did not decrease during the follow-up period of REDUCE-IT. The clinical expert commented that given the absence of longer-term data it is difficult to determine the appropriateness of an assumption of treatment effect loss. However, the expert noted that related treatments for cardiovascular disease, such as statins, have long-term effects. The expert commented that the company's assumption of no loss of treatment effect was likely reasonable. However, the committee was concerned that treatment discontinuation was not linked to treatment effect in the icosapent ethyl model. At its first meeting, the committee noted that it would have preferred a method linking treatment effect and discontinuation by changing the hazard ratio to 1 at an appropriate time after people stopped icosapent ethyl. In response to consultation, the company commented that the clinical efficacy curves accounted for efficacy lost because of discontinuation because they are based on the intention to treat population, which includes all patients in the icosapent ethyl trial, regardless of treatment discontinuation. The committee acknowledged this, but considered that if
