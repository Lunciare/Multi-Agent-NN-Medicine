was no interaction between the efficacy of icosapent ethyl in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events according to ethnicity ('white' HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85, 'non-white' HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.83). It stated that an advisory board of 9 UK clinical experts considered the trial data would be generalisable to the UK population. The clinical adviser to NHS England noted that several treatments available in the NHS, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists, were used by only a small proportion of people in REDUCE-IT. The clinical adviser explained that the change in treatment landscape in the NHS in England since the trial began makes the generalisability of REDUCE-IT to current practice uncertain. The company stated that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in the trial was consistent with clinical practice at the time of the trial. It also noted that people who do not have diabetes would not necessarily be able to have these treatments. The committee concluded that REDUCE-IT may not fully represent NHS clinical practice, which increases uncertainty around the generalisability of the results. There is uncertainty in the trial results because icosapent ethyl's mechanism of action is not fully understood
