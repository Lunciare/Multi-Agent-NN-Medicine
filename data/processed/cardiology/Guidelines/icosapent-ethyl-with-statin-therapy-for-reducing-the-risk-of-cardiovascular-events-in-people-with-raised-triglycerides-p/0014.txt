the REDUCE-IT results, in part because of the use of mineral oil. They commented that mineral oil may not be a true neutral oil and may have increased the risk of cardiovascular events in the placebo group. This would exaggerate the observed difference in cardiovascular events between the icosapent ethyl and placebo groups. The professional group and NHS England clinical adviser also commented that results of a similar trial, STRENGTH, did not show the same magnitude of benefit as REDUCE-IT. STRENGTH compared a combination of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (which is similar to, but not the same as, icosapent ethyl) with a corn oil placebo. The ERG explained that a 2021 paper by Doi et al. comparing REDUCE-IT with STRENGTH suggested the differences in results might be partially explained by differences in placebo comparators. But the ERG cautioned that there were other possible explanations, including that corn oil could decrease the risk of MACE or that there were underlying differences in patient characteristics between the trials. The ERG highlighted a systematic review by Olshansky et al. 2020 that concluded that it is likely that mineral oil at the quantities used as placebos does not significantly affect the conclusion of
