oil placebo. The ERG's base-case ICER was £21,062 per QALY gained. The ERG presented scenario analyses including a 0%, 1.5%, 3% or 7% treatment effect reduction to adjust for the possible effect of mineral oil. It also presented scenario analyses including a loss of treatment effect on discontinuation after 5 or 10 years, or not at all. The committee considered that the scenarios including a reduction of treatment effect of 1.5% and 3% (see section 3.9) and a loss of treatment effect on discontinuation at 10 years (see section 3.14) were the most plausible scenarios. However, it considered that the ICERs that included a loss of treatment effect on discontinuation were likely too high, because of the way this had been modelled. So, the committee also considered a scenario with a 3% reduction in treatment effect and no loss of treatment effect on discontinuation. Therefore, the committee considered that the most plausible ICER was between £21,750 and £24,821 per QALY gained. Other factors The committee considered potential equality issues in its decision making 3.18 A patient organisation and clinical expert raised several potential equalities issues. They noted that people with Black, Asian and minority ethnic family backgrounds are more likely
