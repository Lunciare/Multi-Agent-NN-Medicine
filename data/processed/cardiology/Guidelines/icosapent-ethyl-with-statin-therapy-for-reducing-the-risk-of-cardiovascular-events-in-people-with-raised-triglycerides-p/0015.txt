Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

a systematic review by Olshansky et al. 2020 that concluded that it is likely that mineral oil at the quantities used as placebos does not significantly affect the conclusion of REDUCE-IT. However, the ERG noted that this systematic review had some limitations and one of the co-authors was employed by the company. In response to consultation, the company acknowledged that some parameters associated with cardiovascular risk increased in the placebo group of REDUCE-IT. However, it stated that it was uncertain if these changes were because of the natural history of the disease, regression to the mean, or negative effects of mineral oil. The company provided a comparison of cardiovascular outcomes trials from 2003 to 2019. The comparison found that 79% of studies reported increases in LDL-C after statin stabilisation, similar to what was observed in the placebo group of REDUCE-IT. In response to consultation the company also highlighted that the drug in STRENGTH was different to icosapent ethyl because of different proportions of docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. So, comparing the results from the 2 trials was not appropriate. The experts explained that among cardiovascular disease researchers and clinicians, there is an ongoing debate about mineral oil placebos and the
