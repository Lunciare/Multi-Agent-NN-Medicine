Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

third events, people discontinuing icosapent ethyl, and people alive in the company's and validation models. It noted the models had different structures but produced similar clinical estimates. The committee noted there were still uncertainties about the company's model structure (see section 3.11) and how treatment effect after discontinuation was modelled (see section 3.13). The ERG also noted that it was unclear to what extent the validation model should be used to inform decisions in the company's model. The committee concluded that the company's model remained uncertain and therefore the comparison with the validation model was uncertain. Cost-effectiveness estimates Because of the uncertainty an acceptable ICER is towards the lower end of the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources 3.16 NICE's guide to the methods of technology appraisal notes that above a most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, judgements about the acceptability of a technology as an effective use of NHS resources will take into account the degree of certainty around the ICER. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. Because of the high level of uncertainty in
