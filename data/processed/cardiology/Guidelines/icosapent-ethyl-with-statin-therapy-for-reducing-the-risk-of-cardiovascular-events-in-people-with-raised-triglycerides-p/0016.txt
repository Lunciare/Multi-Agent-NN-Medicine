Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

the results from the 2 trials was not appropriate. The experts explained that among cardiovascular disease researchers and clinicians, there is an ongoing debate about mineral oil placebos and the impact on trial outcomes. The committee concluded that the relative effect of icosapent ethyl was uncertain because of the potential negative effect of the mineral oil placebo. It is appropriate to consider scenarios for an estimated possible reduction in treatment effect from 1.5% to 3% 3.9 At the first meeting, the NHS England clinical adviser explained they expected to see analyses with the magnitude of treatment effect reduced by 7% to account for the estimated negative effect of mineral oil. This estimate was based on the 2021 paper by Doi et al. comparing the results of REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH. The committee was aware that the company provided the analyses done by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US to the European Medicines Agency based on the 3-point MACE outcome assuming that the potential negative effect of mineral oil on MACE events was between 0.3% and 3%. The committee also noted that the Doi et al. 2021 paper commented that there was an unexplained additional 13% benefit in REDUCE-IT.
