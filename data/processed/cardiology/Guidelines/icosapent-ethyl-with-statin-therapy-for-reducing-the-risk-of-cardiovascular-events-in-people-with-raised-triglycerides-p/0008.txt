older with type 1 or 2 diabetes and at least 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor. People in the secondary prevention group were aged 45 and older with established cardiovascular disease. The committee noted that NICE's technology appraisal guidance on alirocumab (TA393), evolocumab (TA394) and inclisiran (TA733) defined high risk of cardiovascular disease as a history of any of the following: • a previous cardiovascular event, including acute coronary syndrome (such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina needing hospitalisation) • previous coronary or other arterial revascularisation procedures • coronary heart disease • ischaemic stroke • peripheral arterial disease. In response to the first consultation, the company provided analyses that focused only on the secondary prevention subgroup. The committee noted that icosapent ethyl was unlikely to be cost effective in the primary prevention subgroup, because the cost-effectiveness estimates presented at the first committee meeting were substantially higher than the range normally considered an acceptable use of NHS resources. It concluded that it was appropriate to focus on the effects of icosapent ethyl for the secondary prevention subgroup. This includes people with diabetes who have established cardiovascular disease. Clinical evidence The REDUCE-IT trial may not be generalisable to the NHS in England 3.6
