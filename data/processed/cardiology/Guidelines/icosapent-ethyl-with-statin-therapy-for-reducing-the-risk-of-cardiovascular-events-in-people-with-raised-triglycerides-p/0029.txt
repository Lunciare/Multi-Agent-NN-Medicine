effect. However, it acknowledged that the true cost-effectiveness results would likely be lower than in the scenarios presented, had the loss of treatment effect been modelled more appropriately. The company's model has uncertainties so the comparison with the validation model is also uncertain 3.15 Because of the ERG's concerns with the company's model, the company provided a microsimulation model for validation. The validation model was originally developed for the US setting but was adapted to the UK NHS setting by using the same costs, utilities and background mortality as the company's model. The validation model also used cardiovascular event data from REDUCE-IT. The company provided a comparison of its model with the validation model. The validation model explicitly modelled individual nonfatal cardiovascular events, had a cycle length of 6 months and assumed people experienced a disutility associated with an acute event for 18 months after an event, after which they experienced a post- event utility. The company also provided a 30-year comparison of the expected number of first, second and third events, people discontinuing icosapent ethyl, and people alive in the company's and validation models. It noted the models had different structures but produced similar clinical estimates. The committee noted
