Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

for the secondary prevention subgroup. This includes people with diabetes who have established cardiovascular disease. Clinical evidence The REDUCE-IT trial may not be generalisable to the NHS in England 3.6 The company provided clinical evidence from REDUCE-IT, a randomised trial comparing icosapent ethyl with a mineral oil placebo. The trial included people who had statins with or without ezetimibe, fasting triglyceride levels of 1.53 mmol/litre or more and below 5.64 mmol/litre, and LDL-C levels of more than 1.04 mmol/litre to 2.60 mmol/litre. In the trial, 8,179 people were randomised and 29% were in the primary prevention group and 71% were in the secondary prevention group (see section 3.5). The primary endpoint was time from randomisation to the first occurrence of any component of the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) composite outcome. This comprised cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularisation and unstable angina.
