assuming that people who discontinue treatment follow the efficacy of the placebo group, it was assuming that all events that were avoided occur at discontinuation, which was not clinically plausible. The committee agreed that the way in which the loss of treatment effect had been modelled was potentially biased against icosapent ethyl. This was mainly because it was implausible that all avoided events would occur at treatment discontinuation, but also because the efficacy curves for people staying on treatment included some people who had stopped treatment in the trial. The ERG's base-case included the company's scenario where people stopping icosapent ethyl would have the same clinical efficacy as the placebo group after 10 years. For people continuing treatment, the assumption was that the treatment effect would remain constant over the model time horizon. The committee acknowledged the limitations with the modelled scenarios but considered it reasonable to accept the scenario in which people stopping icosapent ethyl would lose treatment effect after 10 years and those continuing would maintain the treatment effect. However, it acknowledged that the true cost-effectiveness results would likely be lower than in the scenarios presented, had the loss of treatment effect been modelled more appropriately. The company's
