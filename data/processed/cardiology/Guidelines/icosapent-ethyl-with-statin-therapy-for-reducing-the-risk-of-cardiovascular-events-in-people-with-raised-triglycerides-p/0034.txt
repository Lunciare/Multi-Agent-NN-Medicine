Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

for people with a short life expectancy did not apply. The committee has not seen evidence of additional benefits that are not captured in the cost-effectiveness analysis 3.20 The clinical experts noted that icosapent ethyl may be considered innovative because it appears to work on a disease pathway that is not fully understood. The committee concluded that it had not seen evidence of additional benefits associated with icosapent ethyl over those already included in the QALY calculations. Conclusion Icosapent ethyl is recommended for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with elevated triglycerides 3.21 The committee noted uncertainty in the clinical effectiveness evidence for icosapent ethyl because of the mineral oil placebo in the REDUCE-IT trial (see section 3.8). It also noted concerns about the generalisability of the trial results to the NHS in England (see section 3.6). It was concerned about the company's modelling approach (see section 3.11), including how the treatment effect after discontinuation was modelled (see section 3.13) and the composite outcome (see section 3.12).
