on MACE events was between 0.3% and 3%. The committee also noted that the Doi et al. 2021 paper commented that there was an unexplained additional 13% benefit in REDUCE-IT. In response to the first consultation, the company provided scenarios with the clinical effectiveness of icosapent ethyl reduced by 0.3%, 1%, 2% or 3% based on the analyses provided to the European Medicines Agency. The company considered that the range of 7% to 13% was not plausible because it was based on a single simulated Danish observational study. A clinical expert commented that it was difficult to quantify the potential negative effects of mineral oil and there was significant uncertainty. As such, they could not state which percentage reduction in treatment effect was more plausible. The committee was aware that the European public assessment report on icosapent ethyl notes that a 10% putative negative effect of mineral oil would be a worst-case scenario but likely an overestimation. In response to the second consultation, the company presented an analysis replicating a Cox regression model made by the FDA to examine the effects of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and LDL-C on the relative benefit of icosapent ethyl. It presented a propensity score matched
