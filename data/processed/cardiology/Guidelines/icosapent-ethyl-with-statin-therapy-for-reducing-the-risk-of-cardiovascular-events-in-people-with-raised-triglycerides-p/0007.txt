family backgrounds. The ERG commented that the treatment effect for icosapent ethyl varies by age, with a larger benefit observed in people under 65 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.75) than in people aged 65 or older (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00). The company highlighted that these analyses did not include adjusting for potential confounders or multiple comparisons. The committee was aware that restricting by age may result in an equalities issue because age is a protected characteristic. The committee concluded that the company's submission for icosapent ethyl was narrower than the marketing authorisation and it was acceptable to use the LDL-C thresholds from REDUCE-IT. This would ensure its recommendation was based on the available evidence. It is appropriate to consider the effects of icosapent ethyl only for the secondary prevention subgroup 3.5 In its original submission, the company provided evidence for 2 separate risk groups from the REDUCE-IT trial: primary and secondary prevention. The primary prevention group included people aged 50 and older with type 1 or 2 diabetes and at least 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor. People in the secondary prevention group were aged 45 and older with established cardiovascular disease.
