Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

composite 5-point MACE outcome from REDUCE-IT (see section 3.6). The health states were populated by fitting parametric models to the Kaplan–Meier curves for first, second and third plus cardiovascular events from REDUCE-IT using a partitioned survival approach. The model used a 1-day cycle length and a lifetime horizon, equivalent to 36 years. The company used baseline utility values from the literature (Stevanovic et al. 2016 and O'Reilly et al. 2011) and health state multipliers from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification. The ERG noted several concerns with the model structure and that the company's partitioned survival approach to estimate the probability of having a cardiovascular event deviated from the modelling approach in related NICE appraisals. In recent hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia appraisals, the economic models have often followed a Markov approach and used specific cardiovascular event types as health states. The ERG was concerned that the model structure assumed independence of endpoints, meaning the probability of having a second or third cardiovascular event was independent of the time of the previous events. It commented that the company's model did not explicitly model nonfatal cardiovascular events and used a 1-day cycle length. The committee commented
