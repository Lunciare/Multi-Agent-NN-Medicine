Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

represent NHS clinical practice, which increases uncertainty around the generalisability of the results. There is uncertainty in the trial results because icosapent ethyl's mechanism of action is not fully understood 3.7 The company stated that icosapent ethyl's mechanism of action is not fully understood. The company noted it appears to modulate the atherosclerosis pathway by lipid and non-lipid effects. It explained the primary lipid effect is to reduce triglyceride levels. It added that the non- lipid effects may include localised anti-inflammatory effects, regulation of lipid metabolism gene transcription, antithrombotic effects and plaque reduction. The clinical experts also commented that the mechanism of action is uncertain. They explained that the reduction in cardiovascular risk observed in REDUCE-IT was larger than what would be expected from a reduction in triglycerides alone. It was also larger than that reported by an earlier trial (STRENGTH) of a drug with a similar mechanism of action to icosapent ethyl (see section 3.8). In response to consultation, the company stated that the mechanism of action is likely multifactorial and that icosapent ethyl can positively alter the development, progression and stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaque. It stated that triglyceride reduction only played a minor role in the reduction in
