that the model appeared to overestimate mortality in both the placebo and icosapent ethyl groups at 5 years. The committee concluded that the results of the company's model were uncertain because of the model structure and the discrepancy between model and trial outcomes. Using the composite 5-point MACE outcome in the model increases uncertainty 3.12 The company's model used the same composite MACE outcome as REDUCE-IT (see section 3.6). The ERG was concerned that the composite outcome could mask the treatment effect in relation to individual cardiovascular events. The ERG highlighted that in the intention to treat population, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular death (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98) and death from any cause (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.02) were larger than that for the composite 5-point MACE (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.83). The company noted that although the composite outcome was used, the distribution of specific cardiovascular events was applied in the model. The company explained that the effect of icosapent ethyl on each specific event occurring as a first, second or third plus event was taken into account. However, the ERG commented that applying direct estimates of time to each event is
