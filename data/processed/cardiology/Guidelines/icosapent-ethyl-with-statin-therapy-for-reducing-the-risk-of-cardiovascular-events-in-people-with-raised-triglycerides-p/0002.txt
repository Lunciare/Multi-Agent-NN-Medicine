Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

to stop. Why the committee made these recommendations There are currently no treatment options to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people taking statins who have controlled levels of LDL-C but raised levels of triglycerides. Icosapent ethyl is licensed for people taking statins who have raised triglycerides and a high risk of cardiovascular events, and who have either: • established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention), or • diabetes and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor (primary prevention). Clinical trial evidence suggests that icosapent ethyl reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, compared with placebo, in people with raised fasting triglycerides (1.7 mmol/litre or above) who are taking statins. The trial only included people with LDL-C levels above 1.04 mmol/litre and below or equal to 2.60 mmol/litre. The cost-effectiveness estimates for icosapent ethyl are uncertain. Icosapent ethyl is unlikely to be cost effective for primary prevention, so it is not recommended for this. But the most likely cost-effectiveness estimates for secondary prevention are within what NICE normally considers an acceptable use of NHS resources. So, icosapent ethyl is recommended for secondary prevention in people with LDL-C levels above 1.04 mmol/litre and below or equal to 2.60 mmol/litre. People must be taking
