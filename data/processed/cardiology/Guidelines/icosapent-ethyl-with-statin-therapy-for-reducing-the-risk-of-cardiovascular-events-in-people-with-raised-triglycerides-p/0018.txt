KEYWORDS: ethyl, icosapent, icosapent ethyl, treatment, company, cardiovascular, people, committee, effect, treatment effect, model, events, noted, reduce-it, clinical

Cox regression model made by the FDA to examine the effects of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and LDL-C on the relative benefit of icosapent ethyl. It presented a propensity score matched approach to the Cox regression analysis to account for overlapping effects of the biomarkers. It also presented an analysis exploring the relationship between on-treatment serum active drug concentration and cardiovascular outcomes to explore the effects on cardiovascular risk that are independent of serum eicosapentaenoic acid levels. The company considers the results of these analyses to be confidential so they cannot be reported here. On the basis of these analyses, the company updated its base-case model to include a 1.5% reduced treatment effect for icosapent ethyl. Considering the company's analyses and the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency, the committee concluded that it would be appropriate to consider scenarios estimating a possible reduction in treatment effect from 1.5% to 3%. Icosapent ethyl has manageable adverse events 3.10 In REDUCE-IT, similar proportions of people having icosapent ethyl (81.8%) and placebo (81.3%) reported adverse events. The clinical experts noted that icosapent ethyl appears to be generally well tolerated, but they had some concerns around specific adverse events. In REDUCE-IT, there were significant differences
