Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

each specific event occurring as a first, second or third plus event was taken into account. However, the ERG commented that applying direct estimates of time to each event is not necessarily equivalent to combining time to composite event with the proportion of each event in the composite outcome. The clinical experts commented that using a composite MACE outcome is common for large clinical trials but one expert said that there was some debate about whether all components of the MACE should be used. The committee was concerned that the composite outcome might be double counting risk. It noted that revascularisations accounted for most second and third events (the exact values are considered confidential by the company and cannot be reported here). It also noted that coronary revascularisation could be an indicated procedure based on a preceding event, such as myocardial infarction. At its first meeting, the committee requested Kaplan–Meier curves and hazard ratios for each of the individual cardiovascular events. In response to consultation the company provided Kaplan–Meier curves and hazard ratios over time for each individual event type in the composite outcome. The ERG commented that in the Kaplan–Meier curves for cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal
