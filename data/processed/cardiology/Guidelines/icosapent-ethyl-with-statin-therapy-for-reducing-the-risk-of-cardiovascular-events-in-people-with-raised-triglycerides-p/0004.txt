Treatment pathway and comparator People with elevated triglycerides who are having statins with or without ezetimibe would welcome a treatment option 3.1 NHS England estimated that between 25% and 35% of people having statin therapy have elevated triglycerides. The patient and clinical experts explained there is an unmet need for this population.

They explained the aim of treatment would be to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
