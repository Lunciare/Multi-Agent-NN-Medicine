Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

they are based on the intention to treat population, which includes all patients in the icosapent ethyl trial, regardless of treatment discontinuation. The committee acknowledged this, but considered that if the proportion of patients continuing treatment reduced over the model time horizon, it would expect the average treatment effect to be lower than that captured in the trial. The committee noted that in the recent related appraisal of bempedoic acid with ezetimibe (TA694), the company's model assumed results achieved at 12 weeks were maintained for the duration of the model's time horizon, or until treatment was stopped. It recognised that in TA393, the company had assumed 100% treatment continuation and compliance over the entire time horizon. The committee noted that this assumption likely would not be appropriate in this appraisal because many people had discontinued treatment by the end of follow-up in REDUCE-IT (the value is considered confidential by the company and cannot be reported here). The company highlighted that follow-up was longer in REDUCE-IT and so it would be expected that more people would discontinue treatment. The committee noted that assumptions of complete continuation and no loss of treatment effect were also used in TA733. The committee commented that
