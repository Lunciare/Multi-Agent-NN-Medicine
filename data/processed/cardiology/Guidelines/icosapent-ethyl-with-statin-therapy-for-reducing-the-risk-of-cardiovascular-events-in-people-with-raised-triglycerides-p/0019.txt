Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

adverse events. The clinical experts noted that icosapent ethyl appears to be generally well tolerated, but they had some concerns around specific adverse events. In REDUCE-IT, there were significant differences in the incidence of atrial fibrillation (5.3% icosapent ethyl, 3.9% placebo), bleeding-related events (11.8% icosapent ethyl, 9.9% placebo), constipation (5.4% icosapent ethyl, 3.6% placebo) and peripheral oedema (6.5% icosapent ethyl, 5.0% placebo). The committee noted that some fish oil products can be associated with unpleasant burps that may affect adherence (icosapent ethyl is derived from fish oil). The company stated that unpleasant burps had very little impact on treatment adherence. The committee noted the concerns about some adverse events, but concluded icosapent ethyl was generally well tolerated with manageable adverse events. The economic model The results from the company's model are uncertain 3.11 The company's model included 8 health states: cardiovascular event- free, first event, post-first event, second event, post-second event, third or more event, post-third or more event, and death. The events in the model were based on the composite 5-point MACE outcome from REDUCE-IT (see section 3.6). The health states were populated by fitting parametric models to the Kaplan–Meier curves for first, second and third plus cardiovascular events
