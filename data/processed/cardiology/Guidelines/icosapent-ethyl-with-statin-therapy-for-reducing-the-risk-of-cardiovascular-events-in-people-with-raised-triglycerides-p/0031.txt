Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

around the ICER. The committee will be more cautious about recommending a technology if it is less certain about the ICERs presented. Because of the high level of uncertainty in the clinical and economic evidence, the committee agreed that an acceptable ICER would be towards the lower end of the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained). The most plausible ICER is between £21,750 and £24,821 per QALY gained 3.17 After the second consultation, the company's base-case ICER for icosapent ethyl compared with a stable dose of statins with or without ezetimibe was £20,000 per QALY gained for the secondary prevention group. The company's base case assumed no loss of treatment effect for icosapent ethyl but did include a 1.5% treatment effect reduction to account for the possible effects of the mineral oil placebo. The ERG's base case included a loss of treatment effect for those discontinuing after 10 years but did not include a reduction in treatment effect for the mineral oil placebo. The ERG's base-case ICER was £21,062 per QALY gained. The ERG presented scenario analyses including a 0%, 1.5%, 3% or 7% treatment effect reduction to adjust for the
