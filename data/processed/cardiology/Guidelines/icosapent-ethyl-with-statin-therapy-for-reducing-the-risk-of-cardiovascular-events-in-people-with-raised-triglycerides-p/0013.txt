It stated that triglyceride reduction only played a minor role in the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with icosapent ethyl. The company also noted that other related technologies that have been appraised by NICE, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, have uncertain mechanisms of action. The committee concluded that the mechanism of action for icosapent ethyl is not fully understood. This added uncertainty to the trial's results because the difference in benefit compared with STRENGTH had not been fully explained.
