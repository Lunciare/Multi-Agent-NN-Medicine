and hazard ratios over time for each individual event type in the composite outcome. The ERG commented that in the Kaplan–Meier curves for cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, there appeared to be a lag in the separation of icosapent ethyl and placebo curves at around 1 to 2 years. This might mean the composite outcome biases the treatment effect in favour of icosapent ethyl in the first 1 to 2 years of treatment. The ERG also commented that when considering the hazard ratios over time, there are some differences between the individual events and the composite. The committee welcomed the additional information from the company but concluded that using the composite outcome in the model increased uncertainty. It is implausible that there is no loss of treatment effect at treatment discontinuation 3.13 The company's base case assumed that the treatment effect for icosapent ethyl continued at the same level for the duration of the model with no loss of treatment effect at discontinuation. The company commented that similar technology appraisals did not include loss of treatment effect, including TA393, TA394 and TA733. The company provided an analysis of the treatment effect over time, which showed that it
