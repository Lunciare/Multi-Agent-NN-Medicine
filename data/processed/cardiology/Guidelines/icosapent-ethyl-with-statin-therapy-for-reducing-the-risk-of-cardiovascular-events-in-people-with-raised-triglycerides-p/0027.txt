Icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people

expected that more people would discontinue treatment. The committee noted that assumptions of complete continuation and no loss of treatment effect were also used in TA733. The committee commented that the icosapent ethyl appraisal had different considerations to those previous appraisals. It considered that there was large uncertainty around the assumption that the treatment effect observed over the REDUCE-IT trial period would continue for the entire modelled time horizon if more people discontinued treatment over time. The committee concluded that it was implausible that the treatment effect would not reduce at any point after discontinuation. It is plausible that the treatment effect may be lost after 10 years if treatment is discontinued 3.14 The company's base case did not apply a loss of treatment effect. However, the company did provide 2 scenarios assuming that once a person discontinued treatment, after a period of either 10 or 20 years, they would have equivalent clinical outcomes to people in the placebo group. The company explained that because of the model structure, when assuming that people who discontinue treatment follow the efficacy of the placebo group, it was assuming that all events that were avoided occur at discontinuation, which was not clinically plausible.
