Laparoscopic repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

abdominal aortic aneurysm can be done by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) or by the technically more demanding totally laparoscopic surgery (TLS). In HALS, a midline minilaparotomy incision is made for insertion of one of the surgeon's hands to aid the procedure. In both techniques, small skin incisions are made for insertion of a laparoscope and instruments to guide and/or perform the repair. Lumbar arteries and the inferior mesenteric artery are dissected and clipped. Clamps are applied above and below the aneurysm, the sac is opened and thrombus removed. A prosthetic vascular graft is anastomosed to the proximal and distal ends of the aorta. The aneurysm wall and the posterior parietal peritoneum may be closed to cover the graft. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In three non-randomised controlled trials, mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 5.9 (HALS), 6.2 and 6.3 (TLS) days, compared with 9.4, 10.0 and 10.2 days following open repair. One non-randomised controlled study reported that mean LOS was broadly similar following HALS (7.4 days) and endovascular stenting (6.4 days). 2.3.2 In one case series, mean LOS was 5 days for TLS (n=131) and 7 days for HALS (n=215). In a second case series, mean LOS for HALS was reported
