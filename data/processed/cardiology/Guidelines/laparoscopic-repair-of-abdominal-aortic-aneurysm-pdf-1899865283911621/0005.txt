Laparoscopic repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

out of 20; TLS). 2.4.2 One non-randomised controlled trial reported that the rate of renal insufficiency was 2% (1 out of 60) following laparoscopic repair compared with 11% (11 out of 100) following open repair. Other complications reported following laparoscopic aneurysm repair include bleeding from the hypogastric artery in <1% (1 out of 122; HALS) and bleeding requiring reoperation in 2% (1 out of 60; TLS). 2.4.3 In three non-randomised controlled trials that compared laparoscopic aneurysm repair with open surgery, the mean operative time was longer in the laparoscopic (181 [HALS], 462 and 468 minutes [TLS]) than in the open surgery groups (136, 300 and 301 minutes, respectively; significance not reported). A fourth non- randomised controlled study comparing HALS with endovascular stenting reported that mean operative time was longer in the HALS group (198 and 149 minutes, respectively; not statistically significant). 2.4.4 In one case series mean operative time was 257 minutes with HALS; in another it was 175 minutes with HALS and 265 minutes with TLS.
