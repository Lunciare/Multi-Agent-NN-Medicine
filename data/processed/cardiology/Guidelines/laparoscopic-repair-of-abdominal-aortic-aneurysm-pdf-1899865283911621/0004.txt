2.3.2 In one case series, mean LOS was 5 days for TLS (n=131) and 7 days for HALS (n=215). In a second case series, mean LOS for HALS was reported as 4.4 days. There was a statistically significant difference in mean LOS between the first 30 patients (5.3 days) and the last 92 patients (4.1 days) treated at one institution (p=0.001). For more details, see the overview. 2.3.3 All Specialist Advisers considered this procedure to be novel and of uncertain efficacy. They considered key efficacy outcomes for this procedure to be successful complete repair, open conversion rates, operative time, intensive care unit and overall hospital LOS, patient quality of life, renal function and need for return to theatre. Some Specialist Advisers suggested that there would be longer operating times, particularly early in the learning curve. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Postoperative death rates following laparoscopic aneurysm repair have been reported as 3% (1 out of 29) and 4% (1 out of 24; HALS), and 5% (3 out of 60) and 10% (2 out of 20; TLS). 2.4.2 One non-randomised controlled trial reported that the rate of renal insufficiency was 2% (1 out of 60) following laparoscopic repair compared with 11% (11 out
