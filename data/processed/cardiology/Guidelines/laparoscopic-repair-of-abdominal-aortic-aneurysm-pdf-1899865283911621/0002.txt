This procedure should be performed by vascular surgeons who have had training in advanced laparoscopic surgery, and are mentored in these techniques. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Dilatation of the aorta forming an aneurysm occurs in about 2% of men over the age of 65 (it is less common in women). Small aneurysms may present no problems, but some continue to grow, and larger aneurysms can leak or rupture. This carries a high risk of mortality, even when it is possible to offer emergency surgery. Preventive treatment is often advised for patients with aneurysms that represent an appreciable rupture risk. 2.1.2 The traditional treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm is open surgical repair. The aneurysm is opened and a graft is then sewn in above and below the weakened area to allow normal blood flow. A less invasive approach is now commonly used, involving endovascular stent graft placement via the femoral arteries, but not all aneurysms are suitable for endovascular treatment. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Laparoscopic repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm can be done by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) or by the technically more demanding totally laparoscopic surgery (TLS). In HALS, a midline minilaparotomy incision is made for
