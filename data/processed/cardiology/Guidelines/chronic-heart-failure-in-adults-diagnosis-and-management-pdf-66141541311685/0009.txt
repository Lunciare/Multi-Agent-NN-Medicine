[2003] 1.3 Giving information to people with heart failure 1.3.1 Discuss the person's prognosis in a sensitive, open and honest manner. Be frank about the uncertainty in predicting the course of their heart failure. Revisit this discussion as the person's condition evolves. [2018] First consultations for people with newly diagnosed heart failure 1.3.2 The specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team (MDT) should offer people with newly diagnosed heart failure an extended first consultation, followed by a second consultation to take place within 2 weeks if possible. At each consultation: • discuss the person's diagnosis and prognosis • explain heart failure terminology • discuss treatments • discuss the risk of sudden death, including any misconceptions about that risk • encourage the person and their family or carers to ask any questions they have.
