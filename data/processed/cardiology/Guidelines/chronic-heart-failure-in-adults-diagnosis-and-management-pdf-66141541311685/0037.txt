of a medicine before introducing another. How quickly to introduce the medicines depends on a number of factors including symptoms, frailty, blood pressure and renal function. Based on their experience and expertise, the committee agreed that angiotensin receptor- neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) could be prescribed by primary care prescribers without the advice of a heart failure specialist. However, in some circumstances, advice from a heart specialist might be needed and so should be considered. Evidence showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can affect renal function and electrolyte levels. However, these risks can be managed by measuring a person's electrolyte levels and renal function at baseline and at regular intervals or after increasing their dose. Local guidelines should be followed rather than automatically discontinuing a medicine if there is a rise in serum creatinine of more than 50% or potassium concentrations increase to more than 5.5 mmol per litre. The importance of measuring blood pressure after each dose increment was also stressed by the committee as postural hypotension is a common cause of hospital admission in older people. Beta-blockers can affect heart rate and rhythm. The committee agreed,
