Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

symptomatic when receiving the combination of ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. However, where this combination is providing symptomatic improvement, switching to an ARNI is not advised because it is not as cost effective as an ACE inhibitor. The committee was aware that there should be a period of at least 36 hours between taking the last dose of an ACE inhibitor and the first dose of an ARNI. Economic modelling showed that ARNIs were cost effective compared to ARBs. The committee agreed that an ARNI should be offered instead of an ACE inhibitor to people who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors (other than angioedema). The previous first choice in this situation was an ARB. The committee agreed that an ARB can still be used for people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, or who have symptoms of intolerance to ARNIs. How the recommendations might affect practice Growing numbers of people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are being prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor or ARNI and these recommendations are likely to accelerate this trend. There is likely to be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure as a result of this change in prescribing. Return
