hyperkalaemia. The committee agreed an MRA should remain part of the treatment combination for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Economic modelling based on the clinical trials and real-world data suggested that early use of an MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor in combination with ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker would be cost-effective. For this reason and because the correct sequencing of medicines will vary from 1 person to another, the committee agreed to move away from a set of recommendations that include a sequence for introducing each medicine and instead listed treatment combinations for different scenarios. Evidence comparing treatment with an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker and MRA against treatment with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker and MRA showed reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for the group of people taking the treatment combination with an ARNI. More falls were seen in those taking an ARNI, while hyperkalaemia was more common among those taking an ACE inhibitor. The committee agreed that an ARNI can replace an ACE inhibitor in people who remain symptomatic when receiving the combination of ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. However, where this combination is providing symptomatic improvement, switching to an ARNI is not advised because it
