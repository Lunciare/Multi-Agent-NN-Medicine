heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction? For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on intravenous iron therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: IV iron therapy for heart failure. 2 Diuretic therapy for managing fluid overload in people with advanced heart failure in the community In people with advanced heart failure and significant peripheral fluid overload, what is the clinical and cost effectiveness of oral, subcutaneous and intravenous diuretic therapy in the community? 3 Cardiac MRI versus other imaging techniques for diagnosing heart failure What is the optimal imaging technique for the diagnosis of heart failure? 4 The impact of advanced kidney disease on the natriuretic peptide threshold for diagnosing heart failure What are the optimal NT-proBNP thresholds for diagnosing heart failure in people with stage IIIb, IV or V chronic kidney disease? 5 Risk tools for predicting non-sudden death in heart failure What is the most accurate prognostic risk tool in predicting 1-year mortality from heart failure at specific clinically relevant thresholds (for example, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive
