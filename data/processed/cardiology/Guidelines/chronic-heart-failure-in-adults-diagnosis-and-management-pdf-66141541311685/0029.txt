Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

failure What is the most accurate prognostic risk tool in predicting 1-year mortality from heart failure at specific clinically relevant thresholds (for example, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value at a threshold of 50% risk of mortality at 1 year)? Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Treatment combinations for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.4 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence showed adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to existing treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), beta-blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) reduced mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure without important increases in adverse events. The committee agreed that treatment combinations for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should now include an SGLT2 inhibitor. Similar benefits were seen when adding an MRA to existing treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB and beta-blocker although there was an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. The committee agreed an MRA should remain part of the treatment combination for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Economic modelling based on the clinical trials and
