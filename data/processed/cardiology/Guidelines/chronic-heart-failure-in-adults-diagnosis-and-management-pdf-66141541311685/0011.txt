Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor and • consider an ARB. [2025] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on treatment combinations for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Intravenous iron therapy 1.4.5 In people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, assess iron status and check for anaemia with all of the following blood tests: • transferrin saturation (TSAT) • serum ferritin • haemoglobin. [2025] 1.4.6 Consider iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and haemoglobin of less than 150 g per litre if they have iron deficiency defined as: • TSAT of less than 20% or • serum ferritin of less than 100 nanogram per ml. [2025] 1.4.7 If iron deficiency anaemia is identified, do not assume that it is related to the person's heart failure and think about investigating for alternative causes.
