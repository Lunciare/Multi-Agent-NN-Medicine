used in the trials. To support the recommendation on when to consider IV iron, the committee made a recommendation to assess iron status with blood tests for transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin, as well as measuring haemoglobin to check for anaemia. The committee highlighted the importance of considering alternative causes of iron deficiency anaemia when it is identified, but also the need to get the correct balance against over-investigating. As only 1 small trial was available for the mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction population, the committee made a recommendation for research on use of IV iron therapy in adults with iron deficiency and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. How the recommendations might affect practice The use of IV iron therapy to treat iron deficiency in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is quite common. In some places this might be a change in practice. With increased use of IV iron therapy there could be a reduction in hospitalisation.
