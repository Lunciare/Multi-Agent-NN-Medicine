2 weeks. [2018] 1.2.4 Refer people with suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level between 400 and 2,000 nanogram per litre (47 to 236 pmol per litre) to have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within 6 weeks. [2018] 1.2.5 Be aware that: • an NT-proBNP level of less than 400 nanogram per litre (47 pmol per litre) in an untreated person makes a diagnosis of heart failure less likely • the level of serum natriuretic peptide does not differentiate between heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced and reduced ejection fraction. [2018, amended 2025] 1.2.6 Review alternative causes for symptoms of heart failure in people with NT- proBNP levels of less than 400 nanogram per litre. If there is still concern that the symptoms might be related to heart failure, discuss with a physician with subspeciality training in heart failure. [2018] 1.2.7 Be aware that: • obesity, African or African–Caribbean ethnic background, or treatment with the following can reduce levels of serum natriuretic peptides: － a diuretic － an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) － a beta-blocker － a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) • high levels of serum natriuretic peptides can
