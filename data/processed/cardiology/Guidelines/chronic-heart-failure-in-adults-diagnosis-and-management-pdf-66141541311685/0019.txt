Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

block who do not have a pacemaker or to people with bradycardia (that is, a heart rate of less than 50 beats per minute). [2025] 1.7.12 Assess heart rate and clinical status after each dose increment. [2010] 1.7.13 For people with symptoms and bradycardia, consider repeating a 12-lead ECG after each dose increment. [2025] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2025 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on starting and monitoring medicine use. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Digoxin 1.7.14 Do not routinely monitor serum digoxin concentrations. Be aware that a digoxin concentration measured within 8 to 12 hours of the last dose may be useful to confirm a clinical impression of toxicity or non-adherence. [2003] 1.7.15 Interpret the serum digoxin concentration in the clinical context as toxicity may occur even when the concentration is within the therapeutic range. [2003] 1.8 Clinical review 1.8.1 Monitor all people with heart failure. Provide: • a clinical assessment of functional capacity, fluid status, cardiac rhythm (minimum of examining the pulse), cognitive status and nutritional status
