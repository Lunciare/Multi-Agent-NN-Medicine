Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

(ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) － a beta-blocker － a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) • high levels of serum natriuretic peptides can have causes other than heart failure (for example, pulmonary, renal, liver and systemic pathologies, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or cirrhosis of the liver). [2010, amended 2025] 1.2.8 Perform transthoracic echocardiography to exclude important valve disease, assess the systolic (and diastolic) function of the left ventricle and detect intracardiac shunts. See the section on referral for echocardiography and specialist assessment in NICE's guideline on heart valve disease. [2003, amended 2018] 1.2.9 Use high-resolution equipment operated by someone trained to the relevant professional standards to perform transthoracic echocardiography. Do not allow the need and demand for these investigations to compromise quality. [2003, amended 2018] 1.2.10 Ensure that those reporting echocardiography are experienced in doing so. [2003] 1.2.11 Think about alternative methods of imaging the heart (for example, radionuclide angiography [multigated acquisition scanning], cardiac MRI or transoesophageal echocardiography) if a poor image is produced by transthoracic echocardiography. [2003, amended 2018] 1.2.12 Perform an ECG and consider the following tests to evaluate possible aggravating factors or alternative diagnoses: • chest X-ray •
