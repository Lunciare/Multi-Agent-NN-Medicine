Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

combinations for heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction Recommendations 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence suggested each of the following medicines reduce hospitalisation for heart failure, and possibly mortality, in people with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), beta-blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). In practice, an ACE inhibitor and ARB would not be prescribed together because of the lack of additional benefit and risk of adverse events. There was no cost-effectiveness evidence for these medicines, but all are relatively cheap in their generic form. Evidence comparing use of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) with use of an ARB for treating heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction showed no difference in mortality rates. Economic evidence also showed that ARNIs were not cost effective for this population group and so were not recommended. The committee did not review the evidence for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors because the NICE technology appraisals 929 and 902 already recommend them as treatment options for people with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. The committee therefore agreed they should be considered alongside the other medicines. How the recommendations might
