pre- existing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction See recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 for guidance on how to introduce the medicines listed in recommendations 1.4.1, 1.4.3 and 1.4.4. See also the section on other treatments and advice for all types of heart failure. Treatment combinations 1.4.1 Offer an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. [2025] 1.4.2 For people on the maximum tolerated dose of each of the 4 medicines who continue to have symptoms of heart failure, consider switching the ACE inhibitor to an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). [2025] Alternative treatment combinations if certain medicines are not tolerated 1.4.3 For people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors (other than angioedema), offer an ARNI, beta- blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. [2025] 1.4.4 For people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, or who have symptoms of intolerance to ARNIs: • offer a beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor and • consider an ARB.
