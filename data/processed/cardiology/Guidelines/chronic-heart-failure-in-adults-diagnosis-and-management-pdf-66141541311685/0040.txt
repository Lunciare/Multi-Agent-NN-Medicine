Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management

left ventricular contraction phenotype of heart failure, otherwise called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as it was then the only phenotype of chronic heart failure where we had evidence-based treatments. The treatment algorithm then was based on stepwise introduction of medicines aiming to provide people with at least angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and, if remaining symptomatic, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). Those who continued to be symptomatic would be considered by the specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team for 1 or more of 4 further medicines. Since 2018, we have seen new developments in the treatment of not only heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but also new evidence emerged for the treatment of the people with heart failure due to stiff ventricle, called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; in addition to some evidence for treating those with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. In people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction there will be a need to change the ethos of stepwise introduction of medicines and allow early initiation of multiple medicines before optimising the doses of each. The reason for the different approach being the evidence for impact on people's symptoms and prognosis at an
