and these recommendations are likely to accelerate this trend. There is likely to be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure as a result of this change in prescribing. Return to recommendations Intravenous iron therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Recommendations 1.4.5 to 1.4.7 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence showed intravenous (IV) iron (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose) improved exercise tolerance and quality of life in the first year for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency. Some trials also showed reduced hospitalisation for heart failure. One study showed a significant risk of hypophosphatemia with ferric carboxymaltose. As hypophosphatemia can be monitored and treated, the committee agreed that the risk of this did not outweigh the expected benefits of IV iron. There was evidence that IV iron therapy is cost-effective in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency and so the committee focused on this population. They agreed to define iron deficiency according to the definition used in the trials. To support the recommendation on when to consider IV iron, the committee made a recommendation to assess iron status with blood tests for transferrin saturation (TSAT)
