recommendations on digoxin for people with atrial fibrillation, see the section on rate and rhythm control in NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation. 1.4.11 Offer digoxin to people with worsening or severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction despite optimised treatment combinations as detailed in recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.4. Seek specialist advice before starting treatment. [2010, amended 2025] Calcium-channel blockers 1.4.12 Avoid verapamil, diltiazem and short-acting dihydropyridine agents in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. [2003, amended 2018] 1.5 Treating people with newly diagnosed and pre- existing heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction Mildly reduced ejection fraction See recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 for guidance on how to introduce the medicines listed in recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.3. See also the section on other treatments and advice for all types of heart failure. 1.5.1 Consider an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for treating heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. See also recommendation 1.5.3. [2025] 1.5.2 For people who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors, consider an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), a beta-blocker, an MRA and an SGLT2 inhibitor.
