KEYWORDS: heart, failure, heart failure, people, ejection, fraction, ejection fraction, reduced, recommendations, committee, reduced ejection, person, inhibitor, specialist, care

For people who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors, consider an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), a beta-blocker, an MRA and an SGLT2 inhibitor. See also recommendation 1.5.3 [2025] 1.5.3 For SGLT2 inhibitors recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction, see the guidance on: • empagliflozin (TA929, 2023) • dapagliflozin (TA902, 2023). For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2025 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on treatment combinations for heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: medicines for heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. Preserved ejection fraction See recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 for guidance on how to introduce the medicines listed in recommendations 1.5.4 and 1.5.5. See also the section on other treatments and advice for all types of heart failure. 1.5.4 Consider an MRA and an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. See also recommendation 1.5.5. [2025] 1.5.5 For SGLT2 inhibitors recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, see
