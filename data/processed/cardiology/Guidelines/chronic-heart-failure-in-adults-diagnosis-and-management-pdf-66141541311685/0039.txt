1.7.3 to 1.7.5 and 1.7.7 and 1.7.8 Return to recommendations 1.7.10, 1.7.11 and 1.7.13 Context Key facts and figures Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs caused by impaired heart function. When this affects mainly the left ventricle, it can be due to either weakness of contraction or impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. Other problems affecting the right ventricle, the heart valves, the pulmonary circulation or the pericardium can lead to the development of heart failure. Almost 1 million people in the UK are currently diagnosed with heart failure, with 200,000 new cases each year. Both the incidence and prevalence of heart failure increase steeply with age. The average age at diagnosis is 76 years. Increases in life expectancy, including for people with ischaemic heart disease and hypertension, has increased the incidence of heart failure. The increased prevalence of obesity is another contributor to the rising incidence and prevalence of heart failure. Current practice NICE's 2018 guideline on chronic heart failure concentrated on the weak left ventricular contraction phenotype of heart failure, otherwise called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as it was then the only phenotype of chronic heart failure where we had evidence-based
