them as treatment options for people with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction. The committee therefore agreed they should be considered alongside the other medicines. How the recommendations might affect practice Although this is a new recommendation for NICE, most people in this population will already be receiving a combination of these medicines, if not contraindicated and depending on comorbidities. Where there is an impact, it will include extra staff time for consultations to establish the correct combination and dose of each of medicine. However, there should be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure. Return to the recommendations Treatment combinations for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Recommendation 1.5.4 Why the committee made the recommendation Evidence showed treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) reduced hospitalisation for heart failure and may also improve all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. However, there was an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Although this requires careful monitoring and management the committee agreed this should not prevent them from recommending MRAs for this population group. The committee did not review the evidence for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors because the NICE technology appraisals 929 and 902 already recommend
