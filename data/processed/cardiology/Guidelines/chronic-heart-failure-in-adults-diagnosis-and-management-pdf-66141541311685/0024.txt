cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy 1.10.3 Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy are recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. For full details, see the guidance on implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy (TA314, 2014). 1.10.4 When discussing implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator: • explain the risks, benefits and consequences of cardioverter defibrillator implantation, following the principles on shared decision making in NICE's guideline on shared decision making • ensure the person knows that the defibrillator function can be deactivated without affecting any cardiac resynchronisation or pacing, and reactivated later • explain the circumstances in which deactivation might be offered • discuss and dispel common misconceptions about the function of the device and the consequences of deactivation • provide the person and, if they wish, their family or carers, with written information covering the information discussed. [2018] 1.10.5 Review the benefits and potential harms of a cardioverter defibrillator remaining active in a person with heart failure: • at each 6-monthly review of their heart failure care • whenever their care goals change • as part of advance care planning if it is thought they are nearing the end
