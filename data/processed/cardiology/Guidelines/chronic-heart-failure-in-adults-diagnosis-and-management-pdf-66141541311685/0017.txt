ACE inhibitors, ARNIs, ARBs and MRAs 1.7.3 Before prescribing an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), measure the person's renal function and electrolyte levels. [2025] 1.7.4 If the person is taking an ACE inhibitor, ARNI, ARB or MRA, measure their renal function and electrolyte levels: • 1 to 2 weeks after starting treatment • 1 to 2 weeks after each dose increment • every 3 to 6 months once the maximum tolerated dose has been established • any time renal function may be compromised. [2025] 1.7.5 If the person's serum creatinine level increases by more than 50% or their potassium concentration increases to more than 5.5 mmol per litre, follow local guidelines. [2025] 1.7.6 For potassium binders recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating hyperkalaemia, see the guidance on: • patiromer (TA623, 2020) • sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (TA599, 2022). 1.7.7 Measure the person's blood pressure, or ask the person to measure their own blood pressure, before and after each dose increment. [2025] 1.7.8 For people with symptoms of postural hypotension, measure blood pressure according to recommendation 1.1.5 in NICE's guideline on hypertension in adults. [2025]
