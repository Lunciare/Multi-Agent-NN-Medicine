The committee therefore agreed they should be considered alongside MRAs. How the recommendation might affect practice This is a significant change in practice. The impact will include staff time for consultation to establish the correct dose of MRA and treatment of hyperkalaemia. However, there is likely to be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure.
