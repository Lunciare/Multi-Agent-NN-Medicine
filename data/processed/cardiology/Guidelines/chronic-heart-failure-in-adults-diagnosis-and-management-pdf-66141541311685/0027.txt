including 2 or more of the following: • left atrial volume greater than 34 ml per m2 in sinus rhythm, or greater than 40 ml per m2 in atrial fibrillation • ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and mitral annular early diastolic velocity (E:e' ratio) greater than 11 • left ventricular hypertrophy, that is, wall thickness greater than 12 mm • pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 35 mmHg. Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction Heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction between 41% and 49%. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist A medicine that antagonises the action of aldosterone at mineralocorticoid receptors. Recommendations for research The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. Key recommendations for research 1 Intravenous iron therapy in adults with iron deficiency and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of intravenous iron supplementation in adults with iron deficiency and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction? For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation for research, see the rationale section on intravenous iron therapy
