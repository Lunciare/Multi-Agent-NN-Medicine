In procedurally uncomplicated, elective PCI, where the risk of adverse sequelae is low, use of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is not recommended unless unexpected immediate complications occur. 1.8 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not currently licensed in the UK for use as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Coronary heart
