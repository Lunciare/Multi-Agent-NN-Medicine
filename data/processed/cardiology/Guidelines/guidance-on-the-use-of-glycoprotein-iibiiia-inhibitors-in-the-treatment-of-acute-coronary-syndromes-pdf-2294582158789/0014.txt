difference was statistically significant in 1 trial only. 4.1.2.3 However, with composite outcomes (usually a combination of death, subsequent MI and revascularisation), the great majority of trials showed a statistically significant benefit of treatment with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. There were more minor and major bleeds in the treatment groups in all studies, but the increased rates were not always statistically significant. There was little evidence of benefit for subgroups. 4.1.2.4 The only new data submitted on the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors during PCI were longer-term data from 2 trials (ESPRIT and EPIC), some re-analysis of the existing data, and data from a recent UK audit presented by the British Cardiac Society and Royal College of Physicians (London). 4.1.2.5 The clinical experts were asked to comment on the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as an adjunct during elective PCI. Their view was that elective single-vessel PCI in a low-risk patient carries a very small absolute risk of complications. Consequently, the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in such low-risk patients was generally considered unlikely to confer any clinically significant additional benefit; GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors should only be used in these circumstances if unexpected complications occur. Conversely, the use of GP
