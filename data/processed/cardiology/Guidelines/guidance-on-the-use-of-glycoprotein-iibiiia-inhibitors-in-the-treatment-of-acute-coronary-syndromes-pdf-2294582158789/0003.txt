the cardiac markers (troponins and creatine kinase [CK]) are elevated to ranges that indicate that MI has occurred, but a Q-wave does not develop on electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings. This profile is thought to indicate damage to the heart muscle that does not extend through the full thickness of the myocardium. NSTEMI therefore represents a subgroup of patients with non-ST-elevation ACS at high risk of a subsequent event. 2.4 In 1998, the overall prevalence of CHD in England was estimated to be 7.1% in men and 4.6% in women. Prevalence increases with age. It is difficult to estimate the incidence of ACS in England and Wales. The hospital episode statistics for 2000 to 2001 detail 148,000 episodes of angina pectoris in England, with 83,000 of these specified as unstable angina. However, there are variations in the coding of this condition, and it has been suggested that these figures are conservative. Recently, the incidence of unstable angina has been estimated at 226 cases per 100,000 population, which equates to approximately 120,000 cases in England and Wales per annum. 2.5 In 1999, in England and Wales, there were over 115,000 deaths caused by CHD. Although CHD-associated mortality rates are falling by about 4%
