in England and Wales per annum. 2.5 In 1999, in England and Wales, there were over 115,000 deaths caused by CHD. Although CHD-associated mortality rates are falling by about 4% per year in the UK, this does not reflect a fall in incidence of the disease. In addition, improvements in rates of death from CHD have not been uniform across all social classes; death rates among unskilled men are 3 times greater than those among professional men. 2.6 The main aim in the short-term management of non-ST-segment-elevation ACS is to control pain and prevent progression to full-thickness MI (STEMI) and/or death. The first steps in the management pathway involve bed rest and medical treatment including antiplatelet therapy (aspirin), anticoagulants (heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]), vasodilators (nitrates), calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers. Revascularisation, when necessary, is by means of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), usually with stent implantation, or by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 2.7 Certain patients with unstable angina are at high risk of progression to MI or death. The British Cardiac Society guidelines say that certain circumstances are associated with an increased risk of early adverse outcome, including age above 65 years; comorbidity, especially diabetes; prolonged (more than 15 minutes)
