Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

were small compared with those of other interventions in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), for example aspirin. Subgroup analyses showed that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be particularly effective in troponin-positive patients. A recently published meta-analysis seen by the committee (the Boersma study) analysed the data for various subgroups and suggested that, in those not routinely scheduled for early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the rate of cardiac complications is reduced following the administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. 4.1.1.5 The submissions for this appraisal from consultees (manufacturers or sponsors, professional, and patient or carer groups) contained no clinical evidence on the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors for the medical management of ACS that had not already been included in the assessment report. 4.1.1.6 The clinical experts were asked about the evidence for medical management in those not going on to have a PCI during GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration, which is frequently the scenario in current UK practice. They stated that current evidence-based good practice is to investigate, by means of coronary angiography, with a view to early revascularisation, all of those patients presenting with ACS deemed to be at high enough risk to merit a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. 4.1.1.7 They were also asked
