coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients who are not scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 5.3 Research should be carried out to investigate the efficacy of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in subgroups such as women. A recently published meta-analysis of patient-level data has suggested that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may have no benefit in the medical management of ACS in women. 5.4 The results of the CURE trial may lead to a consideration of the use of clopidogrel for the management of patients with ACS. Research to establish the relative roles of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and clopidogrel in the short-term management of patients with ACS will be necessary. 5.5 Research is needed to establish the statistical relationship between clinical risk factors and troponin levels, so as to assess the value added by the troponin result in the determination of risk level. 6 Implications for the NHS 6.1 Replacement of the September 2000 guidance with this revised guidance is not anticipated to increase costs to the NHS. Fewer patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will receive glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which may result in some cost savings. Under the previous guidance it was assumed that a positive troponin test would be used
