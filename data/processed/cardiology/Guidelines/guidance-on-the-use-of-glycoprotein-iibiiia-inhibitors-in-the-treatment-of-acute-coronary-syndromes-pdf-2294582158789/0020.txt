high-risk ACS patients, this was not assessed in the model and is not within the scope of the present guidance. The model suggests that the cost effectiveness of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is not dependent on whether a PCI is performed; therefore, their administration does not need to be delayed until a decision is made to carry out PCI. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as an adjunct during PCI only is also less cost effective than their use in initial medical management. 4.3 Consideration of the evidence 4.3.1 The committee considered the evidence available and the viewpoints expressed by the experts on the current management of ACS patients in the UK. It was emphasised that this appraisal related solely to the use of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the management of ACS, and that it did not extend to the role of PCI or the management of ACS in general. 4.3.2 Historically, PCI rates have been lower in the UK than in the countries where the majority of the published trials of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in ACS have been carried out. The committee took this into account when considering the validity of these trials in relation to current UK
