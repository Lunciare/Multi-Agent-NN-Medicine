horizon. Four treatment strategies for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were compared: • a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used as part of initial management, with treatment begun immediately in all ACS patients at the time they were identified • a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor started only after making a decision to carry out PCI • a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used as an adjunct to PCI, started up to 1 hour before the procedure • no use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. An additional analysis looked at initial management in high-risk ACS patients only (defined as those with at least 1 of 3 factors: age over 70 years, diabetes, ST-depression). Initially, baseline event rates were calculated based on PRAIS-UK and Leeds audit data. Since PCI rates here may be lower than in current practice, an alternative analysis using the Boersma meta- analysis was performed. The model applied relative risks from all available trials and from the Boersma data. All analyses showed that use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in initial management was the preferred strategy. Depending on the assumptions used, estimates of cost per QALY ranged from £4,605 to £11,671. However, the most cost-effective option was initial medical management in the subgroup of high-risk patients only, with
