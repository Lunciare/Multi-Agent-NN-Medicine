Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

studies looked at eptifibatide, 2 at tirofiban and 1 at abciximab; all these studies compared treatment with placebo or no treatment. On the whole, the studies were well conducted. Outcome measures included death, myocardial infarction (MI), need for revascularisation and adverse events associated with use of the trial drugs. Differences between trials precluded pooling results in the assessment report. 4.1.1.2 In nearly all studies involving the small-molecule glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide and tirofiban), the rates of death and MI were reduced in the treatment groups compared with the comparator group; however, the difference was not always statistically significant. In all of the trials, the risk of bleeding was greater in the groups receiving a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor than in the comparator group, but the difference was not always statistically significant. 4.1.1.3 In the GUSTO-IV trial of abciximab, the results demonstrated neither benefit nor trends of benefit in the primary outcomes of death and MI at 30 days. 4.1.1.4 The assessment group concluded that the effects of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were small compared with those of other interventions in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), for example aspirin. Subgroup analyses showed that GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be particularly effective in troponin-positive patients.
