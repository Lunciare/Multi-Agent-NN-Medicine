Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

of death or further MI. NICE's guidance recommended intravenous administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to patients undergoing acute or elective PCI. 3 The technology 3.1 Abciximab (ReoPro) 3.1.1 Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets. 3.1.2 Abciximab is indicated as an adjunct to aspirin and heparin for the prevention of ischaemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It is also indicated for the short-term (1 month) reduction of risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients who have unstable angina that is not responding to full conventional therapy and who are to undergo PCI. Abciximab is administered intravenously at an initial bolus dose of 250 microgram/kg body weight followed by a maintenance dose of 0.125 microgram/kg/min (maximum 10 microgram/min) over 12 to 36 hours. 3.1.3 As with the other GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the side effects of abciximab (including bleeding and thrombocytopenia) are related to its pharmacological effects. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics. 3.1.4 The cost of abciximab is £280 (net) for a 10-mg vial (BNF 43rd edition). For a 70-kg person, the cost per course ranges from £840 to £1,120,
