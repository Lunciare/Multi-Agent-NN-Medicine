a view to early revascularisation, all of those patients presenting with ACS deemed to be at high enough risk to merit a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. 4.1.1.7 They were also asked to comment on the importance of various risk factors used to identify high-risk ACS patients. They considered that an elevated troponin result often confirms the high-risk status of an individual, but that increased troponin should not be thought of as the only indicator of high risk and that other clinical factors have to be taken into account. 4.1.2 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as an adjunct to PCI 4.1.2.1 The assessment group found 5 new trials (PRICE, ADMIRAL, TACTICS-TIMI, TARGET and ESPRIT), in addition to 12 studies from the previous appraisal that are relevant to this review. Fourteen trials compared treatment with placebo or no treatment, 10 of which involved abciximab, 3 involved eptifibatide and 1 involved tirofiban. There were 2 head-to-head trials, 1 of abciximab and eptifibatide and 1 of abciximab and tirofiban. One further trial compared invasive and conservative treatment, with all participants receiving tirofiban. The definition of participants both within and between trials was broad, from patients undergoing elective PCI to those who had acute PCI after MI. All
