Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

the assumptions used, estimates of cost per QALY ranged from £4,605 to £11,671. However, the most cost-effective option was initial medical management in the subgroup of high-risk patients only, with cost per QALY estimated at £3,966. The additional benefit of use in all patients compared to use in high-risk patients alone was gained at a cost per QALY of £91,000. When using GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as an adjunct to PCI was compared with not using them, the base-case cost per QALY was £25,811; this was reduced to £11,160 if baseline event rates based on Boersma data were applied. 4.2.3.2 In summary, the assessment report model, which is the closest representation of current UK practice available, indicates that the most cost-effective strategy is for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to be used as part of the initial medical management of high-risk ACS patients, irrespective of whether angiography with a view to PCI is performed. Although early angiography with a view to PCI is considered to be of benefit in the initial management of high-risk ACS patients, this was not assessed in the model and is not within the scope of the present guidance. The model suggests that the cost effectiveness of GP IIb/IIIa
