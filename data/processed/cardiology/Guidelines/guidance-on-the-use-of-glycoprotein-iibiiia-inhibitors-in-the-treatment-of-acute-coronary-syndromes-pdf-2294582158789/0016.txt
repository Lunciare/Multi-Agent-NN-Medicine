model was based on a prospective economic evaluation conducted as part of the PURSUIT trial. Based on the subgroup of patients from Western Europe (12% of the total patients), the cost per life-year gained for eptifibatide was estimated as £8,179 to £11,079. Although lifetime survival duration was modelled, no extrapolation of costs over the patients' lifetime was attempted and it is not clear how this would impact on the results. 4.2.1.3 The tirofiban manufacturer's model reported that 22% of the cost of tirofiban is offset by savings due to the reduction in events. The lack of a standardised outcome measure makes it difficult to interpret these results in relation to other treatments. The absolute reduction in event rates associated with tirofiban was not adjusted for UK-specific, baseline-event rates. 4.2.2 Use as an adjunct to PCI 4.2.2.1 A further 6 economic studies in the literature were identified in addition to the 17 studies included in the original appraisal, but none of these fully reflects current UK practice and the long-term costs and consequences. The original appraisal also considered the manufacturer's submission for abciximab. 4.2.2.2 In the manufacturer's model for abciximab, for patients undergoing urgent and elective PCIs in a UK setting,
