Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

and consequences. The original appraisal also considered the manufacturer's submission for abciximab. 4.2.2.2 In the manufacturer's model for abciximab, for patients undergoing urgent and elective PCIs in a UK setting, estimates of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ranged from £6,941 to £9,053 based on the EPILOG trial and from £3,949 to £5,151 based on the EPISTENT trial. These estimates must be interpreted with caution for the following reasons: the baseline risk of events is different in the UK from that in the trials; the assumption that patients surviving the first year will live for a further 15 years ignores variability of prognosis; and it may not be valid to assume that costs do not differ between treatment options over a period of 2 to 15 years. 4.2.3 Assessment group model 4.2.3.1 The assessment group developed a UK-specific model to look at the optimal use and timing of use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in ACS patients. The model estimated health outcomes in terms of QALYs and had a lifetime time horizon. Four treatment strategies for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were compared: • a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor used as part of initial management, with treatment begun immediately in all ACS patients at
