Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

with all participants receiving tirofiban. The definition of participants both within and between trials was broad, from patients undergoing elective PCI to those who had acute PCI after MI. All trials were classified as RCTs, and many of them were large (with at least 1,000 participants). Outcomes measured included death, non-fatal MI, the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after the current procedure, and adverse events. 4.1.2.2 Again, the results of the trials were not pooled for the assessment report because of heterogeneity, which included differences between studies in the inclusion criteria for patients undergoing the procedure. Only 1 trial showed the use of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor to be associated with a significant reduction in the mortality rate at 30 days; another trial showed significant reduction in the mortality rate at 6 months. The use of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor was associated with a reduction in the rate of revascularisation at 30 days and at 6 months in studies in which this was measured, but the difference was statistically significant in 1 trial only. 4.1.2.3 However, with composite outcomes (usually a combination of death, subsequent MI and revascularisation), the great majority of trials showed a statistically
