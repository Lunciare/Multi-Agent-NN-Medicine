Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

Cardiac Society guidelines say that certain circumstances are associated with an increased risk of early adverse outcome, including age above 65 years; comorbidity, especially diabetes; prolonged (more than 15 minutes) cardiac pain at rest; ischaemic ECG ST-segment depression on admission or during symptoms; ECG T-wave inversion (associated with an intermediate risk, lying between that associated with ST-segment depression and normal ECG); evidence of impairment of left ventricular function (either pre-existing or during MI); and elevated C-reactive protein. In addition, those with raised levels of cardiac troponin are considered to be at high risk of an event. 2.8 Despite the use of standard therapy (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants), the rate of adverse outcomes (such as death, non-fatal re-infarction, refractory angina or readmission for unstable angina) at 6 months after presenting with unstable angina is about 30%. 2.9 In guidance issued in September 2000, NICE recommended the intravenous use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, in addition to aspirin and low (adjusted) dose unfractionated heparin, for patients with unstable angina at high risk of death or further MI. NICE's guidance recommended intravenous administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors to patients undergoing acute or elective PCI. 3 The technology 3.1 Abciximab (ReoPro) 3.1.1 Abciximab is
