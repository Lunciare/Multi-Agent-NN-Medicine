Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

intervention (PCI) will receive glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which may result in some cost savings. Under the previous guidance it was assumed that a positive troponin test would be used to identify high risk and that therefore approximately one-third of people admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) would receive a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The prevalence of the risk factors described in 1.4 among people admitted with ACS is unknown, but assuming a similar proportion will be identified as being at high risk as would have been identified using the troponin result, the impact of this section of the guidance remains unchanged. 6.2 The British Cardiovascular Intervention Society audit recorded 30,916 PCIs in NHS centres during 2000. However, since there are only limited data as to the case-mix of patients undergoing these procedures estimation of budget impact cannot be made. 7 Implementation and audit 7.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013 requires integrated care boards, NHS England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this evaluation within 3 months of its date of
