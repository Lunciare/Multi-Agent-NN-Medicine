management in high-risk patients, the committee thought that it was important that treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. This proves problematic if raised troponin alone is used to identify high-risk status, as the earliest that raised troponin levels can be accurately detected is 6 to 12 hours after the onset of chest pain. The committee considered that, in the presence of sufficient high-risk factors, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor treatment should be initiated without delaying to confirm high-risk status with a positive cardiac troponin test. 4.3.6 The committee considered that those ACS patients undergoing PCI should be treated with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. In situations where this is not covered by initial medical management, the committee thought that the administration of a GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor would still be appropriate. No clinical trial evidence is available on a strategy that involves a second administration of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (that is, after initial medical management) for a delayed PCI. 4.3.7 At the same time, the committee considered that, for clinically stable patients without diabetes who are undergoing procedurally uncomplicated, routine, elective single-vessel PCI, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may not be necessary and therefore should not be recommended for routine use unless
