trials of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in ACS have been carried out. The committee took this into account when considering the validity of these trials in relation to current UK practice, together with evidence from the experts suggesting that PCI rates in the UK are now rising by approximately 20% per annum. 4.3.3 The committee considered that the assessment group model provided the best estimates of cost effectiveness for the UK and, on the balance of clinical and cost effectiveness, the committee concluded that use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors for initial medical management in high-risk patients was the preferred treatment strategy. 4.3.4 The current licensed indications for the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are for use with aspirin and unfractionated heparin. However, the committee recognised that low- molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is used widely in the management of ACS in place of unfractionated heparin, and was aware of the ongoing trials using GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors in conjunction with LMWH. 4.3.5 If GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are to be used as part of medical management in high-risk patients, the committee thought that it was important that treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. This proves problematic if raised troponin alone is used to
