(including bleeding and thrombocytopenia) are related to its pharmacological effects. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the summary of product characteristics. 3.2.4 The cost of eptifibatide is £15.54 (net) for a 20-mg vial and £48.84 (net) for a 75-mg vial (BNF 43rd edition). For a 70-kg person, the cost per course ranges from £455 to £553, depending on the duration of treatment (costs rounded to full vials). 3.3 Tirofiban (Aggrastat) 3.3.1 Tirofiban is a non-peptidal antagonist of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor and is 1 of the small-molecule GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. It prevents fibrinogen from binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, thus blocking platelet aggregation. 3.3.2 Tirofiban is indicated for the prevention of early MI in patients presenting with unstable angina or NSTEMI who have had chest pain within the last 12 hours and who have ECG changes and/or elevated cardiac enzymes. It is administered intravenously at an initial dose of 0.4 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1 microgram/kg/min for at least 48 hours, up to a maximum duration of treatment of 108 hours. 3.3.3 As with the other GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the side effects of tirofiban (including bleeding and thrombocytopenia) are related
