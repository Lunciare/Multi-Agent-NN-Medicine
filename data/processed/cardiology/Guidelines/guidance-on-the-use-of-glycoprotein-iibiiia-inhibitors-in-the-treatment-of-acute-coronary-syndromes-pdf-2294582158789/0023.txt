stable patients without diabetes who are undergoing procedurally uncomplicated, routine, elective single-vessel PCI, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may not be necessary and therefore should not be recommended for routine use unless unexpected immediate complications occur. The low risk of adverse events during such PCI procedures is demonstrated by UK audit data submitted by the British Cardiac Society and Royal College of Physicians (London). 5 Recommendations for further research 5.1 All of the trials currently available looked at the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors in conjunction with heparin, in line with their licensed indications. There is an ongoing trial (A-Z trial) looking at the use of tirofiban in conjunction with low- molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); INTERACT, another ongoing trial, is looking at a combination of eptifibatide with a LMWH (enoxaparin). As LMWH is widely used instead of standard heparin, the results of these trials are awaited with interest. 5.2 The effects of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in current UK practice should be investigated in carefully designed research to assess their benefits in non-ST-segment- elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients who are not scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 5.3 Research should be carried out to investigate the efficacy of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in subgroups
