Guidance on the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the treatment of acute coronary

was generally considered unlikely to confer any clinically significant additional benefit; GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors should only be used in these circumstances if unexpected complications occur. Conversely, the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors as an adjunct to PCI was considered beneficial in patients with evidence of recent ACS, in patients with diabetes and in patients undergoing potentially complex PCI, which might include multivessel disease, the use of multiple stents, PCI of a vein graft or PCI of bifurcation lesions. 4.2 Cost effectiveness 4.2.1 GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors for the medical management of ACSs 4.2.1.1 The assessment group found no additional cost-effectiveness studies beyond the 7 included in the previous appraisal of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. None of these studies were UK-based. Since management of ACS in the UK differs from that in other developed countries, particularly in regard to the rate of PCI, the results were not considered to be applicable to the UK. Economic models for tirofiban and eptifibatide were submitted by the manufacturers for the original appraisal. 4.2.1.2 The eptifibatide manufacturer's model was based on a prospective economic evaluation conducted as part of the PURSUIT trial. Based on the subgroup of patients from Western Europe (12% of the total patients), the
