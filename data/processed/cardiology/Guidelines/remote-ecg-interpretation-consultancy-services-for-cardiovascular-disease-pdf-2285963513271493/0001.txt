Remote ECG interpretation consultancy services for cardiovascular disease

Summary • The technologies described in this briefing are remote electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation consultancy services. They are used for assisting in diagnosing and decision-making for people with cardiovascular disease. • The innovative aspects are that with remote ECG interpretation, a person does not need to travel to hospital for a consultation with a cardiologist, potentially providing quicker and more accurate diagnoses. • The intended place in therapy would be to replace referrals to secondary care for interpreting ECGs from people with suspected cardiovascular disease. • The main points from the evidence summarised in this briefing are from 4 UK pilot studies including 26,320 adults and children in primary care.
