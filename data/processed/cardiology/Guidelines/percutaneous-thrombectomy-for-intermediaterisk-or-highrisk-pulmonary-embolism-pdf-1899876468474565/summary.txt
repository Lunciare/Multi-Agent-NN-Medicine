1 Recommendations High-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) when alternative treatments are not suitable 1.1 For high-risk PE in people who cannot have thrombolysis, or when there are no other suitable treatment options or alternative treatments have failed, percutaneous thrombectomy should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, informed consent and audit. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Clinicians wanting to do percutaneous thrombectomy for high-risk PE when alternative treatments are not suitable should: • Inform the clinical governance leads in their healthcare organisation. • Ensure that people (and their families and carers as appropriate) understand the procedure's safety and efficacy, and any uncertainties about these. • Take account of NICE's advice on shared decision making, including NICE's information for the public. • Audit and review clinical outcomes of everyone having the procedure.
