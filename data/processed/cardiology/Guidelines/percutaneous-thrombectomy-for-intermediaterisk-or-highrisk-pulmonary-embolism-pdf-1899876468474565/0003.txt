improvement in short- and long-term outcomes. The evidence on safety does not raise any major concerns. Most of the evidence is for intermediate-risk PE. There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials and very little long-term follow- up evidence, particularly for patient-reported outcomes. There is an unmet need for people with high-risk PE when alternative treatments are not suitable or have failed, and this procedure is the only treatment option. So, this procedure is recommended for use with special arrangements for this population. Because of the lack of evidence, this procedure is only recommended for use in research for intermediate-risk PE, or high-risk PE when alternative treatments are suitable. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 A pulmonary embolism (PE) is when a pulmonary artery is obstructed by an embolus (usually a blood clot) that travels to the lungs from deep veins in the leg or pelvis. PE often causes shortness of breath, chest pain and cough. The symptoms and severity vary from no symptoms to cardiovascular collapse and death. 2.2 A high-risk PE (also known as massive PE) is defined by sustained systemic hypotension or shock. An intermediate-risk PE (also known as submassive PE) involves right
