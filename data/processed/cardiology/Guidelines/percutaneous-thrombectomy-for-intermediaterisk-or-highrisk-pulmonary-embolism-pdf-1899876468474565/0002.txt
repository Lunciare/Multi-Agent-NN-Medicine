of the procedure during their annual appraisal to reflect, learn and improve. 1.3 Healthcare organisations should: • Ensure systems are in place that support clinicians to collect and report data on outcomes and safety for everyone having this procedure. • Regularly review data on outcomes and safety for this procedure. Intermediate-risk PE or high-risk PE when alternative treatments are suitable 1.4 For intermediate-risk PE or high-risk PE when alternative treatments are suitable, pulmonary thrombectomy should only be used in research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.5 Further research should be in the form of randomised controlled trials or registries. It should report: • patient selection • size and position of the clot • degree of right ventricular dysfunction • details of the procedure, including the device used • short- and long-term outcomes, including patient-reported outcomes. Why the committee made these recommendations There is enough evidence that the procedure reduces the extent of clot in the circulation but not enough evidence of improvement in short- and long-term outcomes. The evidence on safety does not raise any major concerns. Most of the evidence is for intermediate-risk PE. There is no evidence from randomised
