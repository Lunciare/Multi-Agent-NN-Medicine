Percutaneous thrombectomy for intermediate-risk or high-risk pulmonary embolism

collapse and death. 2.2 A high-risk PE (also known as massive PE) is defined by sustained systemic hypotension or shock. An intermediate-risk PE (also known as submassive PE) involves right ventricular dysfunction or myocardial injury without major haemodynamic compromise. High-risk PE accounts for less than 10% of acute PE cases and is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. Current treatments 2.3 The first-line treatment for PE is systemic or oral anticoagulants. For high- or intermediate-risk PE with haemodynamic compromise, systemic thrombolysis may be used or, rarely, open surgical embolectomy. Catheter-directed therapies may also be used, including catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous thrombectomy. Catheter-directed therapies are usually used if someone has a high-risk PE and they cannot have surgery, or when systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed. The procedure 2.4 In this endovascular procedure, a catheter is inserted percutaneously into the peripheral vasculature (usually by a common femoral vein) and advanced through the right side of the heart into the pulmonary arteries under image guidance. This procedure is usually done by interventional radiologists and interventional cardiologists. It is usually done using local anaesthesia with or without sedation. 2.5 There are several thrombectomy devices available with some variation in their
