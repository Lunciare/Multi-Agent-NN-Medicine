ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology:

It is also important to remember that cardiotoxicity does not occur in everyone receiving these treatments. Most cancer patients receive their cancer treatment without cardiovascular complications. The aims of cardio-oncology are to allow patients with cancer to receive the best possible cancer treatment and to maintain a healthy heart. To help with this, ESC Guidelines recommend that: • Patients who are scheduled to receive cancer treatment should be assessed for their potential risk of heart complications • Patients should be closely monitored, during and after treatment, so any side effects can be minimised Healthcare Professionals and Patients with Cancer – Working in Partnership A partnership with your medical team is important to ensure you receive the most effective care. Your medical team will give you relevant information on your specific cancer treatment – they will discuss the benefits with you and let you know if there are any side effects related to the heart and circulation. They will monitor you for heart problems and discuss what heart symptoms to look out for and how to keep your heart healthy. Discuss the risk of cardiotoxicity based on the cancer treatment and your heart health Report any heart symptoms to your Monitor
