ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology:

are related to your cancer therapy and other potential causes may need to be investigated. If baseline tests were done before your cancer treatment, cardiologists will be able to compare your test results over time to see if there have been any changes. If you develop a heart or circulation condition during your cancer treatment, doctors will decide if the best option is to keep going with your current treatment, stop it temporarily or change to a different treatment. The ESC Guidelines provide structured plans for how your oncologist and cardiologist can look after you in this situation. They will discuss this with you and a shared decision will be made together. Cardio-Oncology Care After Cancer Treatment In some people, cancer treatment (including cancer drugs and/or radiation therapy) may affect their heart and circulation months to years after completing therapy, for example, developing high blood pressure, heart muscle weakness, coronary artery disease, heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) or problems with the valves in your heart. Your family doctor will be the main point of contact after cancer treatment has been completed and the cancer team will organise follow-ups as required – this may be from every few months to one follow-up
