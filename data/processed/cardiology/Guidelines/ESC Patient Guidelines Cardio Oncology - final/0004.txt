Guidelines provide your medical team with information on how to assess your risk, what tests are needed to monitor your heart health and if a referral to a cardiologist (a heart doctor) is needed. • If you need to have heart tests, these may be carried out before you start treatment (called “baseline” tests) to assess your risk and also to see if there are any changes during treatment. • Heart tests may include heart rhythm tracing (called an “ECG” or “electrocardiogram”), blood tests and/or a heart scan using ultrasound (“echocardiography”), an MRI scanner or a CT scanner. These will help cardiologists to assess your heart health and to work out if you have any existing heart problems. In the case of abnormal findings, heart treatments may be started. Heart tests that help to assess cardiotoxicity risk Electrocardiogram (ECG) Blood tests can check Echocardiogram (echo) checks the electrical if the heart is damaged is an ultrasound of the activity of the heart (e.g. BNP/NT-proBNP heart that shows how well and troponin) it is working Cardiac magnetic resonance Cardiac computed tomography checks the function and provides a detailed picture of structure of the heart your heart and blood vessels • If
