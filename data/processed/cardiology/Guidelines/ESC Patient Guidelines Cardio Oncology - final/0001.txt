ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology:

Cancer and Heart Complications: What is Cardio-Oncology? There are many different types of cancer therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as medications such as hormonal treatments, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Some of these therapies may increase the risk of heart or circulatory problems – we call these complications “cardiotoxicity” or “cardiovascular toxicity.” The types of complications can include: • High blood pressure • A heart attack or chest pain, called “angina” • Heart muscle weakness that can develop into heart failure when the heart does not pump properly • The heart becoming inflamed, known as myocarditis • An irregular heartbeat called an arrhythmia • A blood clot forming in a vein (called “deep vein thrombosis”) or in the lungs (called “pulmonary embolism”) Sometimes, cardiotoxicity can limit the use of effective anticancer therapies. It is important to emphasise that these anticancer therapies have been shown to be effective in treating cancer and the fear of possible cardiotoxicity should not prevent you from receiving the best treatment for your cancer. It is also important to remember that cardiotoxicity does not occur in everyone receiving these treatments. Most cancer patients receive their cancer treatment without cardiovascular complications.
