Percutaneous radiofrequency
ablation for atrial fibrillation
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 26 April 2006
www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg168
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous
radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation appears adequate to support
the use of this procedure in appropriately selected patients (see section
2.1.4) provided that normal arrangements are in place for audit and
clinical governance.
1.2 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the potential
complications, the likelihood of success and the risk of recurrent atrial
fibrillation associated with this procedure. In addition, use of NICE's
information for the public is recommended.
1.3 This procedure should only be performed in specialist units and with
arrangements for cardiac surgical support in the event of complications.
1.4 This procedure should only be performed by cardiologists with extensive
experience of other types of ablation procedures.

Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation (IPG168)
1.5 The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research runs the
National Congenital Heart Disease Audit database and clinicians are
encouraged to enter all patients undergoing percutaneous
radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation onto this database.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications
2.1.1 Atrial fibrillation is the irregular and rapid beating of the upper two
chambers of the heart (the atria). It may be classified as paroxysmal,
persistent or permanent. Patients with atrial fibrillation may be
asymptomatic or they may have symptoms including palpitations,
dizziness, breathlessness and fatigue. They have an increased risk of
stroke as a result of blood clots forming in the left atrium and then
embolising to the brain.
2.1.2 Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the absence of structural heart disease.
2.1.3 Conservative treatments include medication to control the heart rhythm
and rate, electrical cardioversion and anticoagulation to prevent blood
clots forming. Surgery for atrial fibrillation is usually performed at the
same time as open heart surgery for another indication, such as for the
correction of mitral valve disease. The conventional surgical approach,
known as the Cox maze procedure, involves making multiple,
strategically placed incisions in both atria to isolate and stop the
abnormal electrical impulses. Alternative methods of creating lesions in
the atria by ablation have been developed using energy sources such as
radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy and ultrasound.
2.1.4 Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a treatment option for
symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation refractory to anti-arrhythmic
drug therapy or where medical therapy is contraindicated because of co-
morbidity or intolerance.

Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation (IPG168)
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive procedure
that is usually carried out under sedation. A catheter is inserted into the
femoral vein and advanced into the heart, using X-ray fluoroscopic
guidance to ensure correct positioning. An attachment at the tip of the
catheter sends out radiofrequency energy, producing heat that damages
the targeted area of the conduction pathway. Electrophysiological testing
is undertaken before the procedure to identify and map the source of the
abnormal electrical signals. Advanced imaging and mapping techniques
that do not require fluoroscopy have also been developed for use in this
procedure.
2.2.2 Several different strategies may be used, including linear ablation in the
left or right atrium and focal pulmonary vein to isolate triggers of atrial
fibrillation that arise from within the pulmonary vein. This guidance does
not refer to the procedure of atrioventricular node ablation and pacing.
2.3 Efficacy
2.3.1 In a randomised controlled trial of 70 patients, recurrence of atrial
fibrillation at 1 year follow-up was 13% (4/32) after radiofrequency
ablation compared with 63% (22/35) after anti-arrhythmic medication (p
< 0.001). There were also significantly fewer episodes of hospitalisation
in the radiofrequency ablation group: 9% (3/32) and 54% (19/35) of
patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Quality-of-life measurements at 6
months favoured the radiofrequency ablation treatment. In a smaller
randomised controlled trial, frequency of symptoms decreased from a
mean of 42.8 attacks per month at baseline to 0.9 attacks per month at 1
year in 14 patients after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (p <
0.001).
2.3.2 In a non-randomised comparative study of 1171 patients, 78% of patients
treated with radiofrequency ablation were estimated to be free of atrial
fibrillation at 3 years, compared with 37% of patients treated with
medication (p < 0.001). Patients receiving percutaneous radiofrequency
ablation had a 54% reduction in risk of death compared with those
receiving medication (p < 0.001).

Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation (IPG168)
2.3.3 A large survey reported that 76% (6644/8745) of treated patients had
resolution of symptoms of atrial fibrillation after a median follow-up of 12
months (this proportion ranged from 22% to 91% among different
centres). For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.
2.3.4 The Specialist Advisors noted the lack of long-term data.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 A complication rate of 6% (524/8745) was reported in the survey of 8745
patients who had undergone percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for
atrial fibrillation. The most significant complications reported in this study
were four early deaths (< 1%), 20 strokes (< 1%), 47 transient ischaemic
attacks (1%), 117 cases of pulmonary vein stenosis (1%), 107 episodes of
cardiac tamponade (1%) and 37 cases of arteriovenous fistula (< 1%).
2.4.2 In two comparative studies of 1171 and 30 patients, complications
specific to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation included cardiac
tamponade in less than 1% (4/589) of patients, stroke in 7% (1/14) and
groin haematoma in 7% (1/14).
2.4.3 Two of the studies also reported that 2% and 4% of patients (12/589 and
340/8745, respectively) developed atypical atrial flutter of new onset
after undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. In a case series
of 632 procedures a cardiac perforation rate of 2% (15 procedures) was
reported, each case requiring pericardiocentesis: all the patients affected
survived. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence.
2.4.4 The Specialist Advisors listed the potential adverse events as stroke,
cardiac tamponade, atrio-oesophageal fistula and pulmonary vein
stenosis.
