based on prespecified subgroup analyses. The committee noted that the company presented a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients who had a myocardial infarction 1 to 2 years previously (ticagrelor n=4,331, placebo n=4,333). The committee also noted that these results (referred to as the 'base-case' population by the company) tended to be more favourable to ticagrelor than the results from the overall ticagrelor population. The committee acknowledged that PEGASUS-TIMI 54 was not statistically powered to detect a difference in outcomes in the company's base-case population, but agreed that because of the size of the subgroup, and the baseline characteristics being sufficiently similar to the overall ticagrelor group, it was appropriate for it to focus on this subgroup analysis in its decision-making about the clinical effectiveness of ticagrelor. 4.7 The committee considered the effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with placebo in the subgroup of patients from PEGASUS-TIMI 54 who had a myocardial infarction between 1 and 2 years ago. The committee noted that ticagrelor reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes by 23% compared with placebo. The committee concluded that treatment with ticagrelor is clinically effective for people with a history of myocardial infarction and a high risk
