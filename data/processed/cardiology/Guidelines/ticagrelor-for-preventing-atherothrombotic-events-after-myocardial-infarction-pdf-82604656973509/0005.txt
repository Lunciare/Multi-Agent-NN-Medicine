It was aware of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes, as well as the NICE guidelines on myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation: acute management and unstable angina and NSTEMI: early management.
