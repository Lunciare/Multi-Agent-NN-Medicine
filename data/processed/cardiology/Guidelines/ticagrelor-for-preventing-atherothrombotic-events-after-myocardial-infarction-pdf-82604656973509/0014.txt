Ticagrelor for preventing atherothrombotic events after myocardial infarction

It considered the company's deterministic base-case estimate of £20,636, which incorporated some minor amendments suggested by the ERG. It also considered the ERG's exploratory preferred base case of £24,711, which incorporated small changes to parameters including the cost and disutility associated with gout, adjusted health care costs, uncertainty around NHS reference costs and disutility for major bleeds. The committee was further reassured that when the ERG conducted scenario analysis, only one scenario resulted in an ICER above £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. This scenario was considered to be implausible because it held treatment efficacy constant while assuming that all patients who did not die or have a non-fatal event incurred 3-year treatment costs, whereas the actual time on treatment for patients in the study who did not die or have a non-fatal event was less than 3 years. The committee concluded that all the estimates were within a range considered to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained) and that it could recommend treatment with ticagrelor in line with its marketing authorisation.
