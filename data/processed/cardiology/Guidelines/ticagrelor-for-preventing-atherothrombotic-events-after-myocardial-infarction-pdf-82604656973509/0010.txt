The committee understood from the clinical experts that clopidogrel plus aspirin was commonly used as an initial antiplatelet agent for up to 12 months after a myocardial infarction. However it is not used in clinical practice when continued treatment is needed for patients with a history of myocardial infarction and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event, that is, at the same point in the treatment pathway where the summary of product characteristics recommends ticagrelor (see section 4.3). The committee concluded that clopidogrel plus aspirin was not an appropriate comparator and that the most appropriate comparison for its decision-making was ticagrelor compared with aspirin alone. Clinical effectiveness PEGASUS-TIMI 54 4.6 The company presented clinical effectiveness results for the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial whole population who had ticagrelor compared with placebo (ticagrelor n=7,045, placebo n=7,067). The marketing authorisation for ticagrelor as an extended therapy was based on prespecified subgroup analyses. The committee noted that the company presented a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients who had a myocardial infarction 1 to 2 years previously (ticagrelor n=4,331,
