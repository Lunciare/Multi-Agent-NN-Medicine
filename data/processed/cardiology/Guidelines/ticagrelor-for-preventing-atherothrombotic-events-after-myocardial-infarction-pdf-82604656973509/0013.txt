Ticagrelor for preventing atherothrombotic events after myocardial infarction

after myocardial infarction. It noted that the company's economic model was based on data for secondary efficacy outcomes in PEGASUS-TIMI 54, including first and subsequent events, hospitalisations, dyspnoea, bleeds, EQ-5D responses and treatment discontinuations. The committee considered whether PEGASUS-TIMI 54 was underpowered to analyse these data. It was persuaded by the clinical and health economic experts that using these outcomes was acceptable because the population was large, so the numbers of patients on whom the secondary outcomes were based were likely to generate reasonable estimates. In addition, the committee understood that the model used equations to calculate the risk of an event occurring and that the company had used the intention-to-treat population for calculating these. The ERG confirmed the company's view that the risk equations were likely to be conservative and would, therefore, be unfavourable to ticagrelor. The committee concluded that the company's incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were likely to be overestimates because the parameters used to derive them were for the intention-to-treat population and therefore likely to underestimate the effect of ticagrelor. 4.10 The committee considered the most plausible ICER on which to base its decision. It considered the company's deterministic base-case estimate of £20,636, which incorporated some minor
