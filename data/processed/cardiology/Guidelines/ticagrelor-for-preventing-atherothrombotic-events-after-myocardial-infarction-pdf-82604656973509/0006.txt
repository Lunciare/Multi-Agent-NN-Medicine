risk factor for subsequent atherothrombotic events, listed in the summary of product characteristics as age 65 or over, diabetes mellitus needing medication, a second prior myocardial infarction, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or chronic non-end-stage renal dysfunction. In the trial, treatment with a previous adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor could have been stopped any time before randomisation to the treatment arms. The committee was also aware that 84% of patients in each treatment arm received clopidogrel plus aspirin as their previous antiplatelet therapy and, therefore, had switched from clopidogrel (as their first- line therapy) to ticagrelor. The committee heard from clinical experts that switching between treatments occurs in clinical practice and is not as much of a concern as having a gap between treatments. The clinical experts clarified that when there is a gap in therapy, the risk of an atherothrombotic event increases, particularly in people at high risk. Therefore any gap in therapy should be minimised whenever possible. The committee considered whether ticagrelor would only be used as continuation therapy, but noted from consultation comments that this would not always be possible if, for example, a person had stopped their first-line therapy because of an adverse reaction within 1
