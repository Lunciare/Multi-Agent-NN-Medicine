The committee concluded that treatment with ticagrelor is clinically effective for people with a history of myocardial infarction and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. 4.8 The committee heard contrasting views from the clinical and patient experts on the length of treatment with ticagrelor. Based on the progressive disease process that causes an atherothrombotic event, continued therapy may be justified. However, the committee was persuaded that the risk of bleeding was substantial and that prescribing should be informed by the evidence. The committee understood that the mean length of treatment in PEGASUS-TIMI 54 was 25.3 months, and that the ticagrelor marketing authorisation states that there are limited data on its efficacy and safety beyond 3 years of treatment with ticagrelor. The committee concluded that it could only consider a maximum duration of treatment of up to 3 years, in line with the evidence presented for ticagrelor.
