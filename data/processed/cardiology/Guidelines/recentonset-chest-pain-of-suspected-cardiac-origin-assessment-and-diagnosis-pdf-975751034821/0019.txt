Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis

with symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, tingling or difficulty swallowing. Consider causes of chest pain other than angina (such as gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal pain). [2010] 1.3.3.6 Consider investigating other causes of angina, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in people with typical angina-like chest pain and a low likelihood of CAD. [2010, amended 2016] 1.3.3.7 Arrange blood tests to identify conditions which exacerbate angina, such as anaemia, for all people being investigated for stable angina. [2010] 1.3.3.8 Only consider chest X-ray if other diagnoses, such as a lung tumour, are suspected. [2010] 1.3.3.9 If a diagnosis of stable angina has been excluded at any point in the care pathway, but people have risk factors for cardiovascular disease, follow the appropriate guidance, for example, the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease and the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults. [2010] 1.3.3.10 For people in whom stable angina cannot be excluded on the basis of the clinical assessment alone, take a resting 12-lead ECG as soon as possible after presentation. [2010, amended 2016] 1.3.3.11 Do not rule out a diagnosis of stable angina on the basis of a normal resting 12-lead ECG. [2010] 1.3.3.12 Do not offer diagnostic testing to people with non-anginal chest pain
