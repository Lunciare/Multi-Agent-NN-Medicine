anginal chest pain and non-anginal chest pain differently in men and women. [2010] 1.3.3.3 Do not define typical and atypical features of anginal chest pain and non-anginal chest pain differently in ethnic groups. [2010] 1.3.3.4 Take the following factors, which make a diagnosis of stable angina more likely, into account when estimating people's likelihood of angina: • age • whether the person is male • cardiovascular risk factors including: － a history of smoking － diabetes － hypertension － dyslipidaemia － family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) • other cardiovascular disease • history of established CAD, for example, previous MI, coronary revascularisation. [2010] 1.3.3.5 Unless clinical suspicion is raised based on other aspects of the history and risk factors, exclude a diagnosis of stable angina if the pain is non-anginal (see recommendation 1.3.3.1). Features which make a diagnosis of stable angina unlikely are when the chest pain is: • continuous or very prolonged and/or • unrelated to activity and/or • brought on by breathing in and/or • associated with symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, tingling or difficulty swallowing. Consider causes of chest pain other than angina (such as gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal pain). [2010] 1.3.3.6 Consider investigating other causes
