Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis

before arrival at hospital, send a written record that it has been given with the person. Only offer other antiplatelet agents in hospital. Follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2010] 1.2.3.3 Do not routinely administer oxygen, but monitor oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry as soon as possible, ideally before hospital admission. Only offer supplemental oxygen to: • people with oxygen saturation (SpO ) of less than 94% who are not at risk of 2 hypercapnic respiratory failure, aiming for SpO of 94% to 98% 2 • people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, to achieve a target SpO of 88% to 92% until 2 blood gas analysis is available. [2010] Be aware that some pulse oximeters can underestimate or overestimate oxygen saturation levels, especially if the saturation level is borderline. Overestimation has been reported in people with dark skin. See also the NHS England Patient Safety Alert on the risk of harm from inappropriate placement of pulse oximeter probes. 1.2.3.4 Monitor people with acute chest pain, using clinical judgement to decide how often this should be done, until a firm diagnosis is made. This should include: • exacerbations of pain and/or
