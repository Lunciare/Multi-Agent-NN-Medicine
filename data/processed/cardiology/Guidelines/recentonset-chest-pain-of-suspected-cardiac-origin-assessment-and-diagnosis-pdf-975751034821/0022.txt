Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis

recommendation 1.3.3.1) indicates typical or atypical angina or • clinical assessment indicates non-anginal chest pain but 12-lead resting ECG has been done and indicates ST-T changes or Q waves. [2016] 1.3.4.4 For people with confirmed CAD (for example, previous MI, revascularisation, previous angiography), offer non-invasive functional testing when there is uncertainty about whether chest pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia. See the section on use of non-invasive functional testing for myocardial ischaemia for further guidance on non-invasive functional testing. An exercise ECG may be used instead of functional imaging. [2010] See also NICE's medical technologies guidance on HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography. Using HeartFlow FFR may avoid the need for invasive coronary angiography and CT revascularisation for some patients 1.3.5 Additional diagnostic investigations 1.3.5.1 Offer non-invasive functional imaging (see the section on use of non-invasive functional testing for myocardial ischaemia) for myocardial ischaemia if 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography has shown CAD of uncertain functional significance or is non-diagnostic. [2016] 1.3.5.2 Offer invasive coronary angiography as a third-line investigation when the results of non-invasive functional imaging are inconclusive.
