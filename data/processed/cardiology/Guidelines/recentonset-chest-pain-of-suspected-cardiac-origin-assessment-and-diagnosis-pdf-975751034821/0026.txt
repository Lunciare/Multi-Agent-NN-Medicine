Is multislice CT coronary angiography a cost-effective first-line test for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in people with suspected troponin-negative acute coronary syndromes? Why this is important Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines state that in troponin-negative ACS with no ST-segment change on the ECG, 'a stress test is recommended… in patients with significant ischaemia during the stress test, coronary angiography and subsequent revascularisation should be considered'. Yet stress testing has relatively low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing CAD in this group of people. Therefore a significant proportion of at-risk people are missed while others with normal coronary arteries are subjected to an unnecessary invasive coronary angiogram. Multislice CT coronary angiography is highly sensitive and provides a potentially useful means for early rule-out of CAD in troponin- negative acute coronary disease. We need to know whether it is cost effective compared with exercise ECG as a first test in the diagnostic work-up of this group. 2 Refining the use of telephone advice in people with chest pain In what circumstances should telephone advice be given to people calling with chest pain? Is the appropriateness influenced by age, sex or symptoms? Why this is important The telephone is a
