Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis

MR coronary angiography for diagnosing stable angina. [2010] 1.3.6.5 Do not use exercise ECG to diagnose or exclude stable angina for people without known CAD. [2010] 1.3.7 Making a diagnosis following investigations Box 1 Definition of significant coronary artery disease Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) found during CT coronary angiography is ≥ 70% diameter stenosis of at least one major epicardial artery segment or ≥ 50% diameter stenosis in the left main coronary artery: Factors intensifying ischaemia Such factors allow less severe lesions (for example, ≥ 50%) to produce angina: • reduced oxygen delivery: anaemia, coronary spasm • increased oxygen demand: tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy • large mass of ischaemic myocardium: proximally located lesions • longer lesion length. Factors reducing ischaemia which may render severe lesions (≥ 70%) asymptomatic: • Well-developed collateral supply. • Small mass of ischaemic myocardium: distally located lesions, old infarction in the territory of coronary supply. [2016] 1.3.7.1 Confirm a diagnosis of stable angina and follow the NICE guideline on stable angina when: • significant CAD (see box 1) is found during invasive or 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography or • reversible myocardial ischaemia is found during non-invasive functional imaging. [2016] 1.3.7.2 Investigate other causes
