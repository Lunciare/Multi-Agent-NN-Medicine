(see box 1) is found during invasive or 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography or • reversible myocardial ischaemia is found during non-invasive functional imaging. [2016] 1.3.7.2 Investigate other causes of chest pain when: • significant CAD (see box 1) is not found during invasive coronary angiography or 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography or • reversible myocardial ischaemia is not found during non-invasive functional imaging. [2016] 1.3.7.3 Consider investigating other causes of angina, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or syndrome X, in people with typical angina-like chest pain if investigation excludes flow-limiting disease in the epicardial coronary arteries. [2010] Terms used in this guideline Chest pain The term 'chest pain' is used throughout the guideline to mean chest pain or discomfort. Recommendations for research In 2010, the guideline committee made the following recommendations for research. The committee's full set of recommendations for research is detailed in the full guideline. 1 Cost-effectiveness of multislice CT coronary angiography for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease in people with troponin-negative acute coronary syndromes Is multislice CT coronary angiography a cost-effective first-line test for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in people with suspected troponin-negative acute coronary syndromes? Why this is important Current
