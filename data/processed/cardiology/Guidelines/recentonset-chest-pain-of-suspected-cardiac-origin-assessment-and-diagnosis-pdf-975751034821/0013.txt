test is below the lower limit of detection (negative). [2016] 1.2.5.4 Ensure that patients understand that a detectable troponin on the first high- sensitivity test does not necessarily indicate that they have had an MI. [2016] 1.2.5.5 Do not use biochemical markers such as natriuretic peptides and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to diagnose an ACS. [2010] 1.2.5.6 Do not use biochemical markers of myocardial ischaemia (such as ischaemia- modified albumin) as opposed to markers of necrosis when assessing people with acute chest pain. [2010] 1.2.5.7 When interpreting high-sensitivity troponin measurements, take into account: • the clinical presentation • the time from onset of symptoms • the resting 12-lead ECG findings • the pre-test probability of NSTEMI • the length of time since the suspected ACS • the probability of chronically elevated troponin levels in some people • that 99th percentile thresholds for troponin I and T may differ between sexes. [2010, amended 2016] 1.2.6 Making a diagnosis 1.2.6.1 When diagnosing MI, use the universal definition of myocardial infarction. This is the detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least
