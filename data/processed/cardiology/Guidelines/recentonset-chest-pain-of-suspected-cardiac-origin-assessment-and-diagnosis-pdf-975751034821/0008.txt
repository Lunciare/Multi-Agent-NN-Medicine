1.2.3.4). [2010] 1.2.2.3 Follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes for people with a resting 12-lead ECG showing regional ST-segment depression or deep T wave inversion suggestive of a NSTEMI or unstable angina until a firm diagnosis is made. Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010] 1.2.2.4 Even in the absence of ST-segment changes, have an increased suspicion of an ACS if there are other changes in the resting 12-lead ECG, specifically Q waves and T wave changes. Consider following the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes if these conditions are likely. Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010] 1.2.2.5 Do not exclude an ACS when people have a normal resting 12-lead ECG. [2010] 1.2.2.6 If a diagnosis of ACS is in doubt, consider: • taking serial resting 12-lead ECGs • reviewing previous resting 12-lead ECGs • recording additional ECG leads. Use clinical judgement to decide how often this should be done. Note that the results may not be conclusive. [2010] 1.2.2.7 Obtain a review of resting 12-lead ECGs by a healthcare professional qualified to interpret them as well as taking into account automated interpretation. [2010] 1.2.2.8 If clinical assessment (as described in recommendation 1.2.1.10) and a resting 12-lead
