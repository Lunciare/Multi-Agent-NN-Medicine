Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis

not rule out a diagnosis of stable angina on the basis of a normal resting 12-lead ECG. [2010] 1.3.3.12 Do not offer diagnostic testing to people with non-anginal chest pain on clinical assessment (see recommendation 1.3.3.1) unless there are resting ECG ST-T changes or Q waves. [2016] 1.3.3.13 A number of changes on a resting 12-lead ECG are consistent with CAD and may indicate ischaemia or previous infarction. These include: • pathological Q waves in particular • LBBB • ST-segment and T wave abnormalities (for example, flattening or inversion). Note that the results may not be conclusive. Consider any resting 12-lead ECG changes together with people's clinical history and risk factors. [2010] 1.3.3.14 For people with confirmed CAD (for example, previous MI, revascularisation, previous angiography) in whom stable angina cannot be excluded based on clinical assessment alone, see recommendation 1.3.4.4 about functional testing. [2010, amended 2016] 1.3.3.15 Consider aspirin only if the person's chest pain is likely to be stable angina, until a diagnosis is made. Do not offer additional aspirin if there is clear evidence that people are already taking aspirin regularly or are allergic to it. [2010] 1.3.3.16 Follow the NICE guideline on stable angina while waiting for
