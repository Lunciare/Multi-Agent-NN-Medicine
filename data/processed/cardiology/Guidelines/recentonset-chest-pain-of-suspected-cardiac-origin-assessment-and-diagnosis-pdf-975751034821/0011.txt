people with acute chest pain, using clinical judgement to decide how often this should be done, until a firm diagnosis is made. This should include: • exacerbations of pain and/or other symptoms • pulse and blood pressure • heart rhythm • oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry • repeated resting 12-lead ECGs and • checking pain relief is effective. [2010] 1.2.3.5 Manage other therapeutic interventions using the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2010] 1.2.4 Assessment in hospital for people with a suspected acute coronary syndrome 1.2.4.1 Take a resting 12-lead ECG and a blood sample for high-sensitivity troponin I or T measurement (see the section on use of biochemical markers for diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome) on arrival in hospital. [2010, amended 2016] 1.2.4.2 Carry out a physical examination to determine: • haemodynamic status • signs of complications, for example, pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock and • signs of non-coronary causes of acute chest pain, such as aortic dissection. [2010] 1.2.4.3 Take a detailed clinical history unless a STEMI is confirmed from the resting 12-lead ECG (that is, regional ST-segment elevation or presumed new LBBB). Record: • the characteristics of the pain • other associated symptoms • any history of
