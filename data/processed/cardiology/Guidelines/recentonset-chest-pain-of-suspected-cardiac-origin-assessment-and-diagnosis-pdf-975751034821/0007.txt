[2010] 1.2.1.12 When an ACS is suspected, start management immediately in the order appropriate to the circumstances (see the section on immediate management of a suspected acute coronary syndrome) and take a resting 12-lead ECG (see the section on resting 12-lead ECG). Take the ECG as soon as possible, but do not delay transfer to hospital. [2010] 1.2.1.13 If an ACS is not suspected, consider other causes of the chest pain, some of which may be life-threatening (see recommendations 1.2.6.5, 1.2.6.7 and 1.2.6.8). [2010] 1.2.2 Resting 12-lead ECG 1.2.2.1 Take a resting 12-lead ECG as soon as possible. When people are referred, send the results to hospital before they arrive if possible. Recording and sending the ECG should not delay transfer to hospital. [2010] 1.2.2.2 Follow local protocols for people with a resting 12-lead ECG showing regional ST-segment elevation or presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) consistent with an acute STEMI until a firm diagnosis is made. Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010] 1.2.2.3 Follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes for people with a resting 12-lead ECG showing regional ST-segment depression or deep T wave inversion suggestive of a
