confirmed from the resting 12-lead ECG (that is, regional ST-segment elevation or presumed new LBBB). Record: • the characteristics of the pain • other associated symptoms • any history of cardiovascular disease • any cardiovascular risk factors and • details of previous investigations or treatments for similar symptoms of chest pain. [2010] 1.2.5 Use of biochemical markers for diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome 1.2.5.1 Do not use high-sensitivity troponin tests for people in whom ACS is not suspected. [2016] 1.2.5.2 For people at high or moderate risk of MI (as indicated by a validated tool), perform high-sensitivity troponin tests as recommended in the NICE diagnostics guidance on myocardial infarction. [2016] 1.2.5.3 For people at low risk of MI (as indicated by a validated tool): • perform a second high-sensitivity troponin test as recommended in the NICE diagnostics guidance on myocardial infarction if the first troponin test at presentation is positive. • consider performing a single high-sensitivity troponin test only at presentation to rule out NSTEMI if the first troponin test is below the lower limit of detection (negative). [2016] 1.2.5.4 Ensure that patients understand that a detectable troponin on the first high- sensitivity test does not necessarily indicate that
