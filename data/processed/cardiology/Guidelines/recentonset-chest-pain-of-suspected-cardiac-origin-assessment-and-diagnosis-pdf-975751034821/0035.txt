Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis
KEYWORDS: pain, chest, chest pain, people, coronary, guideline, angina, diagnosis, ecg, acute, assessment, stable, nice, lead, resting

whether myocardial ischaemia is the cause of the chest pain and how to manage the chest pain while people are being assessed and investigated. As far as possible, the recommendations in this guideline have been listed in the order in which they will be carried out and follow the diagnostic pathways. But, as there are many permutations at each decision point, it has been necessary to include frequent cross- referencing to avoid repeating recommendations several times. The algorithms presented in full guideline show the two diagnostic pathways. This guideline does not cover the diagnosis and management of chest pain that is unrelated to the heart (for example, traumatic chest wall injury, herpes zoster infection) when myocardial ischaemia has been excluded. The guideline also recognises that in people with a prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease, chest pain or discomfort is not necessarily cardiac. The term 'chest pain' is used throughout the guideline to mean chest pain or discomfort. The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients.
