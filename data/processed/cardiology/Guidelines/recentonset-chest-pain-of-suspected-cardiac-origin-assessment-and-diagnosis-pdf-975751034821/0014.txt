detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following: • symptoms of ischaemia • new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new LBBB • development of pathological Q waves in the ECG • imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality • identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography. [2010, amended 2016] 1.2.6.2 When a raised troponin level is detected in people with a suspected ACS, reassess to exclude other causes for raised troponin (for example, myocarditis, aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism) before confirming the diagnosis of ACS. [2010] 1.2.6.3 When a raised troponin level is detected in people with a suspected ACS, follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes until a firm diagnosis is made. Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010] 1.2.6.4 When a diagnosis of ACS is confirmed, follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2010] 1.2.6.5 Reassess people with chest pain without raised troponin levels and no acute resting 12-lead ECG changes to determine whether their chest pain is likely
