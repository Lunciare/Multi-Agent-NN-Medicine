the committee made the recommendations A single study from the US suggested that regular monitoring for people with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis reduced all-cause mortality and hospital admission for heart failure. However, the study had limitations, including lack of applicability to UK clinical practice. The committee discussed that although frequency of monitoring currently varies in the UK, it is usually every 6 to 12 months. Some adults find 6-monthly monitoring reassuring. For others this leads to anxiety and they would prefer less frequent monitoring (for example, every 12 months). The committee agreed that the exact frequency of monitoring within the 6-month to 12-month timeframe should be determined by echocardiography results and shared decision making with the patient. Monitoring less often than every 12 months would be likely to lead to negative outcomes for the patient because valve changes in this group occur over months rather than years. However, monitoring less often than every 12 months may be suitable for a minority of patients who have demonstrated stability over several years. The recommendation covers all types of asymptomatic severe valve disease. In line with current practice, echocardiographic assessment every 3 to 5 years should be considered for adults with mild aortic
