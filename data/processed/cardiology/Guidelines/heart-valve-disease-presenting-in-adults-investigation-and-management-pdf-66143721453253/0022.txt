Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

of their age or because they have life-limiting comorbidities. Suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair Suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair depends on: • the morphology of the person's valve • the feasibility of using transoesophageal echocardiography to guide the procedure • the person's fitness for general anaesthesia. Recommendations for research The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. Key recommendations for research 1 Monitoring when there is no current need for intervention What is the most clinically and cost-effective monitoring (type and frequency of test) for adults with asymptomatic mild or moderate heart valve disease (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation) and no current need for intervention? For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on monitoring where there is no current need for intervention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: monitoring of people with heart valve disease and no current indication for intervention. 2 Interventions for tricuspid regurgitation What is the most clinically and cost-effective management strategy for adults with tricuspid regurgitation? For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see
