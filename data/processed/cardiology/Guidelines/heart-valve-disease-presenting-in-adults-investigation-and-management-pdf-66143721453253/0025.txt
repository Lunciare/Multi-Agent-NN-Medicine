Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

aortic regurgitation? 7 Indications for interventions – CT or MRI In adults with aortic or primary mitral regurgitation in whom the need for intervention is unclear after echocardiography, what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of cardiac MRI to assess the severity of valvular regurgitation? In adults with aortic or mitral regurgitation in whom the need for intervention is unclear after echocardiography, what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured on cardiac MRI to assess the need for intervention? In adults with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of LVEF measured on cardiac MRI to assess the need for intervention? In adults with asymptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of cardiac MRI for assessment of the right ventricle to assess the need for intervention? 8 Indications for interventions – global longitudinal strain In adults with severe heart valve disease what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of global longitudinal strain to assess the need for intervention? In adults with asymptomatic, severe aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
