Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

often. When surgery is not an option, transcatheter intervention is used as the only alternative to medical management. The recommendation will therefore not represent a change in practice. Return to recommendation Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy Recommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.3 Why the committee made the recommendations Anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment after surgical biological valve replacement Evidence from a population without atrial fibrillation demonstrated an increased risk of major bleeding with vitamin K antagonist compared with single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin). No clear reduction in mortality or thromboembolic events was observed with vitamin K antagonist. Therefore, the committee agreed that anticoagulation should not be offered after surgical biological valve replacement unless there are other indications for anticoagulation. This covers both vitamin K antagonists and direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) because there was no evidence to show that DOACs are safe. One small study in people with atrial fibrillation suggested there may be no clear differences in outcomes between DOACs and vitamin K antagonists, and it is not common practice to use DOACs for this group. The committee agreed that if there is already an indication for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, for example, because of atrial fibrillation, the existing NICE guidelines for these indications should
