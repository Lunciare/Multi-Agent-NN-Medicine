Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

for intervention for people with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation. The committee agreed to make a recommendation for research to inform future practice. Stress testing and stress echocardiography No evidence was identified for stress testing and stress echocardiography in adults with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation. The committee agreed that further research could answer questions about when to intervene in this population. Therefore, they made a recommendation for research to identify prognostic factors in this population on stress testing. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation is in line with current practice. Return to recommendation Indications for intervention for adults with mitral regurgitation Recommendation 1.3.7 Why the committee made the recommendation Echocardiography Evidence showed that an LVEF less than 60% was a risk factor for increased cardiac mortality after intervention for asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation. An ESDI greater than 22 mm/m2 was associated with onset of symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction, or death without intervention. This is broadly equivalent to the non-indexed ESD threshold of 45 mm used in current practice. The committee agreed that either of these indicators of early myocardial decompensation should prompt consideration of an intervention for people with asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation. Recommendations were limited to considering an
