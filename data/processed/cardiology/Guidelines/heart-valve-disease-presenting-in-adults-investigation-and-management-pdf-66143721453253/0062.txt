compared with medical management in those with severe mitral regurgitation when surgery was not suitable. This study had limitations because it included people with secondary mitral regurgitation and used data from a prospective, single-arm registry with a control group obtained retrospectively. A second Japanese study on a mixed population with secondary and primary mitral regurgitation found transcatheter repair with the MitraClip device to be cost effective. This study had some limitations too as the relative treatment effects were informed from a propensity score matching study rather than an RCT. A health economic model developed as part of this guideline did not find MitraClip to be cost effective for adults with secondary mitral regurgitation. However, the committee agreed that it was plausible that MitraClip would offer more benefits for people with primary mitral regurgitation because they are likely to have less residual disease affecting quality of life after the intervention. The committee agreed to recommend that transcatheter mitral valve repair should be considered for primary severe mitral regurgitation with symptoms when surgery is unsuitable. Transcatheter mitral valve repair in secondary mitral regurgitation when surgery is unsuitable Evidence was included from 3 RCTs comparing transcatheter mitral valve repair with medical management for
