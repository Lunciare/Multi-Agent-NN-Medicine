or severe mitral regurgitation? 10 Monitoring when there is no current need for intervention What is the most clinically and cost-effective monitoring strategy (type and frequency of test) for adults with asymptomatic severe heart valve disease (aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation) and no current indication for intervention? What is the most clinically and cost-effective monitoring strategy (type and frequency of test) for adults with symptomatic moderate heart valve disease (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation) and no current indication for intervention? 11 Interventions What is the most clinically and cost-effective management strategy for adults with calcific mitral stenosis and an indication for intervention? 12 Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of single or dual antiplatelet therapies or anticoagulants compared with placebo after transcatheter or surgical valve replacement (implantation) with biological prosthesis and after valve repair? In adults with biological valve replacement, what effect does anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy have on long-term valve function and outcomes? 13 Repeat interventions What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of transcatheter intervention compared with surgical redo intervention for adults with failing biological prosthetic aortic valves when either procedure is suitable?
