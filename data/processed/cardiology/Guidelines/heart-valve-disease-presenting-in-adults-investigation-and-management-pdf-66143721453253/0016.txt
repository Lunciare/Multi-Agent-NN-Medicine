Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

conservative management in heart valve disease. Tricuspid regurgitation 1.5.15 Consider surgical tricuspid valve repair at the time of mitral valve surgery when tricuspid regurgitation is moderate or severe. 1.5.16 Consider surgical tricuspid valve repair at the time of aortic valve surgery when tricuspid regurgitation is severe. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on interventions for tricuspid regurgitation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: transcatheter intervention, surgery or conservative management in heart valve disease. 1.6 Repeat intervention 1.6.1 Consider transcatheter or redo surgical intervention for adults with severe aortic degeneration of a biological prosthetic valve and symptoms. Take into account the following factors to inform a shared decision about the choice of intervention: • the short- and long-term benefits • type of valve dysfunction and prosthesis • the risks associated with the procedure • the possible need for other cardiac procedures in the future.
