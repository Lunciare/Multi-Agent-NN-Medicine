Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

this procedure would be suitable. No evidence was identified for mitral valve replacement in those with rheumatic mitral stenosis when transcatheter valvotomy is not suitable. The committee agreed this it was important to make a recommendation for these people. Although no evidence was included, the condition would likely deteriorate without an intervention. It was not appropriate to extrapolate evidence from rheumatic mitral stenosis to calcific mitral stenosis because they are 2 very different pathologies. Because there was no evidence included for calcific mitral stenosis, the committee made a recommendation for research to inform future practice. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are in line with current practice. Return to the recommendations Interventions for mitral regurgitation Recommendations 1.5.8 to 1.5.14 Why the committee made the recommendations Repair or replacement when surgery is suitable Evidence from 3 RCTs demonstrated few differences between surgical repair and surgical replacement in those with severe mitral regurgitation. (One study included both primary and secondary mitral regurgitation; the other 2 studies covered secondary mitral regurgitation only). The largest effect was for the need for reintervention for secondary mitral regurgitation, with fewer repeat interventions needed in the replacement group. Overall, the included evidence was limited; all
