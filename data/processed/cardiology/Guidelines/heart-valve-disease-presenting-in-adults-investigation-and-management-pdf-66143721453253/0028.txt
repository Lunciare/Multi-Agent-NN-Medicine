Repeat interventions What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of transcatheter intervention compared with surgical redo intervention for adults with failing biological prosthetic aortic valves when either procedure is suitable? What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of transcatheter intervention compared with surgical redo intervention for adults with failing biological prosthetic mitral valves when either procedure is suitable? Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Referral for echocardiography Recommendations 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 Why the committee made the recommendations Murmur alone Limited evidence showed that murmur is an indicator of valve disease. But the evidence also showed that a substantial proportion of people with a murmur do not have valve disease confirmed by a reference test. The committee agreed that 'innocent' murmurs can occur, particularly during the teenage and young adult years and in pregnancy. These are difficult to differentiate from pathological murmurs by clinical examination alone. The evidence was not strong enough to recommend that everyone with a murmur should be referred for echocardiography. The committee agreed that this would be a change in practice, would increase pressure on echocardiography services and would offer uncertain benefit. However, when
