should be based on patient characteristics and preferences. A lack of expertise in minimally invasive surgery locally should not be used as a reason for not performing a minimally invasive procedure. Adults should be referred to a centre where this expertise is available if the procedure is agreed as most suitable. The evidence to support this recommendation is reported under the different types of valve disease. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are expected to have a very small impact on current practice. Minimally invasive surgery will not be suitable for many patients. Those for whom it is suitable may still decide to have standard surgery after considering the possible benefits and risks of both options. Return to recommendations Interventions for aortic valve disease Recommendations 1.5.3 to 1.5.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Aortic stenosis when surgery is suitable Evidence from 8 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed no large or clear differences for most outcomes between transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgery for adults with non-bicuspid aortic stenosis, including mortality outcomes and quality of life. However, a benefit of TAVI was identified for major bleeding and atrial fibrillation at 30 days, and length of hospital stay
