Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

1.3.4 Consider measuring aortic valve calcium score on cardiac CT if the severity of symptomatic aortic stenosis is uncertain. 1.3.5 Offer enhanced follow up (for example, more frequent reviews) and further assessment (for example, stress echocardiography) to monitor the need for intervention if mid-wall fibrosis is detected on cardiac MRI in adults with severe aortic stenosis. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on indications for interventions for adults with aortic stenosis. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in: • evidence review D: indications for intervention • evidence review E: stress testing and stress echocardiography in determining need for intervention • evidence review F: CT and MRI indications for intervention. Aortic regurgitation 1.3.6 Consider referring adults with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation for intervention, if suitable, if they have either of the following: • LVEF less than 55% or • end systolic diameter (ESD) of more than 50 mm or end systolic diameter index (ESDI) more than 24 mm/m2 on echocardiography.
