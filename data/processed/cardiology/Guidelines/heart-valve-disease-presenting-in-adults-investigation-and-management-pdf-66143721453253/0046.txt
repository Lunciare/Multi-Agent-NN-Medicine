committee agreed that either of these indicators of early myocardial decompensation should prompt consideration of an intervention for people with asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation. Recommendations were limited to considering an intervention because the evidence was low to very low quality. The evidence on valve morphology, atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension was not robust enough to include these as independent indicators for referral for intervention. However, the evidence suggested that these were associated with increased mortality, so the committee agreed their presence should be considered when discussing the possibility of intervention. There was not enough evidence to include BNP level as an indicator for referral for intervention for people with asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation. The committee agreed to make a recommendation for research to inform future practice. Stress testing and stress echocardiography Evidence from 2 studies showed that an increase of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) to more than 60 mmHg on exercise was associated with worse outcomes in people with mitral regurgitation (asymptomatic or asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic, moderate or severe). This agreed with the committee's experience. Although there is limited evidence that in severe mitral regurgitation, intervening before symptoms develop results in better outcomes, the committee agreed that this may be
