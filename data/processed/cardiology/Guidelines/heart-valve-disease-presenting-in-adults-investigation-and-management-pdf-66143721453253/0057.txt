in practice. There may be no increase in the short term, as more training in these procedures will be needed, but only in the long term when more centres will have the expertise and capacity of offering minimally invasive surgery. Return to recommendations Interventions for mitral stenosis Recommendations 1.5.6 and 1.5.7 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence from 7 RCTs comparing transcatheter valvotomy with surgical valvotomy (either by minimally invasive or standard surgery) in people with rheumatic severe mitral stenosis demonstrated very few differences in outcomes. The committee agreed that surgical valvotomy is no longer commonly used in practice because similar results can be achieved with the transcatheter procedure, with less trauma and scarring and at a lower cost to the NHS. The evidence was limited by small studies, often with only a small number of events, and most outcomes being graded as very low quality. The committee agreed that transcatheter valvotomy could be considered for adults with rheumatic severe mitral stenosis who need an intervention and for whom this procedure would be suitable. No evidence was identified for mitral valve replacement in those with rheumatic mitral stenosis when transcatheter valvotomy is not suitable. The committee agreed this it
