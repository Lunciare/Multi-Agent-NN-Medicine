interventions for adults with aortic stenosis Recommendations 1.3.2 to 1.3.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Echocardiography A peak aortic jet velocity more than 5 m/s was a risk factor for increased mortality (all-cause and cardiac or cardiovascular) and sudden death in people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis who had not had a valve intervention. An aortic valve area less than 0.6 cm2 was also associated with increased all-cause mortality, both before and after valve intervention in adults with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. A left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 55% was the best marker of early myocardial decompensation, being linked to increased mortality in adults with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Raised B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), particularly when 2 to 3 times the normal level, was a risk factor for all-cause mortality, before and after valve intervention, for people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and a preserved ejection fraction. The committee agreed that this would also apply to N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), which is more widely used currently in the UK than BNP. Some of these indicators were broadly in line with current practice and the experience of the committee. In addition, the evidence for increased mortality was strong, including
