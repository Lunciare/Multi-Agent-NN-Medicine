Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. They noted that some people may not report symptoms because they have adapted, for example, by reducing their activity. Exercise testing may therefore reveal these symptoms, which is an indication for intervention. There was evidence from 2 studies, but with limitations, that no increase in valve area on dobutamine stress testing was associated with worse outcome in symptomatic low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis. Point estimates and confidence intervals from both studies were consistent with this being a risk factor for poor outcome. Severe aortic stenosis is suggested if a person with low-gradient aortic stenosis has an LVEF less than 50% and a valve area less than 1 cm2 at rest. Based on the evidence and the committee's experience, this can be confirmed on dobutamine stress testing if their valve area stays below 1 cm2 and their mean gradient rises above 40 mmHg. This would therefore be an indication for intervention. Cardiac MRI and cardiac CT The evidence showed that a higher aortic valve calcium score measured by cardiac CT indicates a worse prognosis for people with aortic stenosis. This could be because it is an index of the severity of aortic stenosis or because it
