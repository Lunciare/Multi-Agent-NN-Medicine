KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

NICE interventional procedures guidance on using transapical transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation for a failed surgically implanted mitral valve bioprosthesis, transapical transcatheter mitral valve- in-ring implantation after failed annuloplasty for mitral valve repair and valve- in-valve TAVI for aortic bioprosthetic dysfunction. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see rationale and impact section on repeat intervention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I: repeat intervention for failure of biological or repaired valves. 1.7 Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy 1.7.1 Do not offer anticoagulation after surgical biological valve replacement unless there are other indications for anticoagulation. 1.7.2 Consider aspirin, or clopidogrel if aspirin is not tolerated, after TAVI. 1.7.3 If people have other indications for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, follow the recommendations in the NICE guidelines on atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review J: anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy for biological prosthetic valves and after valve
