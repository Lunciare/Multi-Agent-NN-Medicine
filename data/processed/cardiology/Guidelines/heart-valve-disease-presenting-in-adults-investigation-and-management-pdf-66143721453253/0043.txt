Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

committee agreed that follow up should be enhanced and further assessment should be offered in those with mid-wall fibrosis to check for symptoms and enable earlier aortic valve intervention to improve prognosis. How the recommendations might affect practice These recommendations largely reflect current best practice, although there is local variation and not all healthcare professionals will know that all of these thresholds should lead to referral for intervention. However, the threshold of LVEF less than 55% does represent a change from current practice, because some centres use a threshold of less than 50%. However, for most adults this will mean earlier rather than additional intervention, with subsequent improvement in survival and quality of life. Cardiac MRI is not currently used by all centres to assess aortic stenosis. The recommendation to consider enhanced follow up and further assessment if mid-wall fibrosis is detected by cardiac MRI should not mean a change in practice because it will be implemented only when cardiac MRI data is available.
