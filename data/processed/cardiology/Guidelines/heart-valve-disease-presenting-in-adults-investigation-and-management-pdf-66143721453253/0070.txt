group. The committee agreed that if there is already an indication for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, for example, because of atrial fibrillation, the existing NICE guidelines for these indications should be followed. Despite 1 study demonstrating a potential reduction in arterial thromboembolic events and vascular mortality with combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy compared with anticoagulant therapy alone after surgical biological valve replacement, there was uncertainty around this result. This uncertainty, combined with further study limitations, including issues with the target international normalised ratio used and the selective population, meant that the study could not be used to inform general recommendations for surgical biological valve replacement. There was a lack of evidence comparing anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy with no treatment after surgical biological valve replacement, so the committee made a recommendation for research. They made another recommendation for research to investigate the long-term effect of anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy on valve function and outcomes after biological valve replacement because no long-term data was available. Single antiplatelet therapy after TAVI Evidence from 4 studies demonstrated a clinically important benefit of single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) compared with dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing major and minor bleeding in the short-to-medium term. Based on this,
