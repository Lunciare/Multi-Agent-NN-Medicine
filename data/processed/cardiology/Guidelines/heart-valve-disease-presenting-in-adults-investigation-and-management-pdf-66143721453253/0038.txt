Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

beta-blockers in other types of heart valve disease. Similarly, there was not enough evidence to make recommendations on other drugs for the management of heart failure in heart valve disease. They agreed to make a recommendation for research on the pharmacological management of heart failure in adults with severe aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and mitral regurgitation. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice, so the committee agreed there is unlikely to be a significant resource impact. Return to recommendations Indications for interventions Recommendation 1.3.1 Why the committee made the recommendation Severe symptomatic heart valve disease has a poor prognosis and there is no treatment for the symptoms other than an intervention on the valve. Because of this, the committee recommended that an intervention should be offered to this group. The evidence to support this recommendation is discussed under the different types of valve disease in the section on intervention. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice. Return to the recommendation Indications for interventions for adults with aortic stenosis Recommendations 1.3.2 to 1.3.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Echocardiography A peak aortic jet velocity more than 5 m/s was a risk factor
