The committee made a recommendation for research to inform future guidance. How the recommendations might affect practice These recommendations are in line with current practice. Return to recommendations Repeat intervention Recommendation 1.6.1 Why the committee made the recommendation No evidence was identified comparing surgery with medical management for people with failing biological prosthetic aortic valves. However, the committee agreed that surgery should be considered in this group because their condition may deteriorate if left without intervention on medical management.

For people who can have surgery, there were no RCTs comparing transcatheter intervention with surgery for repeat intervention and the only included studies were non-randomised. The committee were not able to base recommendations on this because of
