enough to support recommending 1 type of surgery over the other. They agreed that median sternotomy and minimally invasive surgery should be options for those with mitral regurgitation requiring mitral valve surgery, with the decision being based on patient characteristics and patient preferences. A lack of expertise in minimally invasive surgery locally should not be used as a reason for not performing a minimally invasive procedure and patients should be referred to a centre where there is expertise if this procedure is agreed as most suitable. Transcatheter mitral valve repair in primary mitral regurgitation when surgery is unsuitable No clinical evidence was identified comparing transcatheter mitral valve repair with medical management for primary mitral regurgitation when surgery is not suitable. The committee noted that the lack of evidence may be because it is well established that medical management does not improve outcomes and transcatheter mitral valve repair is useful when surgery cannot be performed. One health economic study, based on a non-randomised registry, reported that transcatheter repair was cost effective compared with medical management in those with severe mitral regurgitation when surgery was not suitable. This study had limitations because it included people with secondary mitral regurgitation and used data
