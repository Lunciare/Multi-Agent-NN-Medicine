Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

UK than BNP. Some of these indicators were broadly in line with current practice and the experience of the committee. In addition, the evidence for increased mortality was strong, including for BNP. Therefore, the committee agreed that these indicators of poorer prognosis should prompt a discussion about the possible need for referral for intervention in people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Recommendations were limited to considering referral because the evidence was low to very low quality. There was some evidence of increased mortality in people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis and a global longitudinal strain less than 14.7% or 15%, even when ejection fraction was preserved. However, there is some concern about reproducibility of measurements. The committee agreed that further research in this area would help to inform future guidance, so they made a recommendation for research. Stress testing and stress echocardiography Despite limitations in the quality of the evidence, the committee agreed that there was enough to show that symptoms revealed during exercise testing predict a poor outcome in people with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. They noted that some people may not report symptoms because they have adapted, for example, by reducing their activity. Exercise testing may therefore reveal
