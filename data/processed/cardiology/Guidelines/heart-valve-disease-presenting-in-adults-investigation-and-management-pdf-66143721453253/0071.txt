4 studies demonstrated a clinically important benefit of single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) compared with dual antiplatelet therapy in reducing major and minor bleeding in the short-to-medium term. Based on this, the committee agreed that single rather than dual antiplatelet therapy should be considered after TAVI. As aspirin is used in practice, and this was used in all of the studies, aspirin was recommended, with clopidogrel specified as the alternative if aspirin was not tolerated. The committee were also aware of observational evidence that antiplatelets reduced the risk of valve thrombosis and improved valve durability over the long term. There was also evidence from 1 study demonstrating harms of DOACs compared with single antiplatelet therapy for most reported outcomes, including mortality, bleeding and withdrawal because of adverse events. This further supported the recommendation for single antiplatelet therapy. Because of the lack of evidence comparing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with no treatment after TAVI, the committee made a recommendation for research. Valve repair No evidence was identified comparing different anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatments in adults who have had valve repair. The committee made a recommendation for research comparing anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatments with placebo after valve repair. How the recommendations might affect
