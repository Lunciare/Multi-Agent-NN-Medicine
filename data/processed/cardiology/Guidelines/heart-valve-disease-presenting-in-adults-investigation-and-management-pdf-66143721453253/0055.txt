should not be used as a reason for not performing a minimally invasive procedure and adults should be referred to a centre where there is expertise if this procedure is agreed as most suitable. Despite no direct evidence for bicuspid aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (bicuspid or non-bicuspid) and mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis and regurgitation in the same person), the committee agreed that the type of aortic valve disease would not affect decisions about the invasiveness of surgery and the evidence could be extrapolated to any aortic valve disease. How the recommendations might affect practice TAVI for non-bicuspid aortic stenosis when surgery is unsuitable The committee agreed that the use of TAVI is increasing, particularly when surgery is unsuitable and there are no other options for interventional procedures. It would be rare not to perform TAVI in these circumstances, but palliative care with pharmacological management is sometimes agreed. Therefore, the committee considered that the recommendation would represent a minimal change in practice and would not increase the number of TAVI procedures. Surgery for aortic stenosis when this is suitable The committee agreed that TAVI is usually reserved for when surgery is unsuitable or carries high risks of mortality. But
