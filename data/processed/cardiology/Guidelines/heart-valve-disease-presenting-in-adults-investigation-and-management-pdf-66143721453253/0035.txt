acknowledged that an ejection systolic flow murmur is present in most pregnant women and is not a cause for concern. They also noted that there is no official subspecialty or national accreditation for cardiologists with a specialist interest in pregnancy. How the recommendations might affect practice The committee acknowledged that it is not current practice to refer women who are considering pregnancy to a cardiologist with specialist expertise. Although moderate or severe heart valve disease is relatively rare in women of childbearing age, they still represent an important group of patients. Healthcare centres offering specialised support to women considering pregnancy are not widespread, so the committee expect a moderate change in practice in those centres. Return to recommendations Pharmacological management to improve prognosis Why the committee made the recommendations There was no evidence that pharmacological management can slow the progression of heart valve disease, only evidence that statins improve prognosis in aortic stenosis. The evidence showed that statins reduced cardiac mortality compared with placebo for adults with aortic stenosis. The committee agreed that this benefit is because of an improvement in overall cardiovascular health rather than a direct effect on the aortic stenosis. Therefore, no recommendation was made and statins
