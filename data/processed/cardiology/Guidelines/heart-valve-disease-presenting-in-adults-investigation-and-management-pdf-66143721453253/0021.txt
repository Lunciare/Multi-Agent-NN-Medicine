aortic stenosis, the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, and mitral valve disease. Specialist assessment and advice This could include assessment and advice from a cardiologist with expertise in heart valve disease, a multidisciplinary team or a heart valve clinic. Suitability for transcatheter aortic valve implantation Suitability for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) depends on: • an appropriate access for inserting the TAVI catheter • the morphology of the valve, aortic root and ascending aorta • the degree and distribution of calcium in the aortic valve. It is an option for: • All people expected to have an unacceptably high risk of mortality or morbidity as a result of surgery (for example, because of a risk of infection in people who are immunosuppressed). See also the definition of high risk of surgery according to EuroSCORE II. • All people expected to have unacceptably strenuous and prolonged recovery from surgery and an extended need for rehabilitation because of frailty, reduced mobility, or musculoskeletal conditions. • All people with low life expectancy, either because of their age or because they have life-limiting comorbidities. Suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair Suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair depends on: • the morphology of the person's valve • the
