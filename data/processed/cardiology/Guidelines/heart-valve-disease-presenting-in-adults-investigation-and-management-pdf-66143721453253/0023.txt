tricuspid regurgitation What is the most clinically and cost-effective management strategy for adults with tricuspid regurgitation? For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on interventions for tricuspid regurgitation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: transcatheter intervention, surgery or conservative management in heart valve disease. 3 Interventions for a failed valve What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of transcatheter intervention compared with surgical redo intervention for adults with failing biological prosthetic tricuspid valves or failing repaired native tricuspid valves when either procedure is suitable? For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on repeat intervention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I: repeat intervention for failure of biological or repaired valves. 4 Monitoring after an intervention What is the most clinically and cost-effective timing, nature and frequency of follow up for different types of valve interventions, including repair and replacement with tissue or mechanical valves? For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see rationale section on monitoring after an intervention.
