Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

aortic stenosis, including mortality outcomes and quality of life. However, a benefit of TAVI was identified for major bleeding and atrial fibrillation at 30 days, and length of hospital stay after the intervention. Absolute effects for other outcomes also suggested a benefit, but there was more uncertainty based on the confidence intervals. A harm of TAVI was identified for pacemaker implantation at 30 days. Although absolute effects also suggested a possible harm of TAVI in terms of mortality and rehospitalisation, the direction and size of the effect was much more uncertain for these outcomes and no clear difference between the 2 groups could be identified. Only 1 study reported data beyond 5 years, but only for all-cause mortality. The health economic model developed as part of the guideline looked for cost effectiveness over a lifetime. Therefore, it included evidence about the impact of complications in the long term, beyond 5 years, given the longer life expectancy for younger people with lower surgical risk. The results of the health economic model showed that TAVI at current prices was cost effective for people at high risk of surgery but not for people at low or intermediate risk. The committee agreed that if
