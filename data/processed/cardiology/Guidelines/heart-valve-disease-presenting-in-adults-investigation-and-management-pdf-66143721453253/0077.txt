Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management
KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

valve disease can be primary or secondary. Primary disease affects the valve structure, whereas secondary disease results from enlargement or dysfunction of the heart chambers (atria or ventricles) with otherwise normal mitral or tricuspid valve structure. Heart valve disease can be congenital or acquired. Acquired valve degeneration is currently the main cause of heart valve disease, leading to the most common types of heart valve disease, as for example calcific aortic stenosis and myxomatous or calcific degeneration of the mitral valve. Secondary heart valve disease can be classified as: • ventricular-secondary mitral or tricuspid regurgitation • atrial-secondary mitral or tricuspid regurgitation. Among people aged 65 years or over the prevalence of asymptomatic heart valve disease may be more than 50%, whereas the prevalence of clinically significant heart valve disease is around 11%. It is predicted that for people over 65, the prevalence of heart valve disease will increase, from 1.5 million people currently to more than 3 million in 2046. People with heart valve disease may have no symptoms or may have symptoms that can depend on the affected valve. Associated heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation or heart block, may cause palpitations and breathlessness, or dizziness and light-headedness,
