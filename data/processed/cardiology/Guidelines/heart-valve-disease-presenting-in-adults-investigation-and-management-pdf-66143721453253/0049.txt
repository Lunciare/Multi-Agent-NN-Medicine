KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

The recommendation covers all types of asymptomatic severe valve disease. In line with current practice, echocardiographic assessment every 3 to 5 years should be considered for adults with mild aortic or mitral stenosis. This would help to identify people with asymptomatic disease that has become more severe and for whom intervention may be appropriate. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are in line with current practice. Return to recommendations Decisions about interventions Recommendations 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee highlighted the importance of shared decision making when discussing interventions. This is to ensure that treatment options are fully explored, along with their risks and benefits. Specifically, the committee highlighted valve durability, the risks associated with the procedure, and the possible need for other cardiac procedures in the future. The committee agreed that in their clinical experience there was no difference between minimally invasive and standard surgery replacement in terms of outcomes when done by those with expertise in minimally invasive surgery. The decision should be based on patient characteristics and preferences. A lack of expertise in minimally invasive surgery locally should not be used as a reason for not performing a minimally invasive
