TAVI procedures. Surgery for aortic stenosis when this is suitable The committee agreed that TAVI is usually reserved for when surgery is unsuitable or carries high risks of mortality. But data from the UK TAVI registry suggests that in recent years the procedure has been expanded to groups of people with lower surgical risk. The recommendation to offer TAVI to those with high surgical risk should have a moderate impact, as only 1.9% of surgeries are currently done in this group. The recommendation to offer surgery instead of TAVI to those with intermediate and low surgical risk should increase the number of surgeries and reduce TAVIs in this group. This will ultimately improve NHS efficiency. Minimally invasive surgery or median sternotomy for aortic valve disease Data suggests that between 5% and 10% of surgical isolated aortic valve replacements are done by minimally invasive surgery. If the recommendation leads to an increase in the number of aortic valve replacements being done by minimally invasive surgery, this could represent an important change in practice. There may be no increase in the short term, as more training in these procedures will be needed, but only in the long term when more centres will
