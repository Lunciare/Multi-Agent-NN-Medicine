Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

step for primary mitral regurgitation and an indication for intervention, for secondary mitral regurgitation the underlying heart failure is usually treated first. Therefore, the committee recommended that an intervention should be offered for severe primary mitral regurgitation and considered for secondary mitral regurgitation after optimisation of medical management. Invasiveness of surgery Evidence from 5 RCTs comparing minimally invasive surgery with median sternotomy for mitral regurgitation or mixed/unclear mitral valve disease demonstrated few differences. The studies were limited by small participant numbers and a small number of events for many reported outcomes. There was substantial uncertainty for most reported outcomes, a lack of long-term data for many outcomes, and most outcomes were graded as low or very low quality. Overall, when any larger differences were observed (for example, length of stay), these were for a benefit of minimally invasive procedures. A single health economic study suggested the cost of minimally invasive surgery was less per person than median sternotomy. However, the committee did not consider the included evidence to be strong enough to support recommending 1 type of surgery over the other. They agreed that median sternotomy and minimally invasive surgery should be options for those with mitral regurgitation requiring mitral
