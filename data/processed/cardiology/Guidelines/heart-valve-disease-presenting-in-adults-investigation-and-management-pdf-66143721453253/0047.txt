agreed with the committee's experience. Although there is limited evidence that in severe mitral regurgitation, intervening before symptoms develop results in better outcomes, the committee agreed that this may be better. Evidence from 1 study showed that SPAP above 60 mmHg on exercise was associated with symptoms developing during follow up. There was not enough evidence for the committee to make a recommendation about symptomatic non-severe mitral regurgitation. The single small study identified suggested that an increase in effective regurgitant orifice area of 13 mm2 or more on exercise may indicate a worse outcome for this group. But the committee were not confident in this result and so made a recommendation for research to inform future practice. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation largely reflects current best practice, although there is local variation and not all healthcare professionals will know that all of these thresholds should lead to referral for intervention. Return to recommendation Monitoring when there is no current need for intervention Recommendations 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 Why the committee made the recommendations A single study from the US suggested that regular monitoring for people with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis reduced all-cause mortality and hospital admission for heart
