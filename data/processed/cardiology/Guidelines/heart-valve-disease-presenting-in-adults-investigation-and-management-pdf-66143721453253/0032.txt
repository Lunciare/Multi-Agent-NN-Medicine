1.1.6 and 1.1.7 Why the committee made the recommendations Across the included studies, moderate and severe valve disease was consistently associated with more adverse outcomes than 'mild' or 'mild and moderate' valve disease. Despite limited evidence for each specific type of valve disease, the committee agreed that specialist referral should be offered to those with moderate or severe disease. This is consistent with current practice. The evidence could not be used to recommend that people with mild valve disease should never be referred to a specialist, because outcomes were not compared with those without valve disease. However, the committee stressed that patients and healthcare professionals should be aware that mild valve disease is very common in people over 70, it seldom causes symptoms and does not progress in most cases. The committee recommended that people with bicuspid aortic valve disease of any severity (including mild disease) should be offered specialist referral because its progression is different to other types of valve disease, it can be associated with aortopathy and in practice is usually referred. How the recommendations might affect practice The committee agreed that it is current practice for everyone with moderate or severe valve disease to be referred to
