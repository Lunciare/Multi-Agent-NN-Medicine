Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

regurgitation Recommendations 1.5.15 and 1.5.16 Why the committee made these recommendations A single RCT was identified comparing transcatheter repair plus optimal medical management with optimal medical management alone in people with severe, symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation and a high surgical risk score. Patients with associated tricuspid regurgitation have worse prognosis after mitral valve intervention than those with mild or no tricuspid regurgitation. There is strong evidence that secondary functional tricuspid regurgitation that is severe does not improve after fixing the mitral lesion. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation does remain stable in a few patients after mitral correction. However, in a significant number, it does not improve and may get worse. Tricuspid annuloplasty by an experienced surgeon (at the time of mitral surgery) is a quick procedure that reduces the amount of tricuspid regurgitation and may improve prognosis. Patients with associated tricuspid regurgitation have a worse prognosis after aortic valve intervention than those with mild or no tricuspid regurgitation. There is strong evidence (but not reviewed here) that secondary functional tricuspid regurgitation that is severe does not improve after fixing the left-sided lesion. Tricuspid annuloplasty by an experienced surgeon is a quick procedure that does reduce the amount of tricuspid regurgitation and may improve
