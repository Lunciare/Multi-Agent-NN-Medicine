Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management
KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

TAVI is the only intervention available for some people with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. They agreed that pharmacological management is not sufficient to help symptoms in severe aortic stenosis and for some aortic stenosis can be fatal without an intervention. TAVI can improve outcomes in many cases. Two UK-based studies indicated that TAVI offers a good balance of benefits and costs in adults who cannot have surgery. The committee agreed to recommend TAVI, if suitable, for those with non-bicuspid severe aortic stenosis if surgery is unsuitable. TAVI is the only option for this group and was deemed cost effective in this population. All of the evidence identified was for non-bicuspid aortic stenosis. TAVI is considered to be more difficult for bicuspid aortic stenosis and the committee could not extrapolate the evidence to cover this population. Invasiveness of surgery Evidence was identified from 14 RCTs comparing minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement with standard surgery by median sternotomy across different aortic valve disease populations. Some harms of minimally invasive surgery were observed, and 1 health economic study suggested that minimally invasive surgery was less cost effective than median sternotomy. However, the RCTs were small and a small number of events
