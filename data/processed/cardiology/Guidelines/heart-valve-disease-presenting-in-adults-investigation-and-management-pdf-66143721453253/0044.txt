Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

for adults with aortic regurgitation Recommendation 1.3.6 Why the committee made the recommendation Echocardiography The committee agreed that it is established practice to consider intervention for people with severe aortic regurgitation and reduced cardiac function. Severity is defined in line with British Society of Echocardiography guidelines. People with aortic regurgitation are often younger than people with other types of valve disease and benefit from timely intervention. Evidence showed that when LVEF was less than 55%, the risk of cardiovascular mortality or heart failure after intervention was higher. End systolic diameter index (ESDI) is also a measure of systolic dysfunction. Evidence showed an increased risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or death when ESDI was more than 24 mm/m2. The committee agreed that either of these 2 indicators of early myocardial decompensation should prompt discussion of possible intervention for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation. Recommendations were limited because of the evidence included being low to very low quality. There was not enough evidence to include BNP level as an indicator for referral for intervention for people with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation. The committee agreed to make a recommendation for research to inform future practice. Stress testing and stress echocardiography No evidence was
