only). The largest effect was for the need for reintervention for secondary mitral regurgitation, with fewer repeat interventions needed in the replacement group. Overall, the included evidence was limited; all studies were very small, with very few events reported for most outcomes and substantial uncertainty in the effects reported. Most outcomes were graded as very low quality. The lack of stronger evidence is likely to be because surgical repair has been preferred to replacement in mitral valve surgery for the past few decades. This was based on observational evidence and because randomising to repair or replacement in people for whom repair is suitable was thought to be unethical. Based on these limitations, the committee made recommendations reflecting current practice for those with severe mitral regurgitation requiring an intervention, with surgical repair recommended in those for whom it is suitable and replacement when repair is not suitable. The committee noted that there are differences in the aetiology and treatment of primary and secondary mitral regurgitation. Although valve intervention is the next step for primary mitral regurgitation and an indication for intervention, for secondary mitral regurgitation the underlying heart failure is usually treated first. Therefore, the committee recommended that an intervention should
