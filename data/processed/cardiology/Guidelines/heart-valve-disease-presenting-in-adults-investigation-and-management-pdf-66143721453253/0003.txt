KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

If valve disease is suspected (based on the nature of the murmur, family history, age or medical history): • Offer urgent (within 2 weeks) specialist assessment that includes echocardiogram or if not available an urgent echocardiogram alone to adults with a systolic murmur and exertional syncope. • Consider urgent (within 2 weeks) specialist assessment that includes echocardiogram for adults with a murmur and severe symptoms (angina or breathlessness on minimal exertion or at rest) thought to be related to valvular heart disease. 1.1.4 For guidance on referral and assessment for adults with murmur and non- exertional syncope, follow the recommendations in the NICE guideline on transient loss of consciousness ('blackouts') in over 16s. 1.1.5 For guidance on referral and assessment for adults with breathlessness but no murmur, follow the recommendations in the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure in adults. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on referral for urgent specialist assessment or urgent echocardiography. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: symptoms and signs indicating need for echocardiography or direct referral to a specialist. Referral
