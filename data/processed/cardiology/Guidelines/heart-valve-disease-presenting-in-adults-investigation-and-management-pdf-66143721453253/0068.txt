Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management
KEYWORDS: valve, committee, aortic, mitral, evidence, disease, intervention, regurgitation, surgery, valve disease, recommendations, stenosis, severe, practice, adults

were no RCTs comparing transcatheter intervention with surgery for repeat intervention and the only included studies were non-randomised. The committee were not able to base recommendations on this because of the limitations with non-randomised evidence. Therefore, they recommended that a shared decision should be based on short- and longer-term benefits, the type of valve dysfunction and prosthesis, the risks associated with the procedure and the possible need for other cardiac procedures. The term 'degenerated' refers to progressive degeneration and does not include failure of the valve due to endocarditis or thrombosis. The recommendation was limited to those with symptoms because this was considered to be an indication for repeat intervention. The committee also made recommendations for research for repeat intervention for failing biological prosthetic aortic, mitral and tricuspid valves because the only available evidence was non-randomised. How the recommendation might affect practice When both transcatheter and surgical procedures are options for repeat intervention, the choice of procedure is usually based on individual patient characteristics although surgery may be done more often. When surgery is not an option, transcatheter intervention is used as the only alternative to medical management. The recommendation will therefore not represent a change in practice. Return to
