affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on indications for intervention for adults with mitral regurgitation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: indications for intervention and evidence review E: stress testing and stress echocardiography in determining need for intervention. 1.4 Monitoring when there is no current need for intervention 1.4.1 Offer clinical review every 6 to 12 months, with an echocardiogram, to adults with asymptomatic severe valve disease if an intervention is suitable but not currently needed. Base the frequency of the review on echocardiography findings and shared decision making with the patient. 1.4.2 Consider echocardiographic assessment every 3 to 5 years for adults with mild aortic or mitral stenosis. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring where there is no current need for intervention.
