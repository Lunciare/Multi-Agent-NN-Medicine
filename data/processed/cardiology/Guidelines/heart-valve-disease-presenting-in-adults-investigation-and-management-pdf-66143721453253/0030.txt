murmur, family history, age or medical history. Murmur with other symptoms or signs Studies showed that echocardiography detected valve disease in a higher proportion of people with murmur plus other signs and symptoms (abnormal ECG, angina, breathlessness, peripheral oedema) than in people with murmur alone. That is, murmur plus other signs or symptoms had a higher specificity for echocardiography confirmed valve disease. Again, this was based on a few studies only, so the committee agreed that the nature of the murmur, family history, age or medical history should also suggest valve disease as a possibility. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current practice. Return to recommendations Referral for urgent specialist assessment or urgent echocardiography Recommendations 1.1.3 to 1.1.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence showed that more cases of severe valve disease were picked up when a murmur plus other signs or symptoms were present. The committee agreed that mild and moderate valve disease does not usually present with these symptoms and using these criteria for referral would not result in unnecessary referral for urgent specialist assessment or echocardiography in most cases. People with exertional syncope and a systolic murmur need an urgent diagnosis because exertional
