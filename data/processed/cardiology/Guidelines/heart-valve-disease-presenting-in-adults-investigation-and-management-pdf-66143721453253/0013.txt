the recommendations on using TAVI in the NICE interventional procedures guidance on transcatheter aortic valve implantation for aortic stenosis, including entering the details of all people undergoing TAVI into the UK TAVI registry. See also the NICE interventional procedures guidance on sutureless aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis and balloon valvuloplasty for aortic valve stenosis. See NHS England's clinical commissioning policy on transcatheter aortic valve implantation for aortic stenosis. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on interventions for aortic valve disease. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: transcatheter intervention, surgery or conservative management in heart valve disease. Mitral stenosis 1.5.6 Consider transcatheter valvotomy for adults with rheumatic severe mitral stenosis, if the valve is suitable for this procedure. 1.5.7 Offer surgical mitral valve replacement to adults with rheumatic severe mitral stenosis if transcatheter valvotomy is unsuitable.
