strain to assess the need for intervention? In adults with asymptomatic, severe aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation what is the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) to assess the need for intervention? 9 Pharmacological management for adults with heart valve disease What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and diuretics for adults with severe aortic stenosis? What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, including compared with placebo, for adults with aortic regurgitation? What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers and diuretics for adults with primary severe mitral regurgitation? What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of beta-blockers for adults over 75 years with non-rheumatic/calcific mitral stenosis, in both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation? What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmacological management of heart failure for adults with heart failure and severe aortic stenosis, severe aortic regurgitation or severe mitral regurgitation? 10 Monitoring when there is no current need for intervention What is the most clinically and cost-effective monitoring strategy (type and frequency of test) for adults
