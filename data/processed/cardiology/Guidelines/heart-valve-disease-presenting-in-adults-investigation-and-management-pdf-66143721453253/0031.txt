Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

referral would not result in unnecessary referral for urgent specialist assessment or echocardiography in most cases. People with exertional syncope and a systolic murmur need an urgent diagnosis because exertional syncope caused by aortic stenosis has a high risk of a poor outcome. The diagnosis must be made quickly to allow appropriate management, which would likely include intervention if severe aortic stenosis is confirmed. Depending on local availability, an echocardiogram may be faster than direct specialist referral, which would include echocardiography, so the committee agreed to recommend either for this group. The committee agreed that the assessment or echocardiogram should be done within 2 weeks. For people with severe symptoms (New York Heart Association classification III to IV or perceived by the person as severe) and a murmur, but without exertional syncope, the committee agreed that urgent specialist assessment within 2 weeks, which would include echocardiography, should be considered. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current practice.
