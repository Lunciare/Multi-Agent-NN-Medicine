treatments in adults who have had valve repair. The committee made a recommendation for research comparing anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatments with placebo after valve repair. How the recommendations might affect practice Anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment after surgical biological valve replacement Practice is currently variable, with some centres offering vitamin K antagonists after surgical biological valve replacement. Therefore, the recommendation will lead to a change in practice in some centres. Single antiplatelet therapy after TAVI It is unusual for people not to receive at least single antiplatelet therapy after TAVI and many people receive dual antiplatelet therapy. The recommendation was not thought to represent a change in practice in terms of the number of people who receive some form of antiplatelet therapy after a transcatheter procedure. Return to recommendations Monitoring after an intervention Recommendation 1.8.1 Why the committee made the recommendation No evidence was found for the frequency of monitoring after an intervention for valve disease. Current practice is variable and depends on patient factors, such as comorbidities, other cardiac disease or previous heart surgery, as well as the type of procedure performed (repair or replacement). Follow up also depends on the type of valve used for a replacement. The committee
