Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

inoperable, found that transcatheter edge-to-edge repair with MitraClip device had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of about £30,000. A health economic model was developed as part of the guideline to investigate the cost effectiveness of using the MitraClip device when surgery is not suitable. The model demonstrated that transcatheter mitral valve repair had a low chance of being cost effective at £20,000 per QALY gained, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £30,000 per QALY gained. These results are in line with the UK study identified in the literature review. The health economic model was largely based on results from the COAPT trial, which covered transcatheter mitral valve repair in severe secondary mitral regurgitation. This trial demonstrated substantial benefits over medical management alone when surgery was unsuitable. However, it was not considered to be cost effective at the current list price. For this reason, edge-to-edge mitral valve repair was not recommended over medical management. How the recommendations might affect practice Repair or replacement when surgery is suitable Edge-to-edge repair is not widely available in the NHS. Therefore, this recommendation may lead to a change in practice and increase the amount of percutaneous mitral intervention in those for whom
