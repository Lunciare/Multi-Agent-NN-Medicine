were observed, and 1 health economic study suggested that minimally invasive surgery was less cost effective than median sternotomy. However, the RCTs were small and a small number of events were observed for many outcomes. The health economic study was limited for the same reasons because it was based on 1 of the RCTs and was limited to a 12-month time- horizon. Although the committee agreed it is likely there would not be a large difference in outcomes after 12 months, this may be too short to draw conclusions about cost effectiveness over a lifetime. The committee highlighted that in their experience there was no difference between minimally invasive surgery and median sternotomy when done by those with expertise. The committee were also aware of certain advantages of minimally invasive surgery, for example, smaller incisions. The committee agreed not to limit the use of minimally invasive surgery and to recommend a choice with the decision based on patient characteristics and preferences. A lack of expertise in minimally invasive surgery locally should not be used as a reason for not performing a minimally invasive procedure and adults should be referred to a centre where there is expertise if this procedure is
