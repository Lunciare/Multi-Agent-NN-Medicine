Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

showed that TAVI at current prices was cost effective for people at high risk of surgery but not for people at low or intermediate risk. The committee agreed that if surgery is an option, it should be offered to those with severe aortic stenosis who are low or intermediate risk. Although all of the evidence identified was for non-bicuspid aortic stenosis, it was agreed that the recommendation should also apply to bicuspid aortic stenosis, because suitability of surgery does not depend on the type of aortic stenosis. TAVI is also considered to be more difficult in bicuspid aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis when surgery is unsuitable Evidence showed benefits for TAVI for people with inoperable non-bicuspid severe aortic stenosis compared with pharmacological management at 1 to 5 years. These included benefits in all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, need for another intervention during follow up, and hospital admission. However, at 30 days TAVI was associated with increased mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, major bleeding, and major vascular complications. The committee noted that TAVI is the only intervention available for some people with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. They agreed that pharmacological management is not sufficient to help symptoms in severe aortic stenosis and
