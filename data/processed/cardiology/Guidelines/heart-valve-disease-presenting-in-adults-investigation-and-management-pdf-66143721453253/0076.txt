Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

fears are different from those of younger adults. Therefore, the committee made a recommendation for research on the information and advice needs of all adult age groups with valve disease of all severities and stages. Studies should include patient-reported outcomes and experiences of decision aids. How the recommendations might affect practice Currently not all adults with valve disease have a point of contact between appointments or psychological support, and so these recommendations will need a change by some providers. Return to recommendations Context The heart has 4 valves (aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary) that control blood flow. In heart valve disease, valve function can be impaired by: • stenosis, a narrowing or stiffening of the valve, which restricts its opening and obstructs the forward flow of blood • regurgitation, failure of the valve to close completely, which allows blood to flow backward. There can be stenosis and regurgitation of the same valve (mixed valve disease) or disease may affect more than one valve (multiple valve disease). Mitral and tricuspid heart valve disease can be primary or secondary. Primary disease affects the valve structure, whereas secondary disease results from enlargement or dysfunction of the heart chambers (atria or ventricles) with otherwise
