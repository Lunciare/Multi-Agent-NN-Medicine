Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

murmur should be referred for echocardiography. The committee agreed that this would be a change in practice, would increase pressure on echocardiography services and would offer uncertain benefit. However, when the nature of the murmur, family history, age or medical history suggest possible valve disease, echocardiography should be considered to establish a diagnosis. Systolic murmur with a reduced second heart sound Evidence suggested that the presence of a systolic heart murmur plus a reduced second heart sound had good specificity for aortic stenosis confirmed by echocardiography. The recommendation specifies ejection systolic murmur because this, combined with a reduced second heart sound, is a classic indicator of aortic stenosis and is most often present in severe aortic stenosis. Although this was based on only a few studies, the committee agreed that people with these features should be referred for echocardiography. Because of the limited evidence identified, this recommendation was limited to those in whom heart valve disease was considered a possible explanation of these signs based on the nature of the murmur, family history, age or medical history. Murmur with other symptoms or signs Studies showed that echocardiography detected valve disease in a higher proportion of people with murmur plus other
