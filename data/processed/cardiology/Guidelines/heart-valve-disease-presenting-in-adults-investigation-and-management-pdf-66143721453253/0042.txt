Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

measured by cardiac CT indicates a worse prognosis for people with aortic stenosis. This could be because it is an index of the severity of aortic stenosis or because it is a marker of more widespread vascular disease. This was supported by the knowledge and experience of the committee, who noted that a more calcified aortic valve is associated with more severe aortic stenosis. However, the mechanism of aortic stenosis in bicuspid aortic valves or in rheumatic disease is different, and cardiac CT would not be as relevant for monitoring valve calcium. Most of the evidence suggested that myocardial fibrosis was associated with increased risk of a poor outcome in severe aortic stenosis. This was in line with the committee's experience that myocardial fibrosis in general, not only in aortic stenosis, is associated with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, myocardial fibrosis in people with severe aortic stenosis indicates early decompensation and the possible need for early intervention to stop progression, because mid-wall fibrosis cannot be reversed or improved by intervention. The committee agreed that follow up should be enhanced and further assessment should be offered in those with mid-wall fibrosis to check for symptoms and enable earlier aortic valve intervention to
