committee agreed that this benefit is because of an improvement in overall cardiovascular health rather than a direct effect on the aortic stenosis. Therefore, no recommendation was made and statins should be used in line with the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification. There was not enough evidence for the committee to make recommendations on pharmacological management of other conditions (for example, systemic hypertension) in people who also have heart valve disease. The committee decided to make recommendations for research to inform pharmacological management using common treatments (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics) in adults with aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation. These are important areas of uncertainty in current UK clinical practice. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice, so the committee agreed there is unlikely to be a significant resource impact. Pharmacological management of heart failure in heart valve disease Recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 Why the committee made the recommendation Some evidence showed that beta-blockers reduced hospital stay for heart failure and increased exercise tolerance compared with usual care in adults with mitral stenosis. As with all other indications for beta-blockers,
