surgery is unsuitable. Transcatheter mitral valve repair in secondary mitral regurgitation when surgery is unsuitable Evidence was included from 3 RCTs comparing transcatheter mitral valve repair with medical management for secondary mitral regurgitation. Two of these were clearly in a population in which surgery was not suitable and covered the use of the MitraClip device; the third study covered a Carillon device rather than MitraClip and the population was unclear. Outcomes from all 3 studies were pooled if possible, in the clinical review, but the health economic modelling was limited to the population in which surgery was not suitable. The clinical review highlighted uncertainty in the results for 3 outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality and onset/exacerbation of heart failure at 1 to 3 years or 2 to 3 years). Some studies demonstrated a benefit of transcatheter repair, some a harm (lack of benefit) and some no difference. One UK health economic study based on the results of the COAPT trial, which enrolled people with very severe secondary mitral regurgitation deemed inoperable, found that transcatheter edge-to-edge repair with MitraClip device had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of about £30,000. A health economic model was developed as part of
