or previous heart surgery, as well as the type of procedure performed (repair or replacement). Follow up also depends on the type of valve used for a replacement. The committee agreed that mechanical valves have good durability with a low risk of failure. In contrast, biological valves have lower durability with deterioration possible within 10 years. The committee noted that, although practice varies, mechanical valves may be monitored over the first 12 months and then only checked if problems develop. Monitoring is usually more frequent for biological valves – with some centres offering annual follow up starting from the year of the operation and others starting annual follow up after 5 years. Any concerns about abnormal valve function may also affect the frequency of monitoring, with more frequent follow up if there are concerns. The committee agreed that frequency of follow up should be discussed with the patient. Some people find more frequent monitoring reassuring whereas for others this leads to increased anxiety. People should be encouraged to seek advice if they feel that their condition has deteriorated. There is a higher risk of endocarditis in replacement valves and people should be encouraged to report symptoms. How the recommendation might
