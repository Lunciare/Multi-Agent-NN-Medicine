Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on indications for interventions. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: transcatheter intervention, surgery or conservative management in heart valve disease. Aortic stenosis 1.3.2 Consider referring adults with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis for intervention, if suitable, if they have any of the following: • Vmax (peak aortic jet velocity) more than 5 m/s on echocardiography • aortic valve area less than 0.6 cm2 on echocardiography • left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 55% • B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) level more than twice the upper limit of normal • symptoms unmasked on exercise testing. 1.3.3 Consider referring adults with symptomatic low-gradient aortic stenosis with LVEF less than 50% for intervention if during dobutamine stress echocardiography the aortic stenosis is shown to be severe by: • a mean gradient across the aortic valve that increases to more than 40 mmHg and • an aortic valve area that remains less than 1 cm2. 1.3.4 Consider measuring aortic valve calcium score on cardiac CT if the severity of symptomatic aortic stenosis is uncertain. 1.3.5 Offer enhanced follow up (for example, more frequent reviews) and
