systolic diameter index (ESDI) more than 24 mm/m2 on echocardiography. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on indications for interventions for adults with aortic regurgitation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: indications for intervention. Mitral regurgitation 1.3.7 Consider referring adults with asymptomatic severe primary mitral regurgitation for intervention, if suitable, if they have any of the following: • LVEF less than 60% • ESD more than 45 mm or ESDI more than 22 mm/m2 on echocardiography or • an increase of systolic pulmonary artery pressure to more than 60 mmHg on exercise testing. When making decisions about referral for surgery, take into account the suitability of the valve for repair and the presence of atrial fibrillation or systolic pulmonary artery pressure of more than 50 mmHg on echocardiography at rest. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on indications for intervention for adults with mitral regurgitation.
