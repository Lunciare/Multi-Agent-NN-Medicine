Heart valve disease presenting in adults: investigation and management

may have symptoms that can depend on the affected valve. Associated heart rhythm problems, such as atrial fibrillation or heart block, may cause palpitations and breathlessness, or dizziness and light-headedness, respectively. Untreated severe disease can lead to valvular heart failure, with symptoms including breathlessness, reduced exercise capacity, tiredness and swollen ankles. Heart valves stiffen as part of the ageing process, making dysfunction more likely in older people. We hope that this guideline will raise awareness of heart valve disease and improve diagnosis and management.
