MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

from making unnecessary dissections during the procedure. This may reduce the risk of bleeding and intraoperative complications. Based on this aspect of detection, 1 expert said that the technology is most appropriate for use in people with known peripheral vascular disease and another expert said that it would provide more benefit in people with calcified vessels or small vessels with a high syntax score. Potential system impact One expert said that the technology has the potential to standardise the methods used in practice, which are currently subjective and not evidence-based. This expert added that the potential to reduce future cardiac events would mean fewer hospital visits, which would free up resource. All of the experts agreed that the technology will initially cost significantly more than standard care. This is because of the cost of purchasing the technology and disposables, training theatre nursing staff and surgeons, and the extra time required to perform flow measurements and ultrasound assessment. One expert felt that the long-term cost impact would be equal to or less than standard care. General comments All 3 experts agreed that the technology would not require any specific changes to facilities and infrastructure, though 2 experts noted that storage space
