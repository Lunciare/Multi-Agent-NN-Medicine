common cause of symptoms, disability and death. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to stenosis or occlusion of the coronary arteries. NICE's guideline on stable angina: management recommends that revascularisation of the blocked coronary arteries using CABG or percutaneous coronary interventions should be considered in people whose symptoms are not satisfactorily controlled by medical treatment. CABG surgery aims to bypass narrowed or blocked segments of the coronary arteries using grafts. Grafts are usually constructed from lengths of the patient's own long saphenous vein or internal mammary artery, although other blood vessels are also used. Cardiac surgeons use a variety of techniques to avoid technical problems during CABG surgery, but assessment of graft flow is usually subjective. Techniques used vary according to the graft used, the surgical technique, and the surgeon's individual preference. They include the surgeon assessing resistance and perfusion beyond a graft by flushing fluid through it before restoring flow, and observing and palpating grafts for pulsation when blood flow has been re-established. The following publications have been identified as relevant to this care pathway: • NICE's guideline on stable angina: management • NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes • European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association
