MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

abnormal TTFM results were false positives for 15 of 18 distal anastomoses (83.3%). Epicardial ultrasound was also used to evaluate 32 target epicardial arteries in 30 people to identify the appropriate anastomosis sites. For 5 anastomoses, the target vessels were changed to adjacent vessels based on the ultrasound findings. The early and 1-year overall graft patency rates were 100% (141 anastomoses) and 96.1% (122 of 127 anastomoses), respectively. The early mortality rate was 1.9% (1 of 53 people). Overall, postoperative complications included new-onset atrial fibrillation (n=13; 24.5%), respiratory complications (n=3; 5.7%), low cardiac output syndrome (n=2; 3.8%), and acute kidney injury (n=2; 3.8%). Strengths and limitations This study suggests that epicardial ultrasound scanning may be beneficial during CABG surgery to confirm the quality of the surgery and potentially reduce additional procedures. A limitation is that the procedures were done by 1 surgeon. Sustainability The company claims the technology will reduce the use of single-use equipment related to the surgical procedure by reducing the need for repeat vascularisation (repeat CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and the ionising radiation connected to PCI. Both the TTFM and HFUS probes can be used on multiple patients after cleaning and sterilisation. There is no
