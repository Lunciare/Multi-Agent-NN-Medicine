completed bypass anastomosis. The TTFM probe uses transit time technology to accurately measure blood flow intraoperatively. It measures 3 parameters of transit time flow (mean blood flow in ml per minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage) to assess graft blood flow and check graft patency. A microcomputer with a touchscreen mounted on a moveable trolley is used to control the probes and store their outputs. There is another version available, the MiraQ TTFM system, that does not include HFUS. This version has been evaluated separately in NICE's medical technologies guidance on MiraQ for assessing graft flow during CABG surgery and is not part of this briefing. Innovations The company claims that the L15 imaging probe is designed to improve near-field imaging using HFUS and is applied directly to the cardiac tissue. The company also claims that intraoperative quality assessment and surgical guidance using HFUS is more likely to lead to a positive outcome and decrease the chance for additional surgical reinterventions. Current care pathway Coronary artery disease is a common cause of symptoms, disability and death. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to stenosis or occlusion of the coronary arteries.
