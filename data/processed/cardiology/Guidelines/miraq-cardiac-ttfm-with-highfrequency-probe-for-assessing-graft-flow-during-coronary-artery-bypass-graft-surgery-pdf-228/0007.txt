MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

variety of techniques, which are selected based on surgeon preference. These usually involve minimal or no extra cost. Resource consequences The company states that MiraQ cardiac with TTFM and HFUS is used in 6 NHS trusts. The company claims that using the MiraQ cardiac TTFM and HFUS system reduces postoperative deaths and re-hospitalisations when compared with both CABG surgery alone and CABG surgery with the MiraQ TTFM system. The company states that there are no practical difficulties or changes in facilities and infrastructure associated with adopting MiraQ. It is a standalone system that only needs an electrical output socket. Regulatory information MiraQ cardiac transit time flow measurement and high-frequency ultrasound system is a CE-marked class IIa medical device, and the probes used with the MiraQ system are CE- marked class III. There is a field safety notice on Medistim ASA: VeriQ, MiraQ. Medistim is aware of incidences when flow measurement channels on Medistim devices have been operating with a significant zero-point offset value. The result is that flow measurements recorded with these channels will indicate that the flow is too high or too low. This might result in worse patient outcomes. Exploration of the issue has shown that this malfunction
