MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

case, the graft was revised. Thirty-day mortality was 0% and no stroke was observed. Strengths and limitations This study suggests that MiraQ TTFM and HFUS was helpful in evaluating the clamping or cannulation site, the potential opening site of the vessel or the completed anastomosis. A limitation is that the main aim of the study was to evaluate MiraQ TTFM and HFUS in relation to postoperative troponin-I release. Kim et al. (2020) Study size, design and location A retrospective observational study of 53 people undergoing CABG in Korea. Intervention and comparator VeriQ C system, no comparator. Key outcomes In total, the quality of 141 distal anastomoses was evaluated, of which 123 with normal TTFM results also had good ultrasound findings. Abnormal TTFM findings, including low flow or high pulsatility index, were found in 18 distal anastomoses. The epicardial ultrasound identified that only 3 of these needed revisions. Revisions were not done for the other 15 distal anastomoses and at 1 year after surgery, all 15 of these were patent. The abnormal TTFM results were false positives for 15 of 18 distal anastomoses (83.3%). Epicardial ultrasound was also used to evaluate 32 target epicardial arteries in 30 people to identify the
