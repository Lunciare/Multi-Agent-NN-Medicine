artery bypass graft surgery Overview NICE has developed a medtech innovation briefing (MIB) on MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The information provided includes a description of the technology, how it's used and its potential role in the treatment pathway. A MIB also includes a review of relevant published evidence and the likely costs of using the technologies, but they are not NICE guidance and do not make any recommendations on the value of using the technologies. Summary • The technology described in this briefing is the MiraQ cardiac transit time flowmetry (TTFM) and high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) system. It is used for intraoperative quality assessment of graft blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for people with coronary heart disease. • The innovative aspect is the L15 HFUS imaging probe that is designed to improve near-field imaging and is applied directly to the cardiac tissue.
