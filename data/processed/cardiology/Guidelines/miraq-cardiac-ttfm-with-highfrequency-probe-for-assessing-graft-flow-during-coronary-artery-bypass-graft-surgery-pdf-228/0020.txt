MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

less than standard care. General comments All 3 experts agreed that the technology would not require any specific changes to facilities and infrastructure, though 2 experts noted that storage space within the operating theatre would be needed. They also agreed that training would be required to achieve competency with the device. One of the experts highlighted that the technology does not automatically record blood pressure during the flow measurement and that this would be useful for retrospective analyses of outcomes. They also said that a small portion of the left internal mammary artery must be prepared for placing the flow probe around the vessel. If this step is not done before the procedure and instead done at the end, this could cause damage to the mammary artery and cause bleeding. All 3 experts suggested that larger studies are needed to determine both the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, including in different patient groups. Two experts said that the technology would be needed for all coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures done in the NHS, which is approximately 15,000 a year.
