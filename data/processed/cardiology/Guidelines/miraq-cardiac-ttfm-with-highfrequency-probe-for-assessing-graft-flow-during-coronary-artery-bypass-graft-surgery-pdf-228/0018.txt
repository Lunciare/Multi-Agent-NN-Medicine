MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

cardiac is the most user-friendly form that this technology has been presented in. The other expert said that MiraQ cardiac is a useful tool for quality control of anastomotic issues. Two experts described the standard care used in clinical practice, which includes assessment of graft adequacy and flow by: changes in electrocardiogram measurements and haemodynamic parameters, infusing cardioplegia through a conduit during the procedure and palpation of the conduit. Two of the clinical experts stated that the technology would be used in addition to standard care and 1 said that it has the potential to replace standard care. Potential patient impact Two experts said that the primary benefit of the technology for patients is providing surgeons with detailed objective information about the graft condition and graft flow. This information can be used to make necessary changes to improve blood flow in the graft and potentially reduce long-term graft failure. One expert also highlighted the ability of the technology to detect the position of deep lying arteries, which prevents the surgeon from making unnecessary dissections during the procedure. This may reduce the risk of bleeding and intraoperative complications. Based on this aspect of detection, 1 expert said that the technology is
