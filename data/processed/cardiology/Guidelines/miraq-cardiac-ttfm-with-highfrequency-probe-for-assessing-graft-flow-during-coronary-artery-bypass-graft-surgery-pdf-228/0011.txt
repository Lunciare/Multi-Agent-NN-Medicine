MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

artery bypass graft surgery in 7 centres in Europe and North America. Intervention and comparator MiraQ cardiac or VeriQ C devices with TTFM and HFUS, no comparator. Key outcomes HFUS was used to assess the ascending aorta in 79.3% (806 out of 1,016) of people, the in situ conduits in 65.1% (661 out of 1,016), the coronary targets in 47.5% (483 out of 1,016) and completed grafts in 59.3% (602 out of 1,016). People who had off-pump surgery had HFUS more frequently (88.3%) compared with people who had on-pump surgery (73.5%). The primary outcome of the study was any change in planned surgical procedure as a result of imaging with TTFM or HFUS, or from visual assessment. A surgical change was made in 256 people. Of these, in 77% (197 out of 256) this was a result of TTFM or HFUS. Of these, surgical changes were made to the aorta in 74 of 80 people (92.5%), to in situ conduits in 10 of 18 people (55.6%), to the proposed coronary target in 73 of 109 people (67.0%) and to grafts in 51 of 79 people (64.6%). In-hospital adverse event rates were 0.3% for myocardial infarction, 0.6% for mortality and 1.0%
