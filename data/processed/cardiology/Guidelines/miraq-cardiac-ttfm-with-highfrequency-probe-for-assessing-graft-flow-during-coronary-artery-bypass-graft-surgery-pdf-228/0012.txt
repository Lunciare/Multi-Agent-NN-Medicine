target in 73 of 109 people (67.0%) and to grafts in 51 of 79 people (64.6%). In-hospital adverse event rates were 0.3% for myocardial infarction, 0.6% for mortality and 1.0% for cerebral events. Strengths and limitations The study suggests that TTFM and HFUS may improve the quality, safety and efficacy of CABG procedures. One of the centres was based in the UK. The main author has received research funding, speaking and travelling fees from the company. Seven out of the other 9 authors received travelling support or speaker fees from the company. A limitation of the study is that the outcomes were limited to in-hospital reporting and no further follow up was done. Rosenfeld et al. (2021) Study size, design and location A retrospective review of the REQUEST registry of 1,016 people diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease who were scheduled for isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery in 7 centres in Europe and North America. Intervention and comparator MiraQ cardiac or VeriQ C devices with TTFM and HFUS, no comparator. Key outcomes This study focused on 3 sub-analyses, comparing on-pump (ONCAB, n=402) with off- pump procedures (OPCAB, n=614), arterial versus venous grafts, and grafts to different territories.
