MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

2019) and 1 retrospective observational study (Kim et al. 2020). There is 1 secondary analysis that is not summarised below because it includes people with chronic and end-stage renal disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (Rosenfeld et al. 2021b). The clinical evidence and its strengths and limitations are summarised in the overall assessment of the evidence. Overall assessment of the evidence The evidence for the technology is of low to moderate quality. None of the studies have a comparator and there is limited evidence in an NHS setting (1 centre). Some of the evidence is on VeriQ C, which is a previous version of the technology. The evidence suggests that MiraQ cardiac with transit time flowmetry (TTFM) and high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) may improve the quality and efficacy of the CABG procedure. Comparative evidence on patient outcomes would be beneficial. Taggart et al. (2020) Study size, design and location A multicentre prospective observational registry of 1,016 people diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease who were scheduled for isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery in 7 centres in Europe and North America. Intervention and comparator MiraQ cardiac or VeriQ C devices with TTFM and HFUS, no comparator. Key outcomes HFUS
