with these channels will indicate that the flow is too high or too low. This might result in worse patient outcomes. Exploration of the issue has shown that this malfunction was caused by electrostatic discharge (ESD) damaging a component in the measurement chain on the Medistim systems, causing an offset from zero. Medistim tests the ESD resistance during compliance testing to ensure the system meets electromedical safety standard requirements. However, the incidences noted above have shown that severe ESD can surpass these requirements. Medistim has therefore further issued updated instructions for use which clarify the importance of routinely performing the probe and system functionality test before use to ensure that they function properly. Equality considerations NICE is committed to promoting equality of opportunity, eliminating unlawful discrimination and fostering good relations between people with particular protected characteristics and others. The MiraQ cardiac transit time flowmetry and high-frequency ultrasound system is intended for people with coronary artery disease who are having coronary artery bypass graft surgery. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, high levels of lipoprotein(a), smoking, physical inactivity, diabetes and being overweight increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease.
