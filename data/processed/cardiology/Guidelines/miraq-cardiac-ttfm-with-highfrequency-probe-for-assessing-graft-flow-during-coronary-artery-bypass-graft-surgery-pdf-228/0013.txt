MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

comparator. Key outcomes This study focused on 3 sub-analyses, comparing on-pump (ONCAB, n=402) with off- pump procedures (OPCAB, n=614), arterial versus venous grafts, and grafts to different territories. There were more surgical changes to the ascending aorta in OPCAB (14.7%) compared with ONCAB (3.4%) procedures (odds ratio [OR] 4.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.32 to 7.20). Strategy changes for in situ conduits occurred less in OPCAB (0.2%) versus ONCAB (2.8%) procedures (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.56). Changes to coronary targets did not differ between groups (10.4% versus 10.9%; OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.46). However, when comparing only people that underwent HFUS scanning, there were more target location changes in OPCAB (28.6%) versus ONCAB (19.9%) procedures (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.62). In all study participants, revisions were more common for arterial versus venous grafts (4.7% versus 2.4%; OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.29 to 3.37), and inferior versus anterior (5.1% versus 2.9%; OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.89) and lateral (5.1% versus 2.8%; OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.27) territory grafts. Strengths and limitations This study is a secondary analysis of Taggart et al. (2020). It suggests that compared with ONCAB, OPCAB procedures resulted
