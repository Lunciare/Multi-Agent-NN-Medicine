cause surgeons to make unnecessary changes and potentially lead to graft failure. The instructions for use have been updated to address the problem. • The cost of the MiraQ cardiac TTFM and HFUS system is £81,550 per unit, the L15 imaging probe is £8,365 and the TTFM probe is £1,720 (excluding VAT). Standard care is clinical assessment of graft flow using a variety of techniques, which are selected based on surgeon preference. The technology MiraQ cardiac (Medistim) combines transit time flow measurement (TTFM) and high- frequency ultrasound (HFUS) modalities within a single system. Surgical findings can be documented through flow tracing and images provided by the system. It is intended for intraoperative quality assessment of graft blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The system consists of 2 probes. The L15 HFUS imaging probe has a frequency range of 11 MHz to 18 MHz and provides high-resolution images that allow the surgeon to assess morphology, including the cannulation or clamping site of the aorta, and to evaluate the completed bypass anastomosis. The TTFM probe uses transit time technology to accurately measure blood flow intraoperatively. It measures 3 parameters of transit time flow (mean blood flow in ml per
