MiraQ cardiac TTFM with high-frequency probe for assessing graft flow during coronary

95% CI 1.04 to 3.27) territory grafts. Strengths and limitations This study is a secondary analysis of Taggart et al. (2020). It suggests that compared with ONCAB, OPCAB procedures resulted in 4 times more changes related to the ascending aorta. An additional limitation to those mentioned above is that the study did not compare CABG procedures with or without the MiraQ cardiac TTFM and HFUS system because of the nature of the study. Wendt et al. (2019) Study size, design and location A prospective study of 65 people undergoing CABG surgery in Germany. Intervention and comparator MiraQ cardiac with TTFM and HFUS, no comparator. Key outcomes A surgical strategy change, based on imaging, was done in 10 procedures (15%). Changes related to the cannulation site (n=3), the target opening site (n=2) and the clamping site (n=1). In 3 cases, imaging was used to identify the left anterior descending artery, and in 1 case the imaging confirmed a calcified vessel and a procedure was done to treat the calcification. In 1 case, the graft was revised. Thirty-day mortality was 0% and no stroke was observed. Strengths and limitations This study suggests that MiraQ TTFM and HFUS was helpful in evaluating the
