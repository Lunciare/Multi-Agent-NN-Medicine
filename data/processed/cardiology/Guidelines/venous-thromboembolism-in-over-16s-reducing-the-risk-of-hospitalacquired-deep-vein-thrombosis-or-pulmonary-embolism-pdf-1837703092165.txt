Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
This guideline replaces CG92.
This guideline is the basis of QS201.
Overview
This guideline covers assessing and reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE or
blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in people aged 16
and over in hospital. It aims to help healthcare professionals identify people most at risk
and describes interventions that can be used to reduce the risk of VTE.
For guidance on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people with COVID-19 pneumonia
who are being treated in a hospital or community setting, see our COVID-19 rapid guideline
on managing COVID-19.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• People going into hospital who are at risk of VTE. This includes people discharged
from hospital, (including from A&E) with lower limb devices such as plaster casts and
braces, people attending hospital for day procedures including cancer treatment and
surgery, and pregnant women admitted to hospital or a midwife-led unit including up
to 6 weeks after giving birth, and their carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Risk assessment
All patients
1.1.1 Assess all patients to identify the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and
bleeding (see the recommendation for all medical patients, for all surgical
patients, for all pregnant women and all women who gave birth or had a
miscarriage or termination of pregnancy in the past 6 weeks, for all people
admitted to the critical care unit and for all acute psychiatric patients). [2018]
People admitted, or are due to be admitted, to hospital
Medical patients
1.1.2 Assess all medical patients to identify the risk of VTE and bleeding:
• as soon as possible after admission to hospital or by the time of the first
consultant review, or
• in accident and emergency, if they have not been admitted within 12 hours of
their arrival

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
• using a tool published by a national UK body, professional network or peer-
reviewed journal.
A tool commonly used to develop a treatment plan for medical patients is the
Department of Health VTE risk assessment tool. (Reproduced with the
permission of the Department of Health and Social Care under the Open
Government Licence.) [2018, amended 2021]
1.1.3 Balance the person's individual risk of VTE against their risk of bleeding when
deciding whether to offer pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to medical
patients. [2018]
1.1.4 If using pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for medical patients, start it as soon as
possible and within 14 hours of a decision to admit, unless otherwise stated in
the population-specific recommendations (see the sections on interventions for
people with acute coronary syndromes or acute stroke or for acutely ill patients,
interventions for people with renal impairment, interventions for people with
cancer, interventions for people having palliative care, interventions for people
admitted to critical care, and interventions for people with psychiatric illness).
[2018]
Surgical and trauma patients
1.1.5 Assess all surgical and trauma patients to identify the risk of VTE and bleeding:
• as soon as possible after admission to hospital or by the time of the first
consultant review, or
• in accident and emergency, if they have not been admitted within 12 hours of
their arrival
• using a tool published by a national UK body, professional network or peer-
reviewed journal.
A tool commonly used to develop a treatment plan for surgical patients is the
Department of Health VTE risk assessment tool. (Reproduced with the

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
Government Licence.) [2018, amended 2021]
1.1.6 Balance the person's individual risk of VTE against their risk of bleeding when
deciding whether to offer pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to surgical and
trauma patients. [2018]
1.1.7 If using pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for surgical and trauma patients, start it
as soon as possible and within 14 hours of a decision to admit, unless otherwise
stated in the population-specific recommendations (see the sections on
interventions when using anaesthesia, interventions for people having
orthopaedic surgery, interventions for people having elective spinal surgery or
cranial surgery people with spinal injury, interventions for people with major
trauma, interventions for people having abdominal, thoracic or head and neck
surgery, and interventions for people having cardiac or vascular surgery). [2018]
Reassessment of risk of VTE and bleeding
1.1.8 Reassess all medical, surgical and trauma patients for risk of VTE and bleeding at
the point of consultant review or if their clinical condition changes. [2018]
Pregnant women and women who gave birth or had a miscarriage
or termination of pregnancy in the past 6 weeks
1.1.9 Assess all women on admission to hospital or a midwife-led unit if they are
pregnant or gave birth, had a miscarriage or had a termination of pregnancy in
the past 6 weeks, to identify their risk of VTE and bleeding. Use a tool published
by a national UK body, professional network or peer-reviewed journal. The most
commonly used tool is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists risk
assessment tool. (Reproduced from: Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists. Reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy
and the puerperium. Green-top Guideline No. 37a. London: RCOG, 2015, with the
permission of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.) [2018]
1.1.10 Reassess risk of VTE and bleeding, and assess the need for thromboprophylaxis

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
for all women:
• within 6 hours of giving birth, having a miscarriage or having a termination of
pregnancy or
• if their clinical condition changes and they:
－ are pregnant or
－ gave birth, had a miscarriage or had a termination of pregnancy within
the past 6 weeks. [2018]
1.2 Giving information and planning for discharge
1.2.1 On admission ensure that people understand the reason for having a risk
assessment for VTE and bleeding. [2018]
1.2.2 For people admitted to hospital who are at increased risk of VTE, give them and
their family members or carers (as appropriate) verbal and written information on
the following before offering VTE prophylaxis:
• the person's risks and possible consequences of VTE
• the importance of VTE prophylaxis and its possible side effects – for example,
pharmacological prophylaxis can increase bleeding risk
• the correct use of VTE prophylaxis – for example, anti-embolism stockings,
intermittent pneumatic compression
• how people can reduce their risk of VTE (such as keeping well hydrated and,
if possible, exercising and becoming more mobile). [2018]
1.2.3 Be aware that heparins are of animal origin and this may be of concern to some
people (See Religion or belief: a practical guide for the NHS). Discuss the
alternatives with people who have concerns about using animal products, after
discussing their suitability, advantages and disadvantages with the person.
[2018]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
1.2.4 As part of the discharge plan, give patients and their family members or carers
(as appropriate) verbal and written information on:
• the signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
embolism
• how people can reduce their risk of VTE (such as keeping well hydrated and,
if possible, exercising and becoming more mobile)
• the importance of seeking help if DVT, pulmonary embolism or other adverse
events are suspected. [2018]
1.2.5 Give people discharged with VTE prophylaxis and their family members or carers
(as appropriate) verbal and written information on:
• the importance of using VTE prophylaxis correctly (including the correct
administration and disposal of pharmacological prophylaxis)
• the importance of continuing treatment for the recommended duration
• the signs and symptoms of adverse events related to VTE prophylaxis
• the importance of seeking help and who to contact if people have problems
using VTE prophylaxis. [2018]
1.2.6 Ensure that people who are discharged with anti-embolism stockings:
• understand the benefits of wearing them
• understand the importance of wearing them correctly
• understand the need to remove them daily for hygiene purposes
• are able to remove and replace them, or have someone available who will be
able to do this for them
• know what to look for if there is a problem – for example, skin marking,
blistering or discolouration, particularly over the heels and bony prominences
• know who to contact if there is a problem
• know when to stop wearing them. [2018]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
1.2.7 Ensure that people who are discharged with pharmacological and/or mechanical
VTE prophylaxis are able to use it correctly, or have arrangements made for
someone to be available who will be able to help them. [2018]
1.2.8 Notify the person's GP if the person has been discharged with pharmacological
and/or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to be used at home. [2018]
1.3 All patients
Mechanical prophylaxis
1.3.1 Do not offer anti-embolism stockings to people who have:
• suspected or proven peripheral arterial disease
• peripheral arterial bypass grafting
• peripheral neuropathy or other causes of sensory impairment
• any local conditions in which anti-embolism stockings may cause damage –
for example, fragile 'tissue paper' skin, dermatitis, gangrene or recent skin
graft
• known allergy to material of manufacture
• severe leg oedema
• major limb deformity or unusual leg size or shape preventing correct fit.
Use caution and clinical judgement when applying anti-embolism stockings
over venous ulcers or wounds. [2010, amended 2018]
1.3.2 Ensure that people who need anti-embolism stockings have their legs measured
and that they are provided with the correct size of stocking. Anti-embolism
stockings should be fitted and patients shown how to use them by staff trained in
their use. [2010]
1.3.3 Ensure that people who develop oedema or postoperative swelling have their

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
legs re-measured and anti-embolism stockings refitted. [2010]
1.3.4 If arterial disease is suspected, seek expert opinion before fitting anti-embolism
stockings. [2010]
1.3.5 Use anti-embolism stockings that provide graduated compression and produce a
calf pressure of 14 mmHg to 15 mmHg. (This relates to a pressure of 14 mmHg to
18 mmHg at the ankle and is in line with the British Standard Institution's BS
661210:2018 Specification for graduated compression hosiery, anti-embolism
hosiery and graduated support hosiery.) [2010]
1.3.6 Encourage people to wear their anti-embolism stockings day and night until they
no longer have significantly reduced mobility. [2010]
1.3.7 Remove anti-embolism stockings daily for hygiene purposes and to inspect skin
condition. In people with a significant reduction in mobility, poor skin integrity or
any sensory loss, inspect the skin 2 or 3 times a day, particularly over the heels
and bony prominences. [2010]
1.3.8 Monitor the use of anti-embolism stockings and offer assistance if they are not
being worn correctly. [2010]
1.3.9 Stop the use of anti-embolism stockings if there is marking, blistering or
discolouration of the skin, particularly over the heels and bony prominences, or if
the person experiences pain or discomfort. If suitable, offer intermittent
pneumatic compression as an alternative. [2010, amended 2018]
1.3.10 Do not offer intermittent pneumatic compression to people with a known allergy
to the material of manufacture. [2010, amended 2018]
1.3.11 Advise the person to wear their device for as much time as possible. [2010,
amended 2018]
Pharmacological prophylaxis
1.3.12 For pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in people under 18, follow the

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
recommendations on apixaban, aspirin, dabigatran etexilate, fondaparinux
sodium, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and rivaroxaban in this guideline.
[2018]
In March 2018, the use of these drugs in young people under 18 was off label.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
All surgery
1.3.13 Advise people to consider stopping oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives or
hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before elective surgery. If stopped,
provide advice on alternative contraceptive methods. [2010]
Nursing care: early mobilisation and hydration
1.3.14 Encourage people to mobilise as soon as possible. [2010]
1.3.15 Do not allow people to become dehydrated unless clinically indicated. [2010]
People using antiplatelet agents
1.3.16 Consider VTE prophylaxis for people who are having antiplatelet agents for other
conditions and whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. Take into
account the risk of bleeding and of comorbidities such as arterial thrombosis.
• If the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding, consider pharmacological
VTE prophylaxis based on their condition or procedure.
• If the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of VTE, consider mechanical VTE
prophylaxis. [2018]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
People using anticoagulation therapy
1.3.17 Consider VTE prophylaxis for people at increased risk of VTE who are interrupting
anticoagulant therapy. [2018]
1.4 Interventions for people with acute coronary
syndromes or acute stroke or for acutely ill
patients
Acute coronary syndromes
1.4.1 Be aware that people receiving anticoagulant drugs as part of their treatment for
an acute coronary syndrome do not usually need VTE prophylaxis. See also the
recommendation in the section on people using anticoagulation therapy. [2018]
Acute stroke patients
1.4.2 Do not offer anti-embolism stockings for VTE prophylaxis to people who are
admitted for acute stroke. [2010, amended 2018]
1.4.3 Consider intermittent pneumatic compression for VTE prophylaxis for people who
are immobile and admitted with acute stroke. If using, start it within 3 days of
acute stroke. [2018]
1.4.4 Explain to the person admitted with acute stroke and their family members or
carers (as appropriate) that intermittent pneumatic compression:
• reduces the risk of DVT and may increase their chances of survival
• will not help them recover from stroke, and there may be an associated
increased risk of surviving with severe disability. [2018]
1.4.5 When using intermittent pneumatic compression for people who are admitted
with acute stroke, provide it for 30 days or until the person is mobile or

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
discharged, whichever is sooner. [2018]
Acutely ill medical patients
For guidance on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people with COVID-19 pneumonia
who are being treated in a hospital or community setting, see our COVID-19 rapid guideline
on managing COVID-19.
1.4.6 Offer pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for a minimum of 7 days to acutely ill
medical patients whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding:
• Use LMWH as first-line treatment.
• If LMWH is contraindicated, use fondaparinux sodium. [2018]
In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people
under 18 was off label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.5 Interventions for people with renal impairment
In March 2018, the use of LMWH in young people under 18 was off label. See NICE's
information on prescribing medicines.
1.5.1 If using pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people with renal impairment,
choose either LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH). [2018]
1.5.2 If needed, reduce the dose of LMWH and UFH for people with renal impairment.
Base the decision on multidisciplinary or senior opinion, or locally agreed
protocols. [2018]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
1.6 Interventions for people with cancer
In March 2018:
• the use of LMWH in young people under 18 in recommendations 1.6.2 and 1.6.3
was off label
• the use of aspirin in recommendation 1.6.2 was off label.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.6.1 Do not offer VTE prophylaxis to people with cancer who are receiving cancer-
modifying treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy and
who are mobile, except as outlined in recommendations 1.6.2 and 1.6.3, unless
they are also at increased risk of VTE because of something other than the
cancer. [2018]
1.6.2 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people with myeloma who are
receiving chemotherapy with thalidomide, pomalidomide or lenalidomide with
steroids. Choose either:
• aspirin (75 mg or 150 mg) or
• LMWH. [2018]
1.6.3 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with LMWH for people with pancreatic
cancer who are receiving chemotherapy. [2018]
1.6.4 If giving VTE prophylaxis to people with cancer (see recommendations 1.6.2
and 1.6.3), continue for as long as they are receiving chemotherapy. [2018]
1.7 Interventions for people having palliative care
1.7.1 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people who are having palliative
care. Take into account temporary increases in thrombotic risk factors, risk of
bleeding, likely life expectancy and the views of the person and their family

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
members or carers (as appropriate):
• Use LMWH as first-line treatment.
• If LMWH is contraindicated, use fondaparinux sodium. [2018]
In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people
under 18 was off label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.7.2 Do not offer VTE prophylaxis to people in the last days of life. [2018]
1.7.3 For recommendations on shared decision-making in the last days of life, see the
NICE guideline on care of dying adults in the last days of life. [2018]
1.7.4 Review VTE prophylaxis daily for people who are having palliative care, taking into
account the views of the person, their family members or carers (as appropriate)
and the multidisciplinary team. [2018]
1.8 Interventions for people admitted to critical
care
For guidance on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people with COVID-19 pneumonia
who are being treated in a hospital or community setting, see our COVID-19 rapid guideline
on managing COVID-19.
1.8.1 Assess all people admitted to the critical care unit for risk of VTE and bleeding.
[2018]
1.8.2 Provide LMWH to people admitted to the critical care unit if pharmacological VTE
prophylaxis is not contraindicated. For people with renal impairment, see the
recommendations on interventions for people with renal impairment. [2018]
In March 2018, the use of LMWH in young people under 18 was off label. See
NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.8.3 Consider mechanical VTE prophylaxis for people admitted to the critical care unit

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
if pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated based on their condition or
procedure. [2018]
1.8.4 If using mechanical VTE prophylaxis for people admitted to the critical care unit,
start it on admission and continue until the person no longer has reduced mobility
relative to their normal or anticipated mobility. [2018]
1.8.5 Reassess VTE and bleeding risk daily for people in critical care units. [2018]
1.8.6 Assess VTE and bleeding risk more than once a day in people admitted to the
critical care unit if the person's condition is changing rapidly. [2018]
1.9 Interventions for people with psychiatric illness
In March 2018:
• the use of LMWH in young people under 18 in recommendations 1.9.3 and 1.9.4
was off label
• the use of fondaparinux sodium in young people under 18 in recommendation
1.9.4 was off label.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.9.1 Assess all acute psychiatric patients to identify their risk of VTE and bleeding:
• as soon as possible after admission to hospital or by the time of the first
consultant review
• using a tool published by a national UK body, professional network or peer-
reviewed journal.
A tool commonly used to develop a treatment plan for surgical patients is the
Department of Health VTE risk assessment tool. (Reproduced with the
permission of the Department of Health and Social Care under the Open
Government Licence.) [2018, amended 2021]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
1.9.2 Reassess all people admitted to an acute psychiatric ward for risk of VTE and
bleeding at the point of consultant review or if their clinical condition changes.
[2018]
1.9.3 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with LMWH for people admitted to an
acute psychiatric ward whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. [2018]
1.9.4 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with fondaparinux sodium if LMWH is
contraindicated for people admitted to an acute psychiatric ward whose risk of
VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. [2018]
1.9.5 Continue pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people admitted to an acute
psychiatric ward until the person is no longer at increased risk of VTE. [2018]
1.10 Interventions when using anaesthesia
1.10.1 Consider regional anaesthesia for individual patients, in addition to other
methods of VTE prophylaxis, as it carries a lower risk of VTE than general
anaesthesia. Take into account the person's preferences, their suitability for
regional anaesthesia and any other planned method of VTE prophylaxis. [2010]
1.10.2 If regional anaesthesia is used, plan the timing of pharmacological VTE
prophylaxis to minimise the risk of epidural haematoma. If antiplatelet or
anticoagulant agents are being used, or their use is planned, refer to the
summary of product characteristics for guidance about the safety and timing of
these in relation to the use of regional anaesthesia. [2010]
1.10.3 Do not routinely offer pharmacological or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to people
undergoing a surgical procedure with local anaesthesia by local infiltration with
no limitation of mobility. [2010]

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
1.11 Interventions for people having orthopaedic
surgery
Lower limb immobilisation
1.11.1 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with LMWH or fondaparinux sodium
for people with lower limb immobilisation whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk
of bleeding. Consider stopping prophylaxis if lower limb immobilisation continues
beyond 42 days. [2018]
In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people
under 18 was off label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
Fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip and proximal femur
In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people under 18
in recommendations 1.11.2 and 1.11.3 was off label. See NICE's information on
prescribing medicines.
1.11.2 Offer VTE prophylaxis for a month to people with fragility fractures of the pelvis,
hip or proximal femur if the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding. Choose
either:
• LMWH, starting 6 to12 hours after surgery or
• fondaparinux sodium, starting 6 hours after surgery, providing there is low
risk of bleeding. [2018]
1.11.3 Consider pre-operative VTE prophylaxis for people with fragility fractures of the
pelvis, hip or proximal femur if surgery is delayed beyond the day after admission.
Give the last dose no less than 12 hours before surgery for LMWH or 24 hours
before surgery for fondaparinux sodium. [2018]
1.11.4 Consider intermittent pneumatic compression for people with fragility fractures of

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
the pelvis, hip or proximal femur at the time of admission if pharmacological
prophylaxis is contraindicated. Continue until the person no longer has
significantly reduced mobility relative to their normal or anticipated mobility.
[2018]
Elective hip replacement
In March 2018:
• the use of LMWH and rivaroxaban in young people under 18 in recommendation
1.11.5 was off label
• the use of aspirin in recommendation 1.11.5 was off label
• the use of apixaban and dabigatran etexilate in young people under 18 in
recommendation 1.11.6 was off label.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.11.5 Offer VTE prophylaxis to people undergoing elective hip replacement surgery
whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. Choose any one of:
• LMWH for 10 days followed by aspirin (75 mg or 150 mg) for a further
28 days.
• LMWH for 28 days combined with anti-embolism stockings (until discharge).
• Rivaroxaban, which is recommended as an option in NICE technology
appraisal guidance for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults after
elective hip replacement surgery. For full details, see the guidance on
rivaroxaban (TA170, 2009). [2018]
1.11.6 Consider one of the following if none of the options in recommendation 1.11.5 can
be used:
• Apixaban, which is recommended as an option in NICE technology appraisal
guidance for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults after elective hip

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
replacement surgery. For full details, see the guidance on apixaban (TA245,
2012).
• Dabigatran etexilate, which is recommended as an option in NICE technology
appraisal guidance for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults after
elective hip replacement surgery. For full details, see the guidance on
dabigatran etexilate (TA157, 2008). [2018]
1.11.7 Consider anti-embolism stockings until discharge from hospital if
pharmacological interventions are contraindicated in people undergoing elective
hip replacement surgery. [2018]
Elective knee replacement

Terms used in this guideline
Admission
Admission in the context of this guideline refers to admission as an inpatient, where a bed
is provided for 1 or more nights, or admission as a day patient, where a bed is provided for
a procedure including surgery or chemotherapy but not for an overnight stay.
Discharge
Discharge in the context of this guideline refers to discharge from hospital as an inpatient
or after a day procedure.
Intermittent pneumatic compression
A method of prophylaxis that includes an air pump and inflatable garments in a system
designed to improve venous circulation in the lower limbs of people at risk of DVT or
pulmonary embolism. The inflation–deflation cycle of intermittent pneumatic compression
therapy simulates the thigh, calf and foot's normal ambulatory pump action increasing
both the volume and rate of blood flow, eliminating venous stasis and replicating the
effects of the natural muscle pump. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be
thigh- or knee-length sleeves that are wrapped around the leg, or a garment that can be
wrapped around or worn on the foot that is designed to mimic the actions of walking.
Lower limb immobilisation
Any clinical decision taken to manage the affected limb in a way that would prevent normal
weight-bearing status or use of that limb, or both.
Renal impairment
People with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2.
For more detailed information on renal impairment, see the NICE guideline on chronic
kidney disease in adults.

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
Significantly reduced mobility
People who are bed bound, unable to walk unaided or likely to spend a substantial
proportion of their day in bed or in a chair.

Recommendations for research
The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. The
committee's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.
1 Risk assessment
What is the accuracy of individual risk assessment tools in predicting the risk of venous
thromboembolism (VTE) and risk of bleeding in people admitted to hospital?
Why this is important
Risk assessment is a mandatory for all people admitted or having day procedures in
hospital. Since 2010, the National VTE Risk Assessment Tool has been widely used in the
NHS to assess a person's risk of VTE. This tool has not been validated or tested against
other tools to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy or effectiveness at correctly identifying
people at risk of VTE. There is concern that the tool may not accurately identify those who
are most likely to get VTE.
According to national figures, over 70% of medical patients in the UK have prophylaxis
when the national tool has been used, with some trusts offering prophylaxis to over 90% of
medical patients. Around 40% of medical patients have prophylaxis in largely US-based
populations when other tools are used (although this may partially relate to different
indications for hospital admission). It is not known if this means that the national tool
identifies too many people or the other tools do not identify enough. The potential impact
of giving unnecessary prophylaxis is that people may be at increased risk of bleeding and
discomfort through repeated injections. There is also the potential for reducing the cost of
thromboprophylaxis by better defining 'at risk' populations, so that the number of those
given thromboprophylaxis is reduced.
2 Dose strategies for people who are obese
What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of weight-based dose-adjustment strategies of
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) compared with fixed-dose strategies of LMWH for
preventing VTE in people who are very obese (BMI over 35) who are admitted to hospital

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
or having day procedures (including surgery and chemotherapy)?
Why this is important
Obesity is on the rise in England. The prevalence of obesity increased by 11% between
1993 and 2014 (15% in 1993 and 26% in 2014), which has resulted in more obese people
being admitted to hospital. Obesity may as much as double a person's risk of developing
hospital-acquired VTE, therefore most obese people will need prophylaxis. There is much
uncertainty about what dose to use and the clinical and cost effectiveness of using
weight-based dose-adjustment versus fixed-dose strategies. In current practice, a higher
than usual dose is given but this may not be necessary, especially if the person has
obesity-related liver disease. Several studies have reported effectiveness in terms of
biological measures rather than clinical outcomes such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
bleeding events. It is important that there is a clearer understanding of the effects that
different dose strategies can have in terms of clinical outcomes. This is because they can
directly influence the quality of life of obese people admitted to hospital and help inform
clinical decisions on patient care.
3 Direct oral anticoagulants for people with lower
limb immobilisation
What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants for preventing VTE
in people with lower limb immobilisation?
Why this is important
The Computerized registry of patients with venous thromboembolism (RIETE) study, a
multicentre prospective cohort study of 30,886 patients with acute VTE, estimated that
5.7% of VTE events were associated with lower limb immobilisation for non-major
orthopaedic surgery. Estimates of DVT risk in people with lower limb immobilisation, based
on meta-analyses of trials comparing chemothromboprophylaxis with placebo, range
between approximately 4% and 40%. Given that lower limb immobilisation following trauma
or non-major orthopaedic surgery is so common, the consequent burden of disease from
VTE from this cause in the whole population is very considerable. For example, the annual
incidence of ankle fracture is 187 per 100,000, translating to over 120,000 incident
fractures per year in the UK. If 10% of these fractures are complicated by VTE, then we
might expect approximately 12,000 events per year only related to immobilisation following

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
ankle trauma.
Despite this burden of ill-health, no randomised studies comparing modern anticoagulants
that are available in oral preparations (perhaps more suitable for outpatient treatments)
with established treatments such as LMWH or fondaparinux were identified in the
evidence review. The committee were unable to make a recommendation to consider oral
anticoagulants for this patient group given this lack of evidence.
4 Aspirin prophylaxis for people with fragility
fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal femur
What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of aspirin alone versus other pharmacological
and/or mechanical prophylaxis strategies (alone or in combination) for people with fragility
fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal femur?
Why this is important
Fragility fractures are the greatest burden of musculoskeletal disease in hospitals in the
UK. There are approximately 70,000 fragility hip fractures per year in England alone
leading to 1.5 million bed days being used each year, which equates with the continuous
occupation of over 4,000 NHS beds.
Current evidence supports a recommendation for prophylaxis with LMWH or fondaparinux.
Both involve a subcutaneous injection for 28 days requiring either self-injection at home or
a community nurse attending to deliver the injection. Patient adherence to treatment may
be improved with an oral rather than injectable treatment.
A large but controversially reported trial suggests that aspirin may be at least as effective
as currently recommended treatments. However, because of methodological and reporting
limitations, the evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin alone is not clear. There is
potentially a large cost saving if aspirin is clinically effective because it is very inexpensive.
5 Duration of prophylaxis for elective total hip
replacement surgery
What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of standard versus extended duration

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
pharmacological prophylaxis for preventing VTE in people undergoing elective total hip
replacement surgery?
Why this is important
In 2015, there were 84,462 hip replacements in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
current recommended duration of prophylaxis is 28 days in the elective total hip
replacement population. This extended duration of prophylaxis is based on few, small and
older trials. The quality of the evidence supporting extended duration prophylaxis is very
low. Modern pharmaceutical trials of newer interventions use extended duration
prophylaxis based on these historical data, with the added incentive of more expensive
prophylaxis strategies. There is a large potential cost saving if a shorter duration of
prophylaxis is as clinically effective, given the considerable cost of prophylaxis and the
number of people for whom it is prescribed.

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
Context
Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE), also known as hospital-acquired or
hospital-associated thrombosis (HAT), covers all VTE that occurs in hospital and within
90 days after a hospital admission. It is a common and potentially preventable problem.
VTE most frequently occurs in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis (a deep vein thrombosis
[DVT]). If it dislodges and travels to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolism, which in
some cases can be fatal.
Hospital-acquired VTE accounts for thousands of deaths annually in the NHS, and fatal
pulmonary embolism remains a common cause of in-hospital mortality. HAT accounts for
50% to 60% of all VTE seen. In 2013 to 2014, there were around 24,700 admissions for
pulmonary embolism and 19,400 for DVT in England. In 2013 in England and Wales, there
were 2,191 deaths recorded as due to pulmonary embolism and 2,816 due to DVT.
Treatment of non-fatal symptomatic VTE and related long-term morbidities is associated
with a considerable cost to the health service.
People admitted to hospital or mental health units have varying risk factors for VTE. The
spectrum of VTE risk is broad, and understanding the scale of the problem has led to a
paradigm shift in preventing and managing VTE in the NHS. In particular, patients now
undergo VTE risk assessment as a routine event in all NHS care pathways. By July 2013,
96% of adult admissions to NHS-funded acute care hospitals were risk assessed for VTE
compared with less than 50% of patients in July 2010.
VTE prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of DVT. It includes mechanical
methods (such as anti-embolism stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression
devices), and pharmacological treatments (such as heparin and other anticoagulant
drugs).
This guideline is about reducing the risk of VTE in over 16s admitted to or treated as day
procedures in hospitals. It provides recommendations on the most clinically and cost-
effective measures to reduce the risk of VTE, while considering the potential risks of the
various VTE prophylaxis options and patient preferences. It highlights the importance of
risk assessment for VTE and for bleeding for all people being admitted and of clinical
judgement in deciding on a prophylaxis strategy for each person at risk.
The 2018 update takes into account newer evidence and newer therapies and has been

Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (NG89)
made more relevant for specific groups such as surgical sub-specialities, people with
mental health conditions and pregnant women.
