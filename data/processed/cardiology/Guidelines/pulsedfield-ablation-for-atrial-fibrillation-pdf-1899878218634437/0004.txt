Pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation

deep sedation is often used in other countries. As in other catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation, a catheter is inserted into the femoral vein and advanced into the left atrium through a trans-septal puncture. The PFA catheter delivers rapid, high-voltage pulsed electric field energy to the tissue it is applied to. This causes pores to form in myocardial cells so they die (irreversible electroporation). PFA is currently used most for isolation of abnormal electrical activity transmitted through the pulmonary vein cells at the entrance to the left atrium. But it is also used on other structures such as the left atrial posterior wall and cavo-tricuspid isthmus. The aim is targeted destruction and scar formation in the tissue it is applied to, to disrupt the transmission of abnormal electrical impulses that cause atrial fibrillation while avoiding damage to surrounding tissues such as nerves and blood vessels. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 19 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The prioritised evidence included 4 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 2
