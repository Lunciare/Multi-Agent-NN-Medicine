Pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation

1 Recommendations 1.1 Use pulsed-field ablation as an option to treat atrial fibrillation with standard arrangements in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. 1.2 Clinicians should enter details about everyone having the procedure onto the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) database and review local clinical outcomes. Why the committee made these recommendations Evidence shows the procedure reduces atrial fibrillation and its symptoms, increases quality of life in the short term, and raises no major safety concerns. More data collection would be useful to guide patient selection and to see how well the procedure works to prevent long-term complications of atrial fibrillation, such as stroke. 2 The condition, current treatments, unmet need and procedure The condition 2.1 Atrial fibrillation is an irregular contraction of the upper chambers of the heart (atria) and often causes the heart to beat rapidly. This makes the heart less effective at moving blood from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. Symptoms include palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue and chest pain. It can have a substantial effect on quality of life. Complications of atrial fibrillation include stroke and heart failure. Atrial fibrillation can be transient (paroxysmal), lasting longer than 30
