Pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation

is associated with age, underlying heart disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension, which are also increasing in prevalence in the UK population. If left untreated, it is a significant risk factor for stroke, other morbidities and mortality. When standard medications do not work or are unsuitable, catheter ablation procedures are commonly offered. Most catheter ablation methods use thermal energy, by either burning (in RFA) or freezing (in CBA) heart tissue that conducts the irregular electrical impulses. Thermal ablation carries a risk of damaging neighbouring tissues. Pulsed-field ablation (PFA) uses electric field energy instead of thermal energy. Heart cells are very sensitive to electric field energy. So, it may be able to target heart tissue more precisely than thermal ablation, which may reduce the risk of damaging surrounding tissues like the oesophagus, nerves, and blood vessels. The procedure 2.4 PFA is a catheter ablation technique that uses electric field energy to destroy the heart cells that transmit abnormal electrical impulses. In the NHS, the procedure is usually done under general anaesthesia, but deep sedation is often used in other countries. As in other catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation, a catheter is inserted into the femoral vein and advanced into the left
