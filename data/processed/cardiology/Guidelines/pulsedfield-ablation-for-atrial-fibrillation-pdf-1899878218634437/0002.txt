Pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation

pain. It can have a substantial effect on quality of life. Complications of atrial fibrillation include stroke and heart failure. Atrial fibrillation can be transient (paroxysmal), lasting longer than 30 seconds but only up to 7 days, or it can be persistent, lasting more than 7 days. Current treatments 2.2 Standard treatments for symptomatic atrial fibrillation include lifestyle modification, drug therapy and procedural interventions. The aim of treatment is to prevent complications like stroke and alleviate symptoms. Drug treatments include anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke, and antiarrhythmics to restore or maintain the normal heart rhythm or to slow the heart rate. When medications do not work or are unsuitable, other treatments such as catheter ablation procedures may be used. The current standard catheter ablation techniques are radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoballoon ablation (CBA). Laser balloon ablation is rarely used in the NHS. Unmet need 2.3 Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting about 2% of the adult population. The prevalence is likely increasing because it is associated with age, underlying heart disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension, which are also increasing in prevalence in the UK population. If left untreated, it is a significant risk factor
