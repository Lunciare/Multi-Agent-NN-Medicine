Pulsed-field ablation for atrial fibrillation

3.4 Sixteen commentaries from people who have had this procedure and a submission from a patient organisation were discussed by the committee. Committee comments 3.5 There are different types of catheter and generators with varying amounts of evidence. The evidence may not be transferable between technologies because of their differences. 3.6 People may have to continue taking anticoagulation medication after the procedure. 3.7 Results may be different for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation. 3.8 The procedure may need to be repeated. 3.9 The procedure is most commonly done under general anaesthesia in the UK. 3.10 The procedure may be associated with less damage to adjacent structures and less post-procedure discomfort than other types of ablation. 3.11 The committee was told that pulsed-field ablation targets heart tissue more specifically than thermal ablation.
