Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management

criteria or score A method of assessing whether a person has FH. It is based on personal and family medical history, clinical signs, LDL-C concentration and DNA testing. A score is attributed to each component; the higher the score, the higher the likelihood of the person having FH. Family history The structure and relationships within the family that relates information about diseases in family members. First-degree relative A person's biological parents, brothers and sisters, and children. Heterozygous FH High LDL-C concentration in the blood caused by an inherited mutation from 1 parent only. People with FH are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. High-intensity statin The following doses for statins are high intensity, based on the percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol they can produce: • atorvastatin: 20 mg to 80 mg • rosuvastatin: 10 mg to 40 mg Homozygous FH Very high LDL-C concentration in the blood caused by an inherited mutation from both parents. When a person inherits exactly the same affected gene from both parents this is called truly 'homozygous' FH. When the mutations in the LDL receptor gene (or equivalent) are different, this state is called 'compound heterozygous'. In general, the overall effect in both
