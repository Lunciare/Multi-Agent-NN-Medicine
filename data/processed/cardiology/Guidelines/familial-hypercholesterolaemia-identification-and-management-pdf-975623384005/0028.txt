Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management

is called truly 'homozygous' FH. When the mutations in the LDL receptor gene (or equivalent) are different, this state is called 'compound heterozygous'. In general, the overall effect in both states is similar, in that LDL-C concentrations are very high. Both groups of patients have the same clinical pattern and high risk of cardiovascular disease. For clinical purposes, both homozygous FH and compound heterozygous FH can be regarded as behaving in a similar manner. Therefore, for the purposes of this guideline the term 'homozygous FH' is used to also encompass compound heterozygous FH. Index individual (synonymous with 'proband') The original patient who is the starting point for follow-up of other members of a family when investigating for possible causative genetic factors of the presenting condition. Lipid measurements, concentrations and levels These terms refer to the measurement of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C. LDL-C is not usually measured directly but calculated from the TC, TGs and HDL-C, ideally using a fasting sample. Such tests are usually done in a clinical biochemistry laboratory. Mutation An identified change in the DNA sequence of a gene that is predicted to damage the normal function of the gene
