research recommendations, on secondary care case finding, cascade testing and the use of clinical scoring criteria. One research recommendation on identification using clinical registers was removed. Details can be found in the evidence reviews. 1 Using different thresholds of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in primary care case finding What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using different thresholds of LDL-C concentration in primary care case finding? Why this is important The clinical community recognises that FH is underdiagnosed, with prevalence more likely to be approximately 1 in 250 rather than the widely cited 1 in 500. Searching electronic primary care databases is an effective way of identifying people with FH. One of the ways in which people are identified through electronic primary care database searching is to search using total cholesterol or LDL-C concentration. Currently, the entire evidence base for identifying cohorts of people with FH through primary care case finding uses a total cholesterol concentration cut-off of 9.3 mmol/l. This is a very high concentration and anecdotal evidence suggests that this identifies older people but may miss younger people with FH. This could lead to missed opportunities to identify and treat people with FH at an earlier age.
