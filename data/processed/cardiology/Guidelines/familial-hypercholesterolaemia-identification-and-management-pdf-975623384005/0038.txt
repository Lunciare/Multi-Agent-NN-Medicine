testing, IMT or calcification over time. Consideration should also be given to the feasibility of conducting a long-term randomised trial to compare the differences in morbidity or mortality attributable to early diagnosis using routine monitoring or symptom-based investigation. [2008] Context In some people, a high cholesterol concentration in the blood is caused by an inherited genetic defect known as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). A raised cholesterol concentration in the blood is present from birth and may lead to early development of atherosclerotic disease like coronary heart disease. The disease shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, being transmitted from generation to generation in such a way that siblings and children of a person with FH have a 50% risk of inheriting FH. Most people with FH have inherited a defective gene for FH from only 1 parent and are therefore heterozygous. Rarely, a person will inherit a genetic defect from both parents and will have homozygous FH or compound heterozygous FH, which will be collectively termed homozygous FH for the purpose of this guideline. The prevalence of heterozygous FH in the UK population is estimated to be somewhere between 1 in 250 and 1 in 500, which means that between approximately
