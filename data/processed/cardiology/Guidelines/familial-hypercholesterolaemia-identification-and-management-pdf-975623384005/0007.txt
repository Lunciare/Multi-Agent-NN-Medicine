concentration from the baseline measurement. [2017] 1.3.1.3 The dose of statin should be increased to the maximum licensed or tolerated dose to achieve a recommended reduction in LDL-C concentration of greater than 50% from baseline (that is, LDL-C concentration before treatment). [2008] 1.3.1.4 Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary heterozygous-familial hypercholesterolaemia in adults in whom initial statin therapy is contraindicated. [2016] 1.3.1.5 Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary heterozygous-familial hypercholesterolaemia in adults who cannot tolerate statin therapy (as defined in recommendation 1.3.1.9). [2016] 1.3.1.6 Ezetimibe, co-administered with initial statin therapy, is recommended as an option for treating primary (heterozygous-familial) hypercholesterolaemia in adults who have started statin therapy when: • serum total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration is not appropriately controlled (as defined in recommendation 1.3.1.8) either after appropriate dose titration of initial statin therapy or because dose titration is limited by intolerance to the initial statin therapy (as defined in recommendation 1.3.1.9) and • a change from initial statin therapy to an alternative statin is being considered. [2016] 1.3.1.7 When prescribing ezetimibe co-administered with a statin, ezetimibe should be prescribed on the basis of lowest acquisition cost. [2016] 1.3.1.8 For the
