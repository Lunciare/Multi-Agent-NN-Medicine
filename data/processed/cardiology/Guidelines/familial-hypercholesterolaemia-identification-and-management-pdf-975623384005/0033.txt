Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management

suggests that this identifies older people but may miss younger people with FH. This could lead to missed opportunities to identify and treat people with FH at an earlier age. Research is needed to identify whether using different total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations to identify people with FH through primary care database searching affects the diagnostic yield of FH. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the ethnicity, age and triglyceride concentration of people with FH identified through primary care database searching. These should be included as outcomes in future research. [2017] 2 Long-term monitoring of sub-clinical atherosclerosis in children with FH who are treated with statin therapy What are the long-term effects of statin therapy on sub-clinical atherosclerosis in children with FH who are treated with statin therapy? Why this is important Although statins are increasing in use, there is still a lack of data on the long-term effects of statins in children. It is particularly important to determine any long-term adverse effects of statin treatment in a population with FH, as people generally take statins for the rest of their lives once treatment starts.
