Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management

excluded FH in a member of a family, healthcare professionals should manage the person's coronary heart disease risk as in the general population (see NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification). [2008] 1.1.15 In children aged 0 to 10 years at risk of FH because of 1 affected parent, offer a DNA test at the earliest opportunity. If testing of a child at risk has not been undertaken by the age of 10 years, offer an additional opportunity for a DNA test. [2017] 1.1.16 In children at risk of homozygous FH because of 2 affected parents or because of the presence of clinical signs, for example, cutaneous lipid deposits (xanthomata), LDL-C concentration should be measured before the age of 5 years or at the earliest opportunity thereafter. If the LDL-C concentration is greater than 11 mmol/l then a clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH should be considered. [2008] 1.2 Identifying people with FH using cascade testing 1.2.1 Carry out cascade testing using DNA testing to identify affected first- and second- and, when possible, third-degree biological relatives of people with a genetic diagnosis of FH. [2017] 1.2.2 Healthcare professionals should offer all people with FH a referral
