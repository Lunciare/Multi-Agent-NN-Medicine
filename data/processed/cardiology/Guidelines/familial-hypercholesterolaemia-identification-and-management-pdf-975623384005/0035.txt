growth and pubertal development. [2008] 4 LDL apheresis for people with heterozygous FH What are the appropriate indications, effectiveness and safety of LDL apheresis in people with heterozygous FH? Why this is important There is limited evidence to inform specific indications for LDL apheresis in people with heterozygous FH. In addition, there is limited published evidence on the cardiovascular outcome of such patients treated with LDL apheresis. Evidence on the value of investigations (various measures of vascular status, considered to reflect the extent or activity of atherosclerotic vascular disease of the coronary arteries) in predicting outcome from LDL apheresis should ideally be based on evidence from randomised controlled trials with clinical outcomes. It is difficult to identify a suitable alternative treatment because LDL apheresis is generally only considered in people for whom no other treatment is available. One comparator may be novel therapies with antisense oligonucleotides (ApoB). A national register should be established for all people with FH who are referred for and/or are undergoing LDL apheresis. Data should be collected on the natural history of FH and the temporal relationship of clinical and vascular features in relation to treatments and other parameters.
