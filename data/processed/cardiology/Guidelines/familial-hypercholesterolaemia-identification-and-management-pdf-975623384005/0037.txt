feasible research method to address these questions is an observational longitudinal study following women with FH and other women (not diagnosed with FH) using statins through their pregnancies using a national register. [2008] 6 Cardiovascular evaluation for people with FH What is the utility of routine cardiovascular evaluation for asymptomatic people with FH? Why this is important Because of their inherent high risk of developing premature coronary heart disease, a low threshold of suspicion for coronary disease is recommended for people with FH. Routine monitoring to detect sub-clinical atherosclerosis should be non-invasive, sensitive, specific and cost effective. Research to assess the prevalence of both asymptomatic coronary and non-coronary atherosclerosis in people with definite heterozygous FH is required. As well as exercise, electrocardiogram (ECG) testing followed by stress echocardiography before possible angiography in people with an abnormal exercise test and ankle brachial pressure measures, research should include MRI in addition to other modalities such as carotid IMT and coronary calcification. Outcomes should include changes in exercise ECG or ankle brachial pressure testing, IMT or calcification over time. Consideration should also be given to the feasibility of conducting a long-term randomised trial to compare the differences in morbidity or mortality attributable to
