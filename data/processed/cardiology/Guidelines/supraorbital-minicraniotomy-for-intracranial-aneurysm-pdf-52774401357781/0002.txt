Supraorbital minicraniotomy for intracranial aneurysm

across the neck of the aneurysm (effectively closing the neck of the balloon) to separate it from the normal vessel while preserving blood flow to the brain. If clipping is not possible, the aneurysm may be reinforced by wrapping it with synthetic material to reduce the risk of rupture. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Supraorbital minicraniotomy is an alternative approach through a smaller incision made above the eyebrow and through the underlying skull. This allows a front-on approach to the abnormal vessels. The aneurysm is then clipped or wrapped using conventional microsurgical instruments. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 No controlled studies were identified. In two studies, all the aneurysms were either successfully clipped or wrapped, but length of follow-up was not reported. In another study, 89% (33 out of 37 patients) showed good recovery on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, but it was not clear how many of the patients were followed up for the entire duration of the study (17 months). This study also reported good cosmetic outcomes following surgery. For more details, see the overview. 2.3.2 One Specialist Advisor considered it unlikely that the efficacy of treating an aneurysm would be affected by the small exposure used in this procedure
