Supraorbital minicraniotomy for intracranial aneurysm

more details, see the overview. 2.3.2 One Specialist Advisor considered it unlikely that the efficacy of treating an aneurysm would be affected by the small exposure used in this procedure when compared with the standard surgical approach. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 In the three case series reviewed, rupture of the aneurysm during surgery occurred in 3% (4 out of 139), 2% (2 out of 102) and 3% (1 out of 37) of patients. Other adverse events were: death within 8 days of surgery (4%, 4 out of 102); central nervous system infection (2%, 2 out of 102); impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation requiring shunting (7%, 7 out of 102); supraorbital nerve damage (11%, 4 out of 37); and wound infection (3%, 1 out of 37). For more details, see the overview. 2.4.2 The Specialist Advisors had no major safety concerns. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 This procedure involves a different surgical approach for performing an established procedure (craniotomy for intracranial aneurysm) and, although there may be a greater risk of per-operative rupture, this has usually been managed successfully. 2.5.2 There is an increasing trend to deal with aneurysms by endoluminal techniques. 3 Further information Sources of evidence The evidence considered by the Interventional
