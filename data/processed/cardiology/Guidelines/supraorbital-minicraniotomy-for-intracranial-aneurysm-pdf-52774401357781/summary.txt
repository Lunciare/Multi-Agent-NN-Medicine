1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of supraorbital minicraniotomy for intracranial aneurysm appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Cerebral aneurysms are small balloon-like dilated portions of blood vessels that may occasionally rupture, causing haemorrhage, stroke or death. Therapy is designed to support recovery from the initial bleed, together with specific treatment to prevent re-bleeding. 2.1.2 The majority of cerebral aneurysms arise from the major blood vessels in the centre of the head as they cross the space between the skull and the brain (the subarachnoid space). The standard surgical approach to this area is through an incision in the scalp, just in front of the ear, and an opening in the underlying bone on the side of the head. The abnormal vessels are approached side-on in the subarachnoid space beneath the brain.
