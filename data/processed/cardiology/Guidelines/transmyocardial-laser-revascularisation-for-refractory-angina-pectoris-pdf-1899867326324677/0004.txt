Transmyocardial laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris

follow-up. 2.3.4 Five RCTs measured quality of life with different instruments. One RCT showed no significant difference between TMLR-treated patients and patients treated with thoracic sympathectomy, while the other 4 RCTs found significant improvements in quality of life for TMLR-treated patients compared with those treated medically (significance not stated). None of the studies had blinded patients to their treatment. 2.3.5 Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as angina severity reduction, exercise capacity improvement, reduced medicine use and increased quality of life. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs indicated no difference in postoperative mortality between TMLR-treated patients and controls treated medically or with CABG (pooled OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.7). However, when 2 trials comparing TMLR plus CABG against CABG alone were excluded, postoperative mortality was greater in TMLR-treated patients than controls (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.93). 2.4.2 In 7 RCTs the subsequent myocardial infarction rate was higher in TMLR-treated patients than in controls (6% [41 of 633] compared with 2% [11 of 651]; follow-up period 12 months; significance not stated). 2.4.3 An RCT of 100 patients reported that postoperative heart failure occurred more frequently in TMLR-treated patients (34% [17 of 50]) than in medically
