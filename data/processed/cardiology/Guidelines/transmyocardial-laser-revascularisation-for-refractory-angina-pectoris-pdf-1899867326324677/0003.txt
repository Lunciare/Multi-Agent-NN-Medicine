Transmyocardial laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris

patients treated either with TMLR or medically reported that myocardial contractility (assessed with stress echocardiography or single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]; lower value indicating worse function) was significantly lower in TMLR-treated patients (1.49±0.44) than those treated medically (1.56±0.47) at 12-month follow-up (p<0.05). Six other RCTs found no significant difference in myocardial perfusion (examined with stress testing or perfusion scanning) in TMLR-treated patients, compared with patients treated medically. A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (total 323 patients) reported greater mean improvement (from baseline) in total exercise time in TMLR-treated patients compared with those treated medically at 6-month follow-up (pooled mean difference 120.1 seconds; 95% CI 4.5 to 235.7). 2.3.3 A meta-analysis of 3 studies (total 135 patients) reported an improvement from baseline in angina score (measured using four-point scales) in TMLR-treated patients compared with those treated medically, with a reduction in mean difference in angina score between TMLR and non-TMLR treatment groups of -1.8 (95% CI -2.4 to -1.1) at 6-month follow-up and -1.0 (95% CI -1.7 to -0.3) at 12-month follow-up. 2.3.4 Five RCTs measured quality of life with different instruments. One RCT showed no significant difference between TMLR-treated patients and patients treated with thoracic sympathectomy, while the other 4
