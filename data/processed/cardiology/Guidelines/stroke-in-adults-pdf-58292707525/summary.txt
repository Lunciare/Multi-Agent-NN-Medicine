Quality statement Adults presenting at an accident and emergency (A&E) department with suspected stroke are admitted to a specialist acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival. [2010, updated 2016] Rationale Specialist acute stroke units are associated with improved patient safety due to better outcomes, such as reduced disability and mortality, because of the range of specialist treatments they provide. Admission to these units should be within 4 hours of arrival at A&E, so that treatment can begin as quickly as possible, and to help prevent complications. Some adults with acute stroke may need treatment in higher-level units, such as high dependency or intensive care units. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly.
