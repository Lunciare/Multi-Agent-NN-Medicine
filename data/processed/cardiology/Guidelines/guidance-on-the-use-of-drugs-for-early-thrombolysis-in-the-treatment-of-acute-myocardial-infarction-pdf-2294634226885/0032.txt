Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

tenecteplase in terms of clinical effectiveness or cost effectiveness in pre-hospital settings, the committee considered that either reteplase or tenecteplase could be used in these settings, provided that the necessary infrastructure and training is provided to fully establish an appropriate model of pre-hospital thrombolytic administration. 4.3.2.4 Given the risks associated with thrombolytic drugs and the fact that pre-hospital administration is an emerging practice in England and Wales, the committee considered it important to ensure high-quality training and supervision of staff involved in the administration of thrombolysis. It was also considered important that clinicians and organisations delivering pre-hospital thrombolysis should develop clear clinical protocols for the use of thrombolytic drugs, such as those developed by the JRCALC, and adopt robust clinical governance arrangements to monitor the use of and outcomes associated with these drugs. 5 Proposed recommendations for further research 5.1 In light of the ongoing introduction of pre-hospital thrombolysis, it is recommended that opportunities for the evaluation of the administration of thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings are explored. 6 Resource impact for the NHS 6.1 Using estimates of the total number of people receiving thrombolysis and the mixture of thrombolytic drugs used, current annual spending on thrombolytic drugs in England
