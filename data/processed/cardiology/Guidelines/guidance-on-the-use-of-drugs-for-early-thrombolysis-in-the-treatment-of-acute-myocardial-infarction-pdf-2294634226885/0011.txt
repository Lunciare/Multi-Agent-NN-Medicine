CCU • direct admission to CCU. Pre-hospital models include: • community hospital administration (nurse or general practitioner) • general practitioner administration (at the point of contact) • telemetry-supported paramedic administration • autonomous paramedic administration. 4 Evidence The appraisal committee reviewed the evidence from a number of sources. 4.1 Clinical effectiveness 4.1.1 In-hospital thrombolysis 4.1.1.1 Fourteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thrombolytic drugs were included in the review. Overall the studies were considered to be of excellent quality. In total, the trials involved over 142,000 patients, and 5 of the trials included over 10,000 patients each. The trials had similar inclusion criteria in terms of age (usually less than 70 or 75 years), ECG changes, duration of symptoms, and presentation within 6 hours of symptom onset. Five of the trials included between 12% and 26% of patients aged over 70 to 75 years. Women were under-represented in all of the studies. Primary endpoints included 30-day mortality, 90-minute artery patency/flow rates and left ventricular function. Secondary endpoints included bleeding, stroke, congestive heart failure, reinfarction, allergy and anaphylaxis. The results of the trials were also pooled in a meta-analysis. 4.1.1.2 No direct trial comparisons between tenecteplase and streptokinase or between tenecteplase and reteplase
