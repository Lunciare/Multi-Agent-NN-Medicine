Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

(ASSENT-2). However, compared with streptokinase, the newer drugs may also be associated with a lower incidence of congestive heart failure. In addition, allergic reactions are more common with streptokinase than with the other drugs, and major bleeds (leading to transfusions) may also be more common with streptokinase, although the evidence on this is not consistent across the trials. There is also some evidence that tenecteplase may be associated with lower rates of major bleeds and heart failure than accelerated alteplase. 4.1.2 Pre-hospital thrombolysis 4.1.2.1 No RCTs were found comparing the different thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings. 4.1.2.2 However, 9 RCTs and a systematic review investigating the feasibility, safety and efficacy of pre-hospital administration of thrombolysis compared with hospital administration were considered in the context of the appraisal. A number of other papers reporting non-randomised studies and audits of pre-hospital thrombolysis were also considered in relation to practical and implementation issues. 4.1.2.3 The RCTs were small, except for one that included over 5,000 patients (EMIP). They were undertaken in a mixture of urban and/or rural settings in Israel, continental Europe, Canada, the USA, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. A variety of thrombolytic drugs were studied – 4 studies used alteplase, 4 used
