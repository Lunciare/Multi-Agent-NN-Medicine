Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

the cost effectiveness of different thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings were found. 4.2.2.2 There is a published economic analysis of the GREAT study comparing cost effectiveness of pre-hospital and in-hospital thrombolysis (that is, the cost effectiveness of the different drugs), which found that pre-hospital delivery had an incremental cost per life saved of £3,890. The sensitivity analysis found that the cost per life saved could increase to £88,000. It should also be borne in mind that the benefits found in the GREAT trial were larger than those found in other studies, the economic analysis was not undertaken alongside the trial, the interventions were not described in detail, and the model of rural Scottish general practitioner care is unlikely to be applicable throughout the NHS in England and Wales. 4.2.2.3 In the pre-hospital setting, Roche's model assumes that reteplase and tenecteplase have equivalent efficacy and that reteplase is slightly cheaper. The Boehringer Ingelheim model finds that tenecteplase dominates reteplase in pre- hospital settings (that is, it has a lower cost and greater effectiveness). 4.2.2.4 Building on the conclusions about in-hospital cost effectiveness, and since the general pre-hospital delivery costs for the 2 suitable bolus drugs (reteplase and tenecteplase) would be the
