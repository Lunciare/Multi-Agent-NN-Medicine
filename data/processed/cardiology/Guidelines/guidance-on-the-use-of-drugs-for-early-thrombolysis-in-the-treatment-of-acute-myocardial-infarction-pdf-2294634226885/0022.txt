inclusion criteria for the review of cost effectiveness. All compared streptokinase and alteplase (standard and accelerated) in a hospital setting. Three of the articles reported different aspects of the same cost-effectiveness model. Most studies reported incremental costs per life-year gained, and 3 also reported incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Most of the studies were based on the effectiveness results of GUSTO-I, in which data on resource use were collected only for USA centres. Consequently, the analyses undertaken in Canada, Ireland and France had to attempt to translate these to settings in other countries. 4.2.1.2 In general, the studies had the following limitations: costs and benefits were not measured in the same populations; comparator treatments were often inadequately described; and the derivation of utility values was inadequately explained. None of the studies undertook costing at a patient level and, while in general similar cost categories were included, only some of the studies included the longer-term costs of stroke and heart failure. Some of the studies included consideration of adverse events, including stroke, reinfarction, major bleeds, anaphylaxis, and congestive heart failure. 4.2.1.3 The analyses undertaken following GUSTO-I, which found a survival advantage for accelerated alteplase at 30 days, showed the
