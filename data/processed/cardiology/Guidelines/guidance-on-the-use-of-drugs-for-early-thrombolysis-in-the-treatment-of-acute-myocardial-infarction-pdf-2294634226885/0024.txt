of issues, including uncertainties over the interpretation of GUSTO-I (in general and in subgroups), application of US data on resource use, and the assumption that costs did not differ significantly between treatment groups. 4.2.1.5 Overall, there is little relevant published evidence on the economics of thrombolytics in a UK setting, and none examining the currently available bolus drugs. However, 2 cost-effectiveness models were submitted by manufacturers. 4.2.1.6 It is logical to assume that the earlier the administration the greater the reduction in damage to the heart. However, while precise assumptions about the survival/ time-to-treatment curve affect the benefit results in any modelling, it is unlikely that any one drug has a large advantage over any other with regard to timing of administration. 4.2.1.7 The 2 manufacturers' models are similar in structure and scope, although they differ in terms of method and level of detail. Roche's model examines costs up to 30 days, assumes all 4 drugs have equivalent efficacy, and has less detailed costing. In contrast the Boehringer Ingelheim model includes costing up to 10 years, includes long-term costing for individual complications (such as congestive heart failure and stroke), and incorporates differential survival and complication outcomes for the drugs and
