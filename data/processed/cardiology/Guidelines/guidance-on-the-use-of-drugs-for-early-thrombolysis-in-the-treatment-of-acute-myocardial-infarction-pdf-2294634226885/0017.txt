terms of mortality. However, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in the incidence of bleeding with tenecteplase (26.4% compared with 28.9% in the accelerated alteplase group), resulting in fewer blood transfusions in the tenecteplase group (4.3% of patients compared with 5.5% in the accelerated alteplase group). Also, the rate of heart failure was statistically significantly lower in the tenecteplase group than in the accelerated alteplase group (6.1% vs 7.0%, p=0.026). Subgroups 4.1.1.9 None of the trials discussed was designed to investigate clinical subgroups, such as by age or site of infarct (anterior, inferior). It was concluded that there was no convincing evidence of relative differences in the effectiveness of the available drugs in subgroups. The greater absolute benefit found in patients with anterior infarcts in GUSTO-I may simply be a reflection of the higher baseline risk in this group. The greater relative benefit in patients aged under 75 years was not reflected in their level of absolute risk reduction. None of the differences between the subgroups appeared to be statistically significant by interaction. Summary 4.1.1.10 In summary, given the evidence on clinical effectiveness, it can be concluded that, in the hospital setting, in terms of mortality: • standard
