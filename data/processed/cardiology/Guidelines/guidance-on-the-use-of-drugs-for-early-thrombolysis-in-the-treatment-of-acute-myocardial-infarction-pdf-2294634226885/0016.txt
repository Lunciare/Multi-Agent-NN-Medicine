(RAPID-2), and 1 larger study that examined patient-focused endpoints (GUSTO-III, n=15,059). GUSTO-III was designed to test the clinical superiority of reteplase over accelerated alteplase, following the findings in RAPID-2 of better coronary artery patency with reteplase. However, GUSTO-III found no statistically significant difference between the 2 drugs, in terms of survival or adverse effects. The mortality rate at 30 days was 7.5% in the reteplase group and 7.2% in the accelerated alteplase group: an absolute risk reduction of 0.23% in favour of accelerated alteplase (95% CI -1.10% to 0.66%). Given the confidence limits, reteplase cannot be considered as equivalent to accelerated alteplase. Tenecteplase 4.1.1.8 ASSENT-2, an equivalence trial of over 16,000 patients compared tenecteplase and accelerated alteplase. The study found that 30-day mortality was almost the same in the tenecteplase group (6.2%) and the accelerated alteplase (6.2%) group. The absolute difference of 0.03% in favour of accelerated alteplase was not statistically significant (95% CI -0.55% to 0.61%). Given the confidence limits, tenecteplase and accelerated alteplase can be considered equivalent in terms of mortality. However, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in the incidence of bleeding with tenecteplase (26.4% compared with 28.9% in the accelerated alteplase group), resulting in
