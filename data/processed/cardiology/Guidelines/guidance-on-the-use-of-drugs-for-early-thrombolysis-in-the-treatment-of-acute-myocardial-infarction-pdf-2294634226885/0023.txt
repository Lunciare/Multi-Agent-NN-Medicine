events, including stroke, reinfarction, major bleeds, anaphylaxis, and congestive heart failure. 4.2.1.3 The analyses undertaken following GUSTO-I, which found a survival advantage for accelerated alteplase at 30 days, showed the drug to be cost effective compared with streptokinase within the context of the clinical trial in the US healthcare system. In all of the studies, sensitivity analyses found that assumptions regarding mortality differences and costs were important, so any conclusions drawn are heavily dependent on the interpretation of the effectiveness findings of GUSTO-I. 4.2.1.4 In particular, the economic analysis undertaken in the USA alongside GUSTO-I modelled lifetime costs and benefits, and reported an incremental cost per life- year gained of $32,678 and an incremental cost per QALY of $36,402 for accelerated alteplase compared with streptokinase. The subgroup analyses found that accelerated alteplase became more cost effective in patients with higher absolute mortality risk – for example, $13,410 per life-year gained in patients older than 75 years with anterior myocardial infarction. However, the analysis requires extremely cautious interpretation given a number of issues, including uncertainties over the interpretation of GUSTO-I (in general and in subgroups), application of US data on resource use, and the assumption that costs did not differ significantly
