Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for the individual agents. 3.1.4 Heparin (an anticoagulant) is given with all of the thrombolytic drugs except streptokinase. It is usually administered as an IV bolus injection before thrombolysis, followed by an IV infusion. When given with tenecteplase the heparin dose is weight adjusted. Aspirin (an antiplatelet agent) is also usually given with any thrombolytic drug, because it delivers a mortality benefit in its own right. 3.1.5 Streptokinase (Streptase) is indicated up to 12 hours after onset of symptoms. It is administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour. It has been extensively studied and remains widely used. Streptokinase is associated with hypotension, infrequent allergic reactions and, rarely, anaphylaxis. Patients treated with streptokinase develop anti-streptococcal antibodies, which can inactivate the drug if subsequent treatment is needed. Consequently in current UK practice, patients are usually treated with streptokinase only once. It is estimated that around one- third of people with AMI have contraindications to streptokinase. A recent survey found that 82% of hospitals in England use streptokinase for eligible patients experiencing their first AMI; other data suggest that streptokinase represents between 53% and 65% of thrombolytic drug
