Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

failure, reinfarction, allergy and anaphylaxis. The results of the trials were also pooled in a meta-analysis. 4.1.1.2 No direct trial comparisons between tenecteplase and streptokinase or between tenecteplase and reteplase have been undertaken, and only cautious conclusions can be drawn from the indirect comparisons that can be deduced from other studies. Streptokinase 4.1.1.3 Two placebo-controlled trials were instrumental in establishing the efficacy of streptokinase in reducing mortality. The GISSI trial (published in 1986) included 11,712 patients, and the ISIS-2 trial (published in 1988) included 17,187 patients. In the GISSI study, 21-day mortality was 10.7% in patients treated with streptokinase and 13% in those treated with placebo. This represents a statistically significant absolute reduction of 2.3% (risk ratio 0.81; 95% confidence ratio [CI] 0.72 to 0.9). In the ISIS-2 study, vascular mortality at 5 weeks was 9.2% in patients treated with streptokinase and 12% in those treated with placebo. This represents a statistically significant absolute reduction of 2.8%. These benefits were independent of those of early aspirin treatment. Alteplase 4.1.1.4 A meta-analysis of 8 comparisons of standard alteplase with streptokinase found no significant difference between the 2 drugs in terms of mortality up to 35 days (odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI
