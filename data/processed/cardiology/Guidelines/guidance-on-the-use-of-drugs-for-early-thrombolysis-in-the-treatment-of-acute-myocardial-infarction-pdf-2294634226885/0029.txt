of 30-day mortality. 4.3.1.3 The committee was aware of the documented higher rates of stroke associated with the newer agents and carefully considered the views of clinical experts on this issue. 4.3.1.4 The committee considered that differences in the benefit of one thrombolytic agent over another are less clear if the combination of mortality and stroke endpoints are taken into account, particularly for subgroups at higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke. Furthermore, when considering the combination of mortality and stroke endpoints, it could be argued that the differences in overall benefit are less clear, particularly for subgroups at higher risk of developing haemorrhagic stroke. 4.3.1.5 In taking the view that the use of streptokinase is cost effective, the committee concluded that, although the acquisition cost of each of the newer drugs is substantially higher than that of streptokinase, the available economic evidence demonstrates that the newer drugs have an acceptable incremental cost- effectiveness ratio when compared with streptokinase. 4.3.1.6 Given that streptokinase is associated with a lower risk of stroke and is a cost- effective drug, the committee also considered it appropriate that all of the available thrombolytic drugs should be considered as options for use in care pathways for AMI.
