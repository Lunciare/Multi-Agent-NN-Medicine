values submitted by the manufacturers for the following: 30-day mortality, strokes, major bleeds, reinfarctions and congestive heart failure. 4.2.1.10 The assessment group used the adjusted models to compare the 3 newer drugs with streptokinase. For each comparison, the additional benefit (using QALYs) of the newer thrombolytic was small, while the additional cost was substantial. The cost differences between the newer drugs are relatively small. The most reliable finding is that streptokinase is by far the cheapest drug and although it is a little less effective (in terms of discounted QALYs), it is the most cost effective. 4.2.1.11 Using the adjusted manufacturers' models, the incremental costs per QALY reported for the 3 drugs compared with streptokinase were: accelerated alteplase, £7,219 (adjusted Boehringer Ingelheim model) and £7,878 (adjusted Roche model); reteplase, £7,893 and £10,247; and tenecteplase, £8,321 and £9,509. However, these cost–utility rankings of the 3 drugs relative to streptokinase are sensitive to changes in assumptions in the models, and so are not conclusive. 4.2.2 Pre-hospital thrombolysis 4.2.2.1 No published articles examining the cost effectiveness of different thrombolytic drugs in pre-hospital settings were found. 4.2.2.2 There is a published economic analysis of the GREAT study comparing cost effectiveness of pre-hospital and in-hospital
