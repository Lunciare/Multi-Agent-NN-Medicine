Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

meta-analysis of 8 comparisons of standard alteplase with streptokinase found no significant difference between the 2 drugs in terms of mortality up to 35 days (odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06). A statistically significant difference in reinfarction rates in favour of alteplase was found (odds ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95). However, alteplase was associated with a statistically significant higher risk of stroke (odds ratio 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.62), due to a doubling in the risk of haemorrhagic stroke (odds ratio 2.13; 95% CI 1.04 to 4.36). However, streptokinase was associated with a statistically significant higher risk of major bleeds (other than stroke) than alteplase (odds ratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97). The categorisation and reporting of major bleeding varied between the trials, so it is difficult to judge the clinical significance of these findings. 4.1.1.5 The studies included in this meta-analysis used the standard alteplase administration regimen, whereas the GUSTO-I trial used the accelerated regimen and is the only trial to have demonstrated superiority between different thrombolytic agents. The GUSTO-I trial included over 40,000 patients. It found an odds ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) for 30-day mortality for accelerated alteplase
