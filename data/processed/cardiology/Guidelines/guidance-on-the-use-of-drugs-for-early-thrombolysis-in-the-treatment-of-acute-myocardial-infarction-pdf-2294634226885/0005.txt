Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

have been introduced more recently (1997 and 2001, respectively). They are new modified forms of plasminogen activator and can be given by rapid IV bolus injection, rather than infusion. 3.1.2 The timing of administration is a crucial factor determining the extent of benefit achieved by thrombolysis, and treatment should ideally be given as soon as possible (normally up to 12 hours) after the onset of AMI symptoms. 3.1.3 Bleeding complications are the main risks associated with thrombolysis. The most important bleeding complication is haemorrhagic stroke, which occurs in 0.5% to 1.0% of patients and is associated with high mortality and long-term disability in survivors. Bleeding may occur at the injection site, in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Hypotension may also occur. The risks and benefits of giving thrombolysis need to be considered in individual patients and settings. The risk of haemorrhagic stroke following thrombolysis increases with age and blood pressure. Thrombolysis is contraindicated in individuals with bleeding disorders or a history of recent haemorrhage, trauma, surgery or acute cerebrovascular event. For full details of side effects and contraindications, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for the individual agents. 3.1.4 Heparin (an anticoagulant) is given with all of the thrombolytic drugs
