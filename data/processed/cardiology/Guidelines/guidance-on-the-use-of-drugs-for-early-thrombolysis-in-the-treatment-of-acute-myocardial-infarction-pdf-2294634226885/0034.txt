between £27 million and £45 million. If these levels were assumed to be 35%, 20% and 22.5% respectively, then the total would be between £22 million and £36 million. 6.5 In addition, substantial costs are associated with the introduction of pre-hospital thrombolysis. These include the costs of additional equipment, training, and potentially longer ambulance time spent treating patients with AMI. Also, any expansion of pre-hospital thrombolysis would result in a shift of drug costs from acute hospital trusts to other services such as ambulance trusts or primary care trusts and, potentially, result in an increase in total local spending on thrombolytic drugs where bolus drugs were not widely used in hospital. Such costs are difficult to estimate usefully on the basis of the information available to NICE at the time of this appraisal. 7 Implementation 7.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013 requires integrated care boards, NHS England and, with respect to their public health functions, local authorities to comply with the recommendations in this evaluation within 90 days of its date of publication. 7.2 The Welsh ministers have issued directions
