was likely to have a much greater impact on these endpoints where the pain-to-needle time was 1 hour compared with the situation where the pain-to-needle time was 6 hours. 4.3.2 Pre-hospital thrombolysis 4.3.2.1 The committee noted that while there is observational evidence to support pre- hospital thrombolysis, applying the results to the current NHS context is difficult, in that a minority used currently available bolus drugs, most are not paramedic based, and none was reliably generalisable to England and Wales. 4.3.2.2 In the absence of comparative evidence on thrombolytics in pre-hospital settings, the committee considered that the findings of trials comparing different thrombolytic drugs in hospital could still reasonably be applied to pre-hospital settings, with consideration of the additional relevant factors including safety and applicability examined in the pre-hospital studies outlined above. 4.3.2.3 On the basis of advice from experts that only the bolus drugs were appropriate for pre-hospital administration given the practical difficulties explained in section 3.2.6, and given that no high-quality evidence was available to differentiate reteplase and tenecteplase in terms of clinical effectiveness or cost effectiveness in pre-hospital settings, the committee considered that either reteplase or tenecteplase could be used in these settings, provided that the necessary
