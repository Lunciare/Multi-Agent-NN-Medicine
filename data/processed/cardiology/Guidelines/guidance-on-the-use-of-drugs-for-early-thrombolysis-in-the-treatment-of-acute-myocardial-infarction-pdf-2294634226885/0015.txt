4.1.1.6 Reteplase has also been compared with streptokinase in a study involving 5,986 patients (the INJECT study). This study found an absolute difference of 0.5% (95% CI -1.98% to 0.96%) in 35-day mortality in favour of reteplase (not statistically significant). If it is accepted that a 1% difference in mortality is the limit of equivalence in thrombolytic therapy, this suggests that it is unlikely that reteplase is inferior to streptokinase. An alternative interpretation is that in terms of overall effects on mortality and disabling stroke reteplase may be inferior to streptokinase, as the trial also found a statistically significantly lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke (odds ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.31) in the streptokinase group. However, the trial also found that the rates of heart failure (23.6% vs 26.3%, p<0.05) and allergic reactions (1.1% vs 1.8%, p<0.05) were statistically significantly lower in the reteplase group. 4.1.1.7 Reteplase has also been compared with accelerated alteplase in 1 relatively small (n=324) study that examined intermediate angiographic endpoints of coronary vessel patency (RAPID-2), and 1 larger study that examined patient-focused endpoints (GUSTO-III, n=15,059). GUSTO-III was designed to test the clinical superiority of reteplase over accelerated alteplase, following the findings in RAPID-2 of
