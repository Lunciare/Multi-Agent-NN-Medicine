NHS Plan to allow more widespread delivery in pre-hospital settings. 3.2.5 Currently, streptokinase is the only thrombolytic that paramedics are authorised to administer under the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997. However, paramedics can administer other thrombolytic drugs under local Patient Group Directions, and guidelines on their use by paramedics have been developed by the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee (JRCALC). 3.2.6 There are practical difficulties in giving controlled-rate infusions in pre-hospital settings, including drug preparation requirements, the practicalities of giving an infusion in an ambulance and, for streptokinase, concerns about higher rates of allergic reactions and hypotension, which are more difficult to manage away from hospital. 3.2.7 Although they are not within the scope of this appraisal, a number of organisational models of service delivery are relevant when considering the feasibility of administering different thrombolytic agents and their effectiveness in particular settings. These involve organisational, practical and operator issues. In-hospital thrombolysis models include: • assessment and treatment in A&E • rapid assessment in A&E and transfer to CCU • direct admission to CCU. Pre-hospital models include: • community hospital administration (nurse or general practitioner) • general practitioner administration (at the point of contact) • telemetry-supported paramedic administration
