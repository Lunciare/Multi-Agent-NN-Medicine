Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

is a cost- effective drug, the committee also considered it appropriate that all of the available thrombolytic drugs should be considered as options for use in care pathways for AMI. Local organisational and clinical policy considerations, such as proximity of CCU facilities and A&E staffing, will also have an impact on decisions regarding the appropriate use of each of the drugs in hospital. 4.3.1.7 Because the drugs will have different risk–benefit profiles for individual patients, the committee concluded that the decision about which of the available drugs to use should be made after balancing the likelihood of the benefits and risks (for example, stroke) to which the different drugs would expose the individual. 4.3.1.8 The committee took into account the potential importance of the methods of administration of the different thrombolytics and their effect on door-to-needle times. However, the impact of this factor on reducing myocardial damage and important clinical outcomes was very dependent on the overall pain-to-needle time. Thus, a saving of a few minutes in the door-to-needle time was likely to have a much greater impact on these endpoints where the pain-to-needle time was 1 hour compared with the situation where the pain-to-needle time was 6 hours. 4.3.2
