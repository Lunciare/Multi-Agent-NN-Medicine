Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

of urban and/or rural settings in Israel, continental Europe, Canada, the USA, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. A variety of thrombolytic drugs were studied – 4 studies used alteplase, 4 used streptokinase-type drugs, and 1 used urokinase (which is not available in the UK). Only the USA study (MITI) involved paramedics administering the thrombolytic (after remote consultation with a physician). In all but 1 of the other studies, a hospital physician attended the patient and administered the drug. In the rural Scottish trial (GREAT) a general practitioner undertook assessment and treatment. 4.1.2.4 The RCTs found that, on average, pre-hospital thrombolysis was administered 58 minutes earlier than hospital thrombolysis; the differences ranged from 33 minutes in the MITI study to 130 minutes in the GREAT study. Individually, the trials failed to show statistically significant reductions in in-hospital mortality, although findings in all of the studies favoured pre-hospital administration. However, a meta-analysis of 6 of the trials found a statistically significant absolute reduction in mortality of 1.6% (95% CI 0.2% to 3%), and a relative risk reduction of 17% (95% CI 2% to 30%, p=0.03) favouring pre-hospital administration of thrombolysis. This analysis is heavily influenced by the results of the GREAT study (in
