Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

A list of the committee members who took part in the discussions for this appraisal appears below. The appraisal committee meets 3 times a month except in December, when there are no meetings. The committee membership is split into 3 branches, with the chair, vice-chair and a number of other members between them attending meetings of all branches. Each branch considers its own list of technologies and ongoing topics are not moved between the branches. Committee members are asked to declare any interests in the technology to be appraised. If it is considered there is a conflict of interest, the member is excluded from participating further in that appraisal. The minutes of each appraisal committee meeting, which include the names of the members who attended and their declarations interests, are posted on the NICE website.
