infarction 1 Recommendations This guidance provides recommendations on the selection of thrombolytic drugs in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Recommendations are made in relation to the use of the drugs in hospital and pre-hospital settings. The guidance does not compare hospital and pre-hospital models of delivering thrombolysis. 1.1 It is recommended that, in hospital, the choice of thrombolytic drug (alteplase, reteplase, streptokinase or tenecteplase) should take account of: • the likely balance of benefit and harm (for example, stroke) to which each of the thrombolytic agents would expose the individual patient • current UK clinical practice, in which it is accepted that patients who have previously received streptokinase should not be treated with it again • the hospital's arrangements for reducing delays in the administration of thrombolysis.
