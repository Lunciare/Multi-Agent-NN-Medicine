Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

a relative risk reduction of 17% (95% CI 2% to 30%, p=0.03) favouring pre-hospital administration of thrombolysis. This analysis is heavily influenced by the results of the GREAT study (in which thrombolysis was administered by general practitioners in rural Scotland) and therefore does not directly relate to the potential for paramedic-based pre-hospital thrombolysis. 4.1.2.5 A number of observational studies examining pre-hospital thrombolysis were considered, although these generally only provide further insight into feasibility and safety. They include studies of administration of anistreplase (a streptokinase-like drug that is no longer available in the UK) by paramedics or general practitioners in a Dutch city, reteplase administered by ambulance-based nurses in Sweden, reteplase administered by paramedics in the USA, anistreplase administered in a rural Italian emergency room, and 2 reports of a small number of cases of reteplase administered by paramedics with hospital telemetry support in England. 4.2 Cost effectiveness 4.2.1 In-hospital thrombolysis 4.2.1.1 The assessment group's literature review found 8 published articles on the cost- effectiveness of thrombolytic agents that met the inclusion criteria for the review of cost effectiveness. All compared streptokinase and alteplase (standard and accelerated) in a hospital setting. Three of the articles reported different aspects of the same
