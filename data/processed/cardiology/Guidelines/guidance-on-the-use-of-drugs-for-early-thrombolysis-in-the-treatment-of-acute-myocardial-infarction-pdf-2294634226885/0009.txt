arriving at hospital ('door-to-needle' time). It is also suggested that it may be appropriate to provide pre-hospital thrombolysis where local 'call-to-hospital' times are likely to be over 30 minutes. The NHS Plan in England gave a commitment to train and equip ambulance paramedics to provide thrombolysis. 3.2.2 Direct admission to a coronary care unit (CCU) is often not possible, and A&E departments are being encouraged to administer thrombolysis to reduce delays in door-to-needle times. The potential for specialist nursing input in the delivery of thrombolysis is being developed. 3.2.3 Given the benefits of early administration of thrombolysis on reducing damage to heart muscle and consequently on long-term outcomes, pre-hospital administration of thrombolysis by ambulance paramedics is being gradually implemented in the NHS. 3.2.4 Currently, pre-hospital thrombolysis is administered by fewer than five ambulance services and a small number of remote community hospitals in England and Wales. Ongoing changes in infrastructure and training will be required to implement the requirements of the NSF for CHD, Tackling CHD in Wales and the NHS Plan to allow more widespread delivery in pre-hospital settings. 3.2.5 Currently, streptokinase is the only thrombolytic that paramedics are authorised to administer under the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use)
