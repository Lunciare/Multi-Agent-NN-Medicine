Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

be statistically significant by interaction. Summary 4.1.1.10 In summary, given the evidence on clinical effectiveness, it can be concluded that, in the hospital setting, in terms of mortality: • standard alteplase is as effective as streptokinase • reteplase is at least as effective as streptokinase, and • tenecteplase is as effective as accelerated alteplase. 4.1.1.11 If accelerated alteplase is believed to be superior to streptokinase, then indirectly tenecteplase would also be considered to be superior to streptokinase. 4.1.1.12 Conclusions regarding the equivalence of reteplase compared with accelerated alteplase depend on the interpretation of GUSTO-III. 4.1.1.13 Furthermore, if reteplase is considered to be equivalent to accelerated alteplase, then this indirectly implies that reteplase is as effective as tenecteplase. 4.1.1.14 Important differences in major adverse events between the thrombolytic agents are also apparent. The newer drugs are associated with a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke compared with streptokinase, but there are no apparent differences in the frequency of haemorrhagic stroke between accelerated alteplase and reteplase (GUSTO-III), or between accelerated alteplase and tenecteplase (ASSENT-2). However, compared with streptokinase, the newer drugs may also be associated with a lower incidence of congestive heart failure. In addition, allergic reactions are more common with streptokinase than
