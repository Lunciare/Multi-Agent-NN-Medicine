Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

superiority between different thrombolytic agents. The GUSTO-I trial included over 40,000 patients. It found an odds ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.94) for 30-day mortality for accelerated alteplase compared with streptokinase, and an absolute reduction in mortality at 30 days of 1.0% (6.3% versus 7.3%; 95% CI 0.4% to 1.6%) in favour of accelerated alteplase. However, this benefit was balanced by a statistically significantly higher incidence of haemorrhagic stroke (odds ratio 1.42; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.91). Using a combined outcome measure of mortality and disabling stroke, the absolute advantage of accelerated alteplase over streptokinase was lower (0.9%; p=0.006). Rates of bleeds (moderate or worse), allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, congestive heart failure, and sustained hypotension were statistically significantly lower in the group treated with accelerated alteplase. A further meta-analysis of 9 comparisons of alteplase with streptokinase, including the findings of GUSTO-I (or accelerated alteplase), found no significant difference between the 2 drugs in terms of mortality up to 35 days (odds ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). Reteplase 4.1.1.6 Reteplase has also been compared with streptokinase in a study involving 5,986 patients (the INJECT study). This study found an absolute difference of 0.5% (95% CI -1.98% to 0.96%)
