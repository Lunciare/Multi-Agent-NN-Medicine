greater effectiveness). 4.2.2.4 Building on the conclusions about in-hospital cost effectiveness, and since the general pre-hospital delivery costs for the 2 suitable bolus drugs (reteplase and tenecteplase) would be the same, the relative cost effectiveness of the drugs in pre-hospital settings is likely to be similar to that in hospital (assuming equal effectiveness of both drugs in each setting). On this basis it was concluded that it was not possible to distinguish between reteplase and tenecteplase on grounds of cost effectiveness in pre-hospital settings. 4.3 Consideration of the evidence 4.3.1 In-hospital thrombolysis 4.3.1.1 The committee noted the debate over the applicability of the findings of GUSTO-I beyond the North American centres (where most of the benefit of alteplase over streptokinase was found). The committee considered that the efficacy of accelerated alteplase should not be determined solely from the results of the GUSTO-I trial. 4.3.1.2 Despite concerns over the interpretation of GUSTO-I, the committee concluded that it was likely that the newer thrombolytic agents are more effective than streptokinase in terms of 30-day mortality. 4.3.1.3 The committee was aware of the documented higher rates of stroke associated with the newer agents and carefully considered the views of clinical experts on this
