Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

death (usually as the result of an acute fatal arrhythmia) is within the first hour of experiencing symptoms – around one-third of all AMI deaths occur within the first hour. 2.4 Thrombolytic drugs break down the thrombus so that the blood flow to the heart muscle can be restored to prevent further damage and assist healing. The sooner the blood flow can be restored, the better the chances of avoiding the death of the heart muscle. Along with clinical symptoms (typically but not exclusively chest pain), characteristic changes in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ST segment elevation) provide the most immediate indication of the diagnosis of AMI for patients requiring thrombolysis for AMI. 2.5 Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is an established standard treatment for AMI. It is estimated that around 50,000 patients currently receive thrombolysis in England and Wales each year. However, evidence suggests that thrombolysis continues to be under-used. 2.6 Thrombolytic drugs are routinely given in hospital as soon as possible after a confirmed diagnosis of AMI. Additionally, their administration in pre-hospital settings, principally by ambulance paramedics, is becoming more common. 2.7 Early primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be an alternative to thrombolysis. Despite research evidence of the potential value of
