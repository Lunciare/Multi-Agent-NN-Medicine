per patient (excluding VAT; BNF 43, March 2002). 3.1.7 Reteplase (Rapilysin) is indicated up to 12 hours after symptom onset. It is given as two IV bolus injections 30 minutes apart. It is estimated that reteplase represents between 12% and 15% of thrombolytic drug use in the UK. Reteplase costs £716 per patient (excluding VAT; BNF 43, March 2002). 3.1.8 Tenecteplase (Metalyse) is indicated up to 6 hours after symptom onset. It is administered as a single (weight-adjusted) IV bolus injection. It is estimated that tenecteplase currently accounts for around 1% of thrombolytic drug use in the UK, the manufacturer indicates that the proportion is increasing. Tenecteplase costs £700 to £770 per patient (excluding VAT; BNF 43, March 2002). 3.2 Delivering thrombolytic drugs 3.2.1 The National Service Framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) in England and Tackling CHD in Wales specify that eligible patients with AMI should be given thrombolysis within 60 minutes of calling for professional help ('call-to- needle' time) and should receive thrombolysis within 20 minutes of arriving at hospital ('door-to-needle' time). It is also suggested that it may be appropriate to provide pre-hospital thrombolysis where local 'call-to-hospital' times are likely to be over 30 minutes. The
