Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

settings, principally by ambulance paramedics, is becoming more common. 2.7 Early primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be an alternative to thrombolysis. Despite research evidence of the potential value of early PCI, currently few hospital trusts have the capacity to provide it. Treatment delivering thrombolytics in combination with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is also the subject of research studies. However, these interventions are beyond the scope of this appraisal. 3 The technology 3.1 Thrombolytic drugs 3.1.1 In the UK, four thrombolytic agents are licensed and available to treat AMI. All act by promoting the activity of circulating plasminogen. There is a long history of use of one, streptokinase, whereas the other three, alteplase, reteplase and tenecteplase, are newer options. Streptokinase is derived from streptococcal bacteria. Streptokinase is given by intravenous (IV) infusion. Alteplase was introduced in the late 1980s. It is essentially the same as the naturally occurring activator of plasminogen in the human body, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is given by IV infusion. Reteplase and tenecteplase have been introduced more recently (1997 and 2001, respectively). They are new modified forms of plasminogen activator and can be given by rapid IV bolus injection, rather than infusion. 3.1.2
