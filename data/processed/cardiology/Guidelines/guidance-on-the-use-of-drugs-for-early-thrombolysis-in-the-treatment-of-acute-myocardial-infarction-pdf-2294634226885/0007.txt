survey found that 82% of hospitals in England use streptokinase for eligible patients experiencing their first AMI; other data suggest that streptokinase represents between 53% and 65% of thrombolytic drug use. Streptokinase costs £80 to £90 per patient (excluding VAT; BNF 43, March 2002). 3.1.6 Alteplase (Actilyse, recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator, rtPA) can be delivered in a standard or accelerated regimen. The accelerated regimen, which is much more commonly used, is indicated up to 6 hours after symptom onset and is delivered by an initial IV bolus injection, followed by two IV infusions, the first given over 30 minutes and the second over 60 minutes. The standard regimen is indicated between 6 and 12 hours after symptom onset and requires a bolus injection followed by five infusions over 3 hours. Like the other newer drugs, alteplase does not stimulate the production of antibodies, so it can be used repeatedly. It is estimated that alteplase represents between 23% and 32% of thrombolytic drug use in the UK. Alteplase costs £600 per patient (excluding VAT; BNF 43, March 2002). 3.1.7 Reteplase (Rapilysin) is indicated up to 12 hours after symptom onset. It is given as two IV bolus injections 30 minutes
