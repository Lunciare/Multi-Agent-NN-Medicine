mean that the bolus drugs (reteplase or tenecteplase) are recommended as the preferred option. 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is caused by blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus or clot. This is usually the result of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque within the artery. The heart muscle supplied by that artery is damaged or dies because of lack of oxygen (ischaemia). Patients with AMI may develop heart failure or potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias as a result of damage to the heart muscle. These and other complications may occur early, within the first few hours of the event, or may develop over the subsequent months or years. 2.2 Around 240,000 people experience AMI in England and Wales each year. Up to 50% of people who have an AMI die within 30 days of the event, and over half of these deaths occur before medical assistance arrives or the patient reaches hospital. 2.3 Onset of AMI symptoms is usually rapid and the highest risk of death (usually as the result of an acute fatal arrhythmia) is within the first hour of experiencing symptoms – around one-third of all AMI deaths occur within the first hour.
