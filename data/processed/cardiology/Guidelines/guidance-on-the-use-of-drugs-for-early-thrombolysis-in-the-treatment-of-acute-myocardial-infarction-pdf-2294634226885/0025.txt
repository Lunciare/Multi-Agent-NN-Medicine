Guidance on the use of drugs for early thrombolysis in the treatment of acute myocardial

includes costing up to 10 years, includes long-term costing for individual complications (such as congestive heart failure and stroke), and incorporates differential survival and complication outcomes for the drugs and more detailed estimation of utilities. Both models incorporate a range of different assumptions regarding adverse events. The models also incorporate adjustment for the timing of administration, including time-savings in pre-hospital settings in which only bolus drugs are compared. 4.2.1.8 The Roche model essentially represents a cost-minimisation analysis, and finds reteplase slightly less costly than accelerated alteplase or tenecteplase in hospital. The Boehringer Ingelheim model assumes better survival and a lower incidence of post-infarct congestive heart failure (streptokinase 15.4%, accelerated alteplase 13.5%, reteplase 13.5%, tenecteplase 11.8%) for tenecteplase. These assumptions, together with 10-year discounted costs, lead to a finding that tenecteplase dominates accelerated alteplase and reteplase in hospital (that is, it is of lower cost and greater effectiveness). 4.2.1.9 The assessment group adjusted key parameters, tested sensitivities and presented revised results using the manufacturers' models. The sensitivity analysis examined the parameter values submitted by the manufacturers for the following: 30-day mortality, strokes, major bleeds, reinfarctions and congestive heart failure. 4.2.1.10 The assessment group used the adjusted models to compare the 3
