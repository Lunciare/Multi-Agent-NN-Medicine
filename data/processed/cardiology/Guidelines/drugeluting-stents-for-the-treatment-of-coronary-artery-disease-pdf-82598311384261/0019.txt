2 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.68), 1 year (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55) and 2 years (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.59). At 3 years, the difference was no longer statistically significant, but the data at this time point were derived from a single, relatively small study that may have been underpowered. TVR data for a SES (Cypher) versus a BMS were available for two trials at 6 to 9 months and for single trials at 1 and 3 years. These showed statistically significantly differences in favour of the SES (Cypher) compared with the BMS at: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18, 0.62), 1 year (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60) and 3 years (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.49). TVR data for the ZES (Endeavor) at 6 to 9 months, the only time period available, was statistically significant in favour of the ZES over the BMS (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.63). There were no data for EES (Xience V) for this outcome measure. 4.1.10 Rates of revascularisation (TLR) at 1 year for procedures carried out with a DES within individual trials were
