Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

and Yorkshire regions, and lowest in South East England) and by ethnic group (for example, CHD rates are highest among people from the Indian subcontinent living in the UK). The prevalence of CHD also increases with age and is higher in men than women. The disease is more common in people with high serum cholesterol and/ or high blood pressure, in people who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, in people who smoke, and in people who are physically inactive and/or obese. 2.4 The symptoms and health risks associated with a stenosed artery may be treated medically, by modifying risk factors (for example, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and hyperglycaemia) and/or by drug treatment (for example, beta- adrenergic blockers, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers, antiplatelet agents and/ or statins). 2.5 If these medical treatments fail or are inappropriate, two invasive therapies are available. The first, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), involves major cardiac surgery. The second, balloon angioplasty (or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) involves a widening from within the artery using a balloon catheter, which is inserted through a femoral artery. When inflated, the balloon increases the calibre of the artery. Most percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures involve the use of stents.
