longer statistically significant, but the data at this time point were derived from a single, relatively small study that may have been underpowered. TLR data for a SES (Cypher) showed it to be statistically significantly more effective than a BMS at all time points up to 3 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30), 1 year (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.25), 2 years (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30) and 3 years (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.36). The data for the ZES (Endeavor) at the follow-up period of 6-9 months showed it to be statistically significantly more effective than the BMS (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22, 0.56). Lower rates of TLR (3.8% versus 21.4%) were apparent for the EES (Xience V) group at 6 months (the only follow-up period) but the difference was not statistically significant. For TLR, the meta-analyses showed statistically significant differences in favour of any-type DES over any-type BMS, with improved rates of lesion revascularisation at all follow-up time points up to 3 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.37), 1 year (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.27), 2 years (OR
