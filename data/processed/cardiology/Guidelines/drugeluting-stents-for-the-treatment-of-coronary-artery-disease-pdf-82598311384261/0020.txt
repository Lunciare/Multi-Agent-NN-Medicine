Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

were no data for EES (Xience V) for this outcome measure. 4.1.10 Rates of revascularisation (TLR) at 1 year for procedures carried out with a DES within individual trials were less than 5%, and typically in the 10% to 25% range for procedures that used a BMS. For example, in three trials of PES (Taxus), the rates were 0%, 4.7% and 4.2% for the DES compared with 10.0%, 12.9% and 14.7% for the BMS, respectively. Rates at 1 year in three trials of a SES (Cypher) were 4.6%, 0% and 4.9% for the DES compared with 24.9%, 13.6% and 20.0% for the BMS, respectively. For TLR, the pooled eluted drug groups analysis showed statistically significant differences in favour of a PES (Taxus) over BMSs at follow- up periods of up to 2 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.49), 1 year (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.39) and 2 years (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40). At 3 years, the difference was no longer statistically significant, but the data at this time point were derived from a single, relatively small study that may have been underpowered. TLR data for a SES (Cypher) showed
