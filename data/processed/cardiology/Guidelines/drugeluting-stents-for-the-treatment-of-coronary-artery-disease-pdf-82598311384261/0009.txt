countries. Eight additional DESs have been included in this appraisal. 3.2 Each DES has an instruction for use (IFU) document that includes the indications for which the specific device can be used. The indications for use for each DES vary, although the majority specify the sizes of vessels (diameter and length) to be treated and are in accordance with their CE marking. Also included in the IFU documents are details of side effects and specific contraindications for DESs. 3.3 Different drugs elute from the stents that are included in this appraisal: paclitaxel is a broad-spectrum antimitotic agent that inhibits cell division; sirolimus (previously known as rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that reduces inflammation; ABT-578 is a synthetic analogue of sirolimus; everolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that is closely related to sirolimus; tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent; and dexamethasone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid that reduces inflammation. These drugs may elute at different rates, depending on the presence or absence of additional polymer coatings on the stent. 3.4 The following list prices for DESs exclude VAT. • The DES Axxion (Biosensors Limited) is a non-polymeric paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) with a list price of £995 (BMS equivalent: Nexus). • The DES CoStar
