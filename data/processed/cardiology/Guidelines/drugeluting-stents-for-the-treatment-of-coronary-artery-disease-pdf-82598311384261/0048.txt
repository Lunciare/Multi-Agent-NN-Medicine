small vessels, 1.35 for long lesions and 1.52 for diabetes; and the relative risk reductions from using DES were set to 60% for all patients; 69% for patients with small vessels; 70% for patients with long lesions and 61% for patients with diabetes. Assessment Group model: results 4.2.24 Based on the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, the Assessment Group's original base-case scenario as described in 4.2.20 assumes the overall repeat revascularisation rate for the total population of stented patients in the UK at 12 months after PCI with BMSs is 7.43%. Using 7.43% for all patients, the absolute rates of repeat revascularisation for the risk factors become: 7.8% for long lesions; 9.0% for diabetes; and 9.9% for small vessels. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient from the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data (1.615) and assuming a price difference of £600 (approximate average of the price difference of the PES Taxus and the SES Cypher, from the survey data) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of elective patients are approximately: £407,000 for all patients; £380,000 for long lesions; £340,000 for diabetes; and £306,000 for small vessels. Using the overall mean number of
