Following data published in 2006, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)'s Circulatory Devices Systems Advisory Panel recommended that the duration of clopidogrel use should be extended in patients receiving a DES. The American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association PCI guidelines (also endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography Interventions) and the BCIS have recommended that for patients receiving DESs the duration of clopidogrel use should be increased to at least 12 months, after which time continuation of clopidogrel should be reviewed taking into account the risk for further events on an individual patient basis. 3 The technologies 3.1 This technology appraisal focuses on DESs only. The preceding appraisal of DESs (NICE's technology appraisal on the use of coronary artery stents) considered only three devices (Taxus, Cypher and Dexamet) because at the time of publication, these were the only DESs that had been granted Conformité Européene (CE) marking for use within EU countries. Eight additional DESs have been included in this appraisal. 3.2 Each DES has an instruction for use (IFU) document that includes the indications for which the specific device can
