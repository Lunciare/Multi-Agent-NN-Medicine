was 1169, and in Wales, 873. 2.10 The National Service Framework for CHD set a target in March 2000 for revascularisations (PCIs and CABGs), of at least 1500 per million of the population (750 for each type of intervention). 2.11 According to BCIS data, in the UK, the proportion of PCI procedures using stents rose steeply between 1993 and 1999, from below 10% to nearly 80%. It continued to increase, although more slowly, to about 94% in 2005. Data for DES use were not available before 2002. In 2003 it was reported that 17% of all stents used in the UK were DESs. In 2005 this had risen to around 62% in the UK, 60% in England and 77% in Wales. Given the increases in numbers of PCI procedures, it may be that utilisation rates are now much higher than this. 2.12 There is a risk of stent thrombosis associated with the use of both types of stent (DESs and BMSs). To prevent thrombosis occurring, patients are required to use an antiplatelet drug, such as clopidogrel, in addition to aspirin during and after the implantation of a stent. Following data published in 2006, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)'s
