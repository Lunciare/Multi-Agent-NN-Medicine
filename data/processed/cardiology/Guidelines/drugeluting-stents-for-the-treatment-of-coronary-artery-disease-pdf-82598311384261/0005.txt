Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

number of problems with PCI may occur. Recoil of the artery which happens when the balloon is deflated, usually occurs immediately or within 24 hours of completing the procedure, and may be associated with acute occlusive dissection of the vessel and require emergency CABG. In the medium term restenosis of the artery after the procedure may occur and has two main causes: contraction of the outer layer of the artery secondary to an injury reaction (3 to 6 months after the procedure) and proliferation of smooth muscle cells within the arterial wall (4 to 6 months after the procedure), leading to intimal hyperplasia. As a consequence of restenosis, a repeat procedure may be required and the rate of reintervention is greater in patients who have arteries of small calibre ('small vessels' – less than 3 mm in calibre), saphenous vein grafts and long lesions (longer than 15 mm) or total occlusions. People with diabetes, who commonly have arteries affected by atherosclerosis, also have a higher rate of restenosis. 2.8 Stent technology (type and platform, including the design, alloy used and strut thickness) has developed rapidly, and recent advances aim to reduce the likelihood of restenosis. Because restenosis is correlated with
