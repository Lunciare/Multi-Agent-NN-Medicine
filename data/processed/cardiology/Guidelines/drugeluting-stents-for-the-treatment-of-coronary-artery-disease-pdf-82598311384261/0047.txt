from 20 to 20.5 weeks for PCI and from 13 to 20.9 weeks for CABG. The number of patients with acute coronary syndrome was changed from 44% to 48.5%, and consequently the number of patients receiving an extra 9 months' treatment with clopidogrel was reduced from 56% to 51.5%. 4.2.23 In addition to the changes to resource costs, waiting times and number of patients with acute coronary syndrome, the second additional analysis included new parameters based on alternative suggestions from the BCIS. The Assessment Group modified BCIS's suggestion regarding the presentational case-mix. The following parameters were used in the model: the percentages of elective and non-elective patients were changed from 68% to 57% for elective patients and from 32% to 43% for non-elective patients; the absolute risk of revascularisation of BMS for all patients was changed from 11% to 13% by combining 11.5% of elective and 15% on non-elective patients from the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit dataset; the relative risks for revascularisation in high-risk groups were set to 1.75 for small vessels, 1.35 for long lesions and 1.52 for diabetes; and the relative risk reductions from using DES were set to 60% for all patients; 69% for patients with small
