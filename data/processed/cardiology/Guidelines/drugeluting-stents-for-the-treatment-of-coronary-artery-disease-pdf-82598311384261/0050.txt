(1.571) and assuming a price difference of £600 (approximate average of the price difference of the PES [Taxus] and the SES [Cypher], from the survey data) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £213,000 for all patients; £183,000 for long lesions; £180,000 for diabetes; and £146,000 for small vessels. Assuming a price difference of £300 the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £101,000 for all patients; £85,000 for long lesions; £84,000 for diabetes; and £59,000 for small vessels. 4.2.26 For the Assessment Group's sensitivity analysis for the combined elective and non-elective data, using a relative risk reduction with DESs of 65% and a price difference of £600, the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £174,000 for all patients; £148,000 for long lesions; £146,000 for diabetes; and £116,000 for small vessels. Assuming a price difference of £300 the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £78,000 for all patients; £65,000 for long lesions; £64,000 for diabetes; and £41,000 for small vessels. 4.2.27 The Assessment Group's additional analysis as described in
