Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

up to 1 month were 1.8% in the SES group and 1.3% in the BMS group. At 1 year, the composite of death or non-fatal MI was 2.7% for the Yukon SES and 3.9% for the BMS. No statistically significant differences were detected. At 1 year, TLR was reported in 12.6% of the SES group and 21.5% of the BMS group, and the difference was statistically significant in favour of the SES (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.81). 4.1.15 The non-randomised trial that compared Dexamet (DES) with a BMS reported no deaths among the 100 participants receiving either stent and only one incidence of acute MI, which was in the BMS group, up to a mean of 8 months' follow-up. Revascularisations for this time period were 2% TLR in the DES group and 10% TLR (12% TVR) in the BMS group. Composite rates of MACEs, consisting entirely of revascularisations, were 2% for the DES and 12% for the BMS. Neither of these comparisons showed statistically significant differences. DES versus DES 4.1.16 Eight RCTs comparing different DES types were identified by the Assessment Group. Six RCTs compared a SES (Cypher) with a PES (Taxus; including one trial that was also
