Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per repeat revascularisation avoided; one estimated it to be US$1650 over 1 year and the other estimated it to be approximately US$7000 over 2 years. The majority of evaluations concluded that DESs are more cost effective than BMSs for patients with types of arteries that have a higher risk of restenosis, although there was great disparity between evaluations, with a variety of outcomes and a range of ICERs being reported. 4.2.2 Only one economic study, carried out alongside the BASKET RCT, reflected clinical practice because no protocol-driven angiographic follow-up was included. This study's results suggested that, at a threshold of €7800 per MACE avoided, DESs could potentially be cost effective in the following subgroups of patients: those older than 65 years; those with more than one segment treated; those with triple-vessel disease; those with a stent length of more than 20 mm; and those with small stent diameters. Manufacturers' economic models 4.2.3 Three models were submitted by DES manufacturers. 4.2.4 The decision analytic model from Boston Scientific compared the PES (Taxus) with the equivalent BMS, for a general population and for subgroups. The incremental costs per QALY at 1 year were given as £29,587 for the overall
