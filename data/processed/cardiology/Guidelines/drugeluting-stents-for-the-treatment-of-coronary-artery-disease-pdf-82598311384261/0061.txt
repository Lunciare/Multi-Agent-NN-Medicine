and, therefore, it could be considered as an appropriate costing option in its considerations. 4.3.12 After agreeing on the parameters to use in the Assessment Group's model, the Committee discussed the resulting ICERs for the base case and risk groups, assuming: • the absolute risk of revascularisation with BMSs for the total population is 11%, with resulting risks of revascularisation for small vessels of 19% and for long lesions of 11.7% • the mean number of stents per patient is 1.571 • the relative risk reduction with DESs for the base case is 55% for the total population, and 65% for patients with small vessels and long lesions • price differences of DESs over BMSs of £600 and £300. At a relative risk reduction of 55% with DESs, the resulting ICER for the total population of patients was associated with a cost per QALY of approximately £171,000 at a price difference of £600 and £74,000 at a price difference of £300. For the higher risk groups of patients (that is, those with long lesions and those with small vessels) using a DES, with a relative risk reduction of 65%, the resulting ICERs were associated with costs per QALYs of £126,000
