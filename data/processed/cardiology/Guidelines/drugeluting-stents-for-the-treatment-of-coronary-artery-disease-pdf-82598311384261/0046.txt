Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

therefore already be receiving 12 months' treatment with clopidogrel in accordance with 'Clopidogrel in the treatment of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome' (NICE technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel in the treatment of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome). 4.2.21 The Assessment Group, at the request of the Committee, also provided estimates based on the analyses using a relative risk reduction with DESs of 55% as the base case and a sensitivity analysis of 65%. These relative risk reductions with DESs were used for a rate of revascularisation, using BMSs, of 11%, which was obtained from combining results for all patients (equivalent to 10% for elective and 13% for non-elective patients). The corresponding risk of revascularisation using BMSs for the risk groups and the mean number of stents were also calculated from the combined datasets for the elective and non-elective patients. 4.2.22 Following consultation, the Assessment Group provided two additional analyses. The first additional analysis updated the 2003/04 resource costs with reference costs from 2005/06. The waiting times for PCI and CABG were updated from 20 to 20.5 weeks for PCI and from 13 to 20.9 weeks for CABG. The number of patients with acute coronary syndrome was changed from 44% to 48.5%, and
