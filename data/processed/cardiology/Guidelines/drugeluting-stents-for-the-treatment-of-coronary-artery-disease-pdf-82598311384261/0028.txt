in stent thrombosis compared with BMS at 1 year after stent implantation; the increased risk of stent thrombosis was not associated with an increased risk of death or MI compared with BMS; and the concerns about thrombosis do not outweigh the benefits of DES compared with BMS when DES are implanted within the limits of their approved indications for use.' The FDA stated that a longer duration of antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial, and this has led to the recommendation in the PCI guideline of the American College of Cardiologists/American Heart Association (endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography Interventions) that in patients receiving DESs the duration of clopidogrel use should be increased to 12 months. The BCIS has also recommended 12 months' use of clopidogrel in patients receiving a DES. 4.1.23 The Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel also considered use of DESs in patients with more complex coronary lesions than those studied to support initial marketing approval ('off-label' use). The Panel agreed that use of DESs 'off-label' is associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis, MI or death compared with 'on-label' use, and until more data are available DES labels (IFUs) should state that when DESs are used
