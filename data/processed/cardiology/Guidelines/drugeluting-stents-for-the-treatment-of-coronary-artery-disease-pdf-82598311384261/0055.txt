and they therefore had the potential to gain a greater relative benefit from DESs than other patients, and this was taken into account by the sensitivity analysis in the assessment group's economic model. The Committee considered the risk factors derived by the Assessment Group using the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, but it heard testimony from the clinical specialists that small vessels (less than 3 mm in calibre), long lesions (longer than 15 mm) and diabetes were the risk factors most consistently reported and that made most sense clinically. The Committee noted that, although the Assessment Group's analysis of the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data did not prove that any of these were statistically significant risk factors, taking account of other studies, small-vessel disease and long lesions were better predictors of risk groups than diabetes, and are particularly prevalent in patients with CAD who also have diabetes. The Committee was also mindful of the regulatory concerns about the 'off-label' use of DESs. The Committee concluded that small vessels and long lesions should be considered as separate risk factors whereas diabetes should not be considered as a separate risk factor. 4.3.5 The Committee noted that the Assessment Group's model was based
