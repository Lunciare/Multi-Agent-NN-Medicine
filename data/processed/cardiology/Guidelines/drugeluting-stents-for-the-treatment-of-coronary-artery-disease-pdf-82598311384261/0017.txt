that the stent design and the insertion system do not have an impact on clinical outcomes. 4.1.7 For rates of mortality and rates of acute MI, one study found a statistically significant difference in favour of the SES (Cypher) compared with the BMS for MI at 6 to 9 months (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04, 0.87). There were no statistically significant differences between the DES and the BMS in the individual studies for all other follow-up periods analysed to 3 years. There were no statistically significant differences between the DES and the BMS for the pooled eluted drug groups (PES [Taxus] and pooled SESs) and for the pooled analyses of any-type DES compared with any-type BMS for any of the follow-up periods. 4.1.8 For event rate (MACE and TVF), the individual studies of PES (Taxus), SES (Cypher) and ZES (Endeavor), and the pooled eluted drug groups analysis showed statistically significant differences in favour of DESs over BMSs. This was also the case for the overall meta-analysis, which favoured any-type DESs over any-type BMSs at all follow-up time points: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.53), 1 year (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.47), 2 years
