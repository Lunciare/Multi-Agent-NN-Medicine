Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

repeat procedure required treatment of new lesions. This resulted in an absolute rate of revascularisation for all patients of 7.43%. The Assessment Group also carried out sensitivity analyses, varying rates of revascularisation for all patients up to 13%, based on trial data. 4.2.16 Using the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, the Assessment Group developed separate risk models for elective and non-elective patients using patient and lesion characteristics known at the time of the index intervention. Risk factors for the patients were identified in the assessment report as being calcification, angulation greater than 45 degrees, restenotic lesion, triple-vessel disease, vessel diameter of less than 2 mm and prior CABG. In the final analyses, the absolute rates of repeat revascularisations for the conventional risk factors (long lesions, small vessels, diabetes and all combinations of these) were provided using the Liverpool audit data. The Assessment Group stated that, because none of these three factors in the multivariate model achieved conventional significance using the Liverpool audit data, the individual relative risks have wide confidence intervals and should be considered only as illustrative. The mean 12-month repeat revascularisation rate for all patients with small vessels was 15.25% (95% CI 9.38% to 22.24%), with a rate
