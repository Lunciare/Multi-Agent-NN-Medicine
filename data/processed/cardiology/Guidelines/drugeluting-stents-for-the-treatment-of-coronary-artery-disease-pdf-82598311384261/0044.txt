Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

the mean utility score recovers in a linear fashion achieving full benefit (0.660) by 4 weeks after the operation. Patients undergoing PCI were assumed to recover full benefit linearly over a 2-week period following the procedure. The Assessment Group concluded additionally that there was no evidence to suggest an effect on the rate of acute MI or mortality with CABG compared with PCI plus stenting. 4.2.18 When BMSs and DESs were compared, the meta-analysis showed a trend towards increased numbers of non-fatal acute MIs with BMSs. The Assessment Group concluded in their analyses that based on the reviewed evidence, the maximum likely effect of this is equivalent to, per patient, an overall cost saving of about £13 and a utility gain of about 0.00055 when DESs are used. 4.2.19 The clinical evidence from the meta-analyses in the assessment report suggested that the SES (Cypher) reduces repeat revascularisations compared with the PES (Taxus). Because most of the clinical trials were limited to 6 to 9 months' duration, the Assessment Group carried out the economic evaluation assuming clinical equivalence and distinguished between stents only on the basis of price. 4.2.20 In the additional analyses requested by the Committee, the Assessment Group undertook
