Angiographic outcomes, binary restenosis and/or late loss were reported for the PES (CoStar), Dexamet and the SES (Yukon). Because of the variety of DESs considered in these studies, the methodological limits of the available studies, and the varied and limited follow- up, the Assessment Group did not consider pooled analysis to be appropriate. 4.1.13 For the TES (Janus), limited data were reported; at 30 days no events (death, MI or TLR) had occurred. For the PES (Taxus Liberté) the data available at 30 days were marked as commercial in confidence. For the PES (CoStar), the only data available were for one of the two arms at 1 year for one trial and interim data from two of the four arms of the other ongoing study. 4.1.14 Data for the SES (Yukon) were reported at 1 month and 1 year. No deaths occurred in the first month. Rates of acute MI up to 1 month were 1.8% in the SES group and 1.3% in the BMS group. At 1 year, the composite of death or non-fatal MI was 2.7% for the
