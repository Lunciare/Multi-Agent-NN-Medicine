was increased from 6 to 12 months, the cost per QALY at 12 months increased to £71,634 for the total population and to over £30,000 for the subgroup with diabetes. 4.2.5 The decision analytic model from Cordis compared the SES (Cypher) with the equivalent BMS for a 'no-risk-factor' population and for subgroups. The model was split into a two-way analysis of the BMS versus the SES (Cypher) and a three-way analysis of the BMS versus the PES (Taxus) versus the SES (Cypher). In extending the three-way analysis to 2 years, an indirect comparison was undertaken that made an assumption that the BMSs in both trials (Boston Scientific and Cordis BMS) are equivalent. The cost data for the technologies (the BMS and Taxus) were considered by the Assessment Group to be overestimated and when the Assessment Group re-ran the model increasing the SES (Cypher) price premium over the equivalent BMS from £433 to £695, the incremental cost per QALY increased from £29,259 to £69,613 for the 'no risk factor' subgroup; from £10,178 to £39,508 for the small-vessels subgroup; from £16,460 to £49,345 for the long-lesions subgroup; and from £9,702 to £38,446 for the group with diabetes. 4.2.6 The Markov model presented
