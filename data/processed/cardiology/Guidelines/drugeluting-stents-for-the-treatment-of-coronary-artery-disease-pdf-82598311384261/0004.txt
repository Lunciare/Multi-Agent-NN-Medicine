balloon catheter, which is inserted through a femoral artery. When inflated, the balloon increases the calibre of the artery. Most percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures involve the use of stents. A stent is a thin wire-mesh tube loaded over an angioplasty balloon. When the balloon inflates, the stent expands like a scaffold to hold the vessel open, and is left behind after the balloon is deflated and withdrawn. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a generic term that encompasses percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with or without stenting. The comparison of CABG with PCI including coronary artery stents (bare-metal and drug-eluting) was covered by NICE's technology appraisal on the use of coronary artery stents and is not dealt with in this appraisal. 2.6 One of the criteria for comparing the clinical effectiveness of PCI with stents with standard PCI (without stents) is the incidence of subsequent attacks of angina and major adverse coronary events (MACEs), which include death, MI and the need for further revascularisation procedures (CABG or repeat PCI). 2.7 A number of problems with PCI may occur. Recoil of the artery which happens when the balloon is deflated, usually occurs immediately or within 24 hours of completing the procedure, and
