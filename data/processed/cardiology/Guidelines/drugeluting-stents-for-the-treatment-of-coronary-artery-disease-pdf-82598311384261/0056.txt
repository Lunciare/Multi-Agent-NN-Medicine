Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

lesions should be considered as separate risk factors whereas diabetes should not be considered as a separate risk factor. 4.3.5 The Committee noted that the Assessment Group's model was based on the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data that distinguished elective and non- elective (emergency) patients. The Committee heard testimony from the clinical specialists that in clinical practice the differences between these patient groups specifically related to the mode of their presentation with acute coronary syndromes, that is, non-ST-segment-elevated MI or unstable angina, and to the use of adjunctive treatments, in particular anti-platelet therapy. Due to the lack of other differences the Committee concluded that elective and non-elective patients should be considered together but that the merging of the estimates should take account of the proportions of elective and non-elective patients seen in clinical practice. 4.3.6 In considering the cost effectiveness of DESs compared with BMSs, the Committee noted that the model structure used by the Assessment Group was appropriate. The Committee discussed the key parameters that drove the Assessment Group's economic model. It considered the absolute rate of revascularisation of BMSs in the total population of stented patients and noted that the Assessment Group used 7.43% for patients in its
