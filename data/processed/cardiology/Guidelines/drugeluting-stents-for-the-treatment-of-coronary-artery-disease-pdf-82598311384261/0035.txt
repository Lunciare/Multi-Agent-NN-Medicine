£10,178 to £39,508 for the small-vessels subgroup; from £16,460 to £49,345 for the long-lesions subgroup; and from £9,702 to £38,446 for the group with diabetes. 4.2.6 The Markov model presented by Medtronic compared the ZES (Endeavor [sirolimus analogue ABT-578]) with Medtronic's comparable BMS, for a total population. The submission measured costs and benefits at 5 years, extrapolating the 9-month trial data. In one scenario, the two arms were assumed to be equivalent in terms of risk of repeat revascularisations after 1 year. The incremental cost per QALY was estimated at £11,220. No subgroup analyses were undertaken. The Assessment Group found the model to be highly sensitive to baseline TVR rates and the number of index stents used. If baseline TVR rates were reduced below 12% (for both the BMS and the ZES), then the ICER exceeded £30,000. If the average number of stents used for the index procedure was increased to 1.4, the ICER increased to £39,174. The Assessment Group noted that the two factors to which the model was sensitive were taken from a single positive trial. 4.2.7 The submission from Kiwimed compared an SES (Yukon) with the Kiwimed BMS for a total population. The effectiveness data were taken
