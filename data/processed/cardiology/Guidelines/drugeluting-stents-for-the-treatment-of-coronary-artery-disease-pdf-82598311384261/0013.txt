a number of sources. 4.1 Clinical effectiveness DESs versus BMSs – evidence from randomised controlled trials 4.1.1 A total of 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified that compared DESs with BMSs, and data from all 17 were included for at least one outcome in the meta-analysis. • 10 studies compared an SES (Cypher) with the equivalent BMS. • Four studies compared a PES (Taxus) with the equivalent BMS. • One study compared both an SES (Cypher) and a PES (Taxus) with a newer BMS. • One study compared the ZES (Endeavor) with the equivalent BMS. • One study compared the EES (Xience V) with the equivalent BMS. No RCT evidence has yet been reported for the Axxion, CoStar, Dexamet or Janus stents. Limited RCT data were available for the Yukon stent. 4.1.2 Study outcomes used in the RCTs included rates of mortality, acute MI, target lesion revascularisation (TLR), target vessel revascularisation (TVR), composite events (major adverse coronary event [MACE] and/or target vessel failure [TVF]), angiographic binary restenosis and late luminal loss. Revascularisation was usually prompted by protocol-driven angiographic evidence of restenosis either for all participants or for a selected subgroup of participants. Only one trial (BASKET) explicitly reported that
