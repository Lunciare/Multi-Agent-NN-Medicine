risk of target lesion revascularisation with DESs. The Committee noted that the trial data typically gave a relative risk reduction of 75%, but considered that this figure might over- estimate the real-life benefit of DESs because it is derived from the trials that included protocol-driven angiography and revascularisation. The Committee heard that the BASKET trial, which had not included protocol-driven angiography, had a relative risk reduction with DESs of 41% at 12 months. The Committee looked at the adjusted relative risk reduction with DESs used by the Assessment Group, and acknowledged that their approach reflected the number of patients, and not the target lesions, that would benefit from DESs. The Committee noted that the Assessment Group's figure was in line with the BASKET trial. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the most plausible relative risk reduction with DESs from the clinical evidence was likely to be in the range 50% to 60% for the base case and 61% to 70% for high-risk groups. Given the variation in data the Committee considered a relative risk reduction with DESs over BMSs of 55% in the base case, and of 65% in a sensitivity analysis for the higher risk groups were
