Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

Cost effectiveness Published literature 4.2.1 A total of 10 full economic evaluations were included in the assessment report, all of which compared an SES with a BMS, although four evaluations also included a PES. One of the evaluations was conducted in the UK; the rest were conducted in the USA, Canada or the rest of Europe. Seven evaluations used a 1-year time horizon, one used 2 years, one used 6 months and one used a patient's lifetime. Of the 10 evaluations, nine estimated that the cost of DESs incurred a price premium/difference (the difference in cost between a given BMS and the drug- eluting equivalent), which ranged from £233 to £1,225. Four of the evaluations reported health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Three evaluations provided incremental costs per QALY for a general population, and these costs ranged from US$27,450 to Can$96,523 (approximately US$93,000). The fourth evaluation did not include a general population because subgroups were found to be too dissimilar for comparison. Two evaluations reported the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per repeat revascularisation avoided; one estimated it to be US$1650 over 1 year and the other estimated it to be approximately US$7000 over 2 years.
