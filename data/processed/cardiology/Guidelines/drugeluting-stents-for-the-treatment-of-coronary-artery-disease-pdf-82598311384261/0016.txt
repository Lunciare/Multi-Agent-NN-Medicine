confidence interval (95% CI) were analysed using the Mantel–Haenszel method fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMDs) were analysed. Where there was significant heterogeneity, analysis using a random-effects model was also undertaken. 4.1.6 In addition to analyses of the individual studies, pooled estimates (giving the OR and 95% CI) were provided for each 'eluted drug' group (for example, comparing a PES [Taxus] and all BMSs in the paclitaxel studies). Data related to the SES (Cypher) and the sirolimus-analogue stent, ZES (Endeavor) in some instances were pooled and presented as pooled SES results. All eluted drug group results were also pooled to obtain estimates for a meta-analysis of any-type DESs compared with any-type BMSs. The meta-analysis was performed for available data at follow-ups of up to 1 month, 6 to 9 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. The Assessment Group assumed, when making decisions about the appropriateness of combining data, that all BMSs are similar and, likewise, all DESs are similar except in the drug delivered; and that the stent design and the insertion system do not have an impact on clinical outcomes. 4.1.7 For rates of mortality and rates of acute MI, one study found a
