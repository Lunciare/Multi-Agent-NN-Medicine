of thrombus in the target vessel, previous PCI within 30 days or PCI other than balloon required as part of the study intervention. 4.1.4 A total of 12 trials described the co-therapies used. Aspirin was prescribed before intervention in 11 of these studies and used after the procedure in all 12. Clopidogrel was used as an antiplatelet therapy in all of the 12 studies; ticlopidine was available for use as an alternative to clopidogrel in five studies. In one trial, tirofiban, used in combination with a DES, was compared with abciximab used with a BMS. The duration of antiplatelet therapy after intervention ranged from 2 months in three trials to 1 year in one study. 4.1.5 Meta-analysis was carried out by the Assessment Group for rates of mortality, acute MI, TLR, TVR, composite event (MACE and/or TVF), angiographic binary restenosis and late luminal loss. Analysis of mortality, acute MI and event rates used pooled results from over 7000 participants. Data in the form of an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were analysed using the Mantel–Haenszel method fixed-effect model. For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMDs) were analysed. Where there was significant heterogeneity, analysis using a random-effects
