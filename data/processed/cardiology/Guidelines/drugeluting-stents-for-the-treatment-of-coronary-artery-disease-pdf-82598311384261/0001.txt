1 Recommendations 1.1 Drug-eluting stents are recommended for use in percutaneous coronary intervention for treating stable angina, within their instructions for use, only if: • the target artery to be treated has less than a 3-mm calibre or the lesion is longer than 15 mm, and • the price difference between drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents is no more than £300. [2020] For recommendations on drug-eluting stents for people with unstable angina, non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), see recommendation 1.1.18 and recommendation 1.2.18 in NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes. 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Coronary artery disease is also known as coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic heart disease. It is narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries as a result of deposition of atherosclerotic plaque, which results in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle. CHD may affect one or more arteries, which may be of different diameters (calibres). The stenosis of arteries may be partial or total. Coronary artery stenosis may be asymptomatic or may lead to angina – chest pain that may be severe enough to restrict or prevent exertion. A critical reduction of the blood supply to the
