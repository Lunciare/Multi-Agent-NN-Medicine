Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

over any-type BMSs at all follow-up time points: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.53), 1 year (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.47), 2 years (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54) and 3 years (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.55). Statistical heterogeneity was indicated at the 6 to 9 months follow-up; a random-effect analysis for this time point showed only a small effect on the OR (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.54). The difference between the EES (Xience V) and the BMS was not statistically significant at the only follow-up period (6 to 9 months). 4.1.9 For TVR, not all individual studies of PES (Taxus) showed statistical significance compared with BMSs for all time periods up to 3 years. The individual studies for SESs (Cypher) and ZESs (Endeavor) all showed statistical significance over BMSs up to 3 years. The pooled eluted drug groups analysis showed statistically significant differences in favour of a PES (Taxus) over BMSs at follow-up time points up to 2 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.68), 1 year (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55) and 2 years (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34
