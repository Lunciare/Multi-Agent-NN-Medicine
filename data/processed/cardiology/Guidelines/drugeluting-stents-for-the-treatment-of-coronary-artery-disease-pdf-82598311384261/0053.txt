It was also mindful of the need to take account of the effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.2 The Committee considered the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of DESs in the treatment of CHD. The Committee acknowledged that the clinical trials showed that the use of any-type DESs reduced the rate of revascularisation in the target lesions and the target vessels, at all follow-up time points up to 3 years, compared with any-type BMSs. The Committee noted not just the trial data, but also the recent discussions on the effects of DESs on the risks of thrombosis, MI, and mortality, and accepted the findings of the FDA review that any-type DESs conferred no statistically significant benefits in mortality or acute MI rates over any-type BMSs. The Committee concluded that the key benefit of DESs is the reduction in rates of revascularisation in target lesions and target vessels compared with BMSs. 4.3.3 The Committee considered whether there was any evidence to suggest that there were differences in the clinical effectiveness of the various types of DESs. It noted that only four of the eleven DESs had been compared with each other in head-to-head RCTs. The majority of data comparing revascularisation
