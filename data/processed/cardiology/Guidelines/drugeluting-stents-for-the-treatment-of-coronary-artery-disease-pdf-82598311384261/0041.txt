reductions from the meta-analysis, this suggested that the reduction in the number of lesions treated in subsequent interventions was between 37% (95% CI 31 to 42%) and 53% (95% CI 47 to 59%) based on TLR (the Assessment Group counted lesions treated but excluded cases undergoing CABG rather than PCI). The Assessment Group noted that the BASKET trial, which did not include protocol-driven angiography, reported a risk reduction for DESs of 41% at 6 months. The Assessment Group therefore used 41% for the risk reduction associated with DESs in its base-case analyses. 4.2.15 The Assessment Group stated that the ICERs of any-type DESs compared with any-type BMSs are very dependent on the estimates of relative risk reduction in revascularisations and on the absolute rate of revascularisation in the types of patients in whom they are used. The absolute rates of revascularisation were derived from the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, and the potential of benefit was reassessed on the basis of the audit data concerning those patients in whom the repeat procedure required treatment of new lesions. This resulted in an absolute rate of revascularisation for all patients of 7.43%. The Assessment Group also carried out sensitivity analyses, varying rates
