Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

groups of patients are approximately: £78,000 for all patients; £65,000 for long lesions; £64,000 for diabetes; and £41,000 for small vessels. 4.2.27 The Assessment Group's additional analysis as described in 4.2.22, assuming a price difference of £600 for the base case (55% relative risk reduction of DES), results in incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients of approximately: £171,000 for all patients; £158,000 for long lesions; £156,000 for diabetes; and £124,000 for small vessels. Assuming a price difference of £300 the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £74,000 for all patients; £66,000 for long lesions; £65,000 for diabetes; and £41,000 for small vessels. For the updated Assessment Group's sensitivity analysis (65% for the relative risk reduction of DES) the resulting incremental costs per QALY, for a price difference of £600, for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £137,000 for all patients; £126,000 for long lesions; £124,000 for diabetes; and £95,000 for small vessels. Assuming a price difference of £300 the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups of patients are approximately: £54,000 for all patients; £47,000 for long lesions; £46,000 for diabetes; and
