of the various types of DESs. It noted that only four of the eleven DESs had been compared with each other in head-to-head RCTs. The majority of data comparing revascularisation rates were between the SES (Cypher) and the PES (Taxus). The Committee noted that the SES (Cypher) showed a statistically significant reduction in TLR, TVR and MACEs compared with the PES (Taxus), at 9 months. It was also noted that at 1 year, for the only outcome available, rates of TLR for the SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus) showed no statistically significant difference. The Committee heard testimony from the clinical specialists that different DESs are clinically comparable and that, in practice, any of the DESs would be used, although those with the greater evidence-base would be first choice. 4.3.4 The Committee considered the evidence to suggest that there were groups of patients whose vessel anatomy was more likely to be subject to restenosis. The absolute rate of revascularisation in these groups was greater than that of other patients and they therefore had the potential to gain a greater relative benefit from DESs than other patients, and this was taken into account by the sensitivity analysis in the assessment
