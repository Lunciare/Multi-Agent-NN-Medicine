observational studies of stented patients treated at the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre, to convert the efficacy of any-type DES to effectiveness estimates for repeat revascularisations and lesions treated in repeat revascularisations. The Assessment Group found that 51% of patients who underwent a second PCI required repeat treatment to previously treated lesions only. An additional 17% of patients received repeat treatment to a target lesion at the same time as treatment to a previously untreated lesion in the same vessel; these are the patients in whom DESs can be expected to produce benefit. Applying these proportions to the relative risk reduction from the trials of 74.6% (for TLR obtained from the meta-analysis of any-type DES trials) yielded an expected risk reduction in all revascularisations at 12 months of between 38% (95% CI 32 to 44%) and 50% (95% CI 44 to 57%). The Assessment Group also considered the likely benefit that any-type DES may offer in reducing the number of lesions treated in repeat revascularisations. When applied to the TLR relative risk reductions from the meta-analysis, this suggested that the reduction in the number of lesions treated in subsequent interventions was between 37% (95% CI 31 to 42%) and 53% (95% CI
