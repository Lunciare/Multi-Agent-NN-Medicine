Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

with an increased risk of stent thrombosis, MI or death compared with 'on-label' use, and until more data are available DES labels (IFUs) should state that when DESs are used off-label, patient outcomes may not be the same as the results observed in the clinical trials conducted to support marketing approval. The FDA has since defined off-label use to mean the use of a medical product for treatments other than those for which the product was initially approved; or use not explicitly included in product labelling (intended use and IFU). The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) supports this definition of off-label use for the DESs that have been approved for use in Europe. 4.1.24 Each DES included in this appraisal has an IFU document that lists the indications for which it can be used. The sizes of vessels (diameter and length) to be treated are stated in the majority of the IFUs, as are the specific contraindications. The FDA considers that although patients with diabetes were included in the pivotal trials, the number of patients was insufficient for either the SES (Cypher) or the PES (Taxus) to earn a specific labelled indication for people with diabetes.
