intervals and should be considered only as illustrative. The mean 12-month repeat revascularisation rate for all patients with small vessels was 15.25% (95% CI 9.38% to 22.24%), with a rate difference p = 0.02; for those with long lesions it was 10.23% (95% CI 8.10% to 12.57%), p = 0.09; and for those with diabetes it was 10.61% (95% CI 7.52% to 14.14%), p = 0.14. 4.2.17 The Assessment Group used patient survey data from the Health Outcomes Data Repository (HoDAR) database for its utility values. The difference in HoDAR health-related quality of life scores between patients with severe angina and those recovered from revascularisation (0.158) was similar to the ARTS trial result (0.16), which was used in the previous appraisal. The assumptions made by the Assessment Group in the final analyses for disutilities associated with CABG versus PCI in the 6-week period following the procedure were that for a 2-week post-operative period, patients undergoing CABG experience a very low quality of life (0.0), and for the next 2 weeks the mean utility score recovers in a linear fashion achieving full benefit (0.660) by 4 weeks after the operation. Patients undergoing PCI were assumed to recover full benefit linearly over
