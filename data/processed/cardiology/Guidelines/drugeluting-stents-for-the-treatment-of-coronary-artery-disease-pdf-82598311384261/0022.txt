follow-up time points up to 3 years: 6 to 9 months (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.37), 1 year (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.27), 2 years (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.31) and 3 years (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.35). DES versus BMS – DESs with non-RCT data 4.1.11 The TES (Janus) was examined in a non-controlled study as was the PES (Taxus Liberté). A range of formulations of the PES (CoStar) was evaluated in two non- randomised controlled studies, and the Yukon DES was evaluated in a dose- ranging non-randomised controlled study comparing Yukon coated with sirolimus with the same stent carrying no drug. The Dexamet DES was studied in one non- randomised study of Dexamet compared with a BMS and four non-controlled studies (including two registries). 4.1.12 Outcome data were limited due to the short follow-up periods: 30 days for the PES (Taxus Liberté) study; 4 months for one PES (CoStar) study and 1 year for the other PES (CoStar) study; 6 months for the Dexamet studies and for the TES stent; and up to 1 year for the SES (Yukon) study. Angiographic outcomes, binary restenosis and/or late loss were reported for
