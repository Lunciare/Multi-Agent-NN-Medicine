Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

and Cypher, respectively. 4.2.12 Information received during the consultation period for the appraisal consultation document suggested that the prices for DESs had decreased since the 2005 survey. Therefore updated prices were sought from the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. From the sample 2007/08 data received from the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency for NHS organisations in England for the stents included in this appraisal, the mean price of DES was £529 and the mean price of BMS was £131. The price difference between DESs compared with BMSs ranged from £203 to £615 across a number of Health Authorities in England. 4.2.13 To calculate the PCI procedure costs it was necessary to subtract the included costs of stents (DES and BMS) from the published PCI costs, and then to add back the model estimates of the number of stents, the type of stent and the cost per stent. In the final analyses, the Assessment Group assumed a wastage rate of 1%. 4.2.14 The Assessment Group base-case analysis used results from two observational studies of stented patients treated at the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre, to convert the efficacy of any-type DES to effectiveness estimates for repeat revascularisations and lesions treated in repeat revascularisations.
