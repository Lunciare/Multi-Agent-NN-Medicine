Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

technology (type and platform, including the design, alloy used and strut thickness) has developed rapidly, and recent advances aim to reduce the likelihood of restenosis. Because restenosis is correlated with the degree of inflammation present at the time of angioplasty, drug-eluting stents (DESs) were developed. These are bare-metal stents (BMSs) coated with a drug, usually an immune suppressant, to reduce inflammation or an antimitotic agent to reduce cell proliferation. The drug reaches therapeutic concentrations in local tissues only and may not be detectable systemically, thus avoiding systemic adverse effects. A subsequent development was the use of a drug–polymer mix where the drug is held temporarily in place within a polymer 'painted' onto the metallic stent, allowing the drug to elute slowly into surrounding tissues. However, not all stents are polymer based. 2.9 According to British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) data, approximately 70,000 PCI procedures were undertaken in the UK in 2005, equating to 1165 per million of the population. In England, the number of procedures per million of the population was 1169, and in Wales, 873. 2.10 The National Service Framework for CHD set a target in March 2000 for revascularisations (PCIs and CABGs), of at least 1500 per million
