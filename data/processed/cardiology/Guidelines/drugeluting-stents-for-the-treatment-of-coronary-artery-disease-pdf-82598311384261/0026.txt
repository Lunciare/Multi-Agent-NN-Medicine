Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

conducted according to which pairing of DES types was compared within trials (most commonly this was the SES [Cypher] versus the PES [Taxus]). No total pooled effect estimate was calculated across multiple groupings of DES versus DES trials. 4.1.19 There were no statistically significant differences in rates of mortality or acute MI for any of the pairings of DES types. 4.1.20 For TLR, one individual study showed a statistically significantly better rate of TLR, at 6 to 9 months, with the SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.93). Only one RCT had data available beyond 9 months; in this study, rates of TLR at 1 year were 5.7% for the SES (Cypher) compared with 9.0% for the PES (Taxus); the difference was not statistically significant. The Assessment Group's pooled analysis of TLR up to 9 months was statistically significant in favour of the SES (Cypher) over the PES (Taxus; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97). 4.1.21 A statistically significant reduction in TVR with the SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus) was determined from a meta-analysis of two trials at 6 to 9 months (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89).
