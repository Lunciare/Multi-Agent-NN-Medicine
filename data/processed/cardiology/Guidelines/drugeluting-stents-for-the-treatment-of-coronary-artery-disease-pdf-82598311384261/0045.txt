The results of the sensitivity analyses were presented as a number of tables containing the ICERs for a range of price premiums, for a range of absolute risks of revascularisation of BMSs, for the total population of stented patients and the risk-factor groups (small vessel, long lesion, diabetes and all combinations of these). Tables were presented for different numbers of stents (mean number, 1, 2 or 3) per patient. The Assessment Group also undertook new sensitivity analyses that took account of an additional 9 months' use of clopidogrel in patients receiving DESs, in accordance with the recent BCIS recommendations. These additional costs were applied only to 56% of the patient population because it was suggested by Consultees that 44% of patients would have acute coronary syndrome and therefore already be receiving 12 months' treatment with clopidogrel in accordance with 'Clopidogrel in the treatment of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome' (NICE technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel in the treatment
