in the pivotal trials, the number of patients was insufficient for either the SES (Cypher) or the PES (Taxus) to earn a specific labelled indication for people with diabetes. The UK MHRA supports the view of the FDA with regard to individuals with diabetes and only one of the DESs, the PES (Taxus), included in this appraisal has recently been specifically indicated for people with diabetes. Summary 4.1.25 There were no statistically significant differences detected in death or MI between the pooled subgroups and pooled any-type DES groups. The pooled DES analysis indicated that revascularisation rates were reduced by approximately three quarters compared with BMSs, consistent across most studies of the PES (Taxus) and SESs (Cypher; Endeavor at 6 to 9 months). The benefits of DESs over BMSs for TLR were seen at 1 year, and this significant difference was maintained for up to 3 years. For the TVR outcome there were statistically significant differences in favour of any-type DES over BMS for most of the time points assessed. 4.2 Cost effectiveness Published literature 4.2.1 A total of 10 full economic evaluations were included in the assessment report, all of which compared an SES with a BMS, although four evaluations
