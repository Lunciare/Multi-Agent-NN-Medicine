Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

compared the PES (Taxus) with the equivalent BMS, for a general population and for subgroups. The incremental costs per QALY at 1 year were given as £29,587 for the overall population and £1,020 for patients with diabetes. For patients with small vessels and long lesions, the PES (Taxus) was dominant (both more effective and less costly than the BMS). For the PES (Taxus) at 2 years, the incremental cost per QALY for the overall population was given as £13,394, and it was dominant for patients with small vessels and those with diabetes. The model was highly sensitive to variations in the duration of clopidogrel therapy and the average number of stents used. In the manufacturer's sensitivity analyses, when the number of stents used per procedure was increased from 1.4 to 1.7, in line with the Assessment Group's model, the estimated cost per QALY at 1 year for the overall population increased to £56,731; however, the subgroup estimates were only marginally increased. If the duration of clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation was increased from 6 to 12 months, the cost per QALY at 12 months increased to £71,634 for the total population and to over £30,000 for the subgroup with diabetes.
