Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

economic model. It considered the absolute rate of revascularisation of BMSs in the total population of stented patients and noted that the Assessment Group used 7.43% for patients in its base case in the assessment report. The Committee heard testimony from the clinical specialists that the rate of revascularisation of BMSs was around 12% in the published literature. It noted that some of these published trials included protocol-driven angiography and revascularisation and therefore were likely to be an overestimate of actual revascularisation rates in clinical practice in the UK. The Committee noted that the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data revascularisation rates were lower than those from other data sets including the BASKET trial (11%), which had not included protocol-driven angiography, and the Scottish Registry (11.5%). The Committee discussed the range of possible values for revascularisation and their relevance to UK practice and concluded that a rate of 11% for the absolute rate of revascularisation was a reasonable estimate for UK practice. 4.3.7 The Committee considered the relative reduction in the risk of target lesion revascularisation with DESs. The Committee noted that the trial data typically gave a relative risk reduction of 75%, but considered that this figure might over- estimate
