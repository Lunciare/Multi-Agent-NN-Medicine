Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

luminal loss. Revascularisation was usually prompted by protocol-driven angiographic evidence of restenosis either for all participants or for a selected subgroup of participants. Only one trial (BASKET) explicitly reported that no protocol-driven angiographic follow-up was included. This trial compared both SES (Cypher) and PES (Taxus) DESs with a newer BMS in a three-arm study. 4.1.3 All but three of the 17 RCTs were multicentre trials. Study size ranged from 60 to over 1300 patients. Of the 17 trials, 11 included patients with single lesions. The studies covered a range of vessel diameters from 2.25 mm to 4.00 mm, although the lower range was not reported in some studies. Lesion length also varied, ranging from 10 mm to 33 mm, although again the data were not always reported. All studies permitted the inclusion of people with diabetes, and all but three studies excluded acute or evolving MI. The presence of unprotected left main coronary artery excluded patients from many trials, as did severe calcification or tortuosity, total occlusion, bifurcation, the presence of thrombus in the target vessel, previous PCI within 30 days or PCI other than balloon required as part of the study intervention. 4.1.4 A total of 12 trials described
