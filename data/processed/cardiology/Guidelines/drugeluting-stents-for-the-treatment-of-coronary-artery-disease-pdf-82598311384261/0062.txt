those with long lesions and those with small vessels) using a DES, with a relative risk reduction of 65%, the resulting ICERs were associated with costs per QALYs of £126,000 and £95,000, respectively, at a price difference of £600 and £47,000 and £25,000, respectively, at a price difference of £300. 4.3.13 Reflecting the testimony of the clinical specialists and the comments received during consultation, the Committee noted the small differences in the key parameters between those that the Committee had previously agreed and those suggested by BCIS. The Committee noted that the ICERs resulting from using the parameter values suggested by the BCIS into the Assessment Group's model for a price difference of £600 were associated with costs per QALYs of approximately: £111,000 for all patients; £51,000 for long lesions; £53,000 for diabetes; and £59,000 for small vessels. For a price difference of £300 the resulting ICERs were associated with costs per QALYs below £5,000 for patients with small vessels and long lesions. The Committee was not, however, persuaded that all of the parameter values suggested by BCIS were plausible, but it agreed that the percentages of elective and non-elective patients at presentation should be 57% elective to 43% non-elective.
