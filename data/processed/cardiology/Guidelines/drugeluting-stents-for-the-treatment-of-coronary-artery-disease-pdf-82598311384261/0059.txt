the Committee considered a relative risk reduction with DESs over BMSs of 55% in the base case, and of 65% in a sensitivity analysis for the higher risk groups were the most plausible. 4.3.8 The Committee considered the mean number of stents used for each of the risk groups from the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data and concluded that the estimate of mean number of stents per patient (1.6 for elective patients, 1.5 for non-elective patients) was likely to be a representative figure of the number used in all patients in the UK and could be used as a base case for consideration of the benefits of DESs. 4.3.9 The Committee was mindful of data in the literature on the mortality and morbidity of CABG and repeat angiography. After reviewing the utility values in the Assessment Group's model the Committee acknowledged the possibility that there could be an additional disutility associated with CABG during the initial 6 weeks following the procedure compared with PCI. The Committee accepted the Assessment Group's revisions for this parameter. 4.3.10 The Committee noted the current UK recommendation that clopidogrel should be given for an additional 9 months in patients receiving a DES and it therefore
