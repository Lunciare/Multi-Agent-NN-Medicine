with the SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus) was determined from a meta-analysis of two trials at 6 to 9 months (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.89). A reduction in the composite event rate (MACE) at 6 to 9 months was also statistically significant with the SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus; OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96). Effects of DESs on the risks of thrombosis, MI and mortality 4.1.22 In December 2006, following publication of data on longer-term risks associated with DES (thrombosis, MI and mortality), the FDA convened a public meeting of its Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel to review and analyse the available data and to provide recommendations for appropriate actions to address this issue. In January 2007, the Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel made recommendations to the FDA. The Panel stated, 'When the DES, which are indicated for use in the USA (SES [Cypher]) and (PES [Taxus]), are used in accordance with their approved indications both are associated with a small increase in stent thrombosis compared with BMS at 1 year after stent implantation; the increased risk of stent thrombosis was not associated with an increased risk of death or MI compared
