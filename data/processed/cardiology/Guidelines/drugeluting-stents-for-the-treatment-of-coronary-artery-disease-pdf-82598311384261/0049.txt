Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

of the groups of elective patients are approximately: £407,000 for all patients; £380,000 for long lesions; £340,000 for diabetes; and £306,000 for small vessels. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient for non-elective patients (1.467) the resulting incremental costs per QALY for each of the groups, at a price difference of £600, are: £282,000 for all patients; £250,000 for long lesions; £353,000 for diabetes; and £94,000 for small vessels. 4.2.25 Based on the Liverpool Cardiothoracic Centre audit data, the Assessment Group's re-analysis of the base-case scenario assumes an 11% overall revascularisation rate for the total population of stented patients in the UK at 12 months after PCI with BMSs. Using 11% for all patients, the absolute rates of repeat revascularisation for the risk factors become: 11.7% for long lesions; 11.6% for diabetes; and 19% for small vessels. The relative risk reduction with DESs is assumed to be 55%. Using the overall mean number of stents implanted per patient from the Liverpool audit data, both elective and non-elective (1.571) and assuming a price difference of £600 (approximate average of the price difference of the PES [Taxus] and the SES [Cypher], from the survey data) the resulting incremental costs
