Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

sensitive were taken from a single positive trial. 4.2.7 The submission from Kiwimed compared an SES (Yukon) with the Kiwimed BMS for a total population. The effectiveness data were taken from the SES (Cypher) trials, so an untested assumption was made that the SES (Yukon) has equivalent effectiveness to the SES (Cypher). Extrapolation from 2 to 5 years was undertaken using an assumption that patients remained in the same health state that they were in at the end of 1 year. Kiwimed's submission stated that the model results indicated that the SES (Yukon) was dominant compared with the BMS in the total population. In a sensitivity analysis varying the cost of the stent and the probability of restenosis, the ICERs for the SES (Yukon) were always under £30,000 per QALY. Assessment Group model: methods 4.2.8 The Assessment Group's model used the framework from the original appraisal with some minor modifications as follows: the time horizon was restricted to 1 year, so no discounting was necessary; particular risk groups were examined; in addition to the modelling of any-type DES compared with BMS, some head to head comparisons were conducted (SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus). 4.2.9 A difference between the
