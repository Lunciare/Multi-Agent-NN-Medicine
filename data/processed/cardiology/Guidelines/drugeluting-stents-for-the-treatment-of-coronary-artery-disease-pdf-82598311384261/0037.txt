Drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease

in addition to the modelling of any-type DES compared with BMS, some head to head comparisons were conducted (SES (Cypher) compared with the PES (Taxus). 4.2.9 A difference between the effectiveness of DES and BMS was only seen with regard to revascularisation (TLR and TVR) and event rate (MACE and TVF). For these endpoints, the clinical trials show evidence of differences between DESs and BMSs at 1 year. The clinical trials show evidence in favour of DESs over all follow-up periods up to 3 years with a trend towards the greatest benefit occurring within the first year. 4.2.10 In the Assessment Group's model the most important factors in determining the incremental cost were the additional cost per DES implanted (price premium/ difference) and the number of stents implanted per patient. The most important factors in determining benefit in the model were the absolute risk of revascularisation for patients treated with a BMS and the risk reduction attributable to the use of a DES. 4.2.11 The acquisition cost of a given stent may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts. The Assessment Group in their economic evaluation used the prices from a market survey of NHS purchasers. The survey
