all of the parameter values suggested by BCIS were plausible, but it agreed that the percentages of elective and non-elective patients at presentation should be 57% elective to 43% non-elective. The Committee noted that taking account of this assumption would decrease the ICERs seen in the updated analysis for long lesions and small vessels (see 4.3.12), which means that, at a price difference of £300, the plausible ICERs would be much lower than cost per QALYs of £47,000 and £25,000, respectively. 4.3.14 The Committee agreed that DESs could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources at a price difference of £600. After considering the alternative parameter values presented by the Assessment Group and BCIS, the Committee concluded that on balance at a price difference between DESs and BMSs of not more than £300, DESs could be considered a cost effective option in patients with small vessels and long lesions, and should be recommended for use in these patient groups. The Committee's decision was based on a price difference of £300 between BMSs and DESs. The Committee noted that procurement arrangements for DESs at a price difference of £300 was already in place within many NHS regions and achievable
