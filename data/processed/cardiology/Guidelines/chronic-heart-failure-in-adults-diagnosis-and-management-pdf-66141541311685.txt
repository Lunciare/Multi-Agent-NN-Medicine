Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline replaces CG108.
This guideline is the basis of QS167, QS9 and QS181.
Overview
This guideline covers diagnosing and managing chronic heart failure in people aged 18 and
over. It aims to improve diagnosis and treatment to increase the length and quality of life
for people with heart failure.
NICE has also produced a guideline on acute heart failure.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• People with heart failure and their families and carers

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about
their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing
medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws
(including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
Healthcare professionals should follow our general guidelines for people delivering care:
• patient experience in adult NHS services
• shared decision making
• medicines adherence
• medicines optimisation
• multimorbidity
1.1 Team working in the management of heart
failure
1.1.1 The specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team (MDT) should work in
collaboration with the primary care team, and should include a:
• lead physician with subspecialty training in heart failure (usually a consultant
cardiologist) who is responsible for making the clinical diagnosis
• specialist heart failure nurse
• healthcare professional with expertise in specialist prescribing for heart
failure, for example, a specialist heart failure pharmacist. [2018 amended
2025]
1.1.2 The specialist heart failure MDT should:

conditions#notice-of-rights). 39
--- Страница 7 ---
Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
• diagnose heart failure
• give information to people with newly diagnosed heart failure (see the
section on giving information to people with heart failure)
• manage newly diagnosed, recently decompensated or advanced heart failure
(New York Heart Association class III to IV)
• optimise treatment
• start new medicines that need specialist supervision
• continue to manage heart failure after an interventional procedure such as
implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronisation device
• manage heart failure that is not responding to treatment. [2018]
1.1.3 The specialist heart failure MDT should directly involve, or refer people to, other
services, including rehabilitation, services for older people and palliative care
services, as needed. [2018]
1.1.4 The primary care team should carry out the following, at all times, for people with
heart failure, including during periods when the person is also receiving specialist
heart failure care from the MDT:
• ensure effective communication links between different care settings and
clinical services involved in the person's care
• lead a full review of the person's heart failure care, which may form part of a
long-term conditions review
• recall the person at least every 6 months and update the clinical record
• ensure that changes to the clinical record are understood and agreed by the
person with heart failure and shared with the specialist heart failure MDT
• arrange access to specialist heart failure services if needed. [2018]

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Care after an acute event
For recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute heart failure, see NICE's
guideline on acute heart failure.
1.1.5 Discharge people with heart failure from hospital when their clinical condition is
stable, and a management plan is in place. Take into account the wishes of the
person and their family or carers, and the level of care and support that can be
provided in the community. [2003]
1.1.6 The primary care team should take over routine management of heart failure as
soon as it has been stabilised and its management optimised. [2018]
Writing a care plan
1.1.7 The specialist heart failure MDT should write a summary for each person with
heart failure that includes:
• diagnosis and aetiology
• medicines prescribed, monitoring of medicines, when medicines should be
reviewed and any support the person needs to take the medicines
• functional abilities and any social care needs
• social circumstances, including carers' needs. [2018]
1.1.8 Use the summary as the basis of the person's care plan, which should include:
• plans for managing the person's heart failure, including follow-up care,
rehabilitation and access to social care
• symptoms to look out for in case of deterioration
• a process for any subsequent access to the specialist heart failure MDT if
needed
• contact details for

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
－ a named healthcare coordinator (usually a specialist heart failure nurse)
－ alternative local heart failure specialist care providers, for urgent care or
review.
• additional sources of information for people with heart failure. [2018]
1.1.9 Give a copy of the care plan to the person with heart failure, their family or carers
if appropriate, and all health and social care professionals involved in their care.
[2018]
1.2 Diagnosing heart failure
Symptoms, signs and investigations
1.2.1 Take a history and perform a clinical examination and tests to confirm the
presence of heart failure. [2010]
1.2.2 Measure N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in people with
suspected heart failure. [2018]
1.2.3 Because very high levels of NT-proBNP carry a poor prognosis, refer people with
suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level more than 2,000 nanogram per
litre (236 picomole per litre) urgently, to have specialist assessment and
transthoracic echocardiography within 2 weeks. [2018]
1.2.4 Refer people with suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level between 400
and 2,000 nanogram per litre (47 to 236 pmol per litre) to have specialist
assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within 6 weeks. [2018]
1.2.5 Be aware that:
• an NT-proBNP level of less than 400 nanogram per litre (47 pmol per litre) in
an untreated person makes a diagnosis of heart failure less likely
• the level of serum natriuretic peptide does not differentiate between heart

conditions#notice-of-rights). 39
--- Страница 10 ---
Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
failure with preserved, mildly reduced and reduced ejection fraction. [2018,
amended 2025]
1.2.6 Review alternative causes for symptoms of heart failure in people with NT-
proBNP levels of less than 400 nanogram per litre. If there is still concern that the
symptoms might be related to heart failure, discuss with a physician with
subspeciality training in heart failure. [2018]
1.2.7 Be aware that:
• obesity, African or African–Caribbean ethnic background, or treatment with
the following can reduce levels of serum natriuretic peptides:
－ a diuretic
－ an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin
receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker
(ARB)
－ a beta-blocker
－ a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)
• high levels of serum natriuretic peptides can have causes other than heart
failure (for example, pulmonary, renal, liver and systemic pathologies, sepsis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or cirrhosis of the liver).
[2010, amended 2025]
1.2.8 Perform transthoracic echocardiography to exclude important valve disease,
assess the systolic (and diastolic) function of the left ventricle and detect
intracardiac shunts. See the section on referral for echocardiography and
specialist assessment in NICE's guideline on heart valve disease. [2003,
amended 2018]
1.2.9 Use high-resolution equipment operated by someone trained to the relevant
professional standards to perform transthoracic echocardiography. Do not allow
the need and demand for these investigations to compromise quality. [2003,
amended 2018]

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
1.2.10 Ensure that those reporting echocardiography are experienced in doing so.
[2003]
1.2.11 Think about alternative methods of imaging the heart (for example, radionuclide
angiography [multigated acquisition scanning], cardiac MRI or transoesophageal
echocardiography) if a poor image is produced by transthoracic
echocardiography. [2003, amended 2018]
1.2.12 Perform an ECG and consider the following tests to evaluate possible aggravating
factors or alternative diagnoses:
• chest X-ray
• blood tests:
－ renal function profile
－ thyroid function profile
－ liver function profile
－ lipid profile
－ glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA )
1c
－ full blood count
• urinalysis
• peak flow or spirometry. [2010, amended 2018]
1.2.13 Try to exclude other disorders that may present in a similar manner. [2003]
1.2.14 When a diagnosis of heart failure has been made, assess severity, aetiology,
precipitating factors, type of cardiac dysfunction and correctable causes. [2010]
Heart failure caused by valve disease
1.2.15 Refer people with heart failure caused by valve disease for specialist assessment

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
and advice regarding follow-up. See the section on referral for echocardiography
and specialist assessment in NICE's guideline on heart valve disease. [2003]
Reviewing existing diagnoses
1.2.16 Review the basis for a historical diagnosis of heart failure and manage care in
accordance with this guideline only if the diagnosis is confirmed with cardiac
imaging. [2003]
1.2.17 If heart failure is still suspected, but an underlying cardiac abnormality has not
been identified, then refer to the specialist heart failure team. [2003]
1.3 Giving information to people with heart failure
1.3.1 Discuss the person's prognosis in a sensitive, open and honest manner. Be frank
about the uncertainty in predicting the course of their heart failure. Revisit this
discussion as the person's condition evolves. [2018]
First consultations for people with newly diagnosed heart failure
1.3.2 The specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team (MDT) should offer people with
newly diagnosed heart failure an extended first consultation, followed by a
second consultation to take place within 2 weeks if possible. At each
consultation:
• discuss the person's diagnosis and prognosis
• explain heart failure terminology
• discuss treatments
• discuss the risk of sudden death, including any misconceptions about that
risk
• encourage the person and their family or carers to ask any questions they

have. [2018]
1.4 Treating people with newly diagnosed and pre-
existing heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction
See recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 for guidance on how to introduce the medicines listed
in recommendations 1.4.1, 1.4.3 and 1.4.4. See also the section on other treatments and
advice for all types of heart failure.
Treatment combinations
1.4.1 Offer an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and a sodium-glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to people with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction. [2025]
1.4.2 For people on the maximum tolerated dose of each of the 4 medicines who
continue to have symptoms of heart failure, consider switching the ACE inhibitor
to an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). [2025]
Alternative treatment combinations if certain medicines are not
tolerated
1.4.3 For people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who have symptoms
of intolerance to ACE inhibitors (other than angioedema), offer an ARNI, beta-
blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. [2025]
1.4.4 For people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, or who have symptoms
of intolerance to ARNIs:
• offer a beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor and
• consider an ARB. [2025]

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on treatment
combinations for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A:
medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Intravenous iron therapy
1.4.5 In people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, assess iron status and
check for anaemia with all of the following blood tests:
• transferrin saturation (TSAT)
• serum ferritin
• haemoglobin. [2025]
1.4.6 Consider iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose for people
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and haemoglobin of less than
150 g per litre if they have iron deficiency defined as:
• TSAT of less than 20% or
• serum ferritin of less than 100 nanogram per ml. [2025]
1.4.7 If iron deficiency anaemia is identified, do not assume that it is related to the
person's heart failure and think about investigating for alternative causes. [2025]
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on IV iron therapy for
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Beta-blockers
1.7.9 Do not withhold treatment with a beta-blocker solely because of age or the
presence of peripheral vascular disease, erectile dysfunction, diabetes, interstitial
pulmonary disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [2010]
1.7.10 Assess for heart rhythm, heart rate and conduction abnormalities using a 12-lead
ECG before deciding whether to prescribe a beta-blocker. [2025]
1.7.11 Do not offer a beta-blocker to people with second-degree or third-degree heart
block who do not have a pacemaker or to people with bradycardia (that is, a
heart rate of less than 50 beats per minute). [2025]

1.8 Clinical review
1.8.1 Monitor all people with heart failure. Provide:
• a clinical assessment of functional capacity, fluid status, cardiac rhythm
(minimum of examining the pulse), cognitive status and nutritional status
• a review of medication, including need for changes and possible side effects
• an assessment of renal function
• iron status and haemoglobin measurement.
Note: This is a minimum. Provide further monitoring for people with
comorbidities or co-prescribed medications. [2010, amended 2025]
1.8.2 Provide more detailed monitoring if the person has significant comorbidity or if
their condition has deteriorated since the previous review. [2003]
1.8.3 Determine the frequency of monitoring based on the person's clinical status and
the stability of their condition. If the person's clinical condition or medication has
changed, use a short timeframe for monitoring (days to every 2 weeks). For
stable people with proven heart failure, monitor at least every 6 months. [2003]
1.8.4 For people with heart failure who want to be involved in monitoring their
condition, provide sufficient education and support from their healthcare
professional to enable this to happen, with clear guidance on what to do in the
event of deterioration. [2003]
People under 75 with normal renal function
1.8.5 For people aged under 75 in specialist care settings with heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) more
than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, consider measuring N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide as part of optimising treatment. [2018]

heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. For full details, see the guidance on
implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy
(TA314, 2014).
1.10.4 When discussing implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator:
• explain the risks, benefits and consequences of cardioverter defibrillator
implantation, following the principles on shared decision making in NICE's
guideline on shared decision making
• ensure the person knows that the defibrillator function can be deactivated
without affecting any cardiac resynchronisation or pacing, and reactivated
later
• explain the circumstances in which deactivation might be offered
• discuss and dispel common misconceptions about the function of the device
and the consequences of deactivation
• provide the person and, if they wish, their family or carers, with written
information covering the information discussed. [2018]

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect practice.
Treatment combinations for heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction
Recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
Evidence showed adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to existing
treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor
blocker (ARB), beta-blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) reduced
mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure without important increases in adverse
events. The committee agreed that treatment combinations for people with heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction should now include an SGLT2 inhibitor.
Similar benefits were seen when adding an MRA to existing treatment with an ACE inhibitor
or ARB and beta-blocker although there was an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. The
committee agreed an MRA should remain part of the treatment combination for people
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Economic modelling based on the clinical trials and real-world data suggested that early
use of an MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor in combination with ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker
would be cost-effective. For this reason and because the correct sequencing of medicines
will vary from 1 person to another, the committee agreed to move away from a set of
recommendations that include a sequence for introducing each medicine and instead
listed treatment combinations for different scenarios.
Evidence comparing treatment with an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker and MRA against
treatment with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker and MRA
showed reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for the group of people taking the
treatment combination with an ARNI. More falls were seen in those taking an ARNI, while

conditions#notice-of-rights). 39
--- Страница 31 ---
Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
hyperkalaemia was more common among those taking an ACE inhibitor. The committee
agreed that an ARNI can replace an ACE inhibitor in people who remain symptomatic when
receiving the combination of ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor.
However, where this combination is providing symptomatic improvement, switching to an
ARNI is not advised because it is not as cost effective as an ACE inhibitor. The committee
was aware that there should be a period of at least 36 hours between taking the last dose
of an ACE inhibitor and the first dose of an ARNI.
Economic modelling showed that ARNIs were cost effective compared to ARBs. The
committee agreed that an ARNI should be offered instead of an ACE inhibitor to people
who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors (other than angioedema). The
previous first choice in this situation was an ARB. The committee agreed that an ARB can
still be used for people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, or who have
symptoms of intolerance to ARNIs.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Growing numbers of people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are being
prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor or ARNI and these recommendations are likely to accelerate
this trend. There is likely to be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure as a result of
this change in prescribing.
Return to recommendations
Intravenous iron therapy for heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction
Recommendations 1.4.5 to 1.4.7
Why the committee made the recommendations
Evidence showed intravenous (IV) iron (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose or ferric
derisomaltose) improved exercise tolerance and quality of life in the first year for people
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency. Some trials also
showed reduced hospitalisation for heart failure. One study showed a significant risk of
hypophosphatemia with ferric carboxymaltose. As hypophosphatemia can be monitored
and treated, the committee agreed that the risk of this did not outweigh the expected

conditions#notice-of-rights). 39
--- Страница 32 ---
Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
benefits of IV iron.
There was evidence that IV iron therapy is cost-effective in people with heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency and so the committee focused on this
population. They agreed to define iron deficiency according to the definition used in the
trials.
To support the recommendation on when to consider IV iron, the committee made a
recommendation to assess iron status with blood tests for transferrin saturation (TSAT)
and serum ferritin, as well as measuring haemoglobin to check for anaemia.
The committee highlighted the importance of considering alternative causes of iron
deficiency anaemia when it is identified, but also the need to get the correct balance
against over-investigating.
As only 1 small trial was available for the mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction
population, the committee made a recommendation for research on use of IV iron therapy
in adults with iron deficiency and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection
fraction.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The use of IV iron therapy to treat iron deficiency in people with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction is quite common. In some places this might be a change in practice. With
increased use of IV iron therapy there could be a reduction in hospitalisation.
Return to recommendations
Treatment combinations for heart failure with
mildly reduced ejection fraction
Recommendations 1.5.1 and 1.5.2
Why the committee made the recommendations
Evidence suggested each of the following medicines reduce hospitalisation for heart
failure, and possibly mortality, in people with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection

fraction: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker
(ARB), beta-blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). In practice, an ACE
inhibitor and ARB would not be prescribed together because of the lack of additional
benefit and risk of adverse events. There was no cost-effectiveness evidence for these
medicines, but all are relatively cheap in their generic form.
Evidence comparing use of an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) with use of
an ARB for treating heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction showed no difference
in mortality rates. Economic evidence also showed that ARNIs were not cost effective for
this population group and so were not recommended.
The committee did not review the evidence for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors because the NICE technology appraisals 929 and 902 already recommend them
as treatment options for people with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction.
The committee therefore agreed they should be considered alongside the other
medicines.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Although this is a new recommendation for NICE, most people in this population will
already be receiving a combination of these medicines, if not contraindicated and
depending on comorbidities. Where there is an impact, it will include extra staff time for
consultations to establish the correct combination and dose of each of medicine. However,
there should be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure.
Return to the recommendations
Treatment combinations for heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction
Recommendation 1.5.4
Why the committee made the recommendation
Evidence showed treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) reduced
hospitalisation for heart failure and may also improve all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. However, there was

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Although this requires careful monitoring and
management the committee agreed this should not prevent them from recommending
MRAs for this population group.
The committee did not review the evidence for sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors because the NICE technology appraisals 929 and 902 already recommend them
as treatment options for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The
committee therefore agreed they should be considered alongside MRAs.
How the recommendation might affect practice
This is a significant change in practice. The impact will include staff time for consultation
to establish the correct dose of MRA and treatment of hyperkalaemia. However, there is
likely to be a reduction in hospitalisation for heart failure.
Return to recommendation
Starting and monitoring medicine use
Recommendations 1.7.1 and 1.7.2, recommendations 1.7.3 to 1.7.5 and 1.7.7 and 1.7.8 and
recommendations 1.7.10, 1.7.11 and 1.7.13
Why the committee made the recommendations
The order in which the medicines should be prescribed should be based on the presenting
symptoms, comorbidities and past medical history and the preferences of the person, for
example, expected side effects.
It is not necessary to optimise the dose of a medicine before introducing another. How
quickly to introduce the medicines depends on a number of factors including symptoms,
frailty, blood pressure and renal function.
Based on their experience and expertise, the committee agreed that angiotensin receptor-
neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) could be prescribed by primary care prescribers without the
advice of a heart failure specialist. However, in some circumstances, advice from a heart
specialist might be needed and so should be considered.

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Evidence showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin
receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can affect renal function and electrolyte
levels. However, these risks can be managed by measuring a person's electrolyte levels
and renal function at baseline and at regular intervals or after increasing their dose. Local
guidelines should be followed rather than automatically discontinuing a medicine if there is
a rise in serum creatinine of more than 50% or potassium concentrations increase to more
than 5.5 mmol per litre.
The importance of measuring blood pressure after each dose increment was also stressed
by the committee as postural hypotension is a common cause of hospital admission in
older people.
Beta-blockers can affect heart rate and rhythm. The committee agreed, based on their
expertise and experience, that a 12-lead ECG should be undertaken in everyone before
prescribing them a beta-blocker.
The committee supported the current clinical practice of not offering a beta-blocker if a
person has second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia, that is a heart rate of less
than 50 beats per minute. They discussed using beta-blockers in symptomatic people with
bradycardia, and agreed that repeating a 12-lead ECG after each dose increment was a
reasonable safety measure to ensure early detection of any new arrhythmias or
conduction abnormalities that could indicate intolerance to the increased dose.
How the recommendation might affect practice
The recommendations reflect current practice but might increase prescribing of ARNIs by
dropping the requirement that these medicines should be initiated by a heart failure
specialist.

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
Context
Key facts and figures
Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs caused by impaired
heart function. When this affects mainly the left ventricle, it can be due to either weakness
of contraction or impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. Other problems affecting the
right ventricle, the heart valves, the pulmonary circulation or the pericardium can lead to
the development of heart failure.
Almost 1 million people in the UK are currently diagnosed with heart failure, with 200,000
new cases each year. Both the incidence and prevalence of heart failure increase steeply
with age. The average age at diagnosis is 76 years. Increases in life expectancy, including
for people with ischaemic heart disease and hypertension, has increased the incidence of
heart failure. The increased prevalence of obesity is another contributor to the rising
incidence and prevalence of heart failure.
Current practice
NICE's 2018 guideline on chronic heart failure concentrated on the weak left ventricular
contraction phenotype of heart failure, otherwise called heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction, as it was then the only phenotype of chronic heart failure where we had
evidence-based treatments. The treatment algorithm then was based on stepwise
introduction of medicines aiming to provide people with at least angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and, if remaining symptomatic, mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists (MRAs). Those who continued to be symptomatic would be
considered by the specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team for 1 or more of 4 further
medicines.
Since 2018, we have seen new developments in the treatment of not only heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction, but also new evidence emerged for the treatment of the people
with heart failure due to stiff ventricle, called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction;
in addition to some evidence for treating those with heart failure with mildly reduced
ejection fraction.

Chronic heart failure in adults: diagnosis and management (NG106)
In people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction there will be a need to change
the ethos of stepwise introduction of medicines and allow early initiation of multiple
medicines before optimising the doses of each. The reason for the different approach
being the evidence for impact on people's symptoms and prognosis at an early stage of
introduction of each medicine class, and the tendency of all classes of medicine to lower
blood pressure which, when exaggerated by optimising the dose of some of the
medicines, can render the person unable to receive further treatment with other
medicines.
