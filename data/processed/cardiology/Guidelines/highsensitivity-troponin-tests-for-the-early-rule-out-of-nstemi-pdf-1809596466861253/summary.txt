1 Recommendations 1.1 The following high-sensitivity troponin tests are recommended as options for the early rule out of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in people presenting to an emergency department with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome: • Access High-Sensitivity Troponin I Assay • ADVIA Centaur High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin-I Assay • Alinity High Sensitive Troponin-I assay • ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I assay • Atellica IM High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay • Dimension Vista High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay • Dimension EXL High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay • Elecsys Troponin T-high sensitive assay • Elecsys Troponin T-high sensitive STAT assay • VIDAS High sensitive Troponin I assay • VITROS High Sensitivity Troponin I Assay. 1.2 The tests are recommended for use with different early rule-out test strategies alongside clinical judgement, including: • A single sample on presentation using a threshold at or near the limit of detection, which will vary depending on the assay being used. If this sample is positive it should not be used to rule in NSTEMI.
