High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

general (mixed) population 99th percentile, and sex-specific 99th percentiles. The committee recalled that all single-sample strategies and multiple sample strategies included in the model were highly sensitive, that is, they had a low false negative rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). It considered that strategies in which people could be safely discharged after the first test could be beneficial because fewer people would have to remain in the emergency department for a second test. The committee noted further that all strategies were cost effective compared with a standard troponin test strategy (see section 4.13). The committee concluded that recommending a range of early rule-out strategies would enable hospitals to use strategies that worked with the set up of their emergency department. Further diagnostic accuracy evidence is needed before the TriageTrue test can be recommended for routine clinical use 4.17 The TriageTrue point-of-care test, when used in the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour pathway, was cost effective compared with a standard troponin test strategy, with an ICER of less than £5,000 per QALY gained. The committee considered that the potential benefits associated with the rapid turnaround times of point-of-care tests (see section 4.9) may not have been fully captured in the
