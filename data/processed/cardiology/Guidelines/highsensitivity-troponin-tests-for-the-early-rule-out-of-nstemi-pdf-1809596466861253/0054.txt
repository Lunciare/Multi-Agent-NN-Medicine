High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

tests should be comparable. It also concluded that it was the responsibility of individual laboratories to assess the equivalency of these tests in practice, and to validate their diagnostic performance against their current system. This would be achieved in part by participating in external quality assessment schemes. Cost effectiveness Only including early rule-out strategies with a minimum sensitivity of 97% in the economic analysis is acceptable 4.11 Only early rule-out strategies with a sensitivity of 97% or more were used in the cost-effectiveness modelling, based on expert opinion about the minimum sensitivity acceptable in clinical practice. The committee noted that this approach could mean that some potentially cost-effective strategies were excluded from the economic modelling. But overall it agreed that it was an acceptable approach that was necessary to keep the number of test strategies in the economic model manageable and ensure that those considered were likely to be safe in practice. The prognostic benefits associated with a false positive high- sensitivity troponin test should be incorporated into decision making 4.12 The secondary analysis incorporated prognostic benefits associated with false positive high-sensitivity troponin test results. Clinical experts noted that it is now widely accepted that people with a negative standard
