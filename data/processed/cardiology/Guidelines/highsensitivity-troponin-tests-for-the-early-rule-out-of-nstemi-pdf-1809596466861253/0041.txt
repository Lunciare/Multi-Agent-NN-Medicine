0.66 21 TriageTrue ESC 0/1-hour pathway (0.01) (0.02) ESC, European Society of Cardiology; SE, standard error; ng/litre is nanograms troponin per litre of blood. 3.42 Test-specific resource use consisted of the number of tests done and the duration of hospital stay in hours before discharge or acute myocardial infarction treatment. For test strategies that involved a subsequent test conditional on the outcome of the first test, the rule-out rate for the presentation sample was used to calculate the number of subsequent tests. The resource use included a delay from the time at which sampling could be done to the time at which results became available (2 hours) and delay between arrival at hospital and troponin assessment starting (1 hour). 3.43 Health state costs were taken from a retrospective cohort study done in the UK (Danese et al. 2016). Acute myocardial infarction treatment costs were based on NHS reference costs and hospital stay costs were based on data from the Personal Social Services Research Unit. 3.44 In the base case, test costs were assumed to be identical for all tests (£2.50) except for the point-of-care test (£25.00, based on information provided by Quidel). A scenario analysis was done using test-specific costs
