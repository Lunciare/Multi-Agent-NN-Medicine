sensitivity and specificity estimates were 100% (95% CI 95 to 100) and 60% (95% CI 55 to 64) respectively for NSTEMI. TriageTrue High-Sensitivity Troponin I Test 3.19 The study evaluating the TriageTrue test assessed the ESC 0/1-hour rule-out pathway. This combined an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 4 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre and an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 3 ng/litre. The reported sensitivity of this strategy was 100% (95% CI 97 to 100) and the specificity was 66% (95% CI 62 to 70) for NSTEMI. ADVIA Centaur high-sensitivity Troponin I assay 3.20 Three studies evaluated the ADVIA Centaur test. Using a rule-out threshold of 2 ng/litre in a single sample taken on presentation, the sensitivity and specificity estimates were 100% (95% CI 99 to 100) and 23% (95% CI 21 to 25) respectively for NSTEMI. Two multiple sample strategies were evaluated. One followed the ESC 0/1-hour rule-out pathway. This combined an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 3 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial concentration of less than 6
