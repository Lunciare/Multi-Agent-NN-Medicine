High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

economic evidence 3.33 Studies were eligible if they reported a full economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of either high-sensitivity troponin testing or standard troponin testing. They also had to include survival or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as an outcome measure. 3.34 Five studies identified in the original assessment report and 1 new study were included in the systematic review. Results varied in the 5 studies from the original report, and the EAG concluded that there was uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using high-sensitivity troponin testing. The EAG noted that the key drivers of cost effectiveness in the included studies were the accuracy of high-sensitivity troponin tests, and the efficiency of decision making once test results were available. 3.35 The most recent study (Ambavane et al. 2017) reported that a 1-hour strategy using high-sensitivity troponin testing had higher sensitivity (87% compared with 69%) but lower specificity (96% compared with 97%) than standard care. The reference standard used to calculate diagnostic accuracy was determination of final diagnosis based on a comprehensive review of medical records. Total costs were less for the 1-hour strategy compared with standard care (£2,480 compared with £4,561). This was mainly because of a shorter
