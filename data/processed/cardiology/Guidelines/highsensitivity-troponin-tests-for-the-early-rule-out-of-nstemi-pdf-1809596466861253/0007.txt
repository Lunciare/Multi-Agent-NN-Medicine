High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

paramagnetic particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Results are available in 17 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 17.5 ng/litre for the whole population • 11.6 ng/litre for women • 19.8 ng/litre for men. Each 99th percentile has a coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I in more than 97% of the reference population. ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I assay (Abbott Diagnostics) 2.7 The ARCHITECT test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR and i1000SR analysers. The test is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Results are available in 18 minutes. The ARCHITECT test can detect troponin I in 96% of the reference population. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 26.2 ng/litre for the whole population with a CV of 4% • 15.6 ng/litre for women (CV 5.3%) • 34.2 ng/litre for men (CV 3.5%). Alinity High Sensitive Troponin-I assay (Abbott Diagnostics) 2.8 The Alinity test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Alinity i analyser. It is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for the
