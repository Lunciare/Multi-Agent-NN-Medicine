High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

95% confidence intervals) of these inputs, standard troponin testing remains cheaper and less effective than the high- sensitivity troponin tests. 4 Committee discussion Quick, accurate tests may reduce anxiety for patients and carers 4.1 The committee heard from a patient expert who highlighted the stresses and fears that patients and their families experience when attending the emergency department with chest pain. Reducing waiting times is important for patients. Technologies that reduce the time taken from sample to clinical decision, while providing good diagnostic accuracy, may help reduce patient anxiety. Patients may be reassured that they are having the most appropriate treatment with tests that provide an accurate result. Flexibility on tests and strategies helps hospitals 4.2 NICE has previously recommended high-sensitivity troponin for early rule out of acute myocardial infarction, so most emergency departments are already set up for high-sensitivity troponin testing. Many have implemented early rule-out strategies as routine practice. The committee considered that there were practical issues around early rule-out strategies that incorporate serial testing but that these could be resolved in practice. It also considered that, if more tests and different testing strategies were found to be cost effective and were recommended, this would help with procurement
