is detecting or ruling out non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 2.3 The optimum sensitivity of older (non-high-sensitivity) troponin tests (referred to here as standard troponin tests) for acute myocardial infarction is 10 to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. For many people, this means hospital admission and observation while serial troponin testing is done. To overcome this, high- sensitivity troponin tests have been developed. These can detect lower levels of troponin in the blood earlier than standard troponin tests, so enable early rule out of NSTEMI after the onset of acute chest pain. This could lead to fewer people being admitted to hospital, earlier discharge for people with normal troponin levels and earlier intervention for those with a confirmed NSTEMI. 2.4 NICE's 2014 guidance on high-sensitivity troponin tests recommended the Elecsys troponin T-high sensitive test and ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I test as options for the early rule out of NSTEMI in people presenting to an emergency department with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome. Since that guidance was published, NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin has been updated to include high- sensitivity troponin tests. But stakeholder feedback suggests that high-sensitivity troponin testing used
