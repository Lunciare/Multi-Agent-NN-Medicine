they are run on different analysers. They are therefore also recommended. Although the TriageTrue test has the potential to be cost effective, its diagnostic accuracy when used on whole blood is uncertain. 2 The diagnostic tests Clinical need and practice 2.1 Chest pain and suspected myocardial infarction were the cause of about 5% of all emergency hospital admissions in 2017 to 2018. However, myocardial infarction will have occurred in only about 20% of those admissions. Tests that can quickly tell whether a person is having a myocardial infarction or not could mean that unnecessary hospital admissions are avoided, reducing waiting time and anxiety for many people. 2.2 Cardiac troponins I and T are biological markers of cardiac muscle death (cardiomyocyte necrosis). They are released into the circulation, so rise when the cardiac muscle is damaged. They are used as markers of acute myocardial infarction along with clinical history taking and electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can usually be diagnosed by ECG alone. So, the main diagnostic challenge is detecting or ruling out non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 2.3 The optimum sensitivity of older (non-high-sensitivity) troponin tests (referred to here as standard troponin tests) for acute myocardial infarction
