One study each reported accuracy data for Dimension Vista, VITROS, VIDAS and TriageTrue. 3.3 Seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy data for more than 1 test. No studies were identified that matched the inclusion criteria for the review for Alinity or Dimension EXL tests. Two randomised controlled trials were included in the review: High-STEACS and HiSTORIC. 3.4 Of the 37 included studies, 22 were done in Europe (7 in the UK), 5 in Australia and New Zealand, 6 in the US, 3 in East Asia, and 1 was a worldwide study. 3.5 The randomised controlled trials were quality assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for cluster randomised trials. Studies that evaluated a single high-sensitivity test were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Studies that provided data for 2 or more high-sensitivity tests were assessed using the QUADAS-2C tool. Randomised controlled trials 3.6 Both trials used the ARCHITECT test. 3.7 The High-STEACS trial evaluated the implementation of an early rule-out strategy in 10 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland. It compared the rates at which conditions were reclassified after high-sensitivity troponin tests with the rates of reclassification after standard troponin testing. It also compared the subsequent incidence of myocardial
