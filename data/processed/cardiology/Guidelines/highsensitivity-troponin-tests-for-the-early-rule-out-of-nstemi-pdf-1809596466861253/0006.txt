was published, NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin has been updated to include high- sensitivity troponin tests. But stakeholder feedback suggests that high-sensitivity troponin testing used with early rule-out strategies has not been routinely adopted in the NHS and, if it has, there is wide variation in how it is being done. This updated assessment is being done to ensure that guidance is based on evidence including new high-sensitivity tests developed and marketed since publication of the NICE guidance. It is also to provide more detailed recommendations on how to use high-sensitivity tests (for example, timing of testing and using sequential testing strategies) when possible. The interventions 2.5 All tests included in the assessment are CE marked and available to the NHS. Access High-Sensitivity Troponin I Assay (Beckman Coulter) 2.6 The Access test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Beckman Coulter Access 2 and DxI/DxC analysers. The company says that the test's performance is the same regardless of analyser. It is a paramagnetic particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Results are available in 17 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 17.5 ng/litre
