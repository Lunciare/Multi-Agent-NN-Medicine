4.12 The secondary analysis incorporated prognostic benefits associated with false positive high-sensitivity troponin test results. Clinical experts noted that it is now widely accepted that people with a negative standard troponin test and a positive high-sensitivity troponin test (classified as false positives in the analysis) have an increased risk of reinfarction and mortality compared with people who have a negative result from both tests. The committee concluded that the secondary analysis was most appropriate for decision making. All early rule-out test strategies in the model are cost effective compared with standard troponin testing at 0 hours and 12 hours 4.13 Compared with standard troponin testing, high-sensitivity troponin test strategies resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of less than £7,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. These ICERs are below £20,000 per QALY gained, which NICE would typically consider to be cost effective. The committee noted that there were only small differences in costs and QALYs between the different test strategies included in the economic model, and recalled its previous conclusion that it was not possible to indirectly compare the tests and early rule-out strategies. The committee concluded that it was not possible to differentiate between the different test strategies, and
