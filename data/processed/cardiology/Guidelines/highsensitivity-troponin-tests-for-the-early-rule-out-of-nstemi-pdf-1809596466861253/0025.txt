High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

for at least 2 hours and an initial troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre, or a troponin concentration of 34 ng/litre or less in women, or 53 ng/litre or less in men at 3 hours and an absolute change in concentration from 0 to 3 hours, of less than 3 ng/litre) were 98% (95% CI 95 to 100) and 74% (95% CI 72 to 76) respectively for NSTEMI. Dimension Vista High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay 3.22 The study of the Dimension Vista test assessed a strategy using measurements done at baseline using a troponin concentration threshold of less than 5 ng/litre and an absolute change of less than 2 ng/litre within 1 hour. The sensitivity of the strategy was 100% (95% CI 97 to 100) and specificity was 66% (95% CI 62 to 69) for NSTEMI. Diagnostic accuracy in relevant subgroups 3.23 The EAG identified some data on the subgroups described in the scope for this guidance. In a study using the Elecsys test and a 99th percentile threshold on a single sample at presentation, a higher sensitivity for any acute myocardial infarction was estimated in people over 70 than for people aged 70 or under (97% [95% CI
