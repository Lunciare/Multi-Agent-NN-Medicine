It compared the rates at which conditions were reclassified after high-sensitivity troponin tests with the rates of reclassification after standard troponin testing. It also compared the subsequent incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. 3.8 The HiSTORIC trial also evaluated the implementation of an early rule-out strategy in 7 acute hospitals in Scotland. The primary outcomes were length of stay and myocardial infarction or cardiac death after discharge at 30 days. The results are academic in confidence. 3.9 During the validation phase of High-STEACS (6 to 12 months), results of the high- sensitivity troponin I test were concealed from the attending clinician, and a standard cardiac troponin test was used to guide care. A high-sensitivity test was introduced after 6 months (early implementation) or 12 months (late implementation). 3.10 In patients whose condition was reclassified in the High-STEACS trial, there were no differences between high-sensitivity and standard troponin tests in the primary or any of the secondary efficacy and safety outcome measures (myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularisation, all-cause death, death from cardiovascular causes, hospital admission for heart failure and ischaemic stroke). The median length of stay for patients without myocardial injury was 7 hours (interquartile range 3 to 24) in
