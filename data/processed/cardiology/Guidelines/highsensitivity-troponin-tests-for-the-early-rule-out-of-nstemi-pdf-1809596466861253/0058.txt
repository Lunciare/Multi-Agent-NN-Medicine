Recommending a range of early rule-out strategies means hospitals can use one that works for their emergency department 4.16 The original NICE diagnostics guidance on troponin tests for myocardial infarction recommended strategies that test at 0 hours and 3 hours, report absolute values and use an upper reference limit at the 99th percentile. The committee noted that much more evidence is now available on different early rule-out strategies. The committee considered the different strategies included in the model: • single-sample strategies using a threshold at or near to the limit of detection • multiple sample strategies in which all patients would be tested at baseline and again at 1 to 3 hours after the initial test • multiple sample strategies in which people only had a second test (1 hour to 3 hours after the initial test) if the first test result could not be used to rule out acute myocardial infarction. The multiple sample strategies incorporated different thresholds, including those at or close to the limit of detection, the general (mixed) population 99th percentile, and sex-specific 99th percentiles. The committee recalled that all single-sample strategies and multiple sample strategies included in the model were highly sensitive, that is, they
