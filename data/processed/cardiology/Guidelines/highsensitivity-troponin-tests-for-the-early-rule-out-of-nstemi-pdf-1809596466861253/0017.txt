High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

from cardiovascular causes, hospital admission for heart failure and ischaemic stroke). The median length of stay for patients without myocardial injury was 7 hours (interquartile range 3 to 24) in the validation phase and 4 hours (interquartile range 3 to 20) in the implementation phase. The authors of High-STEACS concluded that implementing an early rule-out strategy was not associated with any increase in myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year of initial presentation. Diagnostic test accuracy Elecsys troponin T-high sensitive assay 3.11 Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity from testing a single sample, using a 99th percentile diagnostic threshold for the general population, were 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] 85 to 94) and 78% (95% CI 72 to 83) respectively, based on data from 22 studies. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, using a single sample and a limit of detection threshold, were 99% (95% CI 97 to 99) and 36% (95% CI 28 to 45) respectively, based on data from 9 studies. The 8 studies that assessed the diagnostic performance of a limit of blank threshold in a single sample gave a similarly high summary estimate of sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 98 to 100), but a
