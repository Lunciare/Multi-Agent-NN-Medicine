High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

NSTEMI. • Multiple sample strategies, which typically include a sample at initial assessment followed by a second sample taken at 30 minutes to 3 hours (if clinically appropriate) and use of 99th percentile thresholds or thresholds at or near the limit of detection of the assay. Healthcare professionals should consider the likely time since the onset of symptoms when interpreting test results. 1.3 When NSTEMI is not ruled out using early rule-out test strategies, use NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin to help diagnose myocardial infarction, and consider using sex-specific thresholds at the 99th percentile (see section 4.7 and section 5.2). 1.4 Further research is recommended on the diagnostic performance of the TriageTrue High Sensitivity Troponin I test when using samples at point of care (see section 5.1). Why the committee made these recommendations When someone comes to a hospital emergency department with chest pain, tests are needed to work out if they're having a myocardial infarction (heart attack), and if so, what type it is and what treatment they need. Standard troponin tests take 10 to 12 hours, so people need to be admitted to hospital while they wait for the results. High-sensitivity troponin tests
