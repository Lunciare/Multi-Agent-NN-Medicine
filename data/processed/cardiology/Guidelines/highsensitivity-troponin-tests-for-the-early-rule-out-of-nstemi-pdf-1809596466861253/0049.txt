Multiple sample strategies also maintained high levels of sensitivity. However, clinical experts commented that it was difficult to make direct comparisons of the different test strategies based on specificity because the number of true negatives would be affected by the prevalence of NSTEMI in each of the different study populations. High-sensitivity troponin tests should be used alongside clinical judgement 4.6 Clinical experts noted that the clinical context in which decisions on discharging or admitting someone to hospital is important, and that decisions should never be based solely on the results of a high-sensitivity troponin test. For example, a person with a negative high-sensitivity troponin test result should not be discharged without further investigations if they look visibly unwell or if the sample was collected too soon after the suspected cardiac event, a practice that could result in a false negative result. Using sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds could reduce inequality in women's treatment 4.7 Clinical experts explained that there was consistent evidence from reference range studies that the 99th percentile threshold differs between men and women. For the Elecsys and ARCHITECT tests, the 99th percentile upper reference limit for women is much lower than the general (mixed) population 99th percentile. The
