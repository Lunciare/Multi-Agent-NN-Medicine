0/1-hour rule-out pathway. This combined an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 3 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial concentration of less than 6 ng/litre and an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 3 ng/litre. The sensitivity and specificity estimates for this strategy were 99% (95% CI 95 to 100) and 56% (95% CI 52 to 60) respectively for NSTEMI. The second study assessed a similar strategy, but with higher thresholds and repeat testing at 2 hours. The sensitivity and specificity estimates for this strategy were 100% (95% CI 95 to 100) and 67% (95% CI 61 to 72) respectively for NSTEMI. Atellica High-Sensitivity Troponin I Assay 3.21 Using a rule-out threshold of 2 ng/litre, in a single sample taken on presentation, the sensitivity and specificity estimates for the Atellica test were 100% (95% CI 98 to 100) and 26% (95% CI 24 to 28) respectively for NSTEMI. Sensitivity and specificity estimates for the High-STEACS pathway (symptoms for at least 2 hours and an initial troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre, or a troponin concentration of 34 ng/litre or less in women, or 53 ng/litre or
