designed to be used in a laboratory on the following analysers: VITROS ECi/ECiQ/3600 Immunodiagnostic Systems and the VITROS 5600/XT 7600 Integrated System. It is an immunometric immunoassay for the in- vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Test results are available in 15 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 11 ng/litre in lithium heparin and serum for the whole population • 9 ng/litre in lithium heparin and serum for women • 13 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 12 ng/litre in serum for men. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. VIDAS High sensitive Troponin I assay (bioMérieux) 2.16 The VIDAS test is designed to be used in a laboratory on the following analysers: VIDAS, MINI VIDAS and VIDAS 3. It is for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma (lithium heparin) samples. Test results are available in 20 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 19 ng/litre for the whole population • 11 ng/litre for women • 25 ng/litre for men. The comparator 2.17 The comparator was standard troponin testing over 10 to 12 hours from symptom onset used with early rule-out strategies. 3
