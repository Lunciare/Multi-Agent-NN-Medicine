study provided data on the ESC 0/1-hour pathway using the Elecsys, ARCHITECT and ADVIA Centaur tests. It also provided data on the ESC 0/1-hour pathway using the Access, VITROS and TriageTrue tests, but these results came from different patient subgroups and were reported in different publications. Data showed that the ESC 0/1-hour pathway performed consistently across all 6 high- sensitivity troponin tests evaluated with sensitivity estimates of 98% or higher. 3.28 Three other studies, ADAPT, ROMI-3, and TRUST, compared the Elecsys and ARCHITECT tests. Although the sensitivity estimates for the Elecsys test, using the 99th percentile and a single sample at presentation, were higher than those for the ARCHITECT test, both had sensitivity estimates of less than 97%. When the limit of detection threshold was used with a single sample at presentation, sensitivity estimates were comparable for the Elecsys test and the ARCHITECT test, and were always 99% or higher. 3.29 The High-STEACS trial provided data on the rule-out performance of 3 strategies (ESC 0/1-hour, ESC 0/3-hour and High-STEACS 0/3-hour) using the ARCHITECT and Atellica tests. It is unclear whether both tests were evaluated in the same subgroup of people in the study. Data showed that the sensitivity of the
