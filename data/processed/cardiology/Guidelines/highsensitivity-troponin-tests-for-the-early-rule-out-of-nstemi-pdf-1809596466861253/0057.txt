High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

So the benefits of using early rule-out strategies may have been underestimated. The external assessment group (EAG) commented that changing this assumption would be unlikely to affect the model results. Recommending a range of different high-sensitivity troponin tests gives greater flexibility to NHS trusts 4.15 Some of the tests had lower levels of clinical evidence than others. But the diagnostic performance and costs of all the tests used in the modelling were comparable (except for the test cost for TriageTrue). There was no strong evidence to differentiate one test over another (see section 4.3), and when used in the early rule-out strategies all were cost effective compared with the standard troponin test (see section 4.13). The committee noted that recommending a range of tests would benefit hospitals by enabling them to operate within existing equipment contracts or investments in a particular platform. It concluded that recommending a range of high-sensitivity troponin tests gives greater flexibility to NHS trusts and enables them to work with any local restrictions or equipment contracts. Recommending a range of early rule-out strategies means hospitals can use one that works for their emergency department 4.16 The original NICE diagnostics guidance on troponin tests for myocardial infarction
