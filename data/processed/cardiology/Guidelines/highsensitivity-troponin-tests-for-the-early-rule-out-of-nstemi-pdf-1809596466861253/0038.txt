in increased reinfarction and mortality probabilities for 1 year and were allocated to 'non-fatal AMI (untreated)'. 3.40 The long-term consequences in terms of costs and QALYs were estimated using a state-transition cohort model with a lifetime time horizon (60 years) and a cycle time of 1 year (except for the first cycle which was adjusted to 335.25 days to ensure that the decision tree period and the first cycle summed to 1 year). Discount rates of 3.5% and a half-cycle correction were applied for both costs and effects. Model inputs 3.41 Estimates for the model input parameters were retrieved from the literature and from consulting experts. Accuracy estimates were derived from the systematic review component of the assessment. The proportion of people testing positive or negative was based on the estimated accuracy of the testing strategies considered (table 2) and the estimated prevalence of NSTEMI in the UK (12.2%).
