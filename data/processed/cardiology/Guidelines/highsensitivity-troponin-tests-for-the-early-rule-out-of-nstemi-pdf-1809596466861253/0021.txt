High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

pathway. It used an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 2 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre and an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 2 ng/ litre. Summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were 99% (95% CI 98 to 100) and 57% (95% CI 56 to 59) respectively for NSTEMI. Access High-Sensitivity Troponin I Assay 3.16 The 2 studies evaluating the Access test each assessed a different multiple sample strategy. One followed the ESC 0/1-hour rule-out pathway (initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 4 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial concentration of less than 5 ng/litre and an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 4 ng/litre), giving sensitivity and specificity estimates of 99% (95% CI 94 to 100) and 70% (95% CI 66 to 74) respectively for NSTEMI. The second study assessed a similar strategy, but with repeat testing at 2 hours. The sensitivity estimates were similar for the 2 strategies, but the specificity of the 2-hour repeat testing strategy was higher than that of the 1-hour
