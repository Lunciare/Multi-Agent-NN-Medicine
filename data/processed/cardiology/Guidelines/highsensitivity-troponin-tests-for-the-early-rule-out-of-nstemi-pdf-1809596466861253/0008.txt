High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

Sensitive Troponin-I assay (Abbott Diagnostics) 2.8 The Alinity test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Alinity i analyser. It is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for the quantitative determination of troponin I in plasma and serum samples. Results are available in 18 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 26.2 ng/litre for the whole population with a CV of 4.6% • 15.6 ng/litre for women (CV 5.0%) • 34.2 ng/litre for men (CV 4.5%). ADVIA Centaur High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay (Siemens Healthineers) 2.9 The ADVIA Centaur test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Siemens ADVIA Centaur XP and ADVIA Centaur XPT analysers. It is a magnetic latex particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Test results are available in 18 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 47.34 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 46.47 ng/litre in serum for the whole population • 36.99 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 39.59 ng/litre in serum for women • 57.27 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 58.05 ng/litre in serum for men. Each 99th percentile has a CV of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I
