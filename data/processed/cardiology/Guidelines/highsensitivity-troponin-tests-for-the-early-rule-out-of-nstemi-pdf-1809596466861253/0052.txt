High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

concluded that evidence from the randomised controlled trials, which reported end clinical outcomes, strongly supported using high-sensitivity troponin tests with early rule-out strategies in clinical practice. The TriageTrue point-of-care test is innovative but its diagnostic accuracy is uncertain 4.9 The committee noted that the TriageTrue point-of-care test had a turnaround time of around 20 minutes and had the potential to be an important development in the field. The rapid time to test results could have benefits because of a reduced length of time spent waiting for a result in the emergency department (see section 4.1). Only 1 study was available on the TriageTrue test. In this study troponin levels were tested in stored plasma samples rather than the whole blood samples used in clinical practice. The committee noted that the evidence did not reflect how the test would be used in clinical practice at the point of care. It concluded that further evidence on TriageTrue's diagnostic performance when used on whole blood at the point of care is needed before the test can be recommended for use in clinical practice. The Alinity, Dimension EXL and Elecsys STAT tests are likely to have the same performance as alternative versions of tests
