High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

threshold. This is particularly true in women, for whom the 99th percentile is lower. This study also used sex-specific thresholds as part of a multiple test strategy: the High-STEACS pathway. It is unclear whether using sex-specific thresholds in this strategy offers any advantage over using a single general population threshold. This is because no equivalent strategy, using a single universal threshold, was evaluated. Other studies reported data on men and women using a single general population threshold in each group. Results from a study on the Elecsys test showed very similar accuracy estimates for the subgroups, although a study on the Dimension Vista reported a lower sensitivity and specificity in men than in women. 3.25 Two studies on the Elecsys test and 2 on the ARCHITECT test reported data on how diagnostic performance varies with renal function. All studies show a decrease in specificity as renal function decreases. Comparative diagnostic accuracy for more than 1 test 3.26 Seven studies reported accuracy data for more than 1 test. 3.27 The APACE study provided data on the ESC 0/1-hour pathway using the Elecsys, ARCHITECT and ADVIA Centaur tests. It also provided data on the ESC 0/1-hour pathway using the Access, VITROS and
