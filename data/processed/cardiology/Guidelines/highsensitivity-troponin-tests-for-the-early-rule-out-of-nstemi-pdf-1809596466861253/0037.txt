• death. 3.39 People presenting at the emergency department with suspected non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome were tested and results were classified as either true positive, false positive, false negative or true negative. These people entered health states as listed (people could also die after treatment or be discharged): • People with true positive test results were correctly treated for acute myocardial infarction and were allocated to 'non-fatal AMI (treated)'. • People with false positive test results were considered to have no acute myocardial infarction, but did not meet early rule-out criteria. They were subdivided between 'no ACS, no UA' and 'UA'. It was assumed that people with false positive test results would remain in the hospital longer but would not be treated for acute myocardial infarction. • People with true negative test results were considered not to be treated for acute myocardial infarction and were subdivided between 'no ACS, no UA' and 'UA'. • People with false negative test results were assumed to have untreated acute myocardial infarction resulting in increased reinfarction and mortality probabilities for 1 year and were allocated to 'non-fatal AMI (untreated)'. 3.40 The long-term consequences in terms of costs and QALYs were estimated using a
