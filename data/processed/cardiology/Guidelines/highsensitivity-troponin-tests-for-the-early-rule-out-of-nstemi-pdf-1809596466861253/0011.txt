samples. Test results are available in 10 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 58.9 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 57.9 ng/litre in serum for the whole population • 53.77 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 51.1 ng/litre in serum for women • 78.5 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 74.9 ng/litre in serum for men. Each 99th percentile has a CV of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. Elecsys troponin T-high sensitive assay (Roche) 2.13 The Elecsys and Elecsys STAT tests are designed to be used in a laboratory on the Roche cobas e411, e601, and e602 analysers. The company says that performance is the same when used on these analysers. The test can also be run on the cobas e801 analyser, which is designed for very high throughput as both a standard and STAT test. The Elecsys test is a sandwich electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin T in serum and plasma samples. Results are available in 18 minutes with the standard test and in 9 minutes with the STAT test. Both tests can detect troponin T in 57% of the reference population.
