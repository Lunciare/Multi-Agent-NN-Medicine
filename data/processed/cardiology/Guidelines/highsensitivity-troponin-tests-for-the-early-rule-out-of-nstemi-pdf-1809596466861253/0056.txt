that it was not possible to indirectly compare the tests and early rule-out strategies. The committee concluded that it was not possible to differentiate between the different test strategies, and that all early rule-out strategies had the potential to be recommended for clinical practice, provided that each test used with them had enough diagnostic accuracy data. The results of the economic model are robust to changes in the input parameter values 4.14 The model results were robust to changes in the input parameter values, for example, the number of admissions based on the specificity of the test strategy and the prevalence of NSTEMI. Early rule-out strategies with lower specificities would likely result in fewer people being discharged from hospital, but this does not have a substantial effect on the cost-effectiveness results. In addition, clinical experts noted that people having standard troponin testing and who get a negative test result would probably have a hospital length of stay of 24 hours rather than the 14 hours assumed in the economic model. So the benefits of using early rule-out strategies may have been underestimated. The external assessment group (EAG) commented that changing this assumption would be unlikely to affect the model results.
