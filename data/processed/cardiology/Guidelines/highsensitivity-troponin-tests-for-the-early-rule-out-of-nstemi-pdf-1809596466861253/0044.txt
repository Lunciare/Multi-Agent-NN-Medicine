High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

Liplinski et al. (2015) showed that people with a negative standard troponin test and positive high-sensitivity troponin test have an increased risk of reinfarction and mortality compared with those who test negative on both standard troponin and high-sensitivity troponin tests. Although this risk was not as high as in people with both positive standard troponin and positive high-sensitivity troponin tests, it could still be considered prognostically important. A secondary analysis was done in which the risk of acute myocardial infarction and mortality was adjusted for people with false positive results. Results 3.48 In the base case, standard troponin testing was the most effective and the most expensive strategy. But other testing strategies with a sensitivity of 100% (subject to uncertainty) were almost equally as effective, resulting in the same QALY gain up to 4 decimal places. Compared with standard troponin testing, high-sensitivity troponin testing resulted in probabilistic incremental cost- effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging between £34,307 and £36,842,603 savings per QALY lost. 3.49 In the secondary analysis, standard troponin was the cheapest and the least effective testing strategy. Compared with standard troponin testing, high- sensitivity troponin testing resulted in probabilistic ICERs ranging between £4,043 and £6,148 per QALY gained. 3.50 For
