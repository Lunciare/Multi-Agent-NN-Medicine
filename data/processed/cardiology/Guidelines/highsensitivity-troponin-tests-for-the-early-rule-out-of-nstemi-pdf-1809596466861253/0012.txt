High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

18 minutes with the standard test and in 9 minutes with the STAT test. Both tests can detect troponin T in 57% of the reference population. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 14.0 ng/litre for the whole population with a CV of less than 10% • 9.0 ng/litre for women • 16.8 ng/litre for men. TriageTrue High Sensitivity Troponin I Test (Quidel Cardiovascular) 2.14 The TriageTrue test can be used at point of care or in a laboratory with the Triage MeterPro analyser. It is a fluorescence immunoassay for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in EDTA anticoagulated whole blood and plasma samples. Test results are available in less than 20 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 20.5 ng/litre for the whole population with a CV of less than 10% • 14.4 ng/litre for women • 25.7 ng/litre for men. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. VITROS High Sensitivity Troponin I Assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) 2.15 The VITROS test is designed to be used in a laboratory on the following analysers: VITROS ECi/ECiQ/3600 Immunodiagnostic Systems and the VITROS 5600/XT 7600 Integrated System. It is an immunometric immunoassay for the in-
