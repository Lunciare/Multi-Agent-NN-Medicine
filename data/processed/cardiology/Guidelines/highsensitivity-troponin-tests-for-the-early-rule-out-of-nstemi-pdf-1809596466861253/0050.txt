High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

differs between men and women. For the Elecsys and ARCHITECT tests, the 99th percentile upper reference limit for women is much lower than the general (mixed) population 99th percentile. The High-STEACS trial was the only strategy included in the cost- effectiveness modelling to use sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds in an early rule-out strategy. But it did not provide a direct comparison with a general population 99th percentile threshold. The committee therefore considered that the evidence on using sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds in early rule-out strategies was unclear. Clinical experts noted that sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds were sometimes used in clinical practice to help diagnose NSTEMI, but that there was no evidence that using them affected clinical outcomes. They noted that the ongoing CODE-MI study aims to evaluate the effect of using the sex-specific 99th percentile threshold for women for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin. This will be compared with the general (mixed) population 99th percentile threshold, for the diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of women presenting to the emergency department with cardiac chest pain. The committee noted that there was a wider equality issue because women with acute myocardial infarction are generally under-diagnosed and under-treated compared with men. The committee considered that using
