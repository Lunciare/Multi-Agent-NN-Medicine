and what treatment they need. Standard troponin tests take 10 to 12 hours, so people need to be admitted to hospital while they wait for the results. High-sensitivity troponin tests can help to quickly rule out a type of heart attack called an NSTEMI. Doing these tests can mean people with normal troponin levels do not need to be admitted to hospital, and those with a confirmed NSTEMI can get earlier treatment. Evidence shows that, of the high-sensitivity troponin tests, 9 are similarly effective in terms of diagnostic performance. Of these, 8 are also similarly cost effective compared with standard troponin tests in different early rule-out test strategies and so are recommended for use in the NHS. There is only 1 diagnostic accuracy study for Elecsys STAT, and no diagnostic accuracy evidence for Alinity and Dimension EXL. But they use the same methods, principles and reagents as alternative versions of the tests that do have diagnostic accuracy evidence and were included in the economic model. The main difference is that they are run on different analysers. They are therefore also recommended. Although the TriageTrue test has the potential to be cost effective, its diagnostic accuracy when used on whole blood
