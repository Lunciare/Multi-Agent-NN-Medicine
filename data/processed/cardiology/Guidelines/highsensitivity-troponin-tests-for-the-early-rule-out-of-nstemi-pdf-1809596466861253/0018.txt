High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

the diagnostic performance of a limit of blank threshold in a single sample gave a similarly high summary estimate of sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 98 to 100), but a reduced specificity of 19% (95% CI 11 to 31). All estimates were similar when the analyses were restricted to studies that excluded people with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 3.12 Using multiple sample strategies appears to offer better specificity without substantial loss of sensitivity than using a single sample on presentation and a very low limit of detection or limit of blank threshold. The European Society of Cardiology's (ESC) 0/1-hour rule-out pathway combines an initial sample and a very low limit of detection threshold (5 ng/litre) in patients reporting a minimum symptom duration of 3 hours. The strategy tests at presentation and 1 hour later for patients whose acute myocardial infarction is not ruled out by the initial test, that is, it uses an 'OR' combination. The threshold for repeat testing is an initial troponin concentration of less than 12 ng/litre with an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 3 ng/litre. For NSTEMI, the sensitivity and specificity estimates for this strategy were 99%
