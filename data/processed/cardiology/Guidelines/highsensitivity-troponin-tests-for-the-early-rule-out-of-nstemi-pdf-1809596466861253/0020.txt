High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

on data from 4 studies in NSTEMI. 3.14 For multiple sample strategies, the High-STEACS pathway was used as follows: • in the whole population, symptoms for 2 hours or more and a troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre at 0 hours, or • in women, 16 ng/litre or lower when measured 3 hours from presentation and an absolute change of less than 3 ng/litre at 0 to 3 hours, or • in men, 34 ng/litre or lower when measured 3 hours from presentation and an absolute change of less than 3 ng/litre at 0 to 3 hours. 3.15 Using the High-STEACS pathway in this way appeared to offer increased specificity without substantial loss of sensitivity compared with a single sample on presentation and a risk stratification threshold of less than 5 ng/litre. The sensitivity and specificity estimates for this strategy were 99% (95% CI 97 to 100) and 76% (95% CI 73 to 78) respectively, for NSTEMI. The ESC 0/1-hour rule-out pathway reported a lower specificity than the High-STEACS pathway. It used an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 2 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial troponin concentration of less than 5 ng/litre
