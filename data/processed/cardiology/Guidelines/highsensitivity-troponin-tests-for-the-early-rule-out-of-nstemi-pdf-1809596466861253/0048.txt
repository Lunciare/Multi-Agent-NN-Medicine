High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

threshold at or close to the limit of detection gave high sensitivity but low specificity. However, the committee commented that single sample strategies can be useful to rule out non-ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) early in emergency departments and, for this purpose, specificity is not a priority. There were concerns about the consistency of different analysers to provide accurate results at these low thresholds. However, clinical experts commented that samples with results close to these low thresholds would be from people considered very low risk and would have a good prognosis regardless of treatment. In contrast, results from diagnostic accuracy studies showed that a single test strategy using the 99th percentile threshold had sensitivity estimates too low to be safely used in clinical practice. Multiple sample early rule-out strategies have better specificity than single-sample strategies 4.5 Results from the diagnostic accuracy studies showed that multiple sample early rule-out strategies, that is, those that included a second rule-out step, had better specificity than single-sample strategies using a very low threshold. Multiple sample strategies also maintained high levels of sensitivity. However, clinical experts commented that it was difficult to make direct comparisons of the different test strategies based on specificity because
