High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

repeat testing at 2 hours. The sensitivity estimates were similar for the 2 strategies, but the specificity of the 2-hour repeat testing strategy was higher than that of the 1-hour strategy. VIDAS High sensitive Troponin I assay 3.17 The study evaluating the VIDAS test assessed a multiple sample strategy, with samples taken on presentation and at 2 hours using a threshold of less than 2 ng/ litre at presentation, or less than 6 ng/litre at presentation and at 2 hours. The reported sensitivity and specificity estimates were 98% (95% CI 92 to 100) and 64% (95% CI 59 to 68) respectively for NSTEMI. VITROS High Sensitivity Troponin I Assay 3.18 The study evaluating the VITROS test assessed the ESC 0/1-hour rule-out pathway. This combined an initial sample and a limit of detection threshold of less than 1 ng/litre, or repeat testing combining an initial troponin concentration of less than 2 ng/litre and an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 1 ng/litre. The reported sensitivity and specificity estimates were 100% (95% CI 95 to 100) and 60% (95% CI 55 to 64) respectively for NSTEMI.
