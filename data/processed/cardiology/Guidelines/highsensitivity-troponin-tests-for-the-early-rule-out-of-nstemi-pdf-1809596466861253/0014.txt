for women • 25 ng/litre for men. The comparator 2.17 The comparator was standard troponin testing over 10 to 12 hours from symptom onset used with early rule-out strategies. 3 Evidence The diagnostics advisory committee considered evidence on high-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from several sources. Full details of all the evidence are in the committee papers. Clinical effectiveness 3.1 The external assessment group (EAG) did a systematic review to identify evidence on the clinical effectiveness of high-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of acute myocardial infarction, including NSTEMI, in people who come to hospital with chest pain. It also considered studies used to develop the original diagnostics guidance on early rule out of myocardial infarction using high- sensitivity troponin tests. 3.2 The EAG identified 37 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Test accuracy data were reported for the following high-sensitivity troponin tests: Elecsys (30 studies), ARCHITECT (9 studies), Atellica (2 studies), ADVIA Centaur (3 studies), Access (2 studies). One study each reported accuracy data for Dimension Vista, VITROS, VIDAS and TriageTrue. 3.3 Seven studies reported diagnostic accuracy data for more than 1 test. No studies were identified that
