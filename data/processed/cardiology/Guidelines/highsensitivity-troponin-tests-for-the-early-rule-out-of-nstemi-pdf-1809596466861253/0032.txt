on a comprehensive review of medical records. Total costs were less for the 1-hour strategy compared with standard care (£2,480 compared with £4,561). This was mainly because of a shorter length of stay in the emergency department. Economic analysis 3.36 The EAG developed a de novo economic model to explore the cost effectiveness of high-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of acute myocardial infarction, including NSTEMI, in people with acute chest pain (used up to 4 hours from the onset of chest pain or at presentation). The model compared high- sensitivity tests with standard troponin T or I testing, or both, on admission and at 10 to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. The population in the model was people presenting to the emergency department with suspected non-ST- segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, who have no major comorbidities needing hospitalisation (for example, heart failure or arrhythmia) and in whom STEMI has been ruled out. 3.37 Only high-sensitivity troponin tests with a sensitivity of 97% or above were used in the economic model, based on expert opinion of the minimum sensitivity acceptable in clinical practice. The strategies evaluated are described in table 1. Table 1 Test strategies evaluated
