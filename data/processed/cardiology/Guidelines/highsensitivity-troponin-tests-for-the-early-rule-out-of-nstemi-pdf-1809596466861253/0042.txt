costs were assumed to be identical for all tests (£2.50) except for the point-of-care test (£25.00, based on information provided by Quidel). A scenario analysis was done using test-specific costs and assuming that costs relating to the analyser and staff time were identical for all strategies. 3.45 Age-dependent utility scores from the UK general population were calculated for people in the 'no ACS, no UA' health state. These age-dependent utility scores were combined with age-dependent disutility values for acute myocardial infarction, to calculate utility values for the 'post-AMI' health states (with or without reinfarction). Utility values for the 'UA' health state were calculated based on the 'post-MI' utility values and assuming a utility increment of 0.010. Assumptions 3.46 The following assumptions were applied in the base-case analysis: • Standard troponin testing (at presentation and after 10 to 12 hours) has perfect accuracy. • Compared with acute myocardial infarctions occurring during the decision tree period, all acute myocardial infarctions (either first or reinfarction) occurring in the state-transition model are diagnosed correctly, so are treated. • Unstable angina is always correctly diagnosed, so is treated. • The reinfarction probability for the 'post-AMI with reinfarction' health state is equal to the reinfarction probability
