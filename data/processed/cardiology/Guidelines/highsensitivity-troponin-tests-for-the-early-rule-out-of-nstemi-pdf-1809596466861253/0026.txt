High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

on a single sample at presentation, a higher sensitivity for any acute myocardial infarction was estimated in people over 70 than for people aged 70 or under (97% [95% CI 92 to 99] and 88% [95% CI 78 to 94] respectively). The estimate of sensitivity for people over 70 was also higher than the corresponding summary estimates from all 22 studies that used the 99th percentile diagnostic threshold. There was a similar pattern for people with a high pre-test probability (determined by clinical judgement of cardiovascular risk factors, type of chest pain, physical findings and electrocardiography [ECG] abnormalities) compared with those with a low to moderate pre-test probability. The same was found for people without pre-existing cardiovascular disease compared with those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. 3.24 Only the High-STEACS trial reported using sex-specific thresholds. Data from this study appeared to show that testing using a single sample taken on presentation is markedly more sensitive if sex-specific 99th percentile cut-offs are used, compared with a standard troponin test with a uniform threshold. This is particularly true in women, for whom the 99th percentile is lower. This study also used sex-specific thresholds as part of a multiple test strategy: the High-STEACS pathway.
