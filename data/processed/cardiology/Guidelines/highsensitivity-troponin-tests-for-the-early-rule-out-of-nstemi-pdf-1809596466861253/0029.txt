using the ARCHITECT and Atellica tests. It is unclear whether both tests were evaluated in the same subgroup of people in the study. Data showed that the sensitivity of the ESC 0/ 1-hour pathway was lower using the Atellica test (94% [95% CI 79 to 99]) than using the ARCHITECT test (100% [95% CI 91 to 100]). The sensitivity and specificity estimates for the High-STEACS 0/3-hour rule-out pathway were similar using either test (both had sensitivity estimates of 98% or more). The ESC 0/3-hour rule-out pathway in this study consisted of: • symptoms for 6 hours or more and a troponin concentration of 16 ng/litre or less in women or 34 ng/litre or less in men at 0 hours, or • a troponin concentration of 16 ng/litre or less in women or 34 ng/litre or less in men at 3 hours, or • an absolute change of less than 50% of the 99th percentile at 0 to 3 hours. The sensitivity and specificity estimates for the ESC 0/3-hour rule-out pathway were both less than 97% using either test. 3.30 The HIGH-US study compared 2 Siemens tests (Atellica and ADVIA Centaur), using 3 low thresholds and a single sample at presentation.
