High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

pain. The committee noted that there was a wider equality issue because women with acute myocardial infarction are generally under-diagnosed and under-treated compared with men. The committee considered that using sex-specific 99th percentile thresholds to help diagnose NSTEMI could be a step towards reducing this health inequality. It concluded that, when NSTEMI is not ruled out using early rule-out test strategies, NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin may be used to help diagnose myocardial infarction, and the use of sex- specific thresholds at the 99th percentile should be considered (see section 5.2). Randomised controlled trial evidence shows early rule-out strategies do not negatively affect health 4.8 The committee considered evidence from 2 randomised controlled trials, High- STEACS and HiSTORIC. It noted that the authors of High-STEACS concluded that the implementation of an early rule-out strategy was not associated with any increase in myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year of initial presentation. The HiSTORIC trial was submitted to NICE as academic-in- confidence evidence. The committee concluded that evidence from the randomised controlled trials, which reported end clinical outcomes, strongly supported using high-sensitivity troponin tests with early rule-out strategies in clinical practice.
