could be resolved in practice. It also considered that, if more tests and different testing strategies were found to be cost effective and were recommended, this would help with procurement and give hospitals more flexibility to implement a strategy that works for them. Clinical effectiveness The comparative accuracy of the different tests is uncertain 4.3 There were concerns about the level of clinical evidence available for some of the tests. Most diagnostic accuracy results related to the Elecsys (30 studies) and ARCHITECT (9 studies) tests. Other tests had less evidence available but were mostly still acceptable. The committee noted that there was also limited evidence comparing the diagnostic performance of 1 test with another. This meant that although there may be differences in performance between the tests, it is difficult to estimate these differences with any certainty. The sensitivity of single-sample early rule-out strategies varies depending on which threshold is used 4.4 Results from the diagnostic accuracy studies showed that strategies that test a single sample on presentation using a threshold at or close to the limit of detection gave high sensitivity but low specificity. However, the committee commented that single sample strategies can be useful to rule out non-ST-
