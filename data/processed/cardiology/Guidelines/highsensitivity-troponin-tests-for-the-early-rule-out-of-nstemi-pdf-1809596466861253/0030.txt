were both less than 97% using either test. 3.30 The HIGH-US study compared 2 Siemens tests (Atellica and ADVIA Centaur), using 3 low thresholds and a single sample at presentation. The results showed sensitivity estimates were 99% or more for both tests for all thresholds. 3.31 The BEST study compared 2 single sample at presentation strategies using the ADVIA Centaur test (threshold of 3 ng/litre) and Elecsys test (limit of detection [5 ng/litre] threshold). Data were reported in separate publications with different numbers of people. The sensitivity estimates were 99% for both tests, but the Elecsys test had a higher specificity (47% [95% CI 43 to 51]) than the ADVIA Centaur test (33% [95% CI 30 to 36]). Cost effectiveness 3.32 The EAG did a search to identify evidence on the cost effectiveness of high- sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of acute myocardial infarction, including NSTEMI. The EAG also developed a de novo economic model to assess the cost effectiveness of the different testing strategies. Review of economic evidence 3.33 Studies were eligible if they reported a full economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of either high-sensitivity troponin testing or standard troponin testing. They also had to
