High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

(Siemens Healthineers) 2.11 The Dimension EXL test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Siemens Dimension EXL analyser. It is a magnetic latex particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Test results are available in 18 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 60.4 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 58.2 ng/litre in serum for the whole population • 51.4 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 47.8 ng/litre in serum for women • 76.2 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 71.8 ng/litre in serum for men. Each 99th percentile has a CV of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. Dimension Vista High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay (Siemens Healthineers) 2.12 The Dimension Vista test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Siemens Dimension Vista analysers. It is a magnetic latex particle chemiluminescent immunoassay, and is intended for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Test results are available in 10 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 58.9 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 57.9 ng/litre in serum for the whole population • 53.77
