This model structure was adapted from the health technology assessment report from Goodacre et al. (2013). It consists of a decision tree and a state-transition model. The decision tree was used to model the 30-day outcomes after presentation, based on test results and the accompanying treatment decision. The following health states were included: • no acute coronary syndrome and no unstable angina (no ACS, no UA) • unstable angina (UA) • post-acute myocardial infarction, treated and untreated (post-AMI) • post-acute myocardial infarction with reinfarction (post-AMI with reinfarction) • death. 3.39 People presenting at the emergency department with suspected non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome were tested and results were classified as either true positive, false positive, false negative
