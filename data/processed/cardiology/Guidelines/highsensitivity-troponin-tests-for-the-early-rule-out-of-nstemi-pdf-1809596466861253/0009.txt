High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

women • 57.27 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 58.05 ng/litre in serum for men. Each 99th percentile has a CV of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. Atellica IM High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay (Siemens Healthineers) 2.10 The Atellica test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Siemens Atellica IM analyser. It is a magnetic latex particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for the in-vitro quantitative determination of troponin I in serum and plasma samples. Test results are available in 10 minutes. Recommended 99th percentile cut-offs are: • 45.2 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 45.43 ng/litre in serum for the whole population • 34.11 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 38.64 ng/litre in serum for women • 53.48 ng/litre in lithium heparin and 53.53 ng/litre in serum for men. Each 99th percentile has a CV of less than 10%. The test can detect troponin I in more than 50% of the reference population. Dimension EXL High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I Assay (Siemens Healthineers) 2.11 The Dimension EXL test is designed to be used in a laboratory with the Siemens Dimension EXL analyser. It is a magnetic latex particle chemiluminescent immunoassay for
