cheapest and the least effective testing strategy. Compared with standard troponin testing, high- sensitivity troponin testing resulted in probabilistic ICERs ranging between £4,043 and £6,148 per QALY gained. 3.50 For all scenario analyses of the secondary analysis, results were similar to those from the secondary analysis base case. Standard troponin remained the cheapest and the least effective testing strategy (deterministic analysis). In all scenario analyses of the secondary analysis, high-sensitivity troponin testing compared with standard troponin testing resulted in ICERs less than £10,000 per QALY gained. 3.51 One-way sensitivity analyses were done including all parameters that were changed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the secondary analysis, the parameters that had a notable effect on the estimated cost-effectiveness estimates were: • 30-day mortality for untreated acute myocardial infarction • mortality 1 year after treated and untreated acute myocardial infarction • discount rate used for outcomes • relative mortality for people who had a true positive result compared with those who had a false positive result. At extreme values (based on 95% confidence intervals) of these inputs, standard troponin testing remains cheaper and less effective than the high- sensitivity troponin tests. 4 Committee discussion Quick, accurate tests may reduce anxiety for
