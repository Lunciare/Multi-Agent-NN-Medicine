High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

the test can be recommended for use in clinical practice. The Alinity, Dimension EXL and Elecsys STAT tests are likely to have the same performance as alternative versions of tests 4.10 The Alinity and Dimension EXL tests were not included in the economic model because there were no direct diagnostic accuracy data for them in the systematic review. However, the committee noted that these tests were based on the same methods and principles, and used the same reagents as other tests that were included in the modelling. The committee heard that the Alinity test was a newer version of the ARCHITECT test and that the Dimension EXL test was a different version of the Vista test, but the tests were all run on different analysers. It noted further that the Elecsys STAT test was the same in terms of technical specification and performance as the Elecsys troponin T-high sensitive test, and is run on the same analysers. The committee concluded that the diagnostic accuracy of these different versions of the tests should be comparable. It also concluded that it was the responsibility of individual laboratories to assess the equivalency of these tests in practice, and to validate their diagnostic performance
