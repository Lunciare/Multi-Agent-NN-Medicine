High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

so are treated. • Unstable angina is always correctly diagnosed, so is treated. • The reinfarction probability for the 'post-AMI with reinfarction' health state is equal to the reinfarction probability for the 'post-AMI' health state. • The increased post-acute myocardial infarction reinfarction and mortality probabilities for untreated acute myocardial infarction were assumed to last 1 year. After this a relative risk of 1.0 was applied (for untreated compared with treated acute myocardial infarction). • There is no additional benefit of starting treatment early, so treatment effect for high-sensitivity strategies is equal to treatment effect for standard troponin strategies. • All 30-day deaths (after presentation at the emergency department) are due to fatal acute myocardial infarction events and will receive the associated costs. 3.47 For the base case, it was assumed that people who tested negative on standard troponin tests and positive on high-sensitivity troponin tests would have a life expectancy and quality of life equal to people with true negative test results, but this assumption is debatable. A meta-analysis by Liplinski et al. (2015) showed that people with a negative standard troponin test and positive high-sensitivity troponin test have an increased risk of reinfarction and mortality compared with those who
