High-sensitivity troponin tests for the early rule out of NSTEMI

ng/litre with an absolute change in troponin concentration, from 0 to 1 hour, of less than 3 ng/litre. For NSTEMI, the sensitivity and specificity estimates for this strategy were 99% (95% CI 98 to 100) and 68% (95% CI 67 to 70), respectively. Estimates of diagnostic performance were similar for strategies using an 'AND' combination of initial high-sensitivity troponin level and absolute change in troponin level. ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I assay 3.13 Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for a single sample using a diagnostic threshold of the 99th percentile for the general population were 75% (95% CI 65 to 82) and 94% (95% CI 94 to 96) respectively, based on data from 5 studies. These estimates were similar if the analysis was restricted to studies that excluded people with STEMI. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity, using a limit of detection threshold (2 ng/litre) in a single sample taken on presentation, were 100% (95% CI 99 to 100) and 21% (95% CI 16 to 26) respectively, based on data from 4 studies in NSTEMI. 3.14 For multiple sample strategies, the High-STEACS pathway was used as follows: • in the whole population, symptoms for 2 hours or more
