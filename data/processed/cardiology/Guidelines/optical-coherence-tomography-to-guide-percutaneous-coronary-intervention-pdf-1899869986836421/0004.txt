(FD OCT) guidance. Cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) were less frequent in patients treated by PCI with a combination of angiographic and FD OCT guidance than in those treated by PCI with angiographic guidance alone over a follow-up period of 1 year. There were 15 cardiac deaths and 29 MIs in the angiography-only group, and 4 cardiac deaths and 18 MIs in the combined angiography and FD-OCT group; odds ratio 0.49; 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.96, p=0.037. 4.2 A randomised controlled trial comparing FD OCT against intravascular ultrasound for PCI optimisation in 70 patients reported that there was inferior stent expansion, both focal (65% versus 80%, p=0.002) and diffuse (84% versus 99%, p=0.003), when FD OCT had been used for guidance. PCI guided by FD OCT also showed a significant increase in residual stent-edge plaque burden (51% versus 42%, p<0.001). There were no significant differences in stent apposition. 4.3 In the retrospective case series comparing 335 matched pairs of patients undergoing PCI with either angiographic guidance or a combination of angiographic and FD OCT guidance, FD OCT led to additional interventions (further stenting and additional balloon dilation) in 116 patients (35%). 4.4 In a case series of 40
