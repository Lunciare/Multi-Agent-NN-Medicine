combination of angiographic and FD OCT guidance, FD OCT led to additional interventions (further stenting and additional balloon dilation) in 116 patients (35%). 4.4 In a case series of 40 patients in whom OCT was performed to evaluate ambiguous or intermediate lesions, 60% (24 out of 40) were treated by PCI and 40% (16 out of 40) had PCI deferred. None of the patients for whom PCI was deferred had a coronary event within an average follow-up of 4.6 months. 4.5 The specialist advisers listed a key efficacy outcome as a change in diagnosis or management due to OCT imaging results. They cited as examples identifying culprit or non-culprit plaques in acute coronary syndromes, identifying intracoronary or intra-stent thrombus, identifying dissections and complications after stenting, examining stent deformation and conformation, identifying modes of stent failure including neoatherogenesis, and documenting stent tissue coverage. 5 Safety This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure.
