of contrast with frequency-domain OCT (FD OCT). For non-occlusive OCT, a guide wire through which contrast can be injected is used. The imaging catheter is delivered over this wire. Injection of contrast and imaging take place concurrently. 3.2 Second-generation FD OCT devices aim to improve image quality and, more importantly, increase the speed of image acquisition by a factor of 10. FD OCT has superseded TD OCT in the UK. 3.3 The resolution of coronary OCT is reported to be 10 times higher than that of intravascular ultrasound, and has rapid 3-dimensional reconstruction capability. The aim of providing more detailed images is to improve clinical outcome. 4 Efficacy This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview. 4.1 A retrospective case series compared 335 matched pairs of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with either angiographic guidance alone or a combination of angiographic and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (FD OCT) guidance. Cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI) were less frequent in patients treated by PCI with a combination of angiographic and FD OCT guidance than in those treated
