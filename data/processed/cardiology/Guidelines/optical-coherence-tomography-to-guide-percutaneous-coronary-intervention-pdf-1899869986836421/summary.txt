1 Recommendations 1.1 The evidence on the safety of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shows no major concerns. The evidence on efficacy is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. 1.2 Clinicians wishing to undertake OCT to guide PCI should take the following actions. • Inform the clinical governance leads in their NHS trusts. • Ensure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's efficacy and provide them with clear written information.
