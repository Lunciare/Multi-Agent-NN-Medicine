Optical coherence tomography to guide percutaneous coronary intervention

the evidence, see the overview. 5.1 A large coronary perforation occurred (no further details of cause available) during optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in 1 patient presented in a case report, leading to reduced blood pressure and loss of consciousness. Surgical repair was done but the patient died of cardiac arrest after 7 days. 5.2 A minor type A coronary dissection occurred in 1 patient in the case series of 468 patients during time-domain OCT (TD OCT) imaging. Coronary blood flow was not impaired and further treatment was not needed. 5.3 Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 5 patients in a case series of 468 patients during TD OCT imaging, in 3 out of 256 during occlusive imaging and 2 out of 212 during non-occlusive imaging. In all cases, sinus rhythm was promptly restored after stopping OCT imaging and external defibrillation. Ventricular ectopic beats were noted in 3 patients in a case series of 90 patients undergoing 114 OCT image acquisitions. 5.4 Air embolism occurred in 3 patients in the case series of 468 patients during TD OCT imaging. All responded promptly to air aspiration, treatment with nitrates and, in 1 patient, nitroprusside administration. 5.5 Mechanical device failure occurred in 1 patient
