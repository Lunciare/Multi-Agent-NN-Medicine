Optical coherence tomography to guide percutaneous coronary intervention

the case series of 468 patients. This was significantly more common when the occlusive rather than the non-occlusive technique was used (70% [180 out of 256] versus 21% [45 out of 212], p<0.001). 5.9 Self-limiting QRS widening or ST depression and ST elevation occurred in 192 (46%) of 468 patients treated by occlusive or non-occlusive TD OCT. These were significantly more common when the occlusive rather than the non-occlusive technique was used (61% [139 out of 256] versus 27% [53 out of 212], p<0.001). 5.10 The specialist advisers described the possibility that emergency revascularisation might be needed as a result of some of the complications of OCT which were reported in the literature. 6 Committee comments 6.1 The Committee was aware of the large numbers of patients in whom optical coherence tomography during percutaneous coronary interventions might be used. It considered that a high degree of certainty about the clinical utility of the procedure was therefore necessary, and this underpinned the recommendation in section 1.1.
