Optical coherence tomography to guide percutaneous coronary intervention

medium- and long-term clinical outcomes, including the need for revascularisation. 2 Indications and current treatments 2.1 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses a catheter emitting near-infrared light to produce high-resolution images of blood vessel walls. It may be used to assess stenotic lesions in the coronary arteries and to image the result of stent deployment during percutaneous coronary interventions. 2.2 Coronary angiography is used to image coronary arteries immediately before angioplasty. Intravascular ultrasound or OCT may be used to provide additional and complementary information to coronary angiography. 3 The procedure 3.1 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is usually performed using local anaesthesia. A guide wire and delivery sheath are introduced percutaneously into either the femoral or radial artery and passed into the target coronary artery using fluoroscopic image guidance. OCT imaging needs a blood-free field. This was first achieved by an occlusive technique, using an occlusion balloon with first-generation, time-domain OCT (TD OCT), but this technique is no longer used in clinical practice. A non-occlusive technique is now used, involving continuous flushing of contrast with frequency-domain OCT (FD OCT). For non-occlusive OCT, a guide wire through which contrast can be injected is used. The imaging catheter is delivered over this wire. Injection
