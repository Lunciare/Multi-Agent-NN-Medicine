Optical coherence tomography to guide percutaneous coronary intervention

of 468 patients during TD OCT imaging. All responded promptly to air aspiration, treatment with nitrates and, in 1 patient, nitroprusside administration. 5.5 Mechanical device failure occurred in 1 patient in the case series of 468 patients. The imaging wire became trapped within the struts of a stent and the tip fractured and remained within the stent. At 4-month follow-up there had been no clinical consequences and angiography showed no flow abnormalities. 5.6 Multiple thrombi were reported during OCT imaging in 3 patients presented in case reports. These formed during OCT imaging in the left anterior descending artery causing total occlusion in 1 patient and subtotal occlusion in 2 others. All resolved with appropriate management and all patients recovered uneventfully. 5.7 Vessel spasm during withdrawal of the OCT wire was reported in a single case report. This caused chest pain and ST elevation but resolved with an intracoronary injection of nitrate. 5.8 Self-limiting chest pain was reported by 48% of patients (225 out of 468) during TD OCT imaging in the case series of 468 patients. This was significantly more common when the occlusive rather than the non-occlusive technique was used (70% [180 out of 256] versus 21% [45 out
