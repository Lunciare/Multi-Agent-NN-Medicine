treating intermittent claudication in people for whom vasodilator therapy is considered appropriate after taking into account other treatment options. Cilostazol, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate are not recommended. The NICE guideline on lower limb peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management advises that naftidrofuryl oxalate should be considered only when supervised exercise has not led to satisfactory improvement and the person prefers not to be referred for consideration of angioplasty or bypass surgery. Progress should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months and treatment discontinued if there has been no symptomatic benefit. For more information on the management of peripheral arterial disease, see the NICE clinical knowledge summary on peripheral arterial disease and the NICE pathway on lower limb peripheral arterial disease. This evidence summary considers the evidence for using ramipril to treat the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication), rather than for reducing cardiovascular risk in people with peripheral arterial disease. Product overview Drug action Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which causes vasodilation by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, and preventing the breakdown of the vasodilator bradykinin (see the summary of product characteristics for Tritace).
