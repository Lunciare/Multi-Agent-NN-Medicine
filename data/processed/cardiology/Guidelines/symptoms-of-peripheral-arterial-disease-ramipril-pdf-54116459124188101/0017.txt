Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

on statistical powering of the study, the primary outcome is assumed to be change in maximum walking time, although this is not specified in the paper. Participants in Shahin et al. (2013a) were followed up at weeks 2, 6 and 24. Outcomes included treadmill maximum and pain-free walking distances (treadmill speed 2.5 km/hour, incline 10%), quality of life scores (EQ-5D, Short-Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36], King's College Hospital's vascular quality of life questionnaire [VascuQoL]) and adverse events. From the information on powering of this study, the primary outcome is assumed to be change in maximum walking distance, although this is not specified in the paper. ABPI was also assessed in the studies but is not discussed in this evidence summary because it is a disease orientated outcome and has limited applicability to practice.
