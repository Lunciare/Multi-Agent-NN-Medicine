Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

the production of this evidence summary considered that walking times (used in Ahimastos et al. 2006) are of little value in assessing clinical impact of treatments for intermittent claudication. In addition, walking distance should be supported by a quality of life measure because a small increase in walking distance may not affect a person's quality of life. Shahin et al. (2013a) found no differences between the groups in 3 quality of life measures. The 2 studies were small (n=33 and n=40), affecting their power to detect differences between the groups. Participants had stable intermittent claudication that limited their mobility and exercise tolerance, and stable concurrent medical therapies. The results may not be generalisable to people with less severe intermittent claudication or comorbid conditions (for example, concomitant disease limiting walking, including coronary artery disease, or renal impairment). Participants in Ahimastos et al. (2006) had no history of diabetes or hypertension. A higher proportion of participants in Shahin et al. (2013a) had hypertension or diabetes mellitus and took antiplatelet and lipid-lowering drugs than in the other study. Most of the participants in the studies were white and male (average age about 65 years) and around 40% were smokers. It is known that
