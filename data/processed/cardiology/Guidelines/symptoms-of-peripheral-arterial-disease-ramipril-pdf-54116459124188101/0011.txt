Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

degree of peripheral arterial disease. Incidence is high in people who smoke, people with diabetes and people with coronary artery disease. In most people with intermittent claudication the symptoms remain stable, but approximately 20% will develop increasingly severe symptoms, of whom some will develop critical limb ischaemia. Mild intermittent claudication is generally managed in primary care: referral to secondary care is usually reserved for people whose symptoms do not resolve or deteriorate, or are disabling. Treatment options for intermittent claudication include management of cardiovascular risk factors (for example, smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, using antiplatelet drugs and statins), supervised exercise and vasoactive drug treatment (naftidrofuryl oxalate). People with severe and disabling intermittent claudication that is inadequately controlled by the above treatments are often referred to secondary care for consideration of endovascular treatment (such as angioplasty and stenting) and bypass surgery. NICE technology appraisal guidance on cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease recommends naftidrofuryl oxalate as an option for treating intermittent claudication in people for whom vasodilator therapy is considered appropriate after taking into account other treatment options. Cilostazol, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate are not recommended. The NICE guideline
