Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

more information on baseline characteristics. • Intervention and comparison: In the study by Ahimastos et al. (2006), participants were randomised to receive ramipril 10 mg daily or placebo for 24 weeks, and were asked to maintain their lifestyle throughout the trial. Baseline characteristics were reported to be similar between the groups. In Shahin et al. (2013a), participants were randomised to receive ramipril 5 mg daily or placebo for 2 weeks, followed by 10 mg daily or placebo for 22 weeks. In this study, the majority of baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. The methods of randomisation used suggest allocation was concealed in both studies. • Outcomes: In Ahimastos et al. (2006), outcomes were assessed before and after treatment and included maximum and pain-free walking times (treadmill speed 3.2 km/ hour, incline 12%), Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores (WIQ, an assessment of walking distance, speed and stair-climbing ability in peripheral arterial disease, scored from 0−100 with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and greater functional capacity) and adverse events. From the information on statistical powering of the study, the primary outcome is assumed to be change in maximum walking time, although this is not specified in the paper. Participants in Shahin et
