NICE technology appraisal guidance on cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease, vasoactive drugs are now used infrequently for intermittent claudication. Off-label drugs should only be considered when there are good clinical reasons to do so, usually when there is no licensed medicine for the condition requiring treatment, or the licensed medicine is not appropriate for that individual. Therefore, the place in therapy of ramipril is likely to be very limited. One of the specialists considered that, if a trial of ramipril treatment is considered appropriate, it should be discontinued after 3 months if there is no benefit. Context and estimated impact for the NHS Cost effectiveness No cost-effectiveness studies were identified that compared ramipril with other treatments or placebo for managing symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. Costs of 28 days' treatment with ramipril 10 mg daily, the dose used in the studies, are shown in table 3. Table 3 Costs of ramipril treatment Cost (excluding VAT; Drug Cost (excluding VAT) of 28 days' Tariff, October 2015) treatment at 10 mg daily 10 mg capsules £1.28 for 28 £1.28 10 mg tablets £1.33 for 28 £1.33 2.5 mg/5
