of introduction and current guidance. Product overview Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) that is licensed for treating hypertension, renal disease and symptomatic heart failure. It is also licensed for the secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction, and the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in people with manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (including peripheral arterial disease) or diabetes with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. See the summary of product characteristics for Tritace for more information. This evidence summary considers the evidence for using ramipril to treat the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication), rather than for reducing cardiovascular risk in people with peripheral arterial disease. The use of ramipril to treat symptoms of peripheral arterial disease is off-label. Full text of product overview. Evidence review • This evidence summary discusses 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs: Ahimastos et al. 2006 and Shahin et al. 2013a [n=40 and n=33 respectively]) that evaluated ramipril for treating people with stable intermittent claudication and concurrent medical treatment, and no comorbid conditions limiting walking ability or renal impairment. Participants were randomised to receive ramipril 10 mg daily or placebo for 24 weeks (including a 2-week dose titration period using ramipril 5 mg
