Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

for Tritace, common adverse effects of ramipril (seen in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people) include headache, dizziness, cough, sinusitis, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, muscle spasms, myalgia, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, syncope, chest pain and fatigue. Serious adverse effects include angioedema, hyperkalaemia, renal or hepatic impairment, pancreatitis, severe skin reactions and neutropenia/agranulocytosis. Renal function should be assessed before and during ramipril treatment, particularly in people with renal impairment. Evidence strengths and limitations The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study showed that ramipril has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality and it is licensed for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with manifest atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (including peripheral arterial disease). The 2 small RCTs by Ahimastos et al. (2006) and Shahin et al. (2013a) suggest that ramipril 10 mg daily also improves treadmill walking ability (maximum walking and pain free walking) in people with intermittent claudication over 24 weeks and the improvements appear to be clinically important. This is supported by improvements in WIQ distance, speed and stair-climbing scores in Ahimastos et al. (2006), which may be more representative of activities of daily living than treadmill tests. However, the WIQ is a measure of walking impairment generally, not
