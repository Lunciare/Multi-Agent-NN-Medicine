Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

scores in Ahimastos et al. (2006), which may be more representative of activities of daily living than treadmill tests. However, the WIQ is a measure of walking impairment generally, not just that due to intermittent claudication, and Ahimastos et al. (2006) state that the WIQ has restricted capacity to discriminate between people with poor exercise tolerance. In addition, the studies have other limitations. Clinical specialists involved in the development of the NICE technology appraisal considered that neither ABPI or pain-free walking distance were clinically relevant outcome measures because ABPI is used in clinical practice only as a diagnostic tool for peripheral arterial disease, and pain-free walking distance can be difficult to assess without using a fixed-speed treadmill because patients usually adjust the speed of their walking to avoid pain and to maximise walking distance. Treadmill testing is unlikely to be offered in the course of routine clinical practice. In addition, the clinical specialists agreed that maximum walking distance was the most suitable outcome measure. One of the specialists involved in the production of this evidence summary considered that walking times (used in Ahimastos et al. 2006) are of little value in assessing clinical impact of treatments for intermittent claudication.
