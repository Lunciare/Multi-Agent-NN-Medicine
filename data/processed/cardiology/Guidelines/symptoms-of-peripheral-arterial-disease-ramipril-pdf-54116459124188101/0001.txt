Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

Summary The evidence for the efficacy of ramipril in relieving the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease is very limited. Two small RCTs (Ahimastos et al. 2006, n=40 and Shahin et al. 2013a, n=33) found that, compared with placebo, over 24 weeks, ramipril 10 mg daily improved maximum and pain-free walking times and distances in people with stable intermittent claudication, a symptom of peripheral arterial disease. However, while these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance of the results is unclear. No adverse effects were reported in 1 study. In the other study, the adverse effect most often reported with ramipril was cough, which led to discontinuation in some cases. The studies have many limitations and ramipril has not been compared directly with other treatments for intermittent claudication. Higher quality evidence on the efficacy and safety of ramipril is needed in order to determine its place in therapy. A third study (n=212) was originally included in this evidence summary but has now been removed. This follows a statement published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which advises that the study has been retracted after the lead author admitted to fabricating the results of this and a related study.
