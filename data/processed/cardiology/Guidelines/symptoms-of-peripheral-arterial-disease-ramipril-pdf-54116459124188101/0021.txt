Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

It is unclear whether these improvements are clinically important. However, in the ramipril groups, the mean maximum walking time approximately tripled in Ahimastos et al. (2006) (from 234 seconds to 675 seconds) compared with baseline, which may be considered a relevant improvement by patients. Shahin et al. (2013a) (n=33) reported walking distance rather than time and found that, compared with placebo, ramipril 10 mg daily statistically significantly improved mean maximum walking distance (131 m, p=0.001) and mean pain-free walking distance (122 m, p=0.001) over 24 weeks. According to the full NICE guideline on peripheral arterial disease, the minimum clinically important difference is a doubling in baseline values for mean maximum walking distance and pain-free walking distance. Although the complete data are not reported by Shahin et al. (2013a), at baseline median maximum walking distance was 137 m and pain-free walking distance was 81 m, and improvements in these outcomes at 24 weeks are reported to be statistically significant compared with 2 weeks and 6 weeks (p=0.006 and p=0.010 respectively for maximum walking distance and p=0.020 and p=0.042 respectively for pain-free walking distance). Ahimastos et al. (2006) found that ramipril 10 mg daily improved WIQ distance, speed and stair-climbing scores at
