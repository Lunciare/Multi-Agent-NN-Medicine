(2013a) are from 2 weeks to 24 weeks, not baseline to 24 weeks, because participants received a lower dose of ramipril (or placebo) for a 2-week run-in period c p value is for change from baseline Clinical effectiveness Ahimastos et al. (2006) (n=40) found that, in people with intermittent claudication, ramipril 10 mg daily statistically significantly increased mean maximum walking time (451 seconds, p<0.001) and mean pain-free walking time (227 seconds, p<0.001) compared with placebo over 24 weeks. It is unclear whether these improvements are clinically important. However, in the ramipril groups, the mean maximum walking time approximately tripled in Ahimastos et al. (2006) (from 234 seconds to
