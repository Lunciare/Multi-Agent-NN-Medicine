Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

the evidence summary because they were primarily based on the RCT by Ahimastos et al. (2013). However, some background data on the studies that are still included was obtained from the meta-analysis and is still referenced within the document. Ahimastos et al. (2006) and Shahin et al. (2013a) • Design: Both studies were randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. • Patients: The study by Ahimastos et al. (2006) was undertaken in Australia and included 40 people. Shahin et al. (2013a) was undertaken in the UK and included 33 people. Participants in both studies had stable intermittent claudication for 6 months (which limited their mobility and exercise tolerance), an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI, a measure of the severity of peripheral arterial disease) of less than 0.9 at rest, blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or less, and no concomitant disease limiting walking (including coronary artery disease), renal impairment or ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker treatment. Participants in Ahimastos et al. (2006) had no history of diabetes or hypertension. See table 1 for more information on baseline characteristics. • Intervention and comparison: In the study by Ahimastos et al. (2006), participants were randomised to receive ramipril 10 mg daily or placebo for 24
