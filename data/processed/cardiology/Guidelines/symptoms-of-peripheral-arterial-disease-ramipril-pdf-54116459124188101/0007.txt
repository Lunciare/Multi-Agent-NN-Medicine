comparisons with placebo are reported. • Shahin et al. (2013a) found no statistically significant differences between the groups in the 3 quality of life measures used in the study (scores (EQ-5D, Short-Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36] and King's College Hospital's vascular quality of life questionnaire [VascuQoL]). • According to the summary of product characteristics for Tritace, common adverse effects of ramipril (seen in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 people) include headache, dizziness, cough, sinusitis, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, muscle spasms, myalgia, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, syncope, chest pain and fatigue. Renal function should be assessed before and during ramipril treatment, particularly in people with renal impairment. • No adverse effects were reported the study by Ahimastos et al. (2006). In Shahin et al. (2013a), the adverse effect most often reported with ramipril was cough, which led to discontinuation in some cases. • The 2 studies were small (n=33 and n=40), affecting their statistical power to detect differences between the groups. Participants had stable intermittent claudication that limited their mobility and exercise tolerance, and stable concurrent medical therapies. The results may not be generalisable to people with less severe intermittent claudication or comorbid conditions (for example, concomitant disease limiting walking,
