(2006) found that ramipril 10 mg daily improved WIQ distance, speed and stair-climbing scores at 24 weeks compared with baseline (all p<0.001) but no comparisons with placebo are reported. Shahin et al. (2013a) found no significant differences between the groups in the 3 quality of life measures used in the study (EQ-5D, SF-36 and VascuQoL).
