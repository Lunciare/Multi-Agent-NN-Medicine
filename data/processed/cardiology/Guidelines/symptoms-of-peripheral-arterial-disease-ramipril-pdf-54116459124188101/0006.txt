Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease: ramipril

limiting walking ability or renal impairment. Participants were randomised to receive ramipril 10 mg daily or placebo for 24 weeks (including a 2-week dose titration period using ramipril 5 mg daily in Shahin et al. 2013a). • Ahimastos et al. (2006) found that ramipril 10 mg daily statistically significantly increased mean maximum walking time (451 seconds, p<0.001) and mean pain-free walking time (227 seconds, p<0.001) compared with placebo over 24 weeks. Shahin et al. (2013a) reported walking distance rather than time and found that, compared with placebo, ramipril 10 mg daily statistically significantly improved mean maximum walking distance (131 m, p=0.001) and mean pain-free walking distance (122 m, p=0.001) over 24 weeks. Although unclear from the data reported, improvements from baseline in the studies may be clinically important (see the evidence review section of this evidence summary for more details). • Ahimastos et al. (2006) found that ramipril 10 mg daily improved Walking Impairment Questionnaire distance, speed and stair-climbing scores at 24 weeks compared with baseline (all p<0.001) but no comparisons with placebo are reported. • Shahin et al. (2013a) found no statistically significant differences between the groups in the 3 quality of life measures used in the study (scores
