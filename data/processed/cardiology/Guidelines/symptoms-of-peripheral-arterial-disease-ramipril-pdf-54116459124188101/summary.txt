Summary The evidence for the efficacy of ramipril in relieving the symptoms of peripheral arterial disease is very limited. Two small RCTs (Ahimastos et al. 2006, n=40 and Shahin et al. 2013a, n=33) found that, compared with placebo, over 24 weeks, ramipril 10 mg daily improved maximum and pain-free walking times and distances in people with stable intermittent claudication, a symptom of peripheral arterial disease. However, while these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance of the results is unclear. No adverse effects were reported in 1 study.
