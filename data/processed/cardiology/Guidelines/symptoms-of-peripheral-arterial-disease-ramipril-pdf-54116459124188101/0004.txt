ACE inhibitors are less effective for treating hypertension in people of African or Caribbean family origin; therefore, the studies may not apply to this population. • It is not known how ramipril compares with other treatments for intermittent claudication. Introduction and current guidance Peripheral arterial disease, also known as peripheral vascular disease, is a condition in which arteries that carry blood to the legs (or less commonly the arms) are narrowed or blocked. Peripheral arterial disease is generally caused by atherosclerosis and it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events even when it is asymptomatic. The most common initial symptom of peripheral arterial disease is pain in the legs while walking, which is relieved by rest, known as intermittent claudication. Treatment options for intermittent claudication include management of cardiovascular risk factors (for example, smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, using antiplatelet drugs and statins), supervised exercise and vasoactive drug treatment (naftidrofuryl oxalate).
