NICE guidance. Full evidence summary Introduction and current guidance Peripheral arterial disease, also known as peripheral vascular disease, is a condition in which arteries that carry blood to the legs (or less commonly the arms) are narrowed or blocked. The usual cause of peripheral arterial disease is atherosclerosis (Cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease NICE technology appraisal 223). The NICE guideline on lower limb peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management highlights that the condition is a marker for increased risk of cardiovascular events even when it is asymptomatic. The most common initial symptom of peripheral arterial disease is pain in the legs while walking, which is relieved by rest, known as intermittent claudication. When circulation is severely reduced, critical limb ischaemia occurs, characterised by ischaemic pain at rest, ulceration, tissue loss and gangrene. The incidence of peripheral arterial disease increases with age. Population studies have found that about 20% of people aged over 60 years have some degree of peripheral arterial disease. Incidence is high in people who smoke, people with diabetes and people with coronary artery disease. In most people with intermittent claudication the symptoms remain
