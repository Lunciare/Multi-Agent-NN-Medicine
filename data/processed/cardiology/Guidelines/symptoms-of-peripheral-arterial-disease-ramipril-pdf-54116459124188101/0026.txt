than in the other study. Most of the participants in the studies were white and male (average age about 65 years) and around 40% were smokers. It is known that ACE inhibitors are less effective for treating some hypertension in people of African or Caribbean family origin; therefore, the studies on intermittent claudication may not apply to this population. Ramipril has not been compared directly with other treatments for intermittent claudication. Also, the dose of ramipril used in the 2 RCTs was the maximum licensed dose (10 mg) and it is not known whether lower doses would also improve intermittent claudication. The treatment period was 24 weeks and it is unclear whether benefits will be maintained in the longer term. Overall, specialists involved in the production of this evidence summary consider that the improvements in walking seen with ramipril in the studies may be clinically relevant. However, they stress that higher quality evidence is needed before recommendations can be made about when it should be used. In line with the NICE technology appraisal guidance on cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease, vasoactive drugs are now used infrequently
