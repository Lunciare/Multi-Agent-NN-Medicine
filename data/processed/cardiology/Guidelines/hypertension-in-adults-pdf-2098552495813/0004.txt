pressure monitoring (ABPM) ABPM involves a cuff and bladder connected to electronic sensors that detect changes in cuff pressure and allow blood pressure to be measured oscillometrically. Systolic and diastolic pressure readings are deduced from the shape of oscillometric pressure changes using an algorithm built into the measuring device. A patient's blood pressure can be automatically measured at repeated intervals throughout the day and night while they continue routine activities. Systolic and diastolic pressure can be plotted over time, with most devices providing average day, night and 24-hour pressures. NICE recommends recording a daytime average to confirm diagnosis. [NICE's 2011 full guideline on hypertension in adults, section 5.7.3] Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) HBPM devices are oscillometric and measure blood pressure on the upper arm, the wrist or the finger. Home monitoring potentially offers some similar benefits to ABPM. Frequent measurement produces average values that may be more reproducible and reliable than traditional clinic measurement. To confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, blood pressure should be measured twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening and continued for at least 4 days, ideally 7 days. For each blood pressure recording, 2 consecutive measures should be taken at least 1 minute apart
