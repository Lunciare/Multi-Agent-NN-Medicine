Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

noted that the technology is incorporated into the person's CIED and does not need the person to engage directly with the technology themselves. People may feel confined to their home to ensure their data is transmitted 3.29 All of the algorithms can transmit data using Wi-Fi, and some using a landline connection. If people are not in range of a connection, their data will not be transmitted until they are in range. This may cause anxiety for some people when leaving their home, because they do not want to risk transmission of an important alert being missed or delayed. Ensuring equitable access to heart failure algorithms 3.30 The committee discussed that for heart failure algorithms to be used effectively in clinical practice, they should be used as part of a multidisciplinary specialist heart failure service and specialist staff should be available to review and action alerts. Protocols should also be in place to ensure heart failure is properly managed and alerts are responded to in a timely manner. At present, the way centres manage heart failure and respond to alerts can vary. This could mean that some centres are unable to implement heart failure algorithms into their services, which could
