Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

a single published study suggested that, at the nominal threshold of 4.5, HeartInsight had 65.5% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity for the endpoint of first post-implant heart failure hospitalisation. For the endpoint of heart failure hospitalisation, outpatient intravenous intervention or death, HeartInsight had 54.8% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity. The positive predictive value was reported as 7.7%, indicating that there is a high probability that an alert is a false positive. This study was also assessed by the EAG as being at a high risk of bias, with a key concern being the analysis methods. The committee concluded that it is uncertain whether HeartInsight can accurately predict heart failure events. 3.6 Using the study endpoint of worsening heart failure, HeartLogic showed sensitivity ranging from 70% to 100%, and specificity ranging from 61% to 93%. False positives and unexplained alert rates were generally low in 6 studies. Statistically significant associations were observed between being in alert and hospitalisations, length of hospital stay, rate of heart failure events and rate of emergency care visits. All studies reporting prognostic accuracy data for HeartLogic were assessed by the EAG as being at a high risk of bias with the analysis methods being a key concern. The
