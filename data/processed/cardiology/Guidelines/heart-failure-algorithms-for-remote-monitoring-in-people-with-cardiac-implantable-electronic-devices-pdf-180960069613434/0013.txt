Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

an unscheduled review would only be triggered if the person reports worsening symptoms. Algorithm-based remote monitoring provides reassurance to people because they know that alerts are transmitted automatically and reviewed by a healthcare professional, potentially before they experience symptoms. This could prevent people being admitted to hospital and improve their quality of life. But the committee acknowledged that, for some people, false-positive alerts (when an alert is triggered but there are no signs of decompensation) may cause unnecessary anxiety. The committee recommended more research on people's experiences with having heart failure algorithms activated on their CIEDs. Clinical effectiveness Prognostic accuracy 3.3 The committee noted that the heart failure algorithms needed to be considered independently of each other because they are each unique and have different alert rates and levels of accuracy. Each of the heart failure algorithms collects different data types to monitor decompensation or predict a person's risk status. The committee noted that CorVue collects only intrathoracic impedance data, while the other algorithms monitor additional factors (see sections 2.5 to 2.11). The committee noted that the prognostic accuracy of CorVue may be affected by the collection of only 1 data type. 3.4 For the heart failure event endpoint defined
