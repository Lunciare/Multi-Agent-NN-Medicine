variability • general activity • thoracic impedance • heart rate • heart rate at rest and • premature ventricular contractions. 2.8 HeartInsight triggers an alert to healthcare professionals (via text message, email or both) once the prespecified threshold is exceeded for 3 consecutive transmissions (normally 3 consecutive days), indicating higher risk of worsening heart failure. The threshold is customisable. Upon receipt of an alert, a healthcare professional logs on to the Home Monitoring Service Centre website to review and assess the alert. 2.9 The system includes the handheld CardioMessenger device, which transmits data automatically and daily from the CIED to the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring system via a mobile phone network. Access to HeartInsight has a one-off cost of £450 per person. Standard Home Monitoring is a separate cost. HeartLogic (Boston Scientific) 2.10 HeartLogic is a diagnostic algorithm designed to monitor for early signs of worsening heart failure in people with compatible CIEDs. It works with the Latitude NXT Patient Management System. Measurements including heart sounds, thoracic impedance, respiration, heart rate and activity are collected by the implanted device. The HeartLogic algorithm then combines these into 1 composite index that indicates decompensation. Boston Scientific's HeartLogic and Latitude NXT Patient Management System
