failure or worsening heart failure in people with CIEDs. When TriageHF is used within a structured heart failure clinical care pathway it is called TriageHF Plus. TriageHF is hosted on the Medtronic CareLink network for collaborative management of heart failure between clinical teams. The algorithm monitors the following parameters: • atrial tachycardia • atrial fibrillation burden • ventricular rate during atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation • OptiVol fluid index (which tracks changes in thoracic impedance over time) • general activity • night ventricular rate • heart rate variability • percent of ventricular pacing • treated ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and • defibrillator shocks. CareLink uses a plug-in monitor or a smartphone app for transmitting data. Using a mobile or landline connection, data is transmitted from the CIED to the CareLink network where it can be accessed by healthcare professionals. Data can be transmitted: • manually, if a person notices symptoms • automatically, based on TriageHF algorithm alert triggers, or • by scheduled transmission, based on a predefined date to replace a routine check. For each day the data is transmitted, the TriageHF algorithm generates a daily risk status of a heart failure event occurring in the next 30 days
