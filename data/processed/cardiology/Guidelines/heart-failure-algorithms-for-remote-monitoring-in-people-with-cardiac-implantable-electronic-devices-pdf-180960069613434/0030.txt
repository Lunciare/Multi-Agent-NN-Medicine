could benefit these people, because signs of decompensation would be detected and healthcare professionals automatically alerted, before the person needs to seek emergency assistance. For this reason, people who are unable to advocate for themselves or who have less awareness of their symptoms would also benefit from heart failure algorithms. Algorithm-based remote monitoring could also benefit people who are less mobile or people who live in remote areas. This is because following an alert, initial follow up may be a phone call to determine if an in-person follow up is necessary. This will reduce the need for unnecessary travel to hospital appointments. Digital inclusion 3.28 Apart from the technologies that can use a landline to send data, access to technologies for remote monitoring may be restricted in some populations because of internet requirements. This may mean that older people, people from lower socioeconomic groups and people in rural areas could be less able to use algorithm-based remote monitoring because they do not have access to a Wi-Fi connection. The committee noted that the technology is incorporated into the person's CIED and does not need the person to engage directly with the technology themselves. People may feel confined to their home
