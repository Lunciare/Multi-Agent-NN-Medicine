Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

scheduled follow-up visits per year and 1 scheduled follow-up visit per year. These scenario analyses did not impact the direction of the model results. Modelling of unscheduled visits 3.23 In the EAG's base-case model it was assumed that all alerts are reviewed and followed by an unscheduled, in-person follow-up visit. In practice, alerts may be followed by an initial remote interaction (such as a phone call) to determine whether an in-person visit is necessary. Scenarios were modelled in which it was assumed that 25% and 50% of alerts initially require non-face-to-face follow up. The committee agreed that the base-case scenario and scenario analyses were reasonable. Scenarios were also done in which the base-case number of interactions in the intervention arm was doubled and quadrupled. The committee agreed that this assumption was reasonable. This was because the overall number of interactions is likely to be increased in the heart failure algorithm arm because of healthcare professionals reviewing alerts and following up with people remotely or in-person. Unscheduled emergency visits to an emergency department or primary care settings were not modelled. The committee noted that the number of emergency visits is expected to be lower for people with heart failure algorithms because
