Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

to 2.11). The committee noted that the prognostic accuracy of CorVue may be affected by the collection of only 1 data type. 3.4 For the heart failure event endpoint defined by the Framingham Heart Study, CorVue had a sensitivity of 68%. For endpoints related to hospitalisation, clinic visits and changes to treatment, sensitivity ranged from 20% to 61.9%. This suggests that people who are experiencing decompensation may not have an alert triggered using CorVue. Clinical experts noted that heart failure algorithms should have a high sensitivity. This is to ensure that people with early signs of a heart failure event can be identified, assessed and have treatment if necessary, and so people are not missed. False positives were also considered to be high in all studies reporting this outcome. All studies were also assessed by the external assessment group (EAG) as being at a high risk of bias, with a key concern being the analysis methods. The committee concluded that CorVue cannot accurately predict heart failure events. 3.5 Evidence from a single published study suggested that, at the nominal threshold of 4.5, HeartInsight had 65.5% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity for the endpoint of first post-implant heart failure hospitalisation.
