Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

for CorVue and HeartInsight. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 3.18 The EAG's economic model showed that HeartLogic and TriageHF were more effective and less costly than standard care. The first probabilistic sensitivity analysis used probability distributions around mortality and intervention costs. This analysis showed that the probability of HeartLogic being cost effective was 81% at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and 73% at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. The probability of TriageHF being cost effective was 85% at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained and 76% at a threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. The committee noted that intervention costs would not be higher than the list price and so uncertainty around intervention cost should not be included in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The committee acknowledged the importance of considering the uncertainty around mortality rates, but noted limitations with how this uncertainty had been modelled. So, an additional probabilistic sensitivity analysis that excluded uncertainty around intervention costs and mortality was done. This analysis showed that both HeartLogic and TriageHF have a 100% probability of being cost effective at thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained. Cost-effectiveness estimates are driven by hospitalisation rates 3.19
