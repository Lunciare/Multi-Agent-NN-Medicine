Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

emergency department or primary care settings were not modelled. The committee noted that the number of emergency visits is expected to be lower for people with heart failure algorithms because alerts are intended to be triggered before the person experiences symptoms. More data is needed on people without a diagnosis of heart failure 3.24 There was very limited evidence in people who have a CIED and do not have a diagnosis of heart failure but are at high risk of new onset acute heart failure. One study for TriageHF reported that a proportion of people in the cohort did not have a prior diagnosis of heart failure. But results were not reported separately for each population and so could not be used by the EAG to model the population of people at risk of heart failure. The committee agreed that data is needed on the prognostic accuracy and clinical impact of using heart failure algorithms in this population. Collection of registry data 3.25 The committee noted that the evidence available for HeartLogic and TriageHF suggests that they can accurately detect the signs of worsening heart failure that could lead to hospitalisation or an unscheduled clinic event. The evidence also suggests
