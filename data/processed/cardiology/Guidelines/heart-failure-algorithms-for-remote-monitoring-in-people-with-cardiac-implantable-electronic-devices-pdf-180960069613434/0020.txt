Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

reduce heart failure events compared with no algorithm use. TriageHF 3.14 For TriageHF, comparative evidence was limited to 1 study, Ahmed et al. (2024). This is a real-world, UK study of 758 people. This study reported a statistically significant reduction in hospitalisation with TriageHF compared with no algorithm use. Ahmed et al. was assessed by the EAG as being at a critical risk of bias because of risks of confounding and selection bias. The committee concluded that while there are concerns regarding the quality of the comparative evidence from Ahmed et al., it is likely that TriageHF can reduce heart failure events compared with no algorithm use. Failure rates 3.15 CIEDs may fail to transmit data if there are technical problems or connectivity issues, including internet problems, or if they are out of range of the transmission device. The committee noted that failure rates in the studies appear to be high, but it is difficult to separate transmission failure due to technical issues from transmission failure due to connectivity issues. If data transmission is missed, each algorithm has built-in retry mechanisms that will attempt transmission again. Healthcare professionals will be notified if a person's data transmission is missed for a
