Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

CorVue is not recommended for use in the NHS. 2 Heart failure algorithms Clinical need and practice 2.1 Heart failure is a clinical syndrome caused by any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the heart's ability to efficiently pump blood around the body. The most common symptoms of heart failure are breathlessness, fatigue and oedema. Conditions that can cause heart failure include: • coronary heart disease • high blood pressure • heart rhythm or valve abnormalities and • conditions affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies and myocarditis). Around 920,000 people in the UK were living with heart failure in 2018 with an estimated 200,000 new diagnoses each year. Heart failure mainly affects people over 65, with an average age at diagnosis of 77. 2.2 Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are recommended as treatment options for some people who have or are at high risk of heart failure. The different types of CIEDs are pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronisation therapy devices. 2.3 Remote monitoring is the ability for a CIED to communicate wirelessly with a remote monitoring system. People who have CIEDs must be followed up by hospitals for regular technical reviews of how their device is working. They
