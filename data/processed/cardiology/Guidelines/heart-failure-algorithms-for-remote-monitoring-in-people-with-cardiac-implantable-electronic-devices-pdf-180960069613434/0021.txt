Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

If data transmission is missed, each algorithm has built-in retry mechanisms that will attempt transmission again. Healthcare professionals will be notified if a person's data transmission is missed for a number of weeks. The companies commented that they pay stringent attention to device failures and always follow up on these. High failure rates reported in Debski et al. (2020) have been addressed by ensuring that devices are correctly programmed and that local protocols are in place. The committee concluded that they have no concerns regarding transmission failure, because systems are in place to manage and resolve this. Cost effectiveness A pairwise analysis approach was used 3.16 A pairwise analysis approach was taken to estimating cost effectiveness. This was because of the lack of data comparing algorithms and because the comparator for each algorithm is a brand-specific CIED that is not using the heart failure algorithm. The EAG explained that the comparator costs differ for each pairwise analysis because different data sources were used to derive model inputs. For HeartLogic and TriageHF, evidence on hospitalisation rates was available, so different rates were used for these 2 interventions and their comparators. Because of the lack of evidence for CorVue and HeartInsight, no
