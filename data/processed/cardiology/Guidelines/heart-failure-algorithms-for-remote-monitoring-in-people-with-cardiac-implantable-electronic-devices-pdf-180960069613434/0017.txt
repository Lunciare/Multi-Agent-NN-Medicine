Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

concern was the analysis methods, and some of the studies were only available as abstracts that contained limited information. The committee concluded that while there are some concerns regarding the quality of the prognostic accuracy data, it is likely that TriageHF can predict heart failure events. False-positive or unexplained alerts 3.8 The committee noted that heart failure algorithms are intended to be used to support review of heart failure data by healthcare professionals, and should not be used in isolation to make treatment decisions. This is because events other than heart failure decompensation can sometimes trigger an alert. For example, viral respiratory illnesses can increase a person's intrathoracic impedance, which could cause an alert to be triggered even if the person has no decompensation. In a study this would be classed as a false-positive alert. The committee noted that these alerts and the follow up with a person would still be valuable because a non-heart-failure clinical event may still require intervention. 3.9 Some studies reported high rates of false-positive alerts. But the committee noted that all alerts would be reviewed alongside other clinical information and discussed with the person before a treatment decision is made. So the committee considered that
