Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

TriageHF, evidence on hospitalisation rates was available, so different rates were used for these 2 interventions and their comparators. Because of the lack of evidence for CorVue and HeartInsight, no difference in hospitalisation was assumed between these heart failure algorithms and their comparators. The hospitalisation rate for these 2 algorithms and their comparators was assumed to be an average of the rates used for HeartLogic and TriageHF. Model structure 3.17 The EAG used comparative hospitalisation data to model the impact of heart failure algorithms rather than using prognostic accuracy data and a linked evidence approach. False-positive alerts were indirectly captured in the model for HeartLogic and TriageHF because study results on the number of unscheduled visits would be impacted by false-positive alerts. For CorVue and HeartInsight, no published data was available on unscheduled visits, so it was assumed that there was no difference in the number of unscheduled visits between these heart failure algorithms and their comparators. This may underestimate the impact that false-positive alerts have on the cost-effectiveness estimates for CorVue and HeartInsight. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 3.18 The EAG's economic model showed that HeartLogic and TriageHF were more effective and less costly than standard care. The first probabilistic sensitivity
