Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

likely to be cost-effective uses of NHS resources. Potential uncaptured benefits 3.21 There was a lack of evidence for the impact of heart failure algorithms on heart- failure-related mortality rates and health-related quality of life. In the EAG's deterministic base-case model, conservative assumptions were made that there is no difference in heart-failure-related mortality rates between heart failure algorithms and their comparators. The committee noted that if there was an improvement in mortality or if health-related quality of life is greater when using heart failure algorithms, then there would be gains in QALYs. These potential benefits could not be captured in the model because of the lack of evidence. Modelling of scheduled visits 3.22 The base case modelled 2 scheduled visits per year, in the intervention and comparator arms. In clinical practice, people who have stable heart failure would likely only have 1 scheduled visit per year. Other people may also only have 1 visit because of capacity issues. The EAG modelled 2 additional different scenarios for the intervention arms: no scheduled follow-up visits per year and 1 scheduled follow-up visit per year. These scenario analyses did not impact the direction of the model results. Modelling of unscheduled visits 3.23 In
