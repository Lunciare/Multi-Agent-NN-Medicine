that both HeartLogic and TriageHF have a 100% probability of being cost effective at thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained. Cost-effectiveness estimates are driven by hospitalisation rates 3.19 There was no comparative evidence on hospitalisations for CorVue or HeartInsight that was considered suitable for inclusion in the EAG's economic model. A conservative deterministic base-case model assumption was made of no difference in hospitalisations between CorVue and HeartInsight and their comparators. The results of this deterministic model showed CorVue and HeartInsight to be more costly than standard care and equally as effective. Threshold analysis showed that only a small reduction in hospitalisations would make these heart failure algorithms cost effective. 3.20 The EAG's model used published hospitalisation rates for HeartLogic and TriageHF. For HeartLogic, the hospitalisation incidence rate ratio of 0.28 was calculated from Treskes et al. (2021), which indicates a 72% lower rate of hospitalisations in the intervention group. For TriageHF, the hospitalisation incidence rate ratio of 0.42 was taken from Ahmed et al. (2024), which indicates a 58% lower rate of hospitalisations in the intervention group. These inputs resulted in the technologies being dominant (less costly and more effective than standard care) in the deterministic model base
