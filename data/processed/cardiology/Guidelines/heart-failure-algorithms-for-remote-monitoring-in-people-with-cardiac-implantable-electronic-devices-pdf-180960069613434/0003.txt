as heart failure events). Evidence shows that CIEDs used with HeartLogic or TriageHF reduce hospitalisations compared with CIEDs used with remote monitoring only. Collection of registry data is recommended for these algorithms to confirm the extent of the benefit seen in the studies. It is uncertain whether the HeartInsight algorithm can detect early signs of worsening heart failure. There is also no evidence to show how well CIEDs that use HeartInsight reduce heart failure events. HeartInsight may be better at predicting worsening heart failure and reducing hospitalisations than CIEDs without algorithms, so more research is recommended. More research is also recommended for HeartInsight, HeartLogic and TriageHF in people at risk of developing heart failure because there is very limited evidence in this population. CorVue collects only intrathoracic impedance data, while the other algorithms monitor additional factors. Clinical trial evidence suggests that CorVue fails to detect some signs of worsening heart failure and has a high rate of false-positive alerts (alerts that are not followed by a heart failure event). So CorVue is not recommended for use in the NHS. 2 Heart failure algorithms Clinical need and practice 2.1 Heart failure is a clinical syndrome caused by any structural or functional
