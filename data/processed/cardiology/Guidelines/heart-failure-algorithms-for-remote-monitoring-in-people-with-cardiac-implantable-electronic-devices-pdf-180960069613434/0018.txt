Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

But the committee noted that all alerts would be reviewed alongside other clinical information and discussed with the person before a treatment decision is made. So the committee considered that unnecessary treatment arising from false-positive alerts is unlikely and so harms from over treatment when using heart failure algorithms are expected to be low. 3.10 The committee discussed the impact that the number of false positives could have on service burden. Specialist committee members indicated that this burden is low in their experience, because initial interaction following an alert is usually via phone call rather than in-person. The committee concluded that more research should be done on the rate of false-positive alerts. Intermediate and clinical outcomes CorVue 3.11 Shapiro et al. (2017) showed a statistically significant reduction in hospitalisations for people using the CorVue algorithm. But, this study was assessed by the EAG as being at a substantial risk of confounding because the comparator was people with no implanted device having home care. So the reduction in hospitalisations reported in the study could be because of the CIED rather than the CorVue algorithm. The committee concluded that it is uncertain whether use of CorVue can reduce hospitalisations. HeartInsight 3.12 No
