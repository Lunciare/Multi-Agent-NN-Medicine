Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

(see section 2.3). The organisation of heart failure monitoring pathways varies in practice between different trusts, and even between different hospitals. 3 Committee discussion The diagnostics advisory committee looked at evidence on algorithm-based remote monitoring of heart failure in people with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Evidence was considered from several sources, including an external assessment report and an overview of that report. Full details are in the project documents for this guidance. Patient considerations 3.1 Wider availability of algorithm-based remote monitoring may allow greater access to care for people who are less able to attend in-person appointments (because of costs associated with travel, poor public transport, time taken from work, physical impairments, or anxiety). An alert may be followed by an initial telephone call to determine whether in-person follow up is needed. This could reduce the number of unnecessary in-person clinic visits. 3.2 The patient expert explained that CIEDs provide a sense of security to people because they know that their condition is being managed. With conventional remote monitoring, an unscheduled review would only be triggered if the person reports worsening symptoms. Algorithm-based remote monitoring provides reassurance to people because they know that alerts are transmitted automatically and reviewed
