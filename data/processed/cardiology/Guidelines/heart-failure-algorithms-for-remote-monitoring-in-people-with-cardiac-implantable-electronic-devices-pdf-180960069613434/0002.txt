rates of false positives or unexplained alerts • hospitalisation rates • heart-failure-related mortality rates • rates of emergency department or primary care visits • patient-reported outcomes. 1.5 Access to the technologies in sections 1.2 and 1.3 in the populations outlined should be through company, research or non-core NHS funding, and clinical or financial risks should be appropriately managed. Do not use 1.6 CorVue should not be used for algorithm-based remote monitoring in people with CIEDs who have or are at risk of developing heart failure. Why the committee made these recommendations Algorithm-based remote monitoring automatically detects the early signs of worsening heart failure and sends an alert to the healthcare professional. People who have or are at risk of developing heart failure can be offered CIEDs as part of heart failure therapy. Algorithm-based remote monitoring may be activated in a person's CIED. Evidence for HeartLogic and TriageHF shows that they can detect the signs of worsening heart failure that could lead to hospitalisation or an unscheduled clinic visit (referred to as heart failure events). Evidence shows that CIEDs used with HeartLogic or TriageHF reduce hospitalisations compared with CIEDs used with remote monitoring only. Collection of registry data is recommended for
