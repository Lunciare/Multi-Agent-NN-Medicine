Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

for HeartLogic and TriageHF suggests that they can accurately detect the signs of worsening heart failure that could lead to hospitalisation or an unscheduled clinic event. The evidence also suggests that HeartLogic and TriageHF can reduce the number of heart failure events compared with conventional remote monitoring. But there are some concerns about the quality of the evidence for these algorithms and the size of the effects that could be seen. 3.26 To confirm the extent of the benefit seen in the studies, companies should work with the NHS to collect registry data for HeartLogic and TriageHF on: • hospitalisation rates • heart-failure-related mortality rates • rates of emergency department or primary care visits • patient-reported outcomes. Equalities Heart failure algorithms could reduce inequalities 3.27 Algorithm-based remote monitoring systems are ideally positioned to reduce inequalities in access to healthcare. The committee heard that many people, particularly those from ethnic minority groups and lower socioeconomic backgrounds, do not seek medical assistance until they need to attend emergency services. Heart failure algorithms could benefit these people, because signs of decompensation would be detected and healthcare professionals automatically alerted, before the person needs to seek emergency assistance. For this reason, people who are
