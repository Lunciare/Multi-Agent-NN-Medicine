connection. Healthcare professionals can view the data transmitted by the device on the Merlin.net PCN platform. Access to Merlin.net and the mobile transmitter is provided as part of the CIED, and the CorVue algorithm comes free of charge with the CIED devices. 2.6 The CorVue algorithm automatically calculates the mean daily impedance (from 12 daily measurements). It also collects reference impedance data based on the previous 12 to 14 days, which changes continuously based on new impedance readings. If a consistent drop of daily impedance values is detected (13 or 14 consecutive days in congestion) then a congestive event is reported and detected during device check-up. Patient alerts can be activated via remote monitoring if the person wishes. HeartInsight (Biotronik) 2.7 HeartInsight is a predictive algorithm designed to monitor for early signs of worsening heart failure in people with compatible CIEDs. The algorithm works with the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring system. The HeartInsight algorithm combines the following 7 parameters into 1 composite score (calculated daily): • atrial burden • heart rate variability • general activity • thoracic impedance • heart rate • heart rate at rest and • premature ventricular contractions. 2.8 HeartInsight triggers an alert to healthcare professionals (via text
