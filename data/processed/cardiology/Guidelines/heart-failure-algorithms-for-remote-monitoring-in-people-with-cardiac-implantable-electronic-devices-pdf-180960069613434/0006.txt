Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

This enables proactive investigation into the cause of the suspected decompensation, potentially before the person even feels symptomatic. This could ensure that people have appropriate treatment as early as possible, reducing the number of unnecessary hospital visits. The interventions There are 4 heart failure algorithms that were identified as relevant for inclusion in this assessment. Each algorithm is only compatible with specific CIEDs manufactured by the same company that makes the algorithm. CorVue (Abbott Medical) 2.5 The CorVue algorithm works with the Merlin.net Patient Care Network (PCN) platform, and is intended for remotely monitoring for the early signs of heart failure in people who have compatible CIEDs. The CorVue algorithm collects intrathoracic impedance data from the CIED and transmits it to the Merlin.net PCN platform via the mobile app (myMerlinPulse). It does this using Bluetooth and an internet or mobile network connection to generate an alert. Or, instead of using the app-based smartphone transmitter, the company can provide a remote monitoring unit (Merlin@Home) that connects via Wi-Fi, mobile or landline connection. Healthcare professionals can view the data transmitted by the device on the Merlin.net PCN platform. Access to Merlin.net and the mobile transmitter is provided as part of the CIED,
