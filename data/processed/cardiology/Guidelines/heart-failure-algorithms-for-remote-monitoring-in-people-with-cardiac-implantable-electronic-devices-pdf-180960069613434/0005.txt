CIED to communicate wirelessly with a remote monitoring system. People who have CIEDs must be followed up by hospitals for regular technical reviews of how their device is working. They may also have scheduled appointments, during which the clinical events recorded by the device are monitored. There is a lot of variation in clinical practice and the frequency of these follow-up visits varies according to the person's condition. NICE's guideline on diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in adults recommends that reviews are offered every 6 months for people whose condition is stable, but clinical experts highlighted that in practice most people would have a review annually. Sometimes clinical reviews are only triggered if the person with the CIED reports worsening symptoms. 2.4 Some CIEDs have algorithm-based remote monitoring incorporated in the device. Heart failure algorithms analyse and collate different clinical data recorded by the device to detect gradual worsening of heart failure. The system can send alerts to healthcare professionals to prompt a review of the stored data. This enables proactive investigation into the cause of the suspected decompensation, potentially before the person even feels symptomatic. This could ensure that people have appropriate treatment as early as possible,
