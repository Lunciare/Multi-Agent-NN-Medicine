Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

and activity are collected by the implanted device. The HeartLogic algorithm then combines these into 1 composite index that indicates decompensation. Boston Scientific's HeartLogic and Latitude NXT Patient Management System work together to provide advanced monitoring and management capabilities for people with heart failure who have CIEDs. The system has daily data transfers to the clinical team. The transmitter can use a mobile phone connection or an internet connection to relay the data. The system is configured to send an alert to a healthcare professional when the index is over a set threshold (customisable by a healthcare professional). Healthcare professionals need to log on to the LATITUDE NXT website to receive alerts. Secondary notification of alerts may be through email or text message. Access to HeartLogic has a one-off cost of £3,650 per person, but discounts may be offered based on purchase volume. TriageHF (Medtronic) 2.11 TriageHF is an alert-based algorithm used with CareLink remote monitoring. It is a monitoring system for identifying and managing an increased risk of heart failure or worsening heart failure in people with CIEDs. When TriageHF is used within a structured heart failure clinical care pathway it is called TriageHF Plus. TriageHF is hosted on
