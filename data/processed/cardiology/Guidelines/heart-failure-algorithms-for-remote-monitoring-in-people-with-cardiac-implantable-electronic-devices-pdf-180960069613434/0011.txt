Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

replace a routine check. For each day the data is transmitted, the TriageHF algorithm generates a daily risk status of a heart failure event occurring in the next 30 days (low, medium or high risk). This is based on the maximum daily risk status for the previous 30 days. A heart failure management report is generated on the daily risk status. The CareLink network sends an alert for people who have high-risk score so that they can be contacted for a telephone consultation. Access to TriageHF and CareLink remote monitoring has a yearly cost of £100 per person. The comparator Conventional remote monitoring of heart failure in people with CIEDs 2.12 Standard care for monitoring heart failure in people who have CIEDs is periodic reviews of device function with a cardiac physiologist or cardiologist. A person will also have ad hoc reviews of symptoms with a GP, specialist nurse, cardiologist or a heart failure team. The number and timing of the reviews varies in practice depending on the person's symptoms (see section 2.3). The organisation of heart failure monitoring pathways varies in practice between different trusts, and even between different hospitals. 3 Committee discussion The diagnostics advisory committee looked at
