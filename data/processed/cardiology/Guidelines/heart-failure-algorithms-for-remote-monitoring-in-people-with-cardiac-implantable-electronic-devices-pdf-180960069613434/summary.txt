electronic devices 1 Recommendations Use as an option For people with heart failure 1.1 Use HeartLogic and TriageHF as options for algorithm-based remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) who have heart failure. They should be used as part of a specialist multidisciplinary heart failure service with alerts reviewed and acted on by specialist healthcare professionals. Can only be used in research For people with heart failure 1.2 More research is needed on HeartInsight for algorithm-based remote monitoring in people with CIEDs who have heart failure, before it can be routinely used in the NHS. For people at risk of developing heart failure 1.3 More research is needed on HeartInsight, HeartLogic and TriageHF for algorithm- based remote monitoring in people with CIEDs who are at risk of developing heart failure, before they can be routinely used in the NHS. More research 1.4 More research for the technologies in sections 1.2 and 1.3 is needed in the populations outlined.
