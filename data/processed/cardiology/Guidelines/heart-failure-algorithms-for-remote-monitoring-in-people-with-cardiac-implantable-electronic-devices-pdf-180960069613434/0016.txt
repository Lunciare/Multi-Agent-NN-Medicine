Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

All studies reporting prognostic accuracy data for HeartLogic were assessed by the EAG as being at a high risk of bias with the analysis methods being a key concern. The committee also considered data from a study that was published after the EAG's review was complete. Singh et al. (2024) evaluated HeartLogic in 1,458 people. For the endpoint of detecting heart failure events, HeartLogic demonstrated sensitivity of 74.5% and false-positive rate of 1.48 alerts per patient-year. The committee concluded that while there are some concerns regarding the quality of the prognostic accuracy data, it is likely that HeartLogic can predict heart failure events. 3.7 Using the study endpoint of worsening heart failure in people with a 'high-risk' status, TriageHF demonstrated sensitivity ranging from 87.9% to 98.6% and specificity ranging from 59.4% to 63.4%. The false-positive rate was reported in 1 study and was considered to be low. Most studies reporting prognostic accuracy data were assessed by the EAG as being at a high or unclear risk of bias. A key concern was the analysis methods, and some of the studies were only available as abstracts that contained limited information. The committee concluded that while there are some concerns regarding the
