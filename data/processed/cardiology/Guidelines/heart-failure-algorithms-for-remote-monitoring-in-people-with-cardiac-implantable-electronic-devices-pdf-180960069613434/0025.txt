58% lower rate of hospitalisations in the intervention group. These inputs resulted in the technologies being dominant (less costly and more effective than standard care) in the deterministic model base case. The committee noted that post hoc or subgroup analyses from these publications show that reductions in hospitalisations were smaller in some subgroups than in the overall study populations. For example, an analysis by Ahmed et al. that was limited to data collected before the onset of the COVID-19 in the UK, gave a hospitalisation incidence rate ratio of 0.69, indicating a 31% lower rate of hospitalisations in the intervention group. The committee also recalled the concerns regarding the quality of the comparative evidence for HeartLogic (see section 3.13) and TriageHF (see section 3.14) and noted that the risk of confounding may impact the reliability of the results from these studies. But, only small reductions in hospitalisations are needed for HeartLogic and TriageHF to be cost effective in the EAG's model. So the committee concluded that HeartLogic and TriageHF are likely to be cost-effective uses of NHS resources.
