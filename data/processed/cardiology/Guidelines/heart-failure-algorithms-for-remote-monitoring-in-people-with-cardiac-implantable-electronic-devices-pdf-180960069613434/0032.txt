Heart failure algorithms for remote monitoring in people with cardiac implantable

the way centres manage heart failure and respond to alerts can vary. This could mean that some centres are unable to implement heart failure algorithms into their services, which could lead to inequity of access across the country. Specialist committee members indicated that directives and initiatives are in place to steer heart failure services in the right direction for providing equitable access. Protocols should detail how heart failure alerts fit within the clinical pathway and how they should be responded to. 4 Implementation NICE intends to develop tools, in association with relevant stakeholders, to help organisations put this guidance into practice. In addition NICE will support this guidance through a range of activities to promote the recommendations for further research. NICE will also incorporate the recommendations for research in sections 1.2 to 1.4 into its guidance research recommendations database and highlight these recommendations to public research bodies.
