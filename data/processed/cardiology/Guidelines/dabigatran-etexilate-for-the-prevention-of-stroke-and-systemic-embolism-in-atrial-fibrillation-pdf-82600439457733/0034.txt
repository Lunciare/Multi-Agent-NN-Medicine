when younger than 80 years, including the relative risks from the whole RE-LY trial population, an INR cost of £241.54 and all of the assumptions requested by the Committee, was £18,863 per QALY gained compared with the manufacturer's estimate of £17,660 per QALY gained. 3.40 The ERG acknowledged the manufacturer's view that 100% time in therapeutic range is difficult to achieve in clinical practice. The ERG identified a UK-based study by Jones et al. (2005) that reported that the average time in therapeutic range was 67.9%. The ERG commented that the Jones et al. (2005) study indicated that the people with the best INR control (upper quartile) were within therapeutic range an average of 83.7% of the time, so the ERG performed further exploratory sensitivity analyses testing this value. For the subgroup of patients whose INR is within range 83.7% of the time, the ICER for dabigatran compared with warfarin was £46,989 per QALY gained assuming INR monitoring costs of £241.54 per annum. If the INR costs were increased to £414.90 per annum, the ICER decreased to £31,386 per QALY gained compared with warfarin. The ERG commented that it is unclear how INR monitoring costs vary by time in therapeutic
