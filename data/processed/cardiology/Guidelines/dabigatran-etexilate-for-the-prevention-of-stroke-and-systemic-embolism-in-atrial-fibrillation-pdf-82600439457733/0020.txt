and the second was of all potentially relevant pharmacological interventions for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. The ERG commented that the RE-LY trial was of good quality and that the manufacturer appropriately concentrated on the results from this trial. The ERG highlighted the limitations of non-inferiority trials, such as establishing the non-inferiority margin and the population on which to base analyses. Overall, the ERG felt that adequate measures were taken by the manufacturer to reduce the impact of potential bias associated with non-inferiority trials. 3.22 The ERG commented that the results of the RE-LY trial showed both doses of dabigatran to be non-inferior to dose-adjusted warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The ERG noted that a submission from the manufacturer to the FDA indicated that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin in people with good INR control (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92 for time in therapeutic INR range 65% or above; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96 for time in therapeutic INR range 68% or above). The ERG also highlighted that an analysis in the submission produced for the FDA
