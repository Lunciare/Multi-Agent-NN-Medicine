reasonable to expect all patients to try warfarin first, with the associated risks, for the purpose of selecting out a subgroup for whom dabigatran was less cost effective. 4.20 The Committee was also aware of the estimates of the time that the INR in people already taking warfarin would need to be in the target range for the ICERs for dabigatran compared with warfarin to be above £30,000 per QALY gained. Assuming an INR monitoring cost of £241.54 per annum, the manufacturer and ERG estimated an average of 83% to 85% and 75% to 76% of the time respectively. The Committee noted that this would apply to only a proportion of the whole population. The Committee was aware that the average time spent in therapeutic range for the UK centres in the RE-LY trial was 72%, and in the UK- based study by Jones et al. (2005) there was an average time in therapeutic range of 67.9%. It noted the ERG's analysis that explored the effects of time in therapeutic range on the cost effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin. This calculated the ICER for the people with the best-controlled INR (that is, within range 83.7% of the time) at
