Costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts. 3 The manufacturer's submission The Appraisal Committee considered evidence submitted by the manufacturer of dabigatran and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). 3.1 The manufacturer's submission included 3 trials that directly compared dabigatran with dose-adjusted warfarin: RE-LY, PETRO and 1160.49. The PETRO and 1160.49 trials were both dose-finding studies with safety data collection as the primary objective. The main evidence for clinical effectiveness presented in the manufacturer's submission was based on the RE-LY randomised controlled trial. 3.2 RE-LY was a non-inferiority trial in which 2 blinded doses of dabigatran (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) were compared with open-label warfarin (with a target international normalised ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0) for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. The RE-LY trial included people with documented atrial fibrillation and at least 1 of the following additional risk factors: history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or systemic embolism; left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%; symptomatic heart failure; age 75 years or
