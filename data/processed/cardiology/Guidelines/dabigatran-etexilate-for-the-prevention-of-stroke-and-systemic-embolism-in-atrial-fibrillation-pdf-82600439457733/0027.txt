3.30 The ERG considered that the disutility of dabigatran captured by the RE-LY quality-of-life sub-study had not been fully reflected in the manufacturer's cost- effectiveness analysis. The disutility associated with dabigatran treatment was tested by the ERG but it did not change the overall conclusions about the cost effectiveness of this intervention. 3.31 The ERG commented that treatment with dabigatran was associated with an increased incidence of dyspepsia compared with warfarin treatment, but that the model assumed that the cost of dyspepsia was only accrued in the first cycle. The ERG considered that a more conservative approach would be to assume that costs of dyspepsia continue throughout treatment. This caused the ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin to increase slightly from £6,262 per QALY to £6,659 per QALY gained. 3.32 The ERG highlighted that disability and mortality risk after stroke is considered to be treatment dependent in the manufacturer's model. Therefore, the ERG explored the model assuming that disability caused by stroke is independent of treatment. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin increased from £6,262 to £8,393 per QALY gained. 3.33 The ERG presented analyses using an alternative set of assumptions
