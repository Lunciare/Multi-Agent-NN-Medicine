Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

RE-LY quality-of-life sub-study. Utility values associated with clinical events and disability status were derived from published sources. 3.16 The manufacturer's model considered resource costs associated with anti- thrombotic treatment, acute event costs, and long-term follow-up costs resulting from disability. These costs were derived from the national payment by results tariff, systematic reviews and a manufacturer-sponsored study based on the Oxford Vascular study (OXVASC) cohort. The cost of dabigatran was £2.52 (excluding VAT) per day for either the 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily doses. Treatment with warfarin, aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel was assumed to cost £0.04, £0.09, and £0.26 per day, respectively. Treatment with dabigatran was not considered to need any monitoring, but the cost of INR monitoring for warfarin was estimated to be £414.90 per annum. The model assumed an NHS perspective and costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum. 3.17 The manufacturer reported pairwise cost-effectiveness results for dabigatran compared with warfarin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the dabigatran sequential regimen in which people started treatment when younger than 80 years and continued for the rest of their lives, and the sequential regimen in which people started treatment when older than 80
