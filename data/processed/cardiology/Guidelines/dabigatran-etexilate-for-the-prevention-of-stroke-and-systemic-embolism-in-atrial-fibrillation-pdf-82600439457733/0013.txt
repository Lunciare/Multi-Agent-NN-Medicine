twice daily in those aged 80 years and older. Results from the RE-LY trial and the mixed-treatment comparison were very similar for both dabigatran doses compared with dose- adjusted warfarin. 3.12 The manufacturer's economic evaluation was based on a cost–utility analysis designed to compare the costs and outcomes of dabigatran with treatments used in the UK (warfarin, aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel). The manufacturer developed a Markov model that used 3 levels of disability (independent, moderate and severe) and death to define health states. A hypothetical cohort entered the model at risk of specified clinical events and was on 1 of the treatments under comparison. They moved between health states when a clinical event occurred and their disability status changed. The clinical events considered were ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, haemorrhagic stroke, extracranial haemorrhage, systemic embolism, transient ischaemic attack and acute myocardial infarction. All clinical outcomes were associated with acute costs and disutility. Further longer-term costs and disutility beyond the acute stage were associated with ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage. The model permitted 1 clinical event per 3-month cycle over a lifetime horizon. The model also allowed for a switch to second-line treatment or a discontinuation of treatment. 3.13
