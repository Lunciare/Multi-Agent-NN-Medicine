of £7,873 to £21,129 per QALY gained for a group with a CHADS score of 5. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg 2 twice daily compared with warfarin was robust to the parameters and ranges tested by the manufacturer, and the highest ICER was £10,234 per QALY gained. The cost effectiveness of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily in relation to warfarin was highly sensitive to high baseline CHADS scores, risk of ischaemic stroke and 2 risk of intracranial haemorrhage. 3.20 In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the ICERs for the dabigatran sequential regimens in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and in people starting treatment when older than 80 years compared with warfarin were £7,811 and £11,912 per QALY gained respectively. The probabilistic ICERs for dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily compared with warfarin were £7,940 and £15,867 per QALY gained respectively. 3.21 The ERG noted that the manufacturer's submission included 2 generally well- conducted systematic reviews: the first was of dabigatran trials in the relevant indication, and the second was of all potentially relevant pharmacological interventions for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. The ERG commented that the RE-LY trial was of good
