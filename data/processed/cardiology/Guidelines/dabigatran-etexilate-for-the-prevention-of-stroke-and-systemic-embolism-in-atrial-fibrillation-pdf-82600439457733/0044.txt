that the sequence of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily followed by dabigatran 110 mg twice daily once people reach 80 years would be the only regimen appropriate for the assessment of the cost effectiveness of dabigatran relative to warfarin in the whole eligible UK population. 4.11 The Committee heard from the ERG that the relative risks used to inform the manufacturer's original sequential regimen model were derived from people in the younger than 80 years and older than 80 years subgroups of the RE-LY trial that were defined post hoc. It also heard that using relative risks from the whole RE- LY trial population would be more appropriate to determine reliable effectiveness estimates for the dabigatran sequence. Therefore, the Committee asked the manufacturer to submit a re-analysis of the data for discussion at the second Appraisal Committee meeting using the relative risks from the whole RE-LY trial population. 4.12 At the first Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee noted that the ERG had highlighted a number of uncertainties relating to assumptions used in the manufacturer's economic model. First, the Committee noted the ERG's view that an analysis based on an older patient cohort with a lower risk of stroke using data
