of the following additional risk factors: history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or systemic embolism; left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%; symptomatic heart failure; age 75 years or older; age 65 years or older with diabetes mellitus, documented coronary artery disease or hypertension. People were excluded from the RE-LY trial if they had a severe, disabling stroke in the previous 6 months or any stroke within the previous 14 days, conditions associated with increased risk of bleeding, or a contraindication to warfarin treatment. 3.3 The RE-LY study took place in 44 countries including the UK and a total of 18,113 people were randomised across the 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. People recruited into the study were randomised within 14 days of the screening visit and were randomly allocated to dabigatran 110 mg twice daily (n=6,015), dabigatran 150 mg twice daily (n=6,076) or warfarin (n=6,022). Minimum follow- up was 1 year, and median follow-up was 23.7 months. The mean age of people in the study was 71.5 years and 63.6% were male. Risk of stroke at baseline was classified according to CHADS score, which is used to estimate the risk of stroke 2 in people with atrial
