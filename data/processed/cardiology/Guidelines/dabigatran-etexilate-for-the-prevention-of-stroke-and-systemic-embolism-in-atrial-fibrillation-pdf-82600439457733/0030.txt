Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and £18,269 per QALY gained for the sequential regimen in people starting treatment at 80 years and older, compared with warfarin. 3.37 In response to the Committee's request to include a patient cohort that better reflected people with atrial fibrillation in the UK, the manufacturer highlighted that data from Gallagher et al. (2008) were not easily adapted to the model and that many of the patients included in the Gallagher analysis would not be covered by the marketing authorisation for dabigatran. To address the Committee's request the manufacturer performed an analysis of the General Practice Research Database to derive data required for the model. Applying these data increased the ICERs to £17,373 and £19,680 per QALY gained for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and at 80 years and older respectively, compared with warfarin. The manufacturer stated that applying the ERG's preferred assumptions relating to dyspepsia management costs, disability and mortality risks, and disutility associated with dabigatran (see section 3.33) individually had minimal effect on the base-case ICER. Combining an INR monitoring cost of £241.54 with the ERG's preferred
