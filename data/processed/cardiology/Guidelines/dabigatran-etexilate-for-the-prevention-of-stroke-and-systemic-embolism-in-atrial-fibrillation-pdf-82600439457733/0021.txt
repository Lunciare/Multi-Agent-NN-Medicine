HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96 for time in therapeutic INR range 68% or above). The ERG also highlighted that an analysis in the submission produced for the FDA showed a greater benefit of dabigatran in people with poor INR control than in those whose INR was well controlled (the threshold being the centre-level median of 67%). The FDA report concluded that, although the results showed efficacy of dabigatran in people who had INR control above the centre- level median, the results did not show superiority over warfarin. The submission further subdivided people by INR control (less than 58.5%, 58.5% or above, less than 66.8%, 66.8% or above, and less than 74.2%). This demonstrated that the greatest benefit of dabigatran was in the lowest quartile of INR control and that, in people with good INR control with warfarin, little or no additional benefit in terms of effectiveness would be gained with dabigatran. 3.23 A key uncertainty highlighted by the ERG was the generalisability of the results to people with atrial fibrillation in the NHS. The ERG commented that the definition of moderate or high risk of stroke or systemic embolism in the manufacturer's submission differed slightly to the definition
