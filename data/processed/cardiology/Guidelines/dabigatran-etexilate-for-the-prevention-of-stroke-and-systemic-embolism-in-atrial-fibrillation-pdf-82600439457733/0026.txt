warfarin because it was associated with greater costs but lower health benefits. The group of people with poor INR control was also evaluated by the ERG. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin for people with an INR below 2 was £740 per QALY gained. For people with an INR above 3, warfarin was dominated by dabigatran 150 mg twice daily. The ERG did not include pairwise cost-effectiveness results for dabigatran in the sequential regimen compared with warfarin. The ERG concluded that INR control is a key parameter in the economic evaluation. 3.29 The ERG used 3 approaches to calculate the variable costs of INR monitoring, which it considered had been overestimated in the manufacturer's model. The alternative costs used by the ERG were £279.36, £241.54 and £115.14, instead of £414.90 as assumed by the manufacturer. Adjusting the model to test each individual cost assumption increased the ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin to £10,528, £11,720 and £15,701 per QALY gained respectively. 3.30 The ERG considered that the disutility of dabigatran captured by the RE-LY quality-of-life sub-study had not been fully reflected in the manufacturer's cost- effectiveness analysis. The disutility associated with
