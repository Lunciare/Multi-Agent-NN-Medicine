and mortality risks, and disutility associated with dabigatran (see section 3.33) individually had minimal effect on the base-case ICER. Combining an INR monitoring cost of £241.54 with the ERG's preferred assumptions resulted in ICERs of £17,660 and £18,392 per QALY gained for the sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and people starting treatment at 80 years and older respectively, compared with warfarin. 3.38 The manufacturer also responded to the Committee's request in the appraisal consultation document for further comment and consideration of the cost effectiveness of dabigatran in the subgroup of people whose condition is already well controlled on warfarin. The manufacturer highlighted that the INR control analyses submitted to the FDA (see section 3.22) were stratified by time in therapeutic range only in the warfarin arm and should therefore be interpreted with caution. The manufacturer stated that analyses presented in a study by Wallentin et al. (2010), which was stratified on treatment centre time in therapeutic range (a method that maintains randomisation within a centre), would be more relevant if such an analysis were to be carried out. The manufacturer highlighted that the ERG's initial analysis of good INR control (see section 3.28) assumed
