Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

3.30 and 3.31). The Committee agreed that including all of these assumptions would be a more conservative approach. 4.14 Third, the Committee noted the ERG's view that the cost of INR monitoring had been overestimated in the manufacturer's model. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the introduction of dabigatran would not result in complete closure of anticoagulation services with release of all the funding, and the manufacturer's estimate (£414.90) was likely to be too high. It also heard that INR monitoring costs varied in different settings and could not be quantified precisely. The Committee agreed that exploring the effect of assuming the alternative INR monitoring costs put forward by the ERG (£115.14, £241.54, £279.36), in addition to the cost assumed in the manufacturer's submission, would enable it to make a more accurate judgement about the cost effectiveness of dabigatran. 4.15 Finally, the Committee noted the ERG's comments that the cost effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin varied substantially according to level of INR control in those already being treated with warfarin. In the appraisal consultation document, the manufacturer of dabigatran was therefore asked to provide further analyses addressing the uncertainties outlined in sections 4.11 to 4.15. 4.16 The
