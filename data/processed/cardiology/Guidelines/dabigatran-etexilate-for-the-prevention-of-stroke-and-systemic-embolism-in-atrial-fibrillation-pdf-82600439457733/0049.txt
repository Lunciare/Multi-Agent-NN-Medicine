an INR monitoring cost of £241.54, and the corrected values for ischaemic stroke and disability rates (see section 3.39) resulted in an ICER of £18,900 per QALY gained for the sequential regimen in people starting treatment younger than 80 years, compared with warfarin. The Committee concluded that this was broadly in line with the manufacturer's estimate and that the ICERs presented by the manufacturer were robust to the changes requested. The Committee therefore accepted the manufacturer's approach and concluded that the most plausible ICERs for the whole population eligible for dabigatran were within the range normally considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources, being less than £20,000 per QALY gained. 4.18 The Committee discussed comments from consultees that suggested it may be appropriate to recommend dabigatran for use only in people with atrial fibrillation whose INR is not well controlled on warfarin. The Committee was satisfied that the technology was a cost-effective treatment for the whole patient group. It noted that robust evidence of differential clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, with clear justification of the threshold level chosen, would be needed to select out a subgroup, based on INR control, for whom dabigatran would not be recommended. 4.19 The Committee
