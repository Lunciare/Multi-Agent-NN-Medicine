Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

rather than those from the single-dose model. The ERG commented that correcting for this had the effect of reducing the manufacturer's ICERs slightly. The ERG agreed with the manufacturer that the data presented by Gallagher et al. (2008) are not easily adapted to the model. It commented that the General Practice Research Database data presented by the manufacturer have advantages over the Gallagher study in that they are more recent and therefore more reflective of the current UK atrial fibrillation population, and they refer solely to the people with atrial fibrillation for whom dabigatran is licensed. The ERG compared the results of the incremental analyses presented by the manufacturer with the results obtained by the ERG after including the correct values for ischaemic stroke disability and mortality rates by treatment and including all of the assumptions requested by the Committee. The ERG commented that its results were broadly in line with those presented by the manufacturer. The ERG's estimate of the ICER for the sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years, including the relative risks from the whole RE-LY trial population, an INR cost of £241.54 and all of the assumptions requested by the Committee, was
