gastrointestinal bleeding, in contrast to cerebral haemorrhage, was statistically significantly higher for both doses of dabigatran, and the comment from the manufacturer that this may be the result of a local effect of the orally administered drug on the gastrointestinal mucosa. Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a statistically significantly higher incidence of major and life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. The Committee noted that even small changes in total gastrointestinal bleeding rates might have a substantial impact on the provision of services and that major gastrointestinal bleeding is associated with a significant mortality risk. The Committee concluded that treatment with dabigatran resulted in more gastrointestinal bleeding than warfarin, but also recognised the particular importance of the effects of dabigatran on reducing the risk of haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage for people with atrial fibrillation when compared with warfarin. 4.8 The Committee was aware that health-related quality-of-life data were collected in a sub-study of the RE-LY trial. It noted that baseline utility values for people with atrial fibrillation were derived from the sub-study. The Committee agreed that because the sub-study was reasonably representative of the overall RE-LY population, this approach was appropriate. 4.9 The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and
