Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

with clear justification of the threshold level chosen, would be needed to select out a subgroup, based on INR control, for whom dabigatran would not be recommended. 4.19 The Committee was aware of the need for guidance to apply equally to those already on warfarin and to those newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. The Committee noted that, for people newly diagnosed but not already taking an anticoagulant, any stratification of the population according to INR control would mean that all patients would have to try warfarin for at least a few months to assess whether the INR was well controlled and to estimate the time in therapeutic range. The Committee heard from clinical specialists that many of the significant complications of warfarin therapy are experienced in the first months of treatment before the dose is established and stabilised. The Committee accepted therefore that a large number of people having a trial of warfarin at initial diagnosis could be expected to switch to dabigatran. It also accepted that it was not reasonable to expect all patients to try warfarin first, with the associated risks, for the purpose of selecting out a subgroup for whom dabigatran was less cost effective. 4.20 The
