years and 63.6% were male. Risk of stroke at baseline was classified according to CHADS score, which is used to estimate the risk of stroke 2 in people with atrial fibrillation to determine whether they need anticoagulation treatment. The score was calculated by giving 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension or diabetes mellitus, and age 75 years or older. Two points were given if people had already had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 3.4 The primary outcome in the study was incidence of all types of stroke (including haemorrhagic stroke) or systemic embolism. To show non-inferiority in the RE-LY trial, the upper limits of the confidence interval (CI) of the hazard ratio (HR) for dabigatran versus warfarin had to be less than the margin specified. Two margins were used in the manufacturer's submission, 1.46 and 1.38, of which 1.38 was specified as the preferred margin of non-inferiority by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 3.5 The reduction in relative risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin was 10% for dabigatran 110 mg and 35% for dabigatran 150 mg. Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a lower incidence of
