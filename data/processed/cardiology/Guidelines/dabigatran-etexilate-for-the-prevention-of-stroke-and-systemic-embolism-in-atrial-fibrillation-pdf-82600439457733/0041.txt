with warfarin may not gain additional clinical benefit by taking dabigatran. However, the clinical specialists emphasised the importance of the significantly lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage and haemorrhagic stroke associated with both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin in the RE-LY trial, and that this effect is maintained in people with good INR control. The Committee heard that haemorrhagic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage have devastating and life-threatening consequences and concluded that the lower rates associated with dabigatran represent an important advance in the treatment of atrial fibrillation alongside reduction in ischaemic stroke. It concluded that this applied to all patients with atrial fibrillation, including those with good INR control, and that there were also benefits of taking a treatment that didn't need INR monitoring or dietary restriction. 4.7 The Committee considered the additional adverse events reported in the RE-LY trial. It noted that both doses of dabigatran were associated with statistically significant reductions in the incidence of life-threatening bleeds compared with warfarin. However, it also noted that the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, in contrast to cerebral haemorrhage, was statistically significantly higher for both doses of dabigatran, and the comment from the manufacturer that this may be the result of a
