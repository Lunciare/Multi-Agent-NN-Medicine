used in the manufacturer's economic model. First, the Committee noted the ERG's view that an analysis based on an older patient cohort with a lower risk of stroke using data reported by Gallagher et al. (2008) would be more representative of people with atrial fibrillation in the UK than the cohort from the RE-LY trial used by the manufacturer. The Committee accepted that there was uncertainty around which cohort most realistically reflected the population of people with atrial fibrillation in the UK. 4.13 Second, the Committee noted that the ERG questioned whether disability and mortality were independent of the treatment received. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the manufacturer's assumption that a stroke would be less severe after treatment with dabigatran than warfarin was plausible and that there is evidence that both the incidence and the severity of stroke may vary according to the treatment received. The Committee also noted the ERG's views about disutility of dabigatran and the inclusion of dyspepsia management costs throughout treatment (see sections 3.30 and 3.31). The Committee agreed that including all of these assumptions would be a more conservative approach. 4.14 Third, the Committee noted the ERG's view that the cost of
