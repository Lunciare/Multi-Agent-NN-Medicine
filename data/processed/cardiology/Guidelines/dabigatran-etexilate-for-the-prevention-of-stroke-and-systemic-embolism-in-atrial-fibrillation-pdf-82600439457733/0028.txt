The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin increased from £6,262 to £8,393 per QALY gained. 3.33 The ERG presented analyses using an alternative set of assumptions to those provided by the manufacturer. The ERG's alternative base case assumed: • A patient cohort representing people with atrial fibrillation in the UK, using the data reported by Gallagher et al. (2008). • The variable (per patient) costs of anticoagulant monitoring are £115.14. • People have dyspepsia throughout dabigatran treatment, not just in the first 3 months of treatment. • Disability and mortality risks after stroke are treatment independent. • Disutility associated with dabigatran during the first 12 months of treatment as used in the RE-LY quality-of-life sub-study (the details are academic-in- confidence). 3.34 By introducing these assumptions, the ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin increased from £6,264 to £24,173 per QALY gained in the ERG's alternative base-case analysis. Manufacturer's additional analyses 3.35 Additional analyses were provided by the manufacturer in response to NICE's request for further clarification on the cost effectiveness of dabigatran presented in the appraisal consultation document. The manufacturer submitted a revised cost-effectiveness analysis of the sequential regimen model comparing dabigatran with
