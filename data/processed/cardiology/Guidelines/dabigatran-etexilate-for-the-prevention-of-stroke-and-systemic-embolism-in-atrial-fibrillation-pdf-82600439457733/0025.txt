Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

assumed that a person could not switch to warfarin if dabigatran was the first treatment. In addition, the ERG stated that the cost of anticoagulation monitoring was a key driver of the model in terms of resources and costs, and that it was likely that the average cost of monitoring had been overestimated in the model, biasing the results in favour of dabigatran. The ERG also highlighted that its clinical advisers were concerned about the high variability of monitoring costs in practice. This heterogeneity was not considered in the manufacturer's submission. The ERG commented that uncertainty around the monitoring costs was also inadequately modelled in the manufacturer's submission. 3.28 The ERG carried out exploratory cost-effectiveness analyses by subgroups according to INR control with warfarin. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin in people with perfect INR control (that is, in target INR range 100% of the time for the entire duration of treatment) was £60,895 per QALY gained. Dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was dominated by warfarin because it was associated with greater costs but lower health benefits. The group of people with poor INR control was also evaluated by the ERG. The ICER for dabigatran
