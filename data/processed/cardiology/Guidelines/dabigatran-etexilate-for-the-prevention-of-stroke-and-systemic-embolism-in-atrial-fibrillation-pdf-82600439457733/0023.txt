therefore decreasing the risk of stroke in the eligible atrial fibrillation population, making the population in the RE-LY trial less representative of clinical practice over time. 3.24 The ERG commented that the general approach taken by the manufacturer to estimate lifetime cost effectiveness was appropriate and met the requirements of the NICE reference case. The ERG noted that the model included most of the relevant clinical events in atrial fibrillation; however, pulmonary embolism was not included in the model. The ERG commented that excluding pulmonary embolism is potentially an optimistic approach in favour of dabigatran because dabigatran is associated with higher rates of pulmonary embolism than warfarin. 3.25 The ERG noted that, although the manufacturer's submission considered the atrial fibrillation population to be heterogeneous, reflected by the distribution of CHADS scores, the manufacturer assumed that all people would be treated the 2 same. The ERG commented that this may be an over-simplification of the decision problem and does not allow the potential impact of clinical heterogeneity on cost effectiveness to be considered. 3.26 The ERG highlighted that acute myocardial infarction and systemic embolism were assumed by the manufacturer to be associated with acute costs and disutility, but not with any
