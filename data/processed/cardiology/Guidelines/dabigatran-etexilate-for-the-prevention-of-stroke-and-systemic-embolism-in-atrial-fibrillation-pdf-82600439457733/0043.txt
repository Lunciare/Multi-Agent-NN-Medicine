the sub-study. The Committee agreed that because the sub-study was reasonably representative of the overall RE-LY population, this approach was appropriate. 4.9 The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the critique and exploratory analyses performed by the ERG. The Committee considered the utility values used in the model and noted that it was unclear how the utility values relating to the effect of stroke were derived. However, the Committee agreed with the ERG that the general approach taken by the manufacturer to estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of dabigatran was appropriate. 4.10 The Committee noted that the manufacturer presented a single-dose model, and a sequential regimen model in which people younger than 80 years began treatment with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and at the age of 80 years were switched to dabigatran 110 mg twice daily. As the summary of product characteristics for dabigatran excludes people older than 80 years from treatment with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily because of additional risks in this group, the Committee concluded that the sequence of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily followed by dabigatran 110 mg twice daily once people reach 80 years would be the only regimen appropriate for the assessment
