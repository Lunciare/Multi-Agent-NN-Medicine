Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

that there were no statistically significant differences in these outcomes between dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and warfarin. It also noted that both doses of dabigatran were associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction compared with warfarin but that this was not statistically significant. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that this reflected a small absolute difference in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction between the treatment groups, but it was unclear whether this was because of a protective effect of warfarin or a negative effect of dabigatran treatment, and that the effects did not appear to translate into an increased vascular mortality risk. The Committee concluded that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was more clinically effective than warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke and vascular mortality and that this represented an important development for people with atrial fibrillation. It also concluded that the lower 110 mg dabigatran twice-daily dose had shown non-inferiority to warfarin. 4.5 The Committee considered the results of the manufacturer's subgroup analyses. It was aware, however, that the manufacturer's analyses by age had been defined post hoc and it therefore considered that the results should be interpreted
