haemorrhage. The model permitted 1 clinical event per 3-month cycle over a lifetime horizon. The model also allowed for a switch to second-line treatment or a discontinuation of treatment. 3.13 The manufacturer presented 2 economic models: a single-dose model and a sequential regimen model. In the single-dose model, the cohort with atrial fibrillation received either 110 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily throughout their treatment. In the sequential regimen model, the cohort was divided by age and modelled separately. The model for people younger than 80 years assumed that treatment began with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and switched to dabigatran 110 mg twice daily when the age of 80 years was reached. The model for people aged 80 years or older at baseline assumed a dose of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily throughout. Therefore, the sequential regimen model resulted in 2 sets of outputs: a sequential regimen model for people starting treatment younger than 80 years (incorporating a life-time horizon including the switch to 110 mg twice daily at 80 years) and a sequential regimen model for those starting treatment at 80 years or older. 3.14 The event risk for all treatment strategies was applied to the
