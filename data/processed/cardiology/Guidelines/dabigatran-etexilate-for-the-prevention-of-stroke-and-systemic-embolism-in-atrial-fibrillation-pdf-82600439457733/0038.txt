However, the Committee was persuaded by the clinical specialists that the RE-LY trial included a broad range of people that reflected those seen in UK clinical practice and that the results were applicable to a wide range of people with atrial fibrillation. The Committee concluded that the population included in the trial was appropriate and broadly relevant to UK clinical practice. 4.4 The Committee considered the results of the RE-LY trial. It noted that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a statistically significantly lower incidence of stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke and vascular mortality compared with warfarin, but that there were no statistically significant differences in these outcomes between dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and warfarin. It also noted that both doses of dabigatran were associated with an
