daily at 80 years) and a sequential regimen model for those starting treatment at 80 years or older. 3.14 The event risk for all treatment strategies was applied to the baseline risk of events in people treated with warfarin in the RE-LY trial. Therefore, treatment effects were converted into relative risks and applied to the warfarin arm of the RE-LY trial. The relative risks for the various clinical events while on treatment with dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily were obtained from the RE-LY trial. In the sequential regimen model, the relative risks were derived from the post hoc subgroup analyses of people older and younger than 80 years of age. The relative risks for aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel and placebo were obtained from the mixed-treatment comparison. 3.15 The manufacturer's economic evaluation focused on health-related quality of life associated with disability and disutility caused by the various clinical events. The baseline utility value for people with atrial fibrillation in the base-case analyses was taken from the RE-LY quality-of-life sub-study. Utility values associated with clinical events and disability status were derived from published sources. 3.16 The manufacturer's model considered resource costs associated with anti- thrombotic treatment, acute
