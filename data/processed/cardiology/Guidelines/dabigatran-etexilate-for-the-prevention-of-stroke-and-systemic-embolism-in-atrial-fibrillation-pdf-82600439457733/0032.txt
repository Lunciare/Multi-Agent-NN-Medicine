centre), would be more relevant if such an analysis were to be carried out. The manufacturer highlighted that the ERG's initial analysis of good INR control (see section 3.28) assumed a time in therapeutic range of 100%, which is unlikely to be achieved in clinical practice for most patients. The manufacturer further explained that for both the full sequential regimen in people starting treatment younger than 80 years and the over 80 cohort, INR would need to be within target range an average of approximately 83% to 85% of the time for the ICERs to be above £30,000 per QALY gained compared with warfarin. 3.39 The ERG provided a critique and exploratory analysis of the manufacturer's additional analyses. The ERG compared inputs in the revised model with inputs used for the original single-dose and sequential regimen model. It commented that the values for ischaemic stroke disability and mortality rates by treatment used in the revised sequential regimen model were the same as those used in the initial sequential regimen model rather than those from the single-dose model. The ERG commented that correcting for this had the effect of reducing the manufacturer's ICERs slightly. The ERG agreed with the manufacturer that
