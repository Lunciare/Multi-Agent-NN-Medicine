For dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily, the ICERs were £75,601 and £108,736 per QALY gained, respectively. 3.19 In the univariate sensitivity analysis, the cost effectiveness of the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years was most sensitive to risk of ischaemic stroke. Setting the relative risk for ischaemic stroke to the 95% upper confidence limits increased the base-case ICER compared with warfarin from £7,314 to £17,100 per QALY gained. The cost effectiveness of the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when older than 80 years was most sensitive to risk of ischaemic stroke and high baseline CHADS scores. Setting the relative risks for ischaemic stroke to the 2 95% upper confidence limits increased the base-case ICER for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people older than 80 years compared with warfarin from £7,873 to £46,509 per QALY gained. The ICER for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when older than 80 years compared with warfarin increased from the base-case estimate of £7,873 to £21,129 per QALY gained for a group with a CHADS score of 5. The ICER for dabigatran 150 mg 2 twice daily compared with warfarin was robust
