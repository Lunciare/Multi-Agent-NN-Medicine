twice daily was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.87 [vitamin K antagonist-naive group] and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.89 [vitamin K antagonist-experienced group]). No statistically significant differences were reported for the lower, 110 mg twice daily, dose of dabigatran compared with warfarin. 3.8 For adverse events, the manufacturer reported a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke for both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.56 [dabigatran 110 mg twice daily] and HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.49 [dabigatran 150 mg twice daily]). Both doses of dabigatran were also associated with statistically significantly fewer life- threatening bleeds compared with warfarin (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82 [dabigatran 110 mg twice daily] and HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98 [dabigatran 150 mg twice daily]). Both doses of dabigatran were associated with fewer cases of intracranial haemorrhage (including haemorrhagic stroke) than warfarin (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.45 [dabigatran 110 mg twice daily]; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.61 [dabigatran 150 mg twice daily]). Treatment with dabigatran 110 mg
