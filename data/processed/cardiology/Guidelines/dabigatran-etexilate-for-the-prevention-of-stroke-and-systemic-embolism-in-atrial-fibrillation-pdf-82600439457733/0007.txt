or systemic embolism compared with warfarin was 10% for dabigatran 110 mg and 35% for dabigatran 150 mg. Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a lower incidence of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin and this was statistically significant (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81). A statistically significant beneficial effect of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was also demonstrated in terms of a reduced incidence of ischaemic stroke (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97) and vascular mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99). A reduction in all-cause mortality was also observed and, although it did not reach statistical significance, it showed dabigatran 150 mg twice daily to be non-inferior to warfarin (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.00). There were no statistically significant differences between dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and warfarin in the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke or vascular mortality. Both doses of dabigatran were associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction compared with warfarin but this was not statistically significant (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75 [110 mg twice daily]; HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.71 [150 mg twice daily]). 3.6 The manufacturer's submission
