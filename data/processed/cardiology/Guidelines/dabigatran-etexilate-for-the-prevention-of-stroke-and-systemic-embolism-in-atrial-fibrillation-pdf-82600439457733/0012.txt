of the overall RE-LY population with patients having similar demographic and disease characteristics. The manufacturer stated that analysing the EQ-5D data for specific events of interest was not possible and the quality-of-life sub-study was unable to provide utility values for event-driven health states to use in the economic model. However, background utility values could be derived from the quality-of-life sub-study for people being treated with warfarin and dabigatran, the details of which are academic-in-confidence and are not reported here. 3.11 The manufacturer performed a mixed-treatment comparison of dabigatran, aspirin monotherapy and aspirin plus clopidogrel. The treatments considered by the manufacturer to be relevant in this analysis were dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, dose-adjusted warfarin, aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel, and placebo. An additional sequential regimen of dabigatran was used in the mixed-treatment comparison. This was intended to reflect the use of dabigatran according to the licensed regimen which is 150 mg twice daily in people up to the age of 80 years, and then 110 mg twice daily in those aged 80 years and older. Results from the RE-LY trial and the mixed-treatment comparison were very similar for both dabigatran doses compared with dose- adjusted warfarin.
