for further clarification on the cost effectiveness of dabigatran presented in the appraisal consultation document. The manufacturer submitted a revised cost-effectiveness analysis of the sequential regimen model comparing dabigatran with warfarin using relative risks from the whole RE-LY trial population rather than from the post hoc subgroup analysis, as requested by the Committee. Given the uncertainty about costs of warfarin prescription and monitoring because of wide variations in local practice, it also conducted sensitivity analyses that varied the annual cost of INR monitoring (£115.14, £241.54, £279.36 and £414.90) and explored the ERG's preferred assumptions (see section 3.33). 3.36 The manufacturer highlighted that its new base-case analysis included INR costs of £241.54. The manufacturer selected this cost based on the conclusions of the first Appraisal Committee meeting, which stated that the real cost of INR monitoring was likely to lie between the ERG's lower estimate of £115.14 and the manufacturer's upper estimate of £414.90. Assuming an INR monitoring cost of £241.54, the manufacturer's revised base-case ICERs were £14,518 per QALY gained for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and £18,269 per QALY gained for the sequential regimen in people starting treatment at 80 years
