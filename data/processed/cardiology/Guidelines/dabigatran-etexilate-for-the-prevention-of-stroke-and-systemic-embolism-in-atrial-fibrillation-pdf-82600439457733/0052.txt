Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

range on the cost effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin. This calculated the ICER for the people with the best-controlled INR (that is, within range 83.7% of the time) at £47,000 per QALY gained. However, this figure incorporated INR monitoring costs of £241.54 (per annum) and the ICER reduced considerably if higher INR monitoring costs of £414.90 per annum were used. The Committee concluded that evidence for stratifying by INR control was insufficient to exclude the minority of people with very good control from the recommendation of dabigatran as a potential treatment option, and that the ICER for the whole population should be the basis of the recommendation. 4.21 The Committee was mindful of the higher gastrointestinal bleeding rates associated with dabigatran and of the relatively short-term safety data compared with the established standard of care, warfarin. It was also mindful that for those with very well-controlled INR on warfarin, the clinical benefits are likely to be less than for those with poorly controlled INR. The Committee therefore concluded that the decision about whether to start treatment with dabigatran in people with atrial fibrillation should be made after an informed discussion between the responsible clinician and the person about the
