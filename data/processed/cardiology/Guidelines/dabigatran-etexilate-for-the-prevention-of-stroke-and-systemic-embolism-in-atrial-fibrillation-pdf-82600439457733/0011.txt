However, the reduction in incidence of haemorrhagic stroke in people older than 80 years for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin was not statistically significant (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07). 3.10 Health-related quality-of-life data were collected in a sub-study of the RE-LY trial (1440 of the 18,113 people enrolled in the RE-LY study completed the EQ-5D questionnaire as part of the quality-of-life sub-study).
