Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

was not statistically significant (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75 [110 mg twice daily]; HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.71 [150 mg twice daily]). 3.6 The manufacturer's submission included post hoc subgroup analyses of people older and younger than 80 years of age. In both age groups, there were no statistically significant differences between either dose of dabigatran and warfarin in the incidence of ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and myocardial infarction. However, the manufacturer did report a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of transient ischaemic attack (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89) in people older than 80 years receiving dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, compared with warfarin. 3.7 The manufacturer's submission reported results from pre-planned subgroup analyses of people naive to vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin (defined as treatment for 2 months or less in a person's lifetime) and people who have previously used vitamin K antagonists (defined as treatment for more than 2 months during a person's lifetime). In both groups, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism compared with warfarin (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.87 [vitamin K antagonist-naive
