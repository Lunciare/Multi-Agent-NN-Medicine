Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation

which people started treatment when younger than 80 years and continued for the rest of their lives, and the sequential regimen in which people started treatment when older than 80 years were £7,314 and £7,873 per QALY gained respectively, compared with warfarin. The ICERs for dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily compared with warfarin were £6,264 and £18,691 per QALY gained respectively. 3.18 The manufacturer performed structural, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to reflect uncertainty in the model inputs and assumptions. The structural sensitivity analysis explored the cost effectiveness of dabigatran by varying INR cost (±25%), time horizon (2, 10 and 15 years), and discount rate (0 to 6%). The cost effectiveness of dabigatran was highly sensitive to the time horizon specified. A 2-year time horizon resulted in ICERs of £75,891 and £23,403 per QALY gained, respectively, for the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when younger than 80 years and the dabigatran sequential regimen in people starting treatment when older than 80 years, compared with warfarin. For dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg twice daily, the ICERs were £75,601 and £108,736 per QALY gained, respectively. 3.19 In the univariate sensitivity analysis, the cost effectiveness of the
