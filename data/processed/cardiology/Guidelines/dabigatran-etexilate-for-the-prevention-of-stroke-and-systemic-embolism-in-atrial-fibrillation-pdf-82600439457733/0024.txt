be considered. 3.26 The ERG highlighted that acute myocardial infarction and systemic embolism were assumed by the manufacturer to be associated with acute costs and disutility, but not with any ongoing or long-term consequences. The ERG considered this assumption to be over-simplistic and that the effect of including long-term consequences of acute myocardial infarction and systemic embolism on the cost effectiveness of dabigatran is uncertain. The ERG commented that dabigatran was associated with higher discontinuation rates than warfarin in the first 2 years of the trial, which could suggest that people tend to tolerate warfarin better than dabigatran. 3.27 The 2 main weaknesses of the manufacturer's model were considered by the ERG to be related to the sequence of treatments and the cost of anticoagulation monitoring. The ERG commented that the full set of relevant sequences of treatment was not fully investigated by the manufacturer. For example, the ERG considered that starting treatment with dabigatran and subsequently switching to warfarin would be a reasonable treatment sequence, but the manufacturer's model assumed that a person could not switch to warfarin if dabigatran was the first treatment. In addition, the ERG stated that the cost of anticoagulation monitoring was a key driver
