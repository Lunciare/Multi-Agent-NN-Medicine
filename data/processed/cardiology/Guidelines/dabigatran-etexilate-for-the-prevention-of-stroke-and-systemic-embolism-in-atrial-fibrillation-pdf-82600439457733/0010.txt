warfarin (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.45 [dabigatran 110 mg twice daily]; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.61 [dabigatran 150 mg twice daily]). Treatment with dabigatran 110 mg was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in major bleeding compared with warfarin. In contrast, both doses of dabigatran were associated with a significantly higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.53 [dabigatran 110 mg twice daily] and HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.72 [dabigatran 150 mg twice daily]). Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.85) and life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.26). The manufacturer reported that more people in the dabigatran groups discontinued the study drug (22.0% in the dabigatran 110 mg twice daily group and 22.8% in the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group), compared with those on warfarin (17.9%). More people in the dabigatran groups also discontinued study medication because of outcome events; however, discontinuations caused by major bleeds were similar for all treatments. 3.9 The manufacturer reported a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke
