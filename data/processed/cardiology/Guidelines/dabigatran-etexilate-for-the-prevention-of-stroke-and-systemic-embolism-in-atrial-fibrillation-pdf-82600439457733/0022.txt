The ERG commented that the definition of moderate or high risk of stroke or systemic embolism in the manufacturer's submission differed slightly to the definition in NICE's original guideline on atrial fibrillation (now replaced by NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation). The ERG commented that the population in the manufacturer's submission seemed to be at higher risk of stroke because the definition of moderate risk included those aged 75 years and over with no additional risk factors, whereas NICE's previous guideline on atrial fibrillation defined moderate risk as people aged 65 years and over with no additional risk factors. The ERG commented that including the potentially large subgroup of people over 65 years with atrial fibrillation but with no other risk factors for stroke would have been useful, and would reflect NICE's previous guideline on atrial fibrillation more closely and reduce the overall risk level of the population. The clinical specialists advising the ERG noted that the threshold for treatment with warfarin seems to be decreasing, therefore decreasing the risk of stroke in the eligible atrial fibrillation population, making the population in the RE-LY trial less representative of clinical practice over time. 3.24 The ERG commented
