£414.90 per annum, the ICER decreased to £31,386 per QALY gained compared with warfarin. The ERG commented that it is unclear how INR monitoring costs vary by time in therapeutic range. The ERG also performed a threshold analysis to estimate the level of time in therapeutic range needed to raise the ICER above £30,000 per QALY gained compared with warfarin, assuming an INR monitoring cost of £241.54 per annum and including all of the ERG's preferred assumptions. The ERG commented that the INR would need to be within the target range an average of 75% to 76% of the time or more for the ICER to be above £30,000 per QALY gained compared with warfarin. 3.41 Full details of all the evidence are in the manufacturer's submission and the ERG report. 4 Consideration of the evidence 4.1 The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of dabigatran, having considered evidence on the nature of atrial fibrillation and the value placed on the benefits of dabigatran by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical specialists.
