of the inflammation is unknown (called ‘idiopathic’). In all cases, the underlying trigger (e.g. virus, autoimmune attack, etc.) causes the immune system to become over-active and this leads to inflamed heart tissues. Infection Medicines and treatments Unknown Autoimmune diseases What are the common symptoms? Both myocarditis and pericarditis can cause chest pain and related symptoms, but the exact feelings vary. Symptoms are unspecific and may overlap with other heart diseases. Myocarditis symptoms Symptoms can be mild or severe and commonly include: • Chest pain or discomfort. This may feel similar to a heart attack or heavy pressure on the chest. • Shortness of breath. You may be out of breath doing everyday activities or even at rest if the heart isn’t pumping strongly. • Palpitations. You may feel your heart beating quickly, pounding or irregularly. • Fatigue, tiredness or weakness. You may tire easily or feel very low in energy. • Fever or flu-like symptoms. Because many cases follow an infection, you might have had fever, body aches, cough or a sore throat (respiratory infections), as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain (gastroenteritis). • Fainting or light-headedness. If the heart rhythm is very irregular, you might feel dizzy
