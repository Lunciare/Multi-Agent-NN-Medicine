This can include intravenous medications (inotropes) to support the heart’s pumping abilities or even mechanical circulatory support (e.g. ECMO or ventricular assist devices) if the heart is extremely weak. • Treating the underlying cause: If myocarditis is clearly due to something like Lyme disease, that infection is treated. In rare cases where a specific viral cause is found (like COVID-19), doctors focus on supportive care as there isn’t a targeted cure. If a disease that affects the whole body is affecting the heart as well, then the therapy will target the underlying cause. • Medication that is causing IMPS should be stopped immediately.
