Healthy heart Myocarditis Pericarditis Inflammation of the myocardium Inflammation of the pericardium (the heart muscle) (the lining around the heart) Inflammatory myopericardial syndrome (IMPS) What are the causes? Many things can trigger inflammation of the heart. The most common cause is infection, especially viruses. For example, common viruses, like those that cause colds, flu and COVID-19, can inflame the heart muscle or its lining. Other possible causes include bacterial or fungal infections. Sometimes pericarditis is caused by tuberculosis or Lyme disease, especially in certain areas. Autoimmune diseases, where the immune system attacks the body – such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis – can also cause myocarditis or pericarditis. Certain medicines and treatments might be a cause too: cancer chemotherapy drugs, radiation to the chest, or even, very rarely, reactions to vaccines or certain medications. Some recreational drugs can also induce IMPS. Genetic factors can play a role in heart inflammation. If you have relatives with unexplained heart disease, mention that to your doctor. In many cases, the cause of the inflammation is unknown (called ‘idiopathic’). In all cases, the underlying trigger (e.g. virus, autoimmune attack, etc.) causes the immune system to become over-active and this leads to inflamed
