can generally be used in early and mid-pregnancy but avoided later as they can affect the baby’s heart. • Low-dose aspirin is often safe to continue through pregnancy and after. • Colchicine is considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is often continued if the benefit is clear. • If needed, steroids like prednisone are used due to their low risk of transfer to the baby. The dose is kept as low as possible. When myocarditis occurs during pregnancy, treatment is similar: rest and heart failure medications that are safe in pregnancy. Pregnant patients should be co-managed by a cardiologist and a gynaecologist familiar with heart disease. Regular monitoring of mother and baby is done throughout pregnancy. Immediate medical attention should be sought if new or worsening heart symptoms occur in pregnancy. Children can get IMPS too, often after viral infections. Symptoms in kids may differ: younger children might not describe chest pain clearly but may seem very irritable, breathe quickly or refuse to eat. • Children with myocarditis are often admitted to hospital to monitor heart rhythms closely. • Children may be given IV fluids, electrolytes or anti-inflammatories. For pericarditis, children usually take pain relievers like ibuprofen and rest.
