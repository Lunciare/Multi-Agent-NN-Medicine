ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

support network can help remind you of positive progress. • Ask for support and professional help: Don’t hesitate to reach out to your doctor or nurse if feelings of depression or anxiety are severe. They can provide reassurance, answer questions or refer you to a counsellor or mental health professional. • Join support groups: There are patient communities (online or local) for myocarditis/ pericarditis or more broadly, for heart health. Hearing how others cope and being part of a supportive community can help. • Focus on what you can control: During recovery, concentrate on healthy actions (taking medicines, resting, healthy eating) rather than worrying about things you can’t change immediately. Setting small, achievable goals (walk daily when permitted, finish a course of medicines) can give a sense of progress. • Routine activities: Gradually resume hobbies and routines you enjoy (reading, light gardening, watching favourite shows) to maintain normalcy. • Stay positive: Many people recover fully and return to normal life. Try to maintain hope. Remind yourself that you are on a treatment plan and making decisions that aid healing. Remember: It’s understandable to worry, but with time and care, most people do well. Use coping strategies and seek support –
