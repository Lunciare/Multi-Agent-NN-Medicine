ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

can worsen inflammation. The duration depends on the severity and your doctor will guide you. • Heart failure medications: If your heart’s pumping ability is weakened, doctors will treat your condition with heart failure medicines including ACE inhibitors or ARBs (to lower heart strain), beta-blockers (to slow the heart rate and improve function) and diuretics (water pills to remove fluid). These medicines help the heart pump better and prevent fluid build-up. • Anti-arrhythmic drugs or devices: If myocarditis causes dangerous heart rhythms, you may be given medications to stabilise the rhythm or even a temporary pacemaker/defibrillator. Some people need an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if serious arrhythmias persist. In some patients, a life-vest will be used as a bridge while waiting for recovery or the decision to implant an ICD. • Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressives: In specific types of myocarditis (like giant cell myocarditis or if caused by autoimmune disease), high-dose steroids or immunosuppressant drugs may be given. However, in common viral myocarditis, steroids are not always used as evidence is mixed. • Supportive hospital care: Severe cases may require intensive care. This can include intravenous medications (inotropes) to support the heart’s pumping abilities or even mechanical circulatory support (e.g. ECMO
