ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

is often given in addition to NSAIDs for pericarditis. It is safe in most patients, including during pregnancy if needed. Common side effects can include upset stomach or diarrhoea. • Corticosteroids: Steroids, like prednisone are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help if NSAIDs/colchicine aren’t enough or in cases like autoimmune-related pericarditis. Doctors use the lowest dose for the shortest time, because steroids have more side effects (weight gain, bone thinning, etc.). • Other immunosuppressants: In rare cases, if pericarditis is chronic/recurrent and linked to an autoimmune condition, strong immune-suppressing drugs or newer agents like interleukin-1 blockers may be used. • Treating the underlying cause: If an infection is found, appropriate antibiotics or antivirals are given. If another condition like kidney failure is causing pericarditis, that is treated too. • Draining fluid: If there is a large fluid build-up that squeezes the heart (cardiac tamponade), a procedure called pericardiocentesis may be urgently needed. This involves inserting a needle or tube to drain the excess fluid off the heart. In very rare cases of chronic constrictive pericarditis (when the lining becomes very stiff), surgery to remove the pericardium (pericardiectomy) might be required. • Rest and monitoring: During treatment, doctors often advise you
