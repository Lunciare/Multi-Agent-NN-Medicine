ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

medical history, including family history and risk factors. They will listen to your heart with a stethoscope. In pericarditis, they might hear a scratchy pericardial rub sound. In myocarditis, heart sounds may be normal or faint if fluid has accumulated. • Blood tests: These check for markers of inflammation (e.g. CRP and ESR) and heart injury (troponin and BNP). Elevated troponin suggests heart muscle damage, which may be seen in myocarditis. Blood tests can also look for viral antibodies or autoimmune markers, but this is not usually necessary. • Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG): This quick painless test records the heart’s electrical activity. Typical findings with pericarditis include a change in the shape of the electrical pattern. Myocarditis can cause ECG changes, irregular rhythms or delayed electrical activity. • Echocardiogram (echo): This type of scan uses ultrasound. In pericarditis, an echo can detect fluid or show if the heart is filling correctly. In myocarditis, an echo may detect a weak heart pump or heart enlargement. • Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR): This useful type of scan can directly visualise inflammation and scarring in the heart muscle to support myocarditis diagnosis. It may also show pericardial effusion and thickening of the pericardial layer. •
