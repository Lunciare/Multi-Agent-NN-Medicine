ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

diagnosed with history, ECG and echo alone. Myocarditis can be trickier – many cases are diagnosed based on a combination of blood markers and scans, but a CMR or even biopsy may be needed to be certain. Treating IMPS Treatment depends on whether you have pericarditis, myocarditis or both, and on the severity. The main goals are to reduce inflammation, relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Most treatments are based on medicines although sometimes procedures are needed. Treating pericarditis For most people with pericarditis, the first treatments are anti-inflammatory medications and rest. • NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs): These are often the first choice. Over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen or aspirin taken at higher doses can relieve pain and inflammation. Your doctor will tell you exactly which drug and dose. Usually, these are taken for a few weeks. It’s important to take them with food and exactly as prescribed to avoid stomach issues. Medicines to protect the stomach may be advised. • Colchicine: This medication helps reduce inflammation and importantly, prevents recurrences. Colchicine is often given in addition to NSAIDs for pericarditis. It is safe in most patients, including during pregnancy if needed. Common side effects can include upset stomach or diarrhoea. •
