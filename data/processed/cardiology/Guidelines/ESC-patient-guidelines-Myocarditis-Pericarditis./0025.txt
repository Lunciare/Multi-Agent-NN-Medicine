a treatment plan and making decisions that aid healing. Remember: It’s understandable to worry, but with time and care, most people do well. Use coping strategies and seek support – you’re not alone on this journey. Special situations and populations Certain life stages and activities need extra consideration when it comes to IMPS: Active people and athletes: Because exercise increases heart rate, inducing stress for the heart, doctors strongly advise rest after myocarditis/pericarditis. It is usually advised that sports and vigorous exercise are stopped for at least 3 months. After that, repeat heart tests (like an echo or CMR) are performed. Training can be gradually resumed only if the heart appears fully healed and with permission from the doctor. Pushing too soon can worsen heart inflammation and risk dangerous arrhythmias. Think of recovery as part of your season – give your heart time to win the long game. Pregnancy: Heart inflammation during pregnancy is rare but needs careful management. Pericarditis in pregnancy is treated with special drug choices: • NSAIDs can generally be used in early and mid-pregnancy but avoided later as they can affect the baby’s heart. • Low-dose aspirin is often safe to continue through pregnancy and after.
