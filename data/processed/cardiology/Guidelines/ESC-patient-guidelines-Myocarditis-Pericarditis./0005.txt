ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

a sore throat (respiratory infections), as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain (gastroenteritis). • Fainting or light-headedness. If the heart rhythm is very irregular, you might feel dizzy or faint. • Swelling in legs or abdomen. Fluid can back up and cause swelling (oedema) in severe myocarditis. Chest pain Breathlessness Palpitations Fatigue Flu-like symptoms Not everyone has all these symptoms. Some people only have mild illness and may not realise their heart is affected until they see a doctor. Other times, people go to the emergency room with chest pain and find out it’s myocarditis, not a heart attack. Example patient scenario – John’s fatigue and palpitations John is a 45-year-old teacher who had several days of fatigue, feeling short of breath walking upstairs and a bit of chest heaviness. He thought it was a flu, but then he fainted while playing with his kids. At the hospital, tests showed elevated heart enzymes and an abnormal heart rhythm, and scans confirmed myocarditis. John had a few days in hospital for monitoring and started on medication to support his heart function. This illustrates how myocarditis can masquerade as fatigue due to flu and may lead to heart rhythm issues
