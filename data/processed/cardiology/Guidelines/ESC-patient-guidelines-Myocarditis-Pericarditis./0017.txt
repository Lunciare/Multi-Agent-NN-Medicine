ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:

severe your symptoms and heart dysfunction are. Outlook: Can I live a normal life? The good news is, many patients recover fully from IMPS, myocarditis or pericarditis, especially with early treatment. Most people do well and return to normal activities after healing. For pericarditis, full recovery often occurs in a few weeks to months. For myocarditis, it may take longer, but the heart can often regain strength with time and treatment. Recovery can vary: • Complete recovery: Many people regain full heart function and have no lasting issues. • Recurrent symptoms: Pericarditis can come back in some people (recurrent pericarditis). Your doctor may keep you on colchicine or other medicines longer to prevent this. • Long-term effects: A smaller number of patients with myocarditis develop lasting heart damage (dilated cardiomyopathy) or chronic heart failure. This depends on how severe the initial damage was. Regular follow-up helps detect and treat any problems early. Things that improve outlook include younger age, initially mild inflammation, no serious rhythm problems and improvement on early tests. Your cardiologist will discuss your personal risk and recovery plan. Recovery tips: Listen to your body and your doctor. Rest when told and pace yourself as you slowly return
