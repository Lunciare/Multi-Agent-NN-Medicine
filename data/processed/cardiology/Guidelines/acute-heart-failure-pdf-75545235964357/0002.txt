Acute heart failure

presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Rationale Natriuretic peptide testing (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) is an important tool for rapidly assessing adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure. It can be used to rule out a diagnosis of heart failure or to see if further investigation with echocardiography is needed. It can save time and distress for the adult presenting with new suspected acute heart failure. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Data source: Local data collection. Process a) Proportion of adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure who have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Acute heart failure (QS103) Numerator – the number in the denominator who have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Denominator – the number of presentations
