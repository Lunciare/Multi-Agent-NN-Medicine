(ACE) inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Rationale Early initiation of ACE inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists for adults with acute heart failure is positively associated with improved outcomes such as lower mortality and readmission rates. If the ACE inhibitor has intolerable side effects, an angiotensin receptor blocker will be offered. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are offered an ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research heart failure audit 2012/13. Process Proportion of new hospital admissions for adults with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction when an ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist are Acute heart failure (QS103) offered. Numerator – the number in the denominator treated with an ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Denominator – the number of new hospital admissions for adults with acute heart
