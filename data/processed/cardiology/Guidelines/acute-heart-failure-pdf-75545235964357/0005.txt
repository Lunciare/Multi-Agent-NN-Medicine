presentation to hospital to rule out a diagnosis of heart failure. Adults presenting at hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have their natriuretic peptide (also known as BNP or NT-proBNP) level in their blood measured. This test is a quick way for doctors to find out whether the person is likely to have heart failure or if they need further assessment to see if their symptoms are caused by something else. Source guidance Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline CG187 (2014), recommendation 1.2.2 (key priority for implementation) Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Natriuretic peptide A protein substance secreted by the wall of the heart when it is stretched or under increased pressure. It has several forms and its level can be raised in a number of conditions, including heart failure. A normal natriuretic peptide level means that heart failure is unlikely, and its measurement can be used to exclude a diagnosis of heart failure. Acute heart failure (QS103) [Adapted from NICE's full guideline on acute heart failure] Appropriate assay thresholds of plasma BNP to assist in ruling out the diagnosis of heart failure • Plasma BNP less than 100 ng/litre • Plasma NT-proBNP less
