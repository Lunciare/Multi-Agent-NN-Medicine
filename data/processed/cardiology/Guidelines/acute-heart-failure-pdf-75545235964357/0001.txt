Acute heart failure

Quality statements Statement 1 Adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Statement 2 Adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission. Statement 3 Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure have input within 24 hours of admission from a dedicated specialist heart failure team. Statement 4 Adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are started on, or continue with, beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Statement 5 Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are offered an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Statement 6 Adults with acute heart failure have a follow-up clinical assessment by a member of the community- or hospital-based specialist heart failure team within 2 weeks of hospital discharge. Acute heart failure (QS103) Quality statement 1: Single measurement of natriuretic peptide Quality statement Adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide. Rationale Natriuretic peptide testing (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP])
