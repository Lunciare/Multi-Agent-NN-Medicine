Acute heart failure

acute heart failure] Appropriate assay thresholds of plasma BNP to assist in ruling out the diagnosis of heart failure • Plasma BNP less than 100 ng/litre • Plasma NT-proBNP less than 300 ng/litre. [Adapted from NICE's full guideline on acute heart failure] Acute heart failure (QS103) Quality statement 2: Transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiography Quality statement Adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission. Rationale Performing a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of hospital admission for adults with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels will enable earlier diagnosis and appropriate management in terms of pharmacological treatment, location of care and relevant input from the specialist heart failure team. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48
