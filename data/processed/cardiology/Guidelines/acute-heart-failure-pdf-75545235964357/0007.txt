Acute heart failure

Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission. Data source: Local data collection. Process Proportion of adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and Acute heart failure (QS103) raised natriuretic peptide levels who have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission. Numerator – the number in the denominator who have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of admission. Denominator – the number of hospital episodes of adults with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide levels. Data source: Local data collection. Outcome a) Mortality rates. Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research heart failure audit 2012/13. b) Length of stay. Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research heart failure audit 2012/13. c) Incidence of adverse events (withdrawal of beta-blockers and other disease-modifying drugs).
