ventricular ejection fraction are offered an ACE inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Acute heart failure (QS103) Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are offered an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (also known as an ACE inhibitor) and an aldosterone antagonist. Source guidance Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline CG187, recommendation 1.5.4 (key priority for implementation) Definition of terms used in this quality statement Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction The fraction of blood that is pumped out from the left ventricle during each heartbeat. In healthy people it is typically at least 55%. It is reduced in systolic heart failure. [Expert consensus] Acute heart failure (QS103) Quality statement 6: Follow-up clinical assessment Quality statement Adults with acute heart failure have a follow-up clinical assessment by a member of the community- or hospital-based specialist heart failure team within 2 weeks of hospital discharge. Rationale It is important that adults with acute heart failure have early specialist heart failure follow-up by a member of the community- or hospital-based specialist heart failure team within 2 weeks of hospital discharge to reduce early readmissions, achieve better long-term outcomes and improve their quality of life.
