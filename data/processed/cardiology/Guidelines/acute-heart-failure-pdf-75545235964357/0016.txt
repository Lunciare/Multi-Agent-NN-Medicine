professionals ensure that adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are started on, or continue with, beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Commissioners ensure that adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are started on, or continue with, beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (known as LVSD, where the pumping chamber of the heart is not pumping well) start or continue beta-blockers while they are in hospital. Source guidance Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline CG187, recommendation 1.5.2 (key priority for implementation) Acute heart failure (QS103) Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Beta-blocker Treatment for heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, angina and heart attacks, and high blood pressure. [Adapted from NICE's full guideline on acute heart failure] Acute heart failure (QS103) Quality statement 5: Drug therapy Quality statement Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are offered an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and an aldosterone antagonist. Rationale Early initiation of ACE inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists for adults with acute heart failure is positively associated with improved outcomes such as lower
