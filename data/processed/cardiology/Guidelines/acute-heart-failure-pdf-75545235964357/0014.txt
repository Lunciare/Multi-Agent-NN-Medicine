due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are started on, or continue with, beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research heart failure audit 2012/13. Process a) Proportion of adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are started on beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Acute heart failure (QS103) Numerator – the number in the denominator who are started on beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Denominator – the number of hospital admissions of adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction in which the patient is not already taking a beta-blocker. Data source: Local data collection. b) Proportion of adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who continue with beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Numerator – the number in the denominator who continue beta-blocker treatment during their hospital admission. Denominator – the number of hospital admissions of adults with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Data source: Local data collection. Outcome a) Mortality rates. Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the National Institute for Cardiovascular
