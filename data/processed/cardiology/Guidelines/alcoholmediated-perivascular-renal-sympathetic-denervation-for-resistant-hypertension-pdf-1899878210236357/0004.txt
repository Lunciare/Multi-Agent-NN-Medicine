Alcohol-mediated perivascular renal sympathetic denervation for resistant hypertension

and advanced into each renal artery under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter has 3 guide tubes, each containing a microneedle. Once the catheter is positioned within the target site, the 3 tubes are simultaneously deployed against the intimal surface of the renal artery. The 3 microneedles are advanced through the renal artery wall into the adventitia and surrounding perivascular space. Microdoses of neurolytic agent (medical grade dehydrated alcohol) are then infused slowly into the perivascular space from the distal to proximal end of each renal artery. This ablates the renal nerves leading to the kidney, with the aim of disrupting neurogenic reflexes involved in blood pressure control. 2.5 After the catheter is withdrawn, renal artery imaging can be done to identify any adverse vascular events related to the device or the procedure. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 5 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 2 randomised controlled trials and 3 single-arm studies. It is presented in the summary of key evidence section in the interventional procedures
