is based on evidence from limited patient numbers and needs confirming over a longer term. So, more evidence is needed on safety. 3.8 This procedure is a single intervention and not intended to be repeated. 3.9 Technology has evolved over time and renal accessory arteries can be reached using a smaller catheter to achieve a more compete denervation.
