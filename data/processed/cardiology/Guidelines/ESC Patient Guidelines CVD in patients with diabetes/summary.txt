The Risk Of Cardiovascular Events Is High With Diabetes Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure, compared with patients who do not have diabetes. In addition, patients with diabetes may develop severe damage to other organs such as the kidneys (chronic kidney disease) and this also increases the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with diabetes, detecting heart and kidney diseases is of critical importance to ensure that the most appropriate treatments and support are given to improve prognosis. Diagnosis Of Cardiovascular Diseases And Diabetes Based on the ESC Guidelines, all patients with diabetes should be checked for the symptoms or signs of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, for heart failure and for chronic kidney disease. Similarly, all patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should have a test to see if they have diabetes.
