ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Diabetes:

have type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, it is recommended that you receive an SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce the cardiovascular and kidney failure risk • To further reduce the risk, finerenone is also recommended if you have chronic kidney disease I have diabetes, have I got I have diabetes, have I atherosclerotic CVD? got heart failure? I have diabetes, have I got I have atherosclerotic CVD, I have heart failure, have I chronic kidney disease? have I got diabetes? got diabetes? Yes Yes Yes Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic CVD = chronic kidney disease heart failure = GLP-1 RA and an = SGLT2 inhibitor plus SGLT2 inhibitor SGLT2 inhibitor finerenone GLP-1 RA = glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist SGLT2 inhibitor = sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor These treatments are added to your existing medication and are not related to glucose control. SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs and finerenone are not approved for patients with type 1 diabetes. The guidelines mention that this is an important knowledge gap since patients with type 1 diabetes need to know if these medications can help them too.
