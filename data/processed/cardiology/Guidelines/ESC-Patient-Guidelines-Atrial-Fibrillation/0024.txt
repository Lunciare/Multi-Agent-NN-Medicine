ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation:

for stroke. Re-evaluating your situation The way care is organised is different in every country and region. However, you should expect to receive follow-up by medical professionals, most often led by either a cardiologist or general practitioner. They might ask for advice or refer you for specific treatment (for example to a surgeon or stroke doctor). This follow-up can also be combined with advice or referral to other professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists or dietitians. Some healthcare providers also have special clinics for patients with AF. If you have been stable, and your symptoms are well controlled, you may be discharged from follow-up by the hospital. Your risk factors and need for blood thinners should continue to be under regular review by your community physician. If you are troubled by your AF, then you should seek attention so that your treatment plan can be changed. If you suffer a black-out or are worried by chest pain, then seek emergency advice.
