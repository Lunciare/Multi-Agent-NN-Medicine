Unfortunately, this is often not achieved, which is partly why strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and dementia are so common in those with AF. Your healthcare team may need to start or increase medication if blood pressure remains high. Exercise Most people with AF do not get enough exercise. Patients may be afraid to exercise and think this makes the condition worse, however, taking part in regular exercise is good for nearly all people with AF. You should gradually build up your exercise and discuss with your healthcare team what types of exercise are appropriate for you
