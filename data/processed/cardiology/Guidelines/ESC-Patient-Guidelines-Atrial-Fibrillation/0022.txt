treatment is initially successful and you are back in a normal heart rhythm. Catheter ablation This procedure uses fine instruments that are passed through blood vessels to get into the heart and interrupt the electrical circuits which are responsible for AF. Some hospitals use a general anaesthetic and others use sedation only, so your length of stay in the hospital will vary. There are complications that can be associated with the procedure and these will be discussed by your cardiologist. The success rate is dependent on a number of factors. Broadly speaking it is more effective for patients with recent or intermittent AF and these groups of patients can be referred for catheter ablation as the first rhythm treatment. For other patients, catheter ablation is recommended if you have already tried drugs to control AF, but they are no longer working, or you have developed side effects. Endoscopic ablation These procedures require access to the heart from the outside, using small incisions in the chest wall. They need an experienced surgeon, so are not available in every centre that treats patients with AF. They are effective at creating a barrier to the electrical activity that causes AF and can also
