ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation:

top value (systolic) or 90 or above for the bottom value (diastolic). If you have heart failure, your heart may not pump blood effectively, which means it cannot deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to the body. When the heart is not working properly, blood is more likely to pool. This increases the risk of forming blood clots. If you have diabetes and your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, this extra sugar can damage the inner lining of your blood vessels. This damage makes blood vessels less flexible and more likely to get clogged. Diabetes is regarded as a risk factor even when treated with medications. If you have a disease of the blood vessels where blood cannot flow normally because the vessels are blocked, narrowed or damaged, this increases your risk of a blood clot. This applies to blood vessels supplying your heart, brain, kidneys, legs and elsewhere in your body. Blood thinners (anticoagulants) Blood thinners, also called anticoagulants, are medications that are prescribed to reduce the ability of the blood to clot. They are highly effective in preventing strokes in patients with AF and are recommended for all patients who have risk factors for developing blood clots.
