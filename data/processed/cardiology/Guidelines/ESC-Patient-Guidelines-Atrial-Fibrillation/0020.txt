ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation:

approaches available, such as: • Electrical cardioversion (electric impulse to the heart whilst you are made sleepy) • Medications, either immediate or taken long-term • Catheter ablation, a procedure to prevent electrical impulses that cause AF from reaching the heart • Endoscopic ablation, similar to catheter ablation but using key-hole surgery • Open surgery, usually for patients who are already undergoing surgery on their heart The sections that follow go into these approaches in more detail. Keeping you safe when restoring normal heart rhythm While restoring a normal heart rhythm may seem urgent, it can make very good sense to delay if you are not on blood thinners (used for at least 3 weeks before a procedure). In addition, medication to restore the heart rhythm can have side effects which will need to be taken into account to improve your safety. Cardioversion If you are acutely unwell, then you may need the electrical approach which is quick and safe. This involves an electrical impulse applied to the heart through the chest wall. It is usually performed with medications to make you feel sleepy (sedatives) and the expected recovery time is rapid. Otherwise, the choice of an electrical or medicine approach
