clots Blood clots can form in the chambers of the heart, dislodge and pass into the circulation causing a blockage to the blood supply. AF is a leading factor in the development of blood clots in the heart and elsewhere. One of the best-known consequences of this is when a blood clot goes to the brain causing a stroke. AF accounts for about a fifth of all known strokes, but also contributes to damage to the brain over time that can lead to dementia. Identifying a stroke can sometimes be difficult if the symptoms are subtle, but ‘FAST’ is an easy way to remember the signs of a stroke: ‘F’ Face – can the person smile?; ‘A’ Arms – can the person lift both arms?; ‘S’ Speech – can the person speak normally? ‘T’ Time to act – if the answer to any of the questions is no, quick action is needed. Your risk of a stroke will vary according to the number of risk factors you have. A member of the healthcare team will ask you about these to decide whether you should receive blood thinners (anticoagulants). If blood thinners are not required, then your risk should be reassessed
