also mindful of the need to ensure that its advice took account of the effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.2 The Committee considered the evidence submitted on the diagnostic performance of SPECT indicating that, overall, it is more sensitive than sECG. However, the Committee appreciated that considerable uncertainty remains over the true values for sensitivity and specificity of SPECT. In particular, trials that assessed these values were subject to referral bias, in that only SPECT-positive cases were referred for CA, which was assumed to be the 'gold standard'. Additionally, the Committee was aware that, contrary to SPECT, CA does not always provide the fullest evaluation of the patient with CAD, particularly where information relating to myocardial perfusion and function are considered important for the establishment of prognosis and management. 4.3.3 The Committee heard from the clinical experts that SPECT is of value at all levels of likelihood for CAD, because it provides highly accurate diagnostic and prognostic information. The experts indicated that, if SPECT and sECG were equally accessible in the NHS, there would be a case for the preferential use of SPECT in certain groups of patients. However, because of the currently limited availability of SPECT in the UK,
