the availability of both equipment and trained staff. The Committee therefore concluded that the increased use of SPECT should initially be targeted at those groups for whom it provides the greatest benefit in terms of cost effectiveness, as expressed in section 1. 5 Recommendations for further research 5.1 Further research is recommended in patients with established CAD regarding the value of SPECT relative to other tests of cardiac function such as echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in order to inform future assessment of the needs of the NHS. 6 Implications for the NHS 6.1 According to the British Nuclear Cardiology Society survey, there were about 1,200 SPECT scans per million population in the UK in 2000. The average waiting time for a scan was 20 weeks. The submission prepared jointly by the professional groups estimated the optimal level of SPECT provision to be around 4,000 SPECT scans per million population per year, calculated on the basis of current revascularisation and CA rates. Furthermore, it suggested that suitable waiting times would be 6 weeks for routine scans and 1 week for urgent tests. 6.2 In order to achieve these levels of both adequacy of provision and speed of
