the professional groups reviewed the diagnostic performance of SPECT only (compared with CA) from 62 studies. Because of differences in inclusion criteria, only 2 of these studies were also included in the Assessment Report analysis. There was considerable variation in study size, quality and design, but weighted means for sensitivity and specificity were reported to be 86% and 74%, respectively. The manufacturer's submission quoted 1 publication with sensitivity and specificity for SPECT reported as 91% and 89%, respectively, and the American College of Cardiologists and American Heart Association Task Force guideline, with average sensitivity and specificity reported as 89% to 90% and 70% to 76%, respectively. Long-term prognostic value 4.1.5 For the long-term prognostic value of SPECT, the Assessment Report included a systematic review of 46 observational studies. 4.1.6 In the 20 studies that provided general prognostic information, cardiac event rates (defined as cardiac mortality or non-fatal MI) were significantly higher for patients with abnormal SPECT scans than for those with normal scans. An abnormal SPECT result was associated with an annual cardiac event rate of 6.7%, whereas a normal scan was associated with an annual cardiac event rate of 0.7% (data from meta-analyses of 15,000 and 20,963 patients, respectively).
