myocardial infarction 1 Recommendations This appraisal covers the use of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the diagnosis and management of angina and myocardial infarction. It does not cover planar MPS or the use of MPS in the management of heart failure or in the assessment of myocardial viability. In this guidance, the term coronary artery disease (CAD) is used to refer to angina and myocardial infarction. 1.1 This recommendation has been updated and replaced by recommendation 1.3.6.1 in NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin. 1.2 MPS using SPECT is recommended as part of the investigational strategy in the management of established CAD in people who remain symptomatic following myocardial infarction or reperfusion interventions. This recommendation has been partially updated by recommendations 1.5.2 and 1.5.12 in NICE's guideline on stable angina.
