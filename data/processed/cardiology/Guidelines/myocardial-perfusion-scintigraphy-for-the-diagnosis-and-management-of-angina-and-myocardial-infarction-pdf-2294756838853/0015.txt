non-diagnostic (sECG-SPECT-CA) • sECG, followed by CA if sECG was positive or non-diagnostic (sECG-CA) • SPECT, followed by CA if SPECT was positive or non-diagnostic (SPECT-CA) • direct CA (CA). 4.2.5 The results were presented as incremental cost per true-positive diagnosed, per accurate diagnosis, per life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and – importantly – were calculated for different levels of prevalence of CAD. 4.2.6 The key results were as follows: • As prevalence of CAD increased, total cost increased and total number of QALYs gained decreased for each diagnostic strategy. • At all prevalence levels of CAD the ordering of diagnostic strategies was the same, with sECG-SPECT-CA being least costly and least effective, and having the lowest average cost per QALY. This implies that an incremental cost is paid for some incremental benefit when SPECT is not included. • CA was the most costly strategy in both models and for all prevalence levels of CAD, and (as the reference standard) was defined as the most effective strategy. • Most incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were less favourable in the manufacturer's model than in the Assessment Report model. However, all ICERs calculated were less than £24,000, apart
