evidence consisted of non-randomised open observational (both prospective and retrospective) studies, with several studies using a comparative design. Diagnostic performance 4.1.2 The diagnostic performance of SPECT was expressed as sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the proportion of true-positives that are correctly identified by the test. Specificity is the proportion of true-negatives that are correctly identified by the test. 4.1.3 The Assessment Report reviewed 21 studies with 100 or more patients that evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of both SPECT and sECG in the diagnosis of CAD compared with CA. Median sensitivity values for SPECT were higher than those for sECG in all studies (SPECT: 81% for the largest subcategory of studies, with a range of 63% to 93%; sECG: 65% for the largest subcategory of studies, with a range of 42% to 92%). However, the results were not pooled because of the heterogeneity across the different studies. Median specificity values were similar for SPECT (65%, range 10% to 90%) and sECG (67%, range 41% to 88%). 4.1.4 The submission from the professional groups reviewed the diagnostic performance of SPECT only (compared with CA) from 62 studies. Because of differences in inclusion criteria, only 2 of these studies were also included
