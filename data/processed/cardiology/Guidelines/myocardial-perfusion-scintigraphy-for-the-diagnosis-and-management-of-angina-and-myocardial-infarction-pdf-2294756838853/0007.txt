Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

detector as a result of interactions with body tissues. ECG-gated SPECT is synchronised with the patient's ECG, thereby minimising artefacts caused by cardiac motion. Also, left ventricular ejection fraction can be measured at rest with ECG-gated SPECT. 3.5 The complication rates for SPECT are no different from those of sECG, and are usually related to exercise or pharmacological stimulation given as part of the stress component in the procedure, with an associated mortality of around 0.01% and a morbidity of around 0.02%. The radiation exposure from SPECT is similar to the exposure from uncomplicated CA. 3.6 The cost of a SPECT scan is estimated to be around £265, whereas the costs for sECG and CA are £104 and £1,103, respectively (2002 NHS reference costs). 4 Evidence and interpretation The Appraisal Committee considered evidence from a number of sources. 4.1 Clinical effectiveness 4.1.1 The Assessment Report and the submissions reviewed the literature and focused on 2 aspects separately: the diagnostic performance of SPECT, and its long-term prognostic value. Much of the evidence consisted of non-randomised open observational (both prospective and retrospective) studies, with several studies using a comparative design. Diagnostic performance 4.1.2 The diagnostic performance of SPECT was expressed as sensitivity
