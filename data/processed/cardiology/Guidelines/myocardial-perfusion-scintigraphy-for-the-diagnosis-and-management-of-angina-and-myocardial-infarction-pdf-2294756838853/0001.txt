Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

myocardial infarction 1 Recommendations This appraisal covers the use of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the diagnosis and management of angina and myocardial infarction. It does not cover planar MPS or the use of MPS in the management of heart failure or in the assessment of myocardial viability. In this guidance, the term coronary artery disease (CAD) is used to refer to angina and myocardial infarction. 1.1 This recommendation has been updated and replaced by recommendation 1.3.6.1 in NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin. 1.2 MPS using SPECT is recommended as part of the investigational strategy in the management of established CAD in people who remain symptomatic following myocardial infarction or reperfusion interventions. This recommendation has been partially updated by recommendations 1.5.2 and 1.5.12 in NICE's guideline on stable angina. 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the commonest cause of death in England and Wales. It is characterised by the development of lipid-laden coronary arterial plaques, which reduce the blood supply to the heart muscle. Significant CAD is defined as a stenosis (narrowing) of more than 70% of the diameter of at least 1
