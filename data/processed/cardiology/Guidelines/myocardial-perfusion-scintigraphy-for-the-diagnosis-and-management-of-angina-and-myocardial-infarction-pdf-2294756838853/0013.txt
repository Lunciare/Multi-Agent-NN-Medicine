information predictive of outcome that helped to risk-stratify patients and influence the way in which their condition was managed. 4.1.15 The submissions from the professional groups and the manufacturer included reviews of a larger number of papers and, because of differences in the inclusion criteria, there was little overlap between the studies included in each of the 3 reviews. Despite the differences in the evidence base of the 3 reviews, similar conclusions were drawn. 4.2 Cost effectiveness 4.2.1 The Assessment Group, the manufacturer and the professional group reviewed published cost-effectiveness studies. The Assessment Group and the manufacturer also provided new economic models. 4.2.2 The systematic review in the Assessment Report included studies that compared both costs and outcomes of SPECT with alternative diagnostic strategies. The comparison of different publications was complicated by the multitude of strategies considered, differences in study designs and populations, in treatment comparisons, in costing methods and different ways in which outcomes were measured. Overall, it was concluded that direct CA (without any prior tests) was cost effective when the prevalence of disease was high. At low levels of prevalence, strategies involving SPECT and/or sECG were considered to be a better use of resources than a strategy
