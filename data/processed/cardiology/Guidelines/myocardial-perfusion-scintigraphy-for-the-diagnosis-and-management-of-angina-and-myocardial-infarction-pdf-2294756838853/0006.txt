induced by exercise as in sECG, but is most commonly induced by pharmacological agents. 3.2 MPS was originally developed as a planar imaging technique, but SPECT is the clinical standard in current practice. In SPECT, the camera rotates around the patient for 10 to 20 minutes and the raw data are processed to obtain tomographic images of the myocardium. The stress and rest images are normally separated by 3 to 4 hours. The total patient contact time for stress induction, injection and image acquisition is approximately 60 minutes. 3.3 Homogeneous uptake of tracer throughout the myocardium indicates the absence of clinically significant infarction or coronary stenosis. A defect in the stress images that normalises in the rest images usually corresponds to a significant coronary stenosis. A defect in both stress and rest images indicates an area with loss of viable myocardium, such as after MI. 3.4 Two technical improvements to SPECT were also considered in this appraisal. Attenuation-corrected SPECT compensates for the fact that many emitted photons never reach the detector as a result of interactions with body tissues. ECG-gated SPECT is synchronised with the patient's ECG, thereby minimising artefacts caused by cardiac motion. Also, left ventricular ejection fraction can
