SPECT was cost effective across a wide range of clinical situations. 4.3.6 The Committee further considered that, in terms of both clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, the absolute 'value' of SPECT as an appropriate diagnostic tool depends on the likelihood of the presence of CAD in the target population under investigation. Thus, the diagnostic strategy SPECT-CA is clearly preferred on cost-effectiveness grounds in individuals with a lower likelihood of CAD and consequently lower risk of future coronary events. However, as the likelihood of CAD increases, differences in the incremental cost effectiveness for the different testing strategies decrease. Thus, at higher likelihood of CAD and of possible intervention (CABG or PCI), a strategy where direct CA is preferred over SPECT-CA could be considered more appropriate. 4.3.7 The Committee heard from the experts that SPECT enables the redirection of patients into medical rather than surgical management. SPECT may therefore postpone or completely avert the need for CA in some clinical situations. The Committee also recognised the significance of the disutility associated with CA, which would favour SPECT and had been omitted from the economic models reviewed. It concluded that full consideration of these aspects is likely to improve the cost effectiveness of
