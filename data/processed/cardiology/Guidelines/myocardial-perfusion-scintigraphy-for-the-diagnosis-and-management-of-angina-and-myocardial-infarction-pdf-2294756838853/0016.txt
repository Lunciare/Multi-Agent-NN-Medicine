effective strategy. • Most incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were less favourable in the manufacturer's model than in the Assessment Report model. However, all ICERs calculated were less than £24,000, apart from the ICER for direct CA compared with SPECT-CA at low and 30% prevalence of CAD. 4.2.7 When compared with sECG-CA at low prevalence of CAD, the ICER for SPECT-CA (£8,723) was more favourable than the ICER for direct CA (£21,538). Conversely, at high prevalence of CAD, the more favourable strategy was direct CA with an ICER of £1,962, whilst SPECT-CA had an ICER of £3,242. 4.2.8 When direct CA was compared with the SPECT-CA strategy, a high ICER was seen at low prevalence (£42,225). However, as prevalence increased, direct CA became increasingly more cost-effective. At 80% prevalence of CAD, the move to the direct CA from SPECT-CA involved a modest extra cost per additional QALY gained (£942 in the Assessment Report and £4,482 in the manufacturer's submission). 4.2.9 Several sensitivity analyses showed that the results varied considerably depending on the sensitivity or specificity values entered for SPECT and sECG. When the impact of the additional independent information provided by SPECT was explored by increasing the proportion of SPECT positives
