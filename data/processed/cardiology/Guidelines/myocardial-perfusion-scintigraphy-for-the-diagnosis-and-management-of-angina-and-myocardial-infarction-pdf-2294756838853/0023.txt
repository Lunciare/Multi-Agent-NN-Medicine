waiting times would be 6 weeks for routine scans and 1 week for urgent tests. 6.2 In order to achieve these levels of both adequacy of provision and speed of accessibility, it is estimated that 73 additional gamma cameras would be needed in England and Wales, at a capital cost of around £18 million.
