CA, which would favour SPECT and had been omitted from the economic models reviewed. It concluded that full consideration of these aspects is likely to improve the cost effectiveness of SPECT. 4.3.8 The Committee was advised by the experts that SPECT scanning may be particularly useful as an initial diagnostic tool in people for whom sECG poses particular problems of poor sensitivity or difficulties with interpretation. This includes women, patients with cardiac conduction defects (such as left bundle branch block) and people with diabetes. SPECT also has an important role in assessing the presence of CAD in patients for whom treadmill exercise is difficult or impossible, and in the full evaluation of patients following MI or reperfusion interventions. 4.3.9 The Committee considered that increased provision of SPECT within the NHS over that currently available was desirable on the basis of this evidence. However, it recognised that more widespread use of SPECT would require an implementation strategy that may take several years to fulfil and would need a significant increase in the availability of both equipment and trained staff. The Committee therefore concluded that the increased use of SPECT should initially be targeted at those groups for whom it provides the
