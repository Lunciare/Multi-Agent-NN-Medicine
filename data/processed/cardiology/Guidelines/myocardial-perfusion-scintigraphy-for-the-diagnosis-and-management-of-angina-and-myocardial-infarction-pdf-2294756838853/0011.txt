Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

at long-term follow-up. 4.1.10 In several studies that investigated whether an abnormal SPECT scan was a predictor of cardiac death, the relative risk or odds ratios were calculated depending on study design. In all studies an abnormal SPECT scan was described as an independent, main or statistically significant predictor of cardiac death. In 4 studies, with patient numbers ranging from 176 to 947, the relative risk ranged between 1.1 and 17.6. In 2 studies, with patient numbers of 248 and 1,182, the odds ratios were reported to be 2.8 and 4.8, respectively. 4.1.11 SPECT also provided independent prognostic information in the following subgroups: women (5 studies), patients post-MI (4 studies), patients who had undergone PCI or CABG (3 studies), medically treated patients with left main and/ or 3-vessel CAD (1 study), patients hospitalised with angina who had a normal or non-diagnostic sECG (1 study), and patients with diabetes (2 studies). 4.1.12 Two studies found ECG-gated SPECT to be more sensitive than non-ECG-gated SPECT, but with slightly lower specificity. Also, ECG-gated SPECT provided incremental prognostic information in patients with known or suspected CAD that was better than perfusion data alone. One study compared SPECT with attenuation-corrected SPECT and reported that attenuation
