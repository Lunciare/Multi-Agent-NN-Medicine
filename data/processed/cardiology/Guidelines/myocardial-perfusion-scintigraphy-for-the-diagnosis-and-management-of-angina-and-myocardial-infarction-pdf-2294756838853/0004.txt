individual likelihood for CAD can be estimated from age, gender, ethnic group, family history, existence of symptoms, associated comorbidities and the results of tests such as resting electrocardiography (rECG). rECG is a commonly used test because it is readily available in primary care and is inexpensive, but because it does not exclude CAD, it is of limited diagnostic value. Stress ECG (sECG) and coronary angiography (CA) are commonly used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of CAD. 2.7 sECG is normally recorded during progressive exercise on a treadmill, and so is not suitable for people for whom treadmill exercise is difficult or impossible. 2.8 CA involves manipulating a cardiac catheter into the heart from a vein or artery in a limb. A contrast medium is injected through the catheter, and its progress monitored by a rapid series of X-rays. CA provides mainly anatomical information and is used to measure the degree of stenosis. It is considered the 'gold standard' for defining the site and severity of coronary artery lesions. However, CA findings are not always a reliable indicator of the functional significance of a coronary stenosis. Routine use of CA without prior non-invasive testing is not advisable, because of its
