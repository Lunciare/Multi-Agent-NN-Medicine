the sensitivity or specificity values entered for SPECT and sECG. When the impact of the additional independent information provided by SPECT was explored by increasing the proportion of SPECT positives whose condition could be satisfactorily managed medically, ICERs generally improved. When the time horizon was less than 15 years, all ICERs became less favourable. In the subgroup analysis for women, the SPECT-CA strategy dominated both the sECG- CA and CA strategies. 4.2.10 In summary, when compared with sECG-CA, SPECT-CA has more favourable ICERs than direct CA at low levels of prevalence of CAD. At higher prevalence levels, the sECG-CA and CA strategies lead to more favourable ICERs than SPECT-CA. 4.3 Consideration of the evidence 4.3.1 The Committee reviewed the evidence available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of MPS for the diagnosis and management of CAD, having considered evidence on the value placed by users on the benefits of MPS for the diagnosis and management of CAD, from people with CAD, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It was also mindful of the need to ensure that its advice took account of the effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.2 The Committee considered the evidence submitted on the diagnostic performance
