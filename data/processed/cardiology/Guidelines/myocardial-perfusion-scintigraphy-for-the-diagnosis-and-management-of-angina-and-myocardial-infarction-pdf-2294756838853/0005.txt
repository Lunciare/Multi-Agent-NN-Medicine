Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

CA findings are not always a reliable indicator of the functional significance of a coronary stenosis. Routine use of CA without prior non-invasive testing is not advisable, because of its high cost and associated mortality and morbidity. Potential complications include non-fatal MI (0.1%), stroke (0.1%) and death (0.1% to 0.2%). 2.9 Other frequently used non-invasive techniques include myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) and echocardiography. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography are used less frequently. 3 The technology 3.1 MPS involves the intravenous injection of small amounts of a radioactive tracer to evaluate perfusion of living cardiac muscle via the coronary arteries after stress and at rest. After injection, the tracer is taken up by cardiac muscle cells, and its distribution within the myocardium is imaged using a gamma camera. Three tracers are commercially available in the UK: thallium-201 thallous chloride, technetium-99m 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile, and technetium-99m 1,2-bis(bis[2-ethoxyethyl]phosphino)ethane. MPS is a non-invasive procedure which provides more detailed information about coronary function than sECG and CA. Cardiovascular stress can be induced by exercise as in sECG, but is most commonly induced by pharmacological agents. 3.2 MPS was originally developed as a planar imaging technique, but SPECT is the clinical standard
