arterial plaques, which reduce the blood supply to the heart muscle. Significant CAD is defined as a stenosis (narrowing) of more than 70% of the diameter of at least 1 major epicardial artery segment or more than 50% of the diameter of the left main coronary artery. 2.2 Angina (chest pain) is the most common symptom of CAD. It is usually provoked by exercise and relieved by rest. Angina of rapidly increasing frequency, or experienced at rest, is called unstable angina. CAD can also lead to heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI) and sudden cardiac death. MI is characterised by severe chest pain persisting for at least 20 minutes, a rise in cardiac enzymes in the serum, and/or an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). 2.3 About 2.65 million people in the UK have CAD, and of these 1.2 million have had an MI. There were an estimated 275,000 heart attacks in the UK in 2001, and 335,000 new cases of angina are diagnosed each year. CAD is more prevalent in men than in women. The prevalence of CAD increases with age, and varies across geographic regions and socioeconomic groups. 2.4 Preventative strategies for reducing the frequency of CAD include smoking cessation, diet modification,
