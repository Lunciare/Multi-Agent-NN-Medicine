Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

SPECT provided incremental prognostic information in patients with known or suspected CAD that was better than perfusion data alone. One study compared SPECT with attenuation-corrected SPECT and reported that attenuation correction had a significant impact on the assessment of the severity and extent of MI. 4.1.13 The search strategy used in the Assessment Report did not identify any studies evaluating the role of SPECT in the context of rapid access chest pain clinics or in pre-operative risk assessment of patients undergoing major surgery who were potentially at risk of coronary events. However, the submission from the professional groups lists 20 studies on SPECT in pre-operative risk assessment, and emphasises the acknowledged role of SPECT for this indication. 4.1.14 In summary, as studies reviewed in the Assessment Report were carried out under a number of different clinical settings investigating different outcomes, it was not possible to summarise the effectiveness of SPECT in simple quantitative estimates. However, the evidence from the reviewed studies consistently suggested that SPECT provided valuable independent and incremental information predictive of outcome that helped to risk-stratify patients and influence the way in which their condition was managed. 4.1.15 The submissions from the professional groups and the manufacturer included
