Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

an annual cardiac event rate of 6.7%, whereas a normal scan was associated with an annual cardiac event rate of 0.7% (data from meta-analyses of 15,000 and 20,963 patients, respectively). Furthermore, the extent and size of a perfusion defect can predict the likelihood of future cardiac events. 4.1.7 The proportion of normal angiograms was lower in patients who were referred to CA after a positive SPECT than in patients referred directly for CA (2 studies: 33% versus 43% [4,688 patients], and 18% versus 33% [6,800 patients], respectively). 4.1.8 However, the rate of subsequent revascularisations was lower for the SPECT-CA strategy (13% to 27%) than for the direct CA strategy (16% to 44%; data from 3 studies with a combined total of approximately 11,000 patients). 4.1.9 In studies where it was possible to analyse the contribution of different clinical parameters to the prediction of clinical outcomes, it was found that SPECT provided independent prognostic information for predicting MI, and had an additional value over clinical and sECG data that was maintained at long-term follow-up. 4.1.10 In several studies that investigated whether an abnormal SPECT scan was a predictor of cardiac death, the relative risk or odds ratios were calculated depending on
