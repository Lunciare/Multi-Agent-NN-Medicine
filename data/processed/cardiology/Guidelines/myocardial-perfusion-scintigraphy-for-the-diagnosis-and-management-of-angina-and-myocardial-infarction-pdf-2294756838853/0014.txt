Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and management of angina and

effective when the prevalence of disease was high. At low levels of prevalence, strategies involving SPECT and/or sECG were considered to be a better use of resources than a strategy of direct CA. Furthermore, strategies involving SPECT were often found to be dominant or provided additional benefits that might be considered worth the additional cost compared with the sECG-CA strategy. 4.2.3 The new economic models provided by the Assessment Group and the manufacturer used similar designs; decision tree models were constructed for the diagnostic performance of different strategies and Markov models were used to estimate the long-term costs and benefits. They both used a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients (to start at the age of 60), with the assumption that effectiveness of therapy (CABG, PCI, medical management) lasts for 10 years. The time horizon was 25 years with an annual cycle time. 4.2.4 The diagnostic strategies considered in both models were: • sECG, followed by SPECT if sECG was positive or indeterminate, followed by CA if SPECT was positive or non-diagnostic (sECG-SPECT-CA) • sECG, followed by CA if sECG was positive or non-diagnostic (sECG-CA) • SPECT, followed by CA if SPECT was positive or non-diagnostic (SPECT-CA) • direct CA (CA).
