women. The prevalence of CAD increases with age, and varies across geographic regions and socioeconomic groups. 2.4 Preventative strategies for reducing the frequency of CAD include smoking cessation, diet modification, exercise, and treating conditions that exacerbate progression of the disease, such as hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and blood hypercoagulability. Medical treatment of angina symptoms includes the use of nitrates, beta-adrenergic blockers and/or calcium channel blockers. In severe CAD, revascularisation may be required, using surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or via the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly with the insertion of an intraluminal coronary stent. 2.5 The cost of CAD to the UK healthcare system in 1999 was estimated in the Assessment Report (see Appendix B) at £1.7 billion; the total annual cost was around £7 billion when informal care and productivity losses were included. More than 378,000 inpatients were treated for CAD in NHS hospitals in 2000 to 2001. Approximately 28,500 CABG and 39,000 PCI procedures are performed each year in the UK. 2.6 The individual likelihood for CAD can be estimated from age, gender, ethnic group, family history, existence of symptoms, associated comorbidities and the results of tests such as resting electrocardiography (rECG). rECG
