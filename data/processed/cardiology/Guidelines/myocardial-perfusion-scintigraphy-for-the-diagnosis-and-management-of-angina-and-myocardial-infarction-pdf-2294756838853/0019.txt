the NHS, there would be a case for the preferential use of SPECT in certain groups of patients. However, because of the currently limited availability of SPECT in the UK, the committee believed that its use should be particularly directed to patient groups for whom it provides the greatest additional benefit in terms of initial diagnosis of suspected CAD and in the management and prediction of prognosis in those with established CAD. 4.3.4 The Committee also recognised that there are circumstances where the information from sECG is important, as in the evaluation of the overall exercise performance of patients with CAD. sECG is therefore likely to remain a commonly used investigation in most circumstances. 4.3.5 The Committee reviewed the cost-effectiveness modelling. They noted that because the difference in QALYs derived between the different investigational strategies was small, and the disutility of CA was not included in the models, the conclusions of cost–utility differences between diagnostic strategies (see Section 4.2.4) should be interpreted with caution. However, the Committee considered that, overall, SPECT was cost effective across a wide range of clinical situations. 4.3.6 The Committee further considered that, in terms of both clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness, the absolute 'value' of
