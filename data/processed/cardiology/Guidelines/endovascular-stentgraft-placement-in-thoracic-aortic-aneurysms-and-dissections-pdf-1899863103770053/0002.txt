treatment. 2.1.2 Conventional surgery for aneurysms of the thoracic aorta involves replacing the affected part of the aorta with a synthetic graft. Aortic dissections may be managed medically or surgically, depending on the site involved and whether there are complicating features. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Endovascular stent–graft placement involves inserting a metallic stent covered with graft material inside the aorta. This is usually achieved by catheterising the femoral arteries. The stent–graft is positioned and deployed using X-ray guidance. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 A systematic review of the published evidence on this procedure was commissioned by the Institute. A total of 29 studies were identified for inclusion (27 case series and two comparative observational studies). 2.3.2 In one comparative study, the technical success rate was 100% (67/67 patients). The overall technical success rate was 93% across 18 studies (16 case series and two comparative studies). 2.3.3 The rate of conversion to open repair varied from 0% (0/26 patients) to 7% (1/14 patients). The proportion of patients who experienced an increase in aneurysm size varied from 0% (0/18) to 7% (2/29) of patients. In the study with the largest number of patients, the aneurysm increased in size (by ( 5 mm)
