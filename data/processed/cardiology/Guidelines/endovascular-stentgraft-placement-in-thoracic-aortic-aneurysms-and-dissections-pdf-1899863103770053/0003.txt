in aneurysm size varied from 0% (0/18) to 7% (2/29) of patients. In the study with the largest number of patients, the aneurysm increased in size (by ( 5 mm) in 5% (4/84) of patients. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in aneurysm size varied from 100% (18/18) to 17% (5/29) of patients.

The overall mortality ranged from 3% (1/37 patients) to 24% (11/46 patients) across 17 studies with a mean follow-up of 14 months. 2.4.2 The most commonly reported complication following endovascular stent–graft placement was endoleak (incomplete sealing of the aneurysm). Nineteen studies reported at least one patient with an endoleak, with a mean incidence of 13% over 12 months (the total number of patients in these studies was 752; follow-up ranged from 3 to 25 months). Five studies with a total of 83 patients reported that there were no cases of endoleak during a mean follow-up period of 12 months. 2.4.3 Injuries to the access artery were reported in nine case series, and
