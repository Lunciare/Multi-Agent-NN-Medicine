Temperature control to improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest

to prevent fever after cardiac arrest, there may be improved neurological outcomes (less brain injury). There are no safety concerns with fever prevention. So, it can be used with standard arrangements. But more research is needed on whether the improved neurological outcomes are directly related to the procedure. Some clinical trial evidence suggests that there is less brain injury when the body's core temperature is cooled to below 36°C (therapeutic hypothermia) after cardiac arrest. But other clinical trial evidence suggests that there is no reduction in brain injury. In some trials, the procedure was delayed. So, the importance of how long after cardiac arrest cooling is started is uncertain. Evidence on the safety of therapeutic hypothermia suggests that it is potentially harmful. People who have this procedure are also more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm. More research is needed on safety and long-term outcomes of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest, so it should be used only in research. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Cardiac arrest is when normal blood circulation suddenly stops because the heart fails to contract effectively. The underlying abnormal cardiac rhythms most commonly associated with cardiac arrest are: • ventricular
