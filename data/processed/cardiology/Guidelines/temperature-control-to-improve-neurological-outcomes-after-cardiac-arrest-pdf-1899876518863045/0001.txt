Temperature control to improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest

1 Recommendations To prevent fever 1.1 Use temperature control as an option to prevent fever and improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest with standard arrangements in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. 1.2 For auditing the outcomes of this procedure, the main efficacy and safety outcomes identified in this guidance can be entered into NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (for use at local discretion). To induce therapeutic hypothermia 1.3 More research is needed on temperature control to induce therapeutic hypothermia (a temperature of less than 36°C) to improve neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. 1.4 This procedure should only be done as part of a formal research study and a research ethics committee needs to have approved its use. 1.5 More research, in the form of randomised controlled trials, is needed on: • patient selection • timing of the intervention • degree and duration of temperature control • neurological outcomes • survival. Why the committee made these recommendations Clinical trial evidence suggests that, if core body temperature is controlled to prevent fever after cardiac arrest, there may be improved neurological outcomes (less brain injury). There are no safety concerns with fever prevention. So, it can be used with standard
