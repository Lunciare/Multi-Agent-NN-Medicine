and 36°C). 2.4 The aim is to reduce brain injury and improve neurological outcomes. The exact mechanism by which cooling may protect against brain injury is unclear. Possible mechanisms include reductions in metabolic demand, release of excitatory neurotransmitters and inflammation after ischaemia. 2.5 Temperature control is done using either: • surface techniques (for example, heat exchange cooling pads, cooling blankets and ice packs), or • internal techniques (for example, an endovascular cooling device). Core body temperature is monitored using a temperature probe (such as a bladder, rectal or nasopharyngeal temperature probe) and is controlled to a preset point determined by the clinician. 2.6 If therapeutic hypothermia is induced, controlled rewarming is usually done over several hours. In addition, people who have had cardiac arrest generally have standard critical care measures, and may need intravenous sedation and muscle relaxants, to prevent shivering. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 9 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 8 systematic reviews and meta-analyses and 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT). It
