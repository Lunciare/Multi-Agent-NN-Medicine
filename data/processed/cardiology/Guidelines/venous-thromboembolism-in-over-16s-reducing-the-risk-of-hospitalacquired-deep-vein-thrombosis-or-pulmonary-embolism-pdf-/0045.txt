Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein

approximately 12,000 events per year only related to immobilisation following ankle trauma. Despite this burden of ill-health, no randomised studies comparing modern anticoagulants that are available in oral preparations (perhaps more suitable for outpatient treatments) with established treatments such as LMWH or fondaparinux were identified in the evidence review. The committee were unable to make a recommendation to consider oral anticoagulants for this patient group given this lack of evidence. 4 Aspirin prophylaxis for people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal femur What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of aspirin alone versus other pharmacological and/or mechanical prophylaxis strategies (alone or in combination) for people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal femur? Why this is important Fragility fractures are the greatest burden of musculoskeletal disease in hospitals in the UK. There are approximately 70,000 fragility hip fractures per year in England alone leading to 1.5 million bed days being used each year, which equates with the continuous occupation of over 4,000 NHS beds. Current evidence supports a recommendation for prophylaxis with LMWH or fondaparinux. Both involve a subcutaneous injection for 28 days requiring either self-injection at home or a community nurse attending to deliver
