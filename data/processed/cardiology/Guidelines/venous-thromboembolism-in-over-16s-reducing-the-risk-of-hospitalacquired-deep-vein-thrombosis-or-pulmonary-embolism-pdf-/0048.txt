remains a common cause of in-hospital mortality. HAT accounts for 50% to 60% of all VTE seen. In 2013 to 2014, there were around 24,700 admissions for pulmonary embolism and 19,400 for DVT in England. In 2013 in England and Wales, there were 2,191 deaths recorded as due to pulmonary embolism and 2,816 due to DVT. Treatment of non-fatal symptomatic VTE and related long-term morbidities is associated with a considerable cost to the health service. People admitted to hospital or mental health units have varying risk factors for VTE. The spectrum of VTE risk is broad, and understanding the scale of the problem has led to a paradigm shift in preventing and managing VTE in the NHS. In particular, patients now undergo VTE risk assessment as a routine event in all NHS care pathways. By July 2013, 96% of adult admissions to NHS-funded acute care hospitals were risk assessed for VTE compared with less than 50% of patients in July 2010. VTE prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of DVT. It includes mechanical methods (such as anti-embolism stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices), and pharmacological treatments (such as heparin and other anticoagulant drugs). This guideline is about reducing
