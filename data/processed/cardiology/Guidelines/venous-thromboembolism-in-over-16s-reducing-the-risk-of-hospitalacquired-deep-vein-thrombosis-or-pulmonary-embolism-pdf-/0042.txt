Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein

the national tool has been used, with some trusts offering prophylaxis to over 90% of medical patients. Around 40% of medical patients have prophylaxis in largely US-based populations when other tools are used (although this may partially relate to different indications for hospital admission). It is not known if this means that the national tool identifies too many people or the other tools do not identify enough. The potential impact of giving unnecessary prophylaxis is that people may be at increased risk of bleeding and discomfort through repeated injections. There is also the potential for reducing the cost of thromboprophylaxis by better defining 'at risk' populations, so that the number of those given thromboprophylaxis is reduced. 2 Dose strategies for people who are obese What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of weight-based dose-adjustment strategies of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) compared with fixed-dose strategies of LMWH for preventing VTE in people who are very obese (BMI over 35) who are admitted to hospital or having day procedures (including surgery and chemotherapy)? Why this is important Obesity is on the rise in England. The prevalence of obesity increased by 11% between 1993 and 2014 (15% in 1993 and 26% in 2014), which
