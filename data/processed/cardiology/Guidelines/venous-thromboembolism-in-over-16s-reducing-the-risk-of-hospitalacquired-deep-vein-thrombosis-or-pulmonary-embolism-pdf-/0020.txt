Consider regional anaesthesia for individual patients, in addition to other methods of VTE prophylaxis, as it carries a lower risk of VTE than general anaesthesia. Take into account the person's preferences, their suitability for regional anaesthesia and any other planned method of VTE prophylaxis. [2010] 1.10.2 If regional anaesthesia is used, plan the timing of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to minimise the risk of epidural haematoma. If antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents are being used, or their use is planned, refer to the summary of product characteristics for guidance about the safety and timing of these in relation to the use of regional anaesthesia. [2010] 1.10.3 Do not routinely offer pharmacological or mechanical VTE prophylaxis to people undergoing a surgical procedure with local anaesthesia by local infiltration with no limitation of mobility. [2010] 1.11 Interventions for people having orthopaedic surgery Lower limb immobilisation 1.11.1 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis with LMWH or fondaparinux sodium for people with lower limb immobilisation whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. Consider stopping prophylaxis if lower limb immobilisation continues beyond 42 days. [2018] In March 2018, the use of LMWH and fondaparinux sodium in young people under 18 was off label.
