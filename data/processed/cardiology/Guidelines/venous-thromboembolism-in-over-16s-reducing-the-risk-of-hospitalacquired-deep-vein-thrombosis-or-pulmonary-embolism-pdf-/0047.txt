duration of prophylaxis is based on few, small and older trials. The quality of the evidence supporting extended duration prophylaxis is very low. Modern pharmaceutical trials of newer interventions use extended duration prophylaxis based on these historical data, with the added incentive of more expensive prophylaxis strategies. There is a large potential cost saving if a shorter duration of prophylaxis is as clinically effective, given the considerable cost of prophylaxis and the number of people for whom it is prescribed. Context Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE), also known as hospital-acquired or hospital-associated thrombosis (HAT), covers all VTE that occurs in hospital and within 90 days after a hospital admission. It is a common and potentially preventable problem. VTE most frequently occurs in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis (a deep vein thrombosis [DVT]). If it dislodges and travels to the lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolism, which in some cases can be fatal. Hospital-acquired VTE accounts for thousands of deaths annually in the NHS, and fatal pulmonary embolism remains a common cause of in-hospital mortality. HAT accounts for 50% to 60% of all VTE seen. In 2013 to 2014, there were around 24,700 admissions for pulmonary embolism and
