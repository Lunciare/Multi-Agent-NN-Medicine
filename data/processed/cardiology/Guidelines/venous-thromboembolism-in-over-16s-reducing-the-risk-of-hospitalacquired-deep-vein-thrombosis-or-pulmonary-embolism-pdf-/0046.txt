evidence supports a recommendation for prophylaxis with LMWH or fondaparinux. Both involve a subcutaneous injection for 28 days requiring either self-injection at home or a community nurse attending to deliver the injection. Patient adherence to treatment may be improved with an oral rather than injectable treatment. A large but controversially reported trial suggests that aspirin may be at least as effective as currently recommended treatments. However, because of methodological and reporting limitations, the evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin alone is not clear. There is potentially a large cost saving if aspirin is clinically effective because it is very inexpensive. 5 Duration of prophylaxis for elective total hip replacement surgery What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of standard versus extended duration pharmacological prophylaxis for preventing VTE in people undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery? Why this is important In 2015, there were 84,462 hip replacements in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The current recommended duration of prophylaxis is 28 days in the elective total hip replacement population. This extended duration of prophylaxis is based on few, small and older trials. The quality of the evidence supporting extended duration prophylaxis is very low. Modern pharmaceutical trials of newer interventions use
