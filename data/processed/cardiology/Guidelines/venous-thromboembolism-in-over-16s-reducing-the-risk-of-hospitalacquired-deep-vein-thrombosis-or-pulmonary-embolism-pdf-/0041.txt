The committee's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline. 1 Risk assessment What is the accuracy of individual risk assessment tools in predicting the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and risk of bleeding in people admitted to hospital? Why this is important Risk assessment is a mandatory for all people admitted or having day procedures in hospital. Since 2010, the National VTE Risk Assessment Tool has been widely used in the NHS to assess a person's risk of VTE.

There is concern that the tool may not accurately identify those who are most likely to get VTE. According to national figures, over 70% of medical patients in the UK have prophylaxis when the national tool has been used, with some trusts offering prophylaxis to over 90% of medical patients.
