Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein

for preventing venous thromboembolism in adults after elective knee replacement surgery. For full details, see the guidance on dabigatran etexilate (TA157, 2008). [2018] 1.11.10 Consider intermittent pneumatic compression if pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated in people undergoing elective knee replacement surgery. Continue until the person is mobile. [2018] Non-arthroplasty orthopaedic knee surgery 1.11.11 Be aware that VTE prophylaxis is generally not needed for people undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery where: • total anaesthesia time is less than 90 minutes and • the person is at low risk of VTE. [2018] 1.11.12 Consider LMWH 6 to12 hours after surgery for 14 days for people undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery if: • total anaesthesia time is more than 90 minutes or the person's risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. [2018] In March 2018, the use of LMWH in young people under 18 was off label. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. 1.11.13 Consider VTE prophylaxis for people undergoing other knee surgery (for example, osteotomy or fracture surgery) whose risk of VTE outweighs their risk of bleeding. [2018] Foot and ankle orthopaedic surgery 1.11.14 Consider pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for people undergoing foot or ankle surgery: • that requires immobilisation (for example, arthrodesis or arthroplasty);
