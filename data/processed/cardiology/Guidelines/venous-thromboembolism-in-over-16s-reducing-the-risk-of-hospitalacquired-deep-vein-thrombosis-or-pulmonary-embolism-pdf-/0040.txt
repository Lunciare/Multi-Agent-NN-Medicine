Venous thromboembolism in over 16s: reducing the risk of hospital-acquired deep vein

system designed to improve venous circulation in the lower limbs of people at risk of DVT or pulmonary embolism. The inflation–deflation cycle of intermittent pneumatic compression therapy simulates the thigh, calf and foot's normal ambulatory pump action increasing both the volume and rate of blood flow, eliminating venous stasis and replicating the effects of the natural muscle pump. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be thigh- or knee-length sleeves that are wrapped around the leg, or a garment that can be wrapped around or worn on the foot that is designed to mimic the actions of walking. Lower limb immobilisation Any clinical decision taken to manage the affected limb in a way that would prevent normal weight-bearing status or use of that limb, or both. Renal impairment People with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. For more detailed information on renal impairment, see the NICE guideline on chronic kidney disease in adults. Significantly reduced mobility People who are bed bound, unable to walk unaided or likely to spend a substantial proportion of their day in bed or in a chair. Recommendations for research The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. The committee's
