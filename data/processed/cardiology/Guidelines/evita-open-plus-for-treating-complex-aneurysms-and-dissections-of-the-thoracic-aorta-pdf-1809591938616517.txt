E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
This guidance replaces MTG16.
1 Recommendations
1.1 The case for adopting the E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and
dissections of the thoracic aorta, in a carefully selected group of people, is
supported by the evidence.
1.2 Using the E-vita open plus could remove the need for a second procedure and
the associated risk of serious complications, and it should therefore be
considered for people:
• who would otherwise need a 2-stage repair procedure because their aortic
disease extends into or beyond the distal part of their aortic arch (into the
proximal descending aorta), but
• who would not need additional intervention (such as stent grafting) in the
descending aorta.
1.3 The E-vita open plus is estimated to generate cost savings compared with
current 2-stage repair from about 2 years after the procedure. The estimated
cost saving per patient at 5 years after the procedure is around £13,334 when
compared with 2-stage repair involving open insertion of a vascular graft,
£10,225 when compared with 2-stage repair involving endovascular stent
grafting and £12,536 when compared with open surgical debranching followed by
endoluminal stent grafting. At 10 years after the procedure, the estimated cost
savings range from around £22,704 to £29,210 across the 3 comparators (see
section 5.23). [2018]

(HTG326)
2 The technology
Description of the technology
2.1 The E-vita open plus (JOTEC GmbH) is an endoluminal stent graft system
designed for treating aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta. The
device is a 1-piece polyester fabric tube which combines a conventional vascular
graft attached to an endovascular stent graft that allows treatment of the
ascending aorta at the same time as the arch and descending aorta. The E-vita
open plus supersedes its immediate predecessor device, the E-vita open. The
2 devices are similar in design and function but the E-vita open plus is
impermeable to blood, and fibrin glue is not needed to seal the stent graft.
2.2 The E-vita open plus is a single-use device with a shelf life of 2 years. It is
supplied sterile and pre-loaded in its delivery system. The device is available in a
range of sizes with varying diameters and lengths. The delivery system consists
of a release handle, nested catheters and a positioning aid. A luer connector is
also incorporated to allow flushing of the inner guide catheter. A stiff guide wire is
used to aid tracking of the device delivery. Radiopaque markers are integrated
into the fabric of the graft for radiological imaging.
2.3 The E-vita open plus received a CE mark in October 2008 for the repair or
replacement of the thoracic aorta in cases of complex aneurysms or dissections
that involve the ascending aorta, the aortic arch and the descending aorta.
2.4 The E-vita open plus is used in a single-stage procedure known as a 'frozen
elephant trunk'. The thoracic aorta is surgically opened with access through a
median sternotomy approach. The distal stent graft portion of the device is self-
expanding, containing nitinol springs, and is used to treat the upper part of the
descending aorta. The vascular graft part of the device (for repair of the arch and
ascending aorta) is invaginated in the distal stent graft portion. The stent graft, in
its delivery system, is inserted into the descending aorta and deployed by
retracting a retaining sheath. Once the stent graft is in place, the delivery system
is removed and the proximal vascular graft component is drawn out a short
distance (5 mm to 10 mm). The stent graft is then surgically anastomosed to the

(HTG326)
distal aorta. The vascular graft portion of the device is then drawn out fully and
used to repair the ascending aorta and arch in a standard surgical fashion. The
aortic branch vessels are attached to the vascular graft using a patch and the
graft is anastomosed to the ascending aorta.
2.5 The cost of the E-vita open plus stated in the sponsor's submission was
£10,500 excluding VAT.
2.6 The claimed benefits of the E-vita open plus in the case for adoption presented
by the sponsor are:
• repair of the ascending aorta, arch and descending aorta in a single-stage
procedure
• a reduction in pain and discomfort
• elimination of the psychological distress associated with the anticipation of a
second procedure
• a reduction in treatment times and costs
• a reduction in total end-organ ischaemia
• a reduction in incisional complications and infections
• a reduction in anaesthetic use and the elimination of the need for additional
epidural pain management
• a reduction in both total length of stay and intensive care unit length of stay
• a reduction in rehabilitation time
• an earlier return to normal activities and work.
Current management
2.7 The management of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections is determined by
the location, severity and rate of change of the disease, as well as the clinical
circumstances. Thoracic aortic aneurysms result from a weakening of the aortic

(HTG326)
wall, leading to localised dilation. People with thoracic aneurysms are often
observed with clinical and imaging surveillance. Invasive treatment may be
offered depending upon the size and rate of enlargement of the aneurysm.
2.8 Aortic dissections result from a tear in the inner layer of the aorta. Blood flows
through the tear, separating the layers of the wall. Acute aortic dissections are
less than 2 weeks old, and chronic dissections have been present for longer than
2 weeks. Management of aortic dissections depends primarily on their location.
Emergency surgery is usually offered for a Stanford type A aortic dissection,
which affects the ascending thoracic aorta and often also the arch and
descending aorta. Stanford type B dissections, typically involving the descending
thoracic aorta, are often managed with conservative medical treatment. Elective
surgical repair is sometimes undertaken, but endovascular repair with stent grafts
is more commonly used.
2.9 There are 3 main current methods of surgically treating complex aneurysms and
dissections of the thoracic aorta, 2 of which involve a 2-stage 'elephant trunk'
procedure. Both approaches are similar in their first stage but use alternative
repair techniques to complete the second stage. During the first stage, the
ascending aorta and arch are repaired with a vascular graft through a median
sternotomy. During this procedure a free-floating extension of the arch graft
prosthesis (the 'elephant trunk') is left unattached in the descending aorta.
Attaching it (and extending it as necessary) may be done by an endovascular
procedure during which a stent graft is inserted into the descending aorta with
access via the femoral artery (thoracic endovascular aortic repair – TEVAR).
Alternatively the descending aorta may be repaired in a second surgical
procedure some weeks or months later, by extending the 'elephant trunk' as
necessary, through a lateral thoracotomy approach. The third method involves
'debranching' of the head and neck vessels from the aortic arch by creating a
surgical anastomosis between the ascending aorta and the head and neck
vessels using a vascular graft. This then allows an endoluminal stent graft to be
inserted into the aortic arch and descending aorta either as a hybrid procedure
(during the same operation) or at a second-stage operation.

(HTG326)
3 Clinical evidence
Summary of clinical evidence
3.1 Full details of all clinical outcomes considered by the committee are available in
the assessment report overview.
3.2 The key clinical outcomes for the E-vita open plus presented in the decision
problem were:
• completion and success of technical procedure(s)
• mortality
• major complications, for example stroke, paraplegia, renal failure, myocardial
infarction and other events that may delay discharge
• length of intensive care unit stay
• total length of hospital stay
• freedom from further interventions
• long-term survival rates
• incidence of junctional endoleak
• device-related adverse events.
3.3 The sponsor identified 13 papers relevant to the E-vita open plus. Most of these
were derived from the International E-vita Open Registry, which is reported to
contain data on 70% to 80% of patients in 11 European centres who have received
the E-vita open or open plus devices to treat their complex aortic disease. The
sponsor excluded 10 (of the 13) papers from further consideration, either
because the data were already included in a more recent report on the entire
register dataset at the time of publication (Jakob et al. 2011), or because they
reported on small numbers of patients or on animal studies. The external
assessment centre excluded a further 2 papers from its evaluation: a small study

(HTG326)
with limited follow-up, and a study using the same data as the paper by Jakob et
al. (2011). The external assessment centre judged that the principal clinical
evidence for the E-vita open plus was presented in the observational study on
the International E-vita Open Registry by Jakob et al. (2011).
3.4 Jakob et al. (2011) reported observational data, gathered between January
2005 and December 2010, for 274 patients with complex aortic disease enrolled
in the International E-vita Open Registry from, at the time, 8 European centres.
This comprised the entire dataset at the time of publication. Details of the
274 patients treated, in terms of condition and interventions, are shown in tables
1 and 2. Outcomes were presented as proportions and survival analysis was
carried out using the Kaplan–Meier technique. Stent-graft deployment and arch
replacement were carried out under selective antegrade cerebral perfusion
during a mean time of 75 minutes. Median length of hospital stay was 19 days
(range 12 to 29). Adverse events are shown in table 3. For patients with
dissections the false lumen was assessed postoperatively and at a median time
of 59 months (range 28 to 99) after surgery. The false lumen thrombosed fully in
83% (62 of 75) of patients with acute aortic dissection, and 72% (68 of 94) of
patients with chronic aortic dissection. After follow-up these figures rose to 93%
and 92% respectively. For patients with aneurysms, complete exclusion of the
aneurysm was achieved in 77% of cases (61 of 79). The overall 5-year survival
rate was 74%. Of the 233 patients surviving the procedure initially, secondary
endovascular intervention was needed in 13% (29) and surgery downstream was
needed in 3% (6) of cases.

3.5 The sponsor presented limited evidence on clinical outcomes for 2-stage
procedures to allow comparison with those for the E-vita open plus. The external
assessment centre therefore carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis
of available data for the comparator procedures. The review identified 10 papers
and the meta-analysis provided pooled estimates of outcome rates with 95%
confidence intervals for in-hospital and 30 day mortality, stroke, bleeding,
paraplegia and renal failure, which were the main complications reported in the
literature. The external assessment centre was unable to calculate single
outcome estimates for the combined 2-stage procedures because of a lack of
data. It judged that direct comparisons between the E-vita open plus and the
comparators would therefore be complex and that the figures did not take into
account factors such as survival from stage 1 to 2 or the impact of the combined
outcomes for each procedure. Long-term survival rates could not be included in
the meta-analysis because no confidence intervals were reported and individual
patient data were not available. The pooled estimate data for the comparators are
shown in table 3.

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
3.6 During consultation, an additional clinical report was identified that presented
more recent data from the International E-vita Open Registry (Jakob and
Tsagakis, 2013). The paper reported outcomes for in-hospital mortality, stroke,
paraplegia and 5-year survival rates for a total of 416 patients from
11 international centres. No outcomes were reported for 30-day mortality,
bleeding or renal failure. Figures for 5-year survival rates were reported for
3 subgroups but no overall figure was reported or could be calculated from the
data presented. The external assessment centre determined that, overall, there
was insufficient information available, in terms of completeness or long-term
follow-up, to provide additional reliable estimates of outcome rates beyond those
derived from the Jakob et al. (2011) study (see section 3.4).
Committee considerations
3.7 The committee considered that the clinical evidence was limited because it was
restricted to observational studies. However, it considered that the evidence was
sufficient, when taken together with clinical expert advice, to conclude that the
E-vita open plus is effective for use in a selected group of people (see sections
3.10 to 3.11).
3.8 The committee considered that the pooled estimates of outcomes for the
comparators produced by the external assessment centre indicated that more
bleeding would be likely to occur with the E-vita open plus (13.9%) than with the
comparators (ranging from 4.2% to 8.1% at stage 1, and from 3.7% to 5.6% at
stage 2). The committee was advised that bleeding was a complication
experienced with both the E-vita open plus and the comparators and that excess
bleeding with the E-vita open plus may have reflected incorrect choice of device
size during early experiences of its use. It was mindful that bleeding is a
complication which is normally controlled at the time of surgery, without patients
experiencing long-lasting adverse consequences, in contrast to the other major
adverse events (stroke, paraplegia and renal failure) which may have serious
consequences for patients in the long term.
3.9 The committee was advised that patient selection would be important in realising
the claimed benefits of the E-vita open plus. The committee heard expert clinical
advice that the E-vita open plus is primarily suitable for people needing aortic

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
arch repair and that the device enables repair to the arch to be completed more
rapidly than by other techniques. Expert advice also confirmed that in people
whose aortic disease extends less than 10 cm into the descending aorta (based
on the size of the stent graft portion of the device), the E-vita open plus would
allow a complex repair in a single procedure.
3.10 The committee concluded that in people with aneurysms or acute aortic
dissections needing repair of the aortic arch and ascending aorta, if the disease
extends less than 10 cm into the descending aorta, the E-vita open plus would be
a suitable treatment. The committee recognised that the E-vita open plus might
be suitable for use in other people with more extensive disease in the descending
aorta that would need multiple stent grafts. However, it decided that the potential
benefits of the technology for these people were not clear, based on the
evidence presented. The committee therefore considered that making a
recommendation for use of the technology in those with more extensive disease
in the descending thoracic aorta was not possible.
3.11 The committee was advised that many people for whom treatment with the E-vita
open plus would be suitable have progressive aortic disease that would need
further interventions, regardless of whether the repair was carried out in a single
or 2-stage procedure. It was advised that this is significantly more likely in people
with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan's syndrome than in those with
atherosclerotic disease.
3.12 The committee judged that the main advantage of the E-vita open plus is the
avoidance of a second procedure with its associated serious risks, which include
stroke, renal failure, paraplegia and bleeding. The committee was advised by
clinical experts that some people decide not to return for a second procedure
because of negative experiences from the first operation. The committee
considered that the opportunity to repair the aorta in a single procedure would
confer significant benefits to these people.
3.13 The committee was advised by clinical experts that the estimate in the scope for
the number of people in England (50 to 100 per year) eligible for treatment was
reasonable.
3.14 The committee considered the paper by Jakob and Tsagakis (2013), but judged

that the outcomes it reported did not add to the evidence base for the E-vita
open plus: no data for 30-day mortality, bleeding or renal failure were reported. It
considered that the included outcome data did not differ significantly from those
reported by Jakob et al. (2011) and would not alter the outcomes from the
external assessment centre's cost analysis.

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
4 NHS considerations
System impact
4.1 The sponsor stated that using the E-vita open plus could allow repair of the
thoracic aorta in a single procedure, when a 2-stage procedure would otherwise
be necessary. It claimed that this would consequently reduce overall length of
stay in hospital and reduce the risk of complications needing hospital treatment.
The clinical evidence consisted of the study by Jakob et al. (2011), which
contained no comparative data about resource use during other aortic repair
techniques. The review and meta-analysis carried out by the sponsor focused on
clinical outcomes rather than resource implications.
Committee considerations
4.2 The committee was satisfied that a second repair procedure could be avoided by
using the E-vita open plus in a selected group of people and that this could
reduce associated NHS resource use.
4.3 The committee was advised that aortic repair using the E-vita open plus is a
highly specialised procedure, carried out in a small number of centres, in a small
patient group. Despite these limitations, the committee considered that the
potential benefits of releasing operating theatre and clinical time by avoiding the
need for a second procedure could be significant. It recognised that the
resources needed for treating complications associated with a second procedure
(some of which would be severe and would result in long-term disability) would
also be released.

(HTG326)
5 Cost considerations
Cost evidence
5.1 Neither the sponsor nor the external assessment centre identified any relevant
published economic evidence for the E-vita open plus or for the comparator
techniques.
5.2 The sponsor submitted a de novo analysis comparing the use of the E-vita open
plus against a 2-stage classical 'elephant trunk' procedure in terms of overall
costs, in-hospital mortality and adoption rates. The population was a cohort of
3,500 people with aneurysms, dissections and other specified lesions of the
thoracic aorta. The model consisted of 2 decision trees over a 1-year time
horizon:
• a current practice model using the classical 'elephant trunk' procedure
• an intervention model comparing current practice against use of the E-vita
open plus at a 40% adoption rate.
5.3 The first stage of the current practice arm was divided into 2 options: woven
graft or branched graft. For patients undergoing stage 2, the options were woven
graft (open surgery) or endovascular stent graft. Following clarification from the
sponsor, these options were further defined as follows:
• Woven graft at stages 1 and 2 referred to 2-stage open surgical repair with
vascular graft placement.
• Woven graft followed by stent graft at stage 2 referred to 2-stage repair with
open surgical graft placement in the ascending aorta and arch and
endovascular stent graft placement in the descending aorta.
• Branched graft followed by woven or stent graft at stage 2 referred to open
surgical 'debranching' of the head and neck vessels with endoluminal stent

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
5.4 The sponsor carried out 1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses to include base-case,
worst-case and best-case scenarios in its analysis.
5.5 The key assumptions used in the model were:
• In-hospital and 30-day mortality was 15% for the E-vita open plus, based on
data from the paper by Jakob et al. (2011).
• The remaining 85% of patients treated would not experience other
complications.
• Mortality rates were 20% for woven graft and 30% for branched graft at
stage 2.
• The number of inpatient days for the classical elephant trunk procedure was
10 at stage 1 and 15 at stage 2.
• The number of inpatient days for the endovascular stent procedure was 10 at
stage 1 and 8 at stage 2.
• The number of inpatient days for the E-vita open plus was 4 in the intensive
care unit and 6 in a surgical ward.
5.6 Technology costs were provided by the sponsor. The cost of the E-vita open plus
was £10,500 and the comparator costs were £200 for a woven graft for stages
1 and 2, £1,000 for a branched graft, and £5,000 for an endovascular stent graft.
Consumable costs (mainly for the guide wire, estimated to be £130) were not
included because the sponsor considered these to be the same for the
technology and comparators. Cost estimates for clinical time and resource use
were sourced from published literature, the Personal Social Services Research
Unit (PSSRU) unit costs of health and social care manual, and NHS reference
costs.
5.7 The cost of a surgeon was estimated to be £399 per hour and the costs of a
perfusionist and anaesthetist were each estimated to be £87 per hour (registrar
rate). The cost for theatre time, including nursing and consumables, was
estimated to be £24 per hour, and £30 per hour for corresponding intensive care
unit costs. These were derived from the NHS tariff for admitted patient case and
outpatient procedures but no codes were specified. The sponsor used a daily

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
cost for an intensive care unit stay of £1,500, taken from a report in The Lancet.
The cost of a surgical ward inpatient stay was taken to be £420 per day, based
on 2 different tariff codes. The cost of death cited by the sponsor (£8,000) was
taken from a cancer network publication.
5.8 The sponsor carried out 1-way sensitivity analyses varying the adoption rate from
20% to 100% (in the modelled population of 3,500 patients assumed to be eligible
for the E-vita open plus). The proportion of woven or branched grafts used at
stage 1 was varied from 60% to 95% from a base-case estimate of 85%. The
proportional suitability for a second stage operation was varied from a base case
of 80% to 60% and 95%, and the proportion of patients having each
stage 2 procedure was varied from a 50% base case to 40% and 100%. The
sponsor also carried out a 2-way sensitivity analysis varying the in-hospital death
rate at stage 1 of the classical elephant trunk procedure and for the E-vita open
plus.
5.9 The sponsor presented the results of its de novo analysis as an average cost per
patient, assuming a 100% adoption level (rather than the 40% adoption level
described in the model decision tree in section 5.2) for the E-vita open plus
compared with current practice. The cost for the E-vita open plus was
£25,689 and the overall cost presented for the comparators was £30,241,
indicating a cost saving per patient of £4,553 if the E-vita open plus was used.
The cost per patient varied across the different comparators, ranging from
£26,691 for woven graft (stage 1) with endovascular stent (stage 2) to
£36,016 for branched graft (stage 1) with woven graft (stage 2).
5.10 The sponsor's sensitivity analysis showed little variation in the cost savings
generated for the E-vita open plus at different adoption levels, with an average
cost saving of around £4,358. The sponsor reported that varying the parameters
for second-stage suitability and in-hospital death had an impact on the cost
savings, but that this was relatively small. Varying the suitability of a second
stage operation produced higher cost savings per patient if the level of suitability
was raised. The sponsor did not consider the subgroups defined in the scope in
its de novo analysis because of a lack of available data on the comparators.
5.11 The external assessment centre considered that the sponsor's de novo cost
model was flawed because it did not include the short- or long-term costs of

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
complications and because some of the costs and clinical parameters were
inaccurate or inappropriate. Specifically, the external assessment centre
considered that a per-patient, rather than a cohort, approach would have been
more useful and that the estimated cohort of 3,500 patients was too large.
5.12 The external assessment centre carried out additional modelling to address these
issues, constructing short- and long-term models that included the costs of
complications (stroke, paraplegia, renal failure and bleeding). Both models
compared per-patient costs for the E-vita open plus and the 3 comparators
defined in the scope. A decision tree was constructed for each procedure in each
model. In-hospital mortality was modelled at each stage of each procedure. The
time horizon for the short-term model was 1 year, as the external assessment
centre considered that stage 2 procedures were likely to be carried out within
6 months of stage 1. The long-term model had a 20 year time horizon, based on
the UK life expectancy of the average age (65 years) of those receiving treatment
described in published literature. Lifetime costs of complications were included in
this model.
5.13 In the short-term model for each comparator, patients with no complications or
bleeding at stage 1 were assumed to proceed to the second stage procedure,
whereas it was assumed that those who had a stroke, renal failure or paraplegia
would not. In the long-term model, the annual costs of care for stroke, paraplegia
and renal failure were taken from published literature and discounted at 3.5%.
The discounted annual cost was multiplied by a survival probability for 65 to
85 years and the weighted annual costs were summed to estimate the lifetime
cost of the complications.
5.14 The external assessment centre estimated the probabilities of the outcomes at
each stage from the register data for the E-vita open plus and from its meta-
analysis of the clinical evidence on the comparator procedures. The probability of
paraplegia at stage 1 was assumed to be the same for 2-stage repair with
vascular graft and 2-stage repair with endovascular stent graft. For open
debranching, the probability of paraplegia and that of renal failure at stage 1 was
taken from hybrid procedure estimates. Operating times and total lengths of stay
for all the comparators were sourced from published literature. Operating time for
the E-vita open plus and details of the surgical team involved for each procedure
were taken from the sponsor's model. The team included a consultant surgeon,

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
consultant anaesthetist, associate specialist, perfusionist and 2 specialist nurses.
A consultant radiologist was included for stage 2 procedures involving stent
grafts.
5.15 The external assessment centre used technology and comparator costs from the
sponsor's model but derived more precise estimates for staff and ward stay costs
than those used by the sponsor (as described in section 5.7). Costs for each
professional in the surgical team were taken from PSSRU 2012 unit costs. The
costs for an intensive care unit and surgical ward stay were sourced from NHS
reference costs at £1,410 per day and £383 per day respectively.
5.16 Complications were assumed to incur additional in-hospital management costs
and a single cost figure was applied across all procedures (£2,155). The annual
cost for stroke care was estimated to be £9,597 at 2012 prices, from the NICE
guideline on atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management. The annual cost of
paraplegia was estimated to be £14,580, based on published literature and
inflated to 2012 prices. The annual cost for renal failure used was £32,961, taken
from the NICE guideline on renal replacement therapy and conservative
management and inflated to 2012 prices.
5.17 Costs for multiple stents were included in the analysis and sourced from the
sponsor's submission. However, the external assessment centre was not able to
model the probable outcomes from using multiple stents, citing a lack of available
clinical evidence.
5.18 Results of the short-term model showed that treatment with the E-vita open plus
could generate a cost saving of £280 per patient when compared against
2-stage repair with vascular graft. The E-vita open plus incurred costs when
compared against 2-stage repair with endovascular stent graft (£4,760) and also
when compared against open debranching with endoluminal stent graft (£7,663).
5.19 Results from the long-term model, which included the lifetime costs of
complications, showed that treatment with the E-vita open plus could generate
significant cost savings when compared with all 3 comparator procedures. The
estimated saving per patient 20 years after the procedure was £41,213 when
compared against 2-stage repair with vascular graft, £39,392 when compared
against 2-stage repair with endovascular stent graft and £51,778 when compared

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
against open debranching with endoluminal stent graft.
5.20 The external assessment centre carried out a deterministic sensitivity analysis to
investigate the impact of uncertainty on the likelihood and costs of complications.
The probabilities of in-hospital mortality and paraplegia were varied separately
based on their 95% confidence intervals from the external assessment centre's
meta-analysis of the clinical evidence. The overall management costs and the
annual costs of complications were varied separately using minimum and
maximum ranges identified in the literature, if available. The proportion of days
spent in an intensive care unit and the cost of an intensive care unit day were
also varied to reflect uncertainty in the number of organs needing support.
Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that varying the probability of in-
hospital mortality and paraplegia for the E-vita open plus, or the management or
annual costs of complications, did not substantially change the expected cost
savings in the base-case estimate. In the short-term model, varying the
proportion of days spent in the intensive care unit did change the observed cost
savings. At a 20% level, the E-vita open plus incurred costs when compared with
all 3 comparators. At a 60% level, there were cost savings for the E-vita open plus
compared against 2-stage repair with vascular graft. Varying the cost of intensive
care unit stay affected the short-term model results in a similar way, but neither
variable substantially altered the cost savings in the long term.
5.21 The external assessment centre acknowledged some limitations in its model.
Complications were assumed to occur only in the short term, because data were
not available about their occurrence in the longer term. However, clinical expert
advice indicated that the majority of complications would occur during or shortly
after the intervention. The external assessment centre recognised that a more
complex model (such as Markov or discrete event simulation) might have
facilitated a more refined analysis and noted that the sensitivity analysis did not
account for the possibility of multiple complications occurring in individual
patients.
5.22 The external assessment centre developed a profile of year-on-year costs for the
long-term model from year 1 to year 20. The E-vita open plus was estimated to
be cost saving at and beyond 2 years after the procedure compared with all
3 comparator procedures. For example, when compared with 2-stage repair with
vascular grafting, the base-case cost savings per person treated with the E-vita

E-vita open plus for treating complex aneurysms and dissections of the thoracic aorta
(HTG326)
open plus were £6,057 at 2 years after the procedure, £13,822 at 5 years, and
£24,948 at 10 years. When compared with 2-stage repair with endovascular stent
grafting, the cost savings were £1,471 at 2 years after the procedure, £9,847 at
5 years, and £21,847 at 10 years. When compared with open surgical
debranching with endoluminal stent grafting, the cost savings were £726 at
2 years after the procedure, £12,003 at 5 years, and £28,158 at 10 years.
5.23 For the guidance review, the external assessment centre revised the model to
reflect 2018 costs. The major changes in the update relate to acute care costs of
adverse events and staff costs. In the original model, the acute care cost of
adverse events was calculated as £2,155; in the revised model, the costs depend
on the type of adverse event and range from £498 for bleeding to £11,663 for
paraplegia. Staff costs in the revised model were taken from the Personal Social
Services Research Unit (PPSRU) 2017 and were often cheaper. Base-case results
for the 2018 revised model show that estimated cost savings per patient at 5
years after the procedure are:
• £13,334 compared with 2-stage repair involving open insertion of a vascular
graft.
• £10,225 compared with 2-stage repair involving endovascular stent grafting.
• £12,536 compared with open surgical debranching followed by endoluminal
stent grafting.
These saving increase across the 3 comparators in the longer term. Further
details of the 2018 revised model are in the revised model summary. [2018]
Committee considerations
5.24 The committee recognised the difficulties of cost modelling based on the limited
clinical evidence. It considered that the external assessment centre's critique of
the sponsor's cost analysis was generally valid and judged its additional
modelling to be sufficiently robust to provide a reasonable estimate of potential
cost savings.
5.25 The committee heard clinical expert advice that 10% to 20% of people treated

(HTG326)
with the E-vita open plus might need a second procedure. It was advised that
reintervention was likely for people with connective tissue disorders regardless of
whether they had a 1- or 2-stage procedure initially. The external assessment
centre had been unable to include the possibility of reintervention in its model,
citing a lack of data on which to base estimates. The external assessment centre
advised the committee that including the assumption that 10% to 20% of people
would need reintervention would not substantially change the findings from the
long-term model.
5.26 The committee recognised that the E-vita open plus could incur costs in the short
term when compared with most methods of current practice. However, the
opportunity to avoid a second stage procedure by using the E-vita open plus
would reduce resource use. The committee accepted the external assessment
centre's year-on-year costs profile and concluded that the E-vita open plus was
likely to have a cost advantage from year 2 onwards.

(HTG326)
6 Conclusions
6.1 The committee concluded that use of the E-vita open plus would be likely to
provide benefits compared with current practice for a small group of people with
disease of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.
Benefits would be conferred by eliminating the need for a second procedure and
the associated risk of serious complications. Patients would need to be selected
carefully based on the extent of their thoracic aortic disease.
6.2 The committee recognised that some people for whom treatment with the E-vita
open plus would be suitable would have progressive aortic disease needing
reintervention in the future, regardless of the method of repair used initially. This
would be significantly more likely in people with connective tissue disorders such
as Marfan's syndrome than in those with atherosclerotic conditions.
6.3 The committee concluded that using the E-vita open plus in the NHS was likely to
save money compared with current standard practice in the longer term, from
about 2 years after the intervention.
