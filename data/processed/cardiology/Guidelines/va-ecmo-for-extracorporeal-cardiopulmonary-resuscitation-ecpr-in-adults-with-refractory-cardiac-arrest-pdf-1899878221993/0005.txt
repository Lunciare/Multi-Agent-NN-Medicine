as the lack of return of spontaneous circulation after 30 minutes of appropriate CPR, in the absence of hypothermia. Current practice 3.2 Treatment for cardiac arrest includes immediate CPR to restore the circulation and prevent subsequent brain injury. Defibrillation may be used to treat ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia rhythms.

Resuscitation Council UK's 2021 resuscitation guidelines contain guidance on basic and advanced life support.

Data from NHS England indicates that the ambulance service responds to around 40,000 people needing resuscitation each year. The evidence 3.4 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and a detailed review of the evidence from 13 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 9 systematic reviews, 1 long-term randomised controlled trial follow-up study, 2 retrospective registry studies, and 1 single-centre retrospective study. It is presented in the summary of key evidence section in the interventional procedures overview. Other
