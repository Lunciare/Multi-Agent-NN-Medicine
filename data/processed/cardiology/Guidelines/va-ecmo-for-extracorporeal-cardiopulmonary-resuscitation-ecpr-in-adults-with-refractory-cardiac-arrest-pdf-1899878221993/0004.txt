to help people when conventional CPR does not work. The goal of ECPR is to restore circulation and gas exchange, and to allow time for other interventions. 2.2 In VA ECMO, blood is taken from the venous system (usually from the femoral vein or the right atrium) and pumped through an oxygenator, where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. It is then returned to the arterial system, usually through the femoral or axillary artery, or the ascending aorta. People are usually given a continuous infusion of an anticoagulant, usually heparin, to prevent blood clotting in the extracorporeal system. ECPR is used when conventional CPR is unable to restore spontaneous circulation. 3 Committee discussion The condition 3.1 Cardiac arrest is when normal blood circulation suddenly stops because the heart does not contract effectively. The underlying abnormal cardiac rhythms most associated with cardiac arrest are ventricular fibrillation, asystole, pulseless electrical activity, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac arrest leads to loss of consciousness, respiratory failure and, ultimately, death. Refractory cardiac arrest is defined as the lack of return of spontaneous circulation after 30 minutes of appropriate CPR, in the absence of hypothermia. Current practice 3.2 Treatment for cardiac arrest includes immediate CPR to
