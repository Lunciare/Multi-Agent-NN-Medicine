For refractory cardiac arrest with a non-shockable heart rhythm or irreversible causes 1.2 More research is needed on VA ECMO for ECPR to manage in-hospital and out- of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest in adults with a non-shockable heart rhythm or irreversible causes, before it can be used in the NHS. 1.3 This procedure should only be done as part of formal research and an NHS research ethics committee needs to have approved its use.

Healthcare professionals should discuss the available options with the person with refractory cardiac arrest (and their family members and carers as appropriate) before a joint decision is made, if possible (see NICE's
