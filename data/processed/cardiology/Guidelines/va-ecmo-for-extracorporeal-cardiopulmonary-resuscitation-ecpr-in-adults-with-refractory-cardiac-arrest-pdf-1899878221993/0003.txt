team. The procedure should only be done in centres specialising in using VA ECMO for ECPR for refractory cardiac arrest and by healthcare professionals with specific training in this procedure. What research is needed More research is needed on: • patient selection • survival • neurological outcomes • timing of the intervention. Why the committee made these recommendations Clinical trial evidence suggests that, compared with conventional CPR, using VA ECMO for ECPR improves the likelihood of surviving with good brain function in adults with refractory cardiac arrest with a shockable heart rhythm or reversible causes. So, it can be used for this group. Clinical trial evidence is inconsistent for VA ECMO for ECPR in adults with refractory cardiac arrest with a non-shockable heart rhythm or irreversible causes. So, it is uncertain who in this group could benefit from this intervention, and more research is needed. 2 Information about the procedure 2.1 Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a type of CPR that uses a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) machine to help people when conventional CPR does not work. The goal of ECPR is to restore circulation and gas exchange, and to allow time for other interventions. 2.2 In VA
