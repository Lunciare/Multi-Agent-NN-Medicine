type of TAH, power is supplied either by drive lines connected percutaneously to an external biventricular pneumatic pump (which may be portable or static) or by batteries that are implanted internally and can be recharged through the skin using a transcutaneous energy transfer system. When the device begins to pump and restores blood flow around the body, cardiopulmonary bypass is stopped and the chest incision is closed. 4 Efficacy This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview. 4.1 In a non-randomised prospective comparative study of patients at risk of imminent death from irreversible biventricular heart failure, total artificial heart (TAH) implantation (n=81) was compared with no TAH implantation (matched historical controls; n=35). The rates of survival to heart transplantation were 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68% to 87%) in the TAH group compared with 46% in the control group (p<0.001). The 1-year survival to heart transplantation rates were 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%) and 31% respectively (p<0.001). In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study (United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] database analysis) comparing TAH support
