artery, 2 spleen, 1 superior mesenteric artery, 2 kidney, 2 retina) were reported in 8% (8/101) of patients, 4 of whom died. Strokes rates were not significantly different between the TAH and BIVAD groups during support in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 148 patients (TAH 12% [9/81] compared with BIVAD 24% [16/67]; p=0.08). Strokes were reported in 10% (9/90) of patients while on device support in the case series of 90 patients with TAH implantation. Thromboembolic events (at a median time of 500 days) were reported in 19% (9/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year; 6 had a transient ischaemic attack and 3 had a major cerebrovascular accident with hemiparesis or aphasia. 5.7 Technical or procedural problems (obstruction of the mechanical tricuspid valve of the TAH because of migration of the central venous catheter) were reported in 3% (3/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. This caused death in 1 patient. Catheter entrapment of a central line in the tricuspid valve was reported in 2 patients in the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation. Both these patients
