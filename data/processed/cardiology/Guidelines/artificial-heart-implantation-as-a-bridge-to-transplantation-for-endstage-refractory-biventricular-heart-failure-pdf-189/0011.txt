21 days. Two patients died from bleeding: 1 during TAH implantation and 1 during heart transplantation). Bleeding (from various sites) at a mean of 4 days was reported in 43% (43/101) of patients in the case series of 101 patients. Reoperations for haemorrhage (mediastinal explorations) were done in 25% (25/101) of patients. The surgical revision rate for bleeding or haematoma was significantly lower in the TAH group than the BIVAD group in the non-randomised comparative study (23% [17/81] compared with 42% [28/67] respectively; p=0.03). Surgical re- exploration for bleeding, haematoma or infection was reported in 39% (35/90) of patients while on device support in the case series of 90 patients. Haemorrhagic events (at a median time of 249 days) were reported in 14% (7/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year. These included cerebral haemorrhage (n=3), subarachnoid haemorrhage (n=2), and gastrointestinal bleeding (n=2). 5.3 Device malfunction events were reported in 17% (16/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. One patient died because of perforation in 1 of the layers of the device's left ventricular diaphragm on day 124. Fitting complications were
