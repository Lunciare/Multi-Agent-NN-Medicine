Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory

1 patient. Catheter entrapment of a central line in the tricuspid valve was reported in 2 patients in the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation. Both these patients had irreversible brain damage from device arrest and died. 5.8 In addition to safety outcomes reported in the literature, specialist advisers are asked about anecdotal adverse events (events which they have heard about) and about theoretical adverse events (events which they think might possibly occur, even if they have never done so). For this procedure, specialist advisers did not describe any anecdotal or theoretical adverse events. 6 Further information 6.1 Patient commentary was sought but none was received. 6.2 This guidance requires that clinicians doing the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed NICE's interventional procedure outcomes audit tool (which is for use at local discretion).
