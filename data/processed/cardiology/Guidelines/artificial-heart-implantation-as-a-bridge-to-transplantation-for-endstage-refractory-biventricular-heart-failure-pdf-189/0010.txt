Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory

pulmonary oedema (1). In the same group after transplantation, there were 6 deaths (3 graft failure, 1 sepsis, 1 procedural or technical complication and 1 multi-organ failure). Rates of deaths in a non- randomised retrospective comparative study of 148 patients were not significantly different between TAH and BIVAD support groups while on support (37% compared with 39%; p=0.87). Death occurred in 32% (32/101) of patients in a case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation; 70% were within the first 14 days. Causes of deaths were multi-organ failure (13), pneumonia or pulmonary oedema (6), sepsis (5), neurologic injury (4, including 1 stroke, 1 hypoxic damage from hypotension and 2 intracranial haemorrhage), pancreatic abscess (1), small intestinal ischaemia (1), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (1), and disseminated coccidiodomycosis (1). 5.2 Bleeding events were reported in 62% (59/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Of these events, 50% occurred during TAH implantation and were mainly tamponade or mediastinal bleeding (needing surgery and blood transfusion) within 21 days. Two patients died from bleeding: 1 during TAH implantation and 1 during heart transplantation). Bleeding (from various sites) at a mean of 4 days was reported in 43%
