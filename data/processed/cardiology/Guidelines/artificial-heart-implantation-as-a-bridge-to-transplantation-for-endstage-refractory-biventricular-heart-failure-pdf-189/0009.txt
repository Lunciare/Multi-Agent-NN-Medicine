of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview. 5.1 In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study of 578 patients (United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] database analysis), rates of deaths were not significantly different between total artificial heart (TAH) and biventricular assisted device (BIVAD) groups: 10% (22/212) compared with 12% (45/366), p=0.7 while on support; and 30% (64/212) compared with 30% (111/366), p=0.9 after transplantation. The causes of death while on device support (infection, multi-organ failure, stroke or haemorrhage) and after heart transplantation (acute rejection, infection, cardiac arrest, multi-organ failure and stroke) for both groups were also similar. In a non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients, rates of death before transplantation were 21% (17/81) in the TAH group compared with 54% (19/35) in the control group (p value not reported). Causes of the 17 deaths before transplantation in the TAH group were multi- organ failure (7), procedural or technical complications (4), bleeding (2), sepsis (2), congestive heart failure (1) and pulmonary oedema (1). In the same group after transplantation, there were 6 deaths (3 graft failure, 1 sepsis, 1 procedural or technical complication and 1 multi-organ failure). Rates of deaths
