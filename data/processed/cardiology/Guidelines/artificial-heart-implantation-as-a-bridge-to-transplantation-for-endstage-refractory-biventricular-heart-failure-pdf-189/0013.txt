triggering was caused by auricular compression during some movements (stretching and yawning) and the patient was advised to avoid them. 5.4 The renal failure rate was significantly higher in the TAH support group than the BIVAD support group after implantation (24% [52/212] compared with 10% [35/ 366]; p<0.0001) and after transplantation (26% [56/212] compared with 14% [49/ 366]; p=0.0001) in the non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS database analysis). Renal failure (needing postoperative renal replacement therapy) was reported in 64% (30/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year. Recovery of renal function occurred in 73% (22/47) of patients but therapy continued in 17% (8/47) of patients. 5.5 The infection rate after implantation was significantly lower in the TAH group than the BIVAD group (22% [46/212] compared with 28% [104/366]; p=0.005) in the non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS database analysis). Infections (7 blood, 50 respiratory, 5 mediastinal, 28 genitourinary, 12 gastrointestinal, 17 driveline and 6 in catheters) were reported in 77% (73/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Infections contributed to death in 7 patients and delayed transplantation in 5 patients. Infections (commonly
