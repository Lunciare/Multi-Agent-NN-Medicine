KEYWORDS: patients, tah, heart, transplantation, implantation, failure, comparative, reported, study, group, comparative study, non-randomised, compared, patients tah, support

the non-randomised comparative study of 148 patients, survival rates after transplantation in the TAH group (n=51) and the paracorporeal BIVAD group (n=39) were similar (p=0.60): 77% compared with 76% at 1year; 72% compared with 70% at 3 years; and 70% compared with 58% at 5 years. In the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation, survival after transplantation at 1, 5 and 10 years was 77%, 61% and 41% respectively. In the case series of 90 patients with TAH implantation, actuarial survival rates after transplantation were 78±6%, 71±6% and 63±8% at 1, 5 and 8 years respectively. In the case series of 27 patients with TAH implantation, survival after transplantation (n=12) at a median 20-month follow-up was 91%. 4.3 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients who had TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), the overall survival rate at 1 year was 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%) and 31% respectively (p<0.001). In the case series of 101 patients with TAH implantation, the overall survival at 1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 55% (n=56), 43% (n=35), 28% (n=18), and 26% (n=3) respectively. 4.4 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients with TAH implantation (n=81)
