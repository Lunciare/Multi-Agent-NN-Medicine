transplantation rates were 70% (95% CI 63% to 77%) and 31% respectively (p<0.001). In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study (United Network of Organ Sharing [UNOS] database analysis) comparing TAH support (n=212) with biventricular assisted device (BIVAD) support (n=366) as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) in adult patients, device support survival rates were similar in both groups (p=0.8): 95% compared with 93% at 30 days and 77% compared with 69% at 1 year. In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study comparing TAH support (n=81) with paracorporeal BIVAD support (n=67) as a BTT in 148 adult patients, device support survival rates were similar between the groups (p=0.87): 76% compared with 72% at 30 days; 63% compared with 61% at 2 months; and 46% compared with 53% at 6 months respectively. In a case series of 101 patients at risk of imminent death from irreversible biventricular heart failure and eligible for transplant, survival to heart transplantation with TAH implantation as a BTT was 68% (69/101). In a case series of 90 patients with biventricular failure treated by TAH implantation as a BTT, actuarial survival on device was 74±5%, 63±6% and 47±8% at 30, 60 and 180 days after implantation respectively.
