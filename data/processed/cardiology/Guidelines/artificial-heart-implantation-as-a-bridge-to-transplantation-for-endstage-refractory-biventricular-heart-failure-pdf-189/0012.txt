non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. One patient died because of perforation in 1 of the layers of the device's left ventricular diaphragm on day 124. Fitting complications were reported in 5% (5/ 95) of patients in the TAH group in the same study; 2 patients died because of poor fitting and 3 patients had repeat surgery to reposition the device. Device failure was reported in 10% (5/47) of patients in the case series of 47 patients with TAH support for more than 1 year; there were 3 membrane ruptures (2 patients died), 1 air hole in the driveline and 1 lower pump output. Device malfunction (technical problems with the alarm and computer monitoring system needing console change) was reported in 1 patient during hospitalisation in the case series of 27 patients. Malfunctions were reported in 25% (3/12) of patients discharged home after TAH implantation. In 2 patients, an air leak occurred in the driveline to the ventricle, which was sealed with a silicon band. In 1 patient, alarm triggering was caused by auricular compression during some movements (stretching and yawning) and the patient was advised to avoid them. 5.4 The renal failure rate was significantly higher in the
