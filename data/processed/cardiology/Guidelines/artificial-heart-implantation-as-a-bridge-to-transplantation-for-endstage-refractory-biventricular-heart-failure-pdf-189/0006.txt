Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory

failure treated by TAH implantation as a BTT, actuarial survival on device was 74±5%, 63±6% and 47±8% at 30, 60 and 180 days after implantation respectively. In a case series of 27 patients with TAH implantation as a BTT, 44% (12/27) of patients were discharged from hospital within a median of 88 days after implantation (range 35 to 152 days). Support time between discharge and transplantation was spent out of hospital in 87% of patients. 4.2 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients with TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), the survival rates at 1 and 5 years after transplantation in the TAH group were 86% and 64% compared with 69% and 34% in the control group respectively (p values not reported). In the non-randomised retrospective comparative study (UNOS database analysis) comparing TAH support with BIVAD support, survival rates after transplantation were 88% compared with 93% at 30 days, 78% compared with 83% at 1 year, and 67% compared with 73% at 3 years respectively (p=0.06). In the non-randomised comparative study of 148 patients, survival rates after transplantation in the TAH group (n=51) and the paracorporeal BIVAD group (n=39) were similar (p=0.60): 77% compared with 76% at
