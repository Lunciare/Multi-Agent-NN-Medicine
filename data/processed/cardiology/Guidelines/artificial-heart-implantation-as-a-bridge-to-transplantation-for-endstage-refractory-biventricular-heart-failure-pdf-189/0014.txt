Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory

of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Infections contributed to death in 7 patients and delayed transplantation in 5 patients. Infections (commonly in the lungs and urinary tract) were reported in 64% (64/101) of patients in the case series of 101 patients. Rates of postoperative mediastinitis (TAH 12% [9/81] compared with BIVAD 5% [3/67]; p=0.14) or driveline infections (1 patient with TAH compared with 2 patients with BIVAD; p=0.61) were similar in both groups during support in the non-randomised comparative study of 148 patients. 5.6 Neurologic events (10 stroke, 4 transient ischaemic attack, 5 anoxic encephalopathy, 1 metabolic encephalopathy, 4 seizure and 1 syncope) were reported in 27% (26/95) of patients in the TAH group in the non-randomised prospective comparative study of 130 patients. Transplantation was delayed in 6 patients. Neurologic events were reported in 16% (16/101) of patients in the case series of 101 patients. Strokes were reported in 8% (8/101) of patients (5 within 9 days). Peripheral emboli (1 celiac artery, 2 spleen, 1 superior mesenteric artery, 2 kidney, 2 retina) were reported in 8% (8/101) of patients, 4 of whom died. Strokes rates were not significantly different between the
