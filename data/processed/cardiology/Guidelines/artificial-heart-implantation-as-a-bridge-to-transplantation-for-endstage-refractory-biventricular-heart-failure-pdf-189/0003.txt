include reduced exercise tolerance, fatigue and malaise. 2.2 Medical treatment of heart failure involves drugs, such as diuretics and inotropic agents, to improve heart function. Invasive therapies, such as electrophysiological interventions, coronary revascularisation, valve replacement or repair, may also be used for patients with end-stage refractory biventricular heart failure. When these therapies no longer work, left ventricular or biventricular assist devices or heart transplantation may be considered. 3 The procedure 3.1 A total artificial heart (TAH) can be implanted to provide circulatory support with the aim that the patient survives while waiting for a donor heart to become available (a technique known as 'bridge to transplantation'). In this procedure, the device replaces the heart function completely. 3.2 Implantation of a TAH is done with the patient under general anaesthesia and on cardiopulmonary bypass. The native left and right ventricles, and all 4 cardiac valves are excised. The TAH device is implanted and attached to the atria, for blood inflow, and pulmonary artery and aorta, for blood outflow. Depending on the type of TAH, power is supplied either by drive lines connected percutaneously to an external biventricular pneumatic pump (which may be portable or static) or by batteries that are implanted
