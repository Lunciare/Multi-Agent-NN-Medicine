Artificial heart implantation as a bridge to transplantation for end-stage refractory

1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 55% (n=56), 43% (n=35), 28% (n=18), and 26% (n=3) respectively. 4.4 In the non-randomised prospective comparative study comparing patients with TAH implantation (n=81) with matched historical controls (n=35), quality of life in the TAH group improved significantly: 75% of patients were out of bed 1 week after implantation and mobility (defined as ability to walk more than 100 feet) was seen in 61% of patients (method of measurement not reported). In the case series of 27 patients with TAH implantation, the quality of life results for 12 patients at home (measured using a modified ED-5D defined by INTERMACS) showed that only 1 young patient was able to return to school. Patients and families reported the console's noise as bothersome. 4.5 The specialist advisers listed the key efficacy outcomes as survival to hospital discharge, survival and successful BTT at 6 and 12 months, and survival after transplantation. 5 Safety This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the interventional procedure overview. 5.1 In a non-randomised retrospective comparative study of 578 patients (United Network
