1 Recommendations 1.1 Evidence on the efficacy of bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease is inadequate. Evidence on its safety has shown an increased risk of serious complications in the longer term. This includes an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death with some types of bioresorbable stents. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Clinicians should enter details about everyone having bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease into the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research's National Audit of Percutaneous Coronary Interventions. Contact nicor.auditenquiries@nhs.net for details. 1.3 Further research should include randomised controlled trials reporting details of patient selection and choice of bioresorbable stent. It should also include long- term outcomes. Bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease (IPG732) 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Stenosis of the coronary arteries is usually caused by deposition of atherosclerotic plaque. This reduces blood flow to the heart muscle and is usually progressive. Symptoms of coronary artery disease typically include angina (chest pain that is exacerbated by exertion). A critical reduction of the blood
