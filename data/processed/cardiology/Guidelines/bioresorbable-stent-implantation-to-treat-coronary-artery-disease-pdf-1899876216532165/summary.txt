1 Recommendations 1.1 Evidence on the efficacy of bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease is inadequate. Evidence on its safety has shown an increased risk of serious complications in the longer term. This includes an increased risk of myocardial infarction and death with some types of bioresorbable stents. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Clinicians should enter details about everyone having bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease into the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research's National Audit of Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.
