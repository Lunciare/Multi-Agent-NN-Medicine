Bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease

local anaesthesia. A guidewire is passed into the target coronary artery, usually from the radial or femoral artery under fluoroscopic image guidance. A balloon angioplasty catheter passed over the Bioresorbable stent implantation to treat coronary artery disease (IPG732) guidewire is used to dilate the coronary artery stenosis. A bioresorbable stent mounted on a balloon catheter is passed over the guide wire into the relevant segment of the artery. Then, it is expanded by inflation of the balloon inside it. The balloon is then deflated and removed with the guide wire. The stent acts as a scaffold to hold the vessel open. Additional imaging, such as intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, is sometimes used to guide the procedure. This is to optimise positioning and deployment of the stent in the target coronary artery. 2.6 Bioresorbable stents are absorbed over time. Most bioresorbable stents are also drug-eluting, with a view to reducing the risk of restenosis. Antiplatelet medicines such as aspirin and clopidogrel are usually prescribed for at least 6 months after the procedure. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive
