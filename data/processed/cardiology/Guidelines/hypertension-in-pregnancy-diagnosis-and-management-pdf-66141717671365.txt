Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
This guideline replaces CG107.
This guideline is the basis of QS35.
Overview
This guideline covers diagnosing and managing hypertension (high blood pressure),
including pre-eclampsia, during pregnancy, labour and birth. It also includes advice for
women with hypertension who wish to conceive and women who have had a pregnancy
complicated by hypertension. It aims to improve care during pregnancy, labour and birth
for women and their babies.
We've created a series of visual summaries to explain assessment, treatment and other
aspects of care for various conditions relating to hypertension in pregnancy.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Women who develop hypertension during pregnancy, who have hypertension and wish
to conceive, and who have had a pregnancy complicated by hypertension, and their
relatives and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Reducing the risk of hypertensive disorders in
pregnancy
Symptoms of pre-eclampsia
1.1.1 Advise pregnant women to see a healthcare professional immediately if they
experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Symptoms include:
• severe headache
• problems with vision, such as blurring or flashing before the eyes
• severe pain just below the ribs
• vomiting
• sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet.
See the NICE guideline on antenatal care for advice on risk factors and
symptoms of pre-eclampsia. [2010, amended 2019]

Antiplatelet agents
For the indication in recommendations 1.1.2 and 1.1.3, although its use is common in
UK clinical practice, at the time of publication (June 2019), aspirin did not have a UK
marketing authorisation. Community pharmacies cannot legally sell aspirin as a
pharmacy medicine for prevention of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy in England. Aspirin
for this indication must be prescribed. The prescriber should see the summary of
product characteristics for the manufacturer's advice on use in pregnancy. See
NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.1.2 Advise pregnant women at high risk of pre-eclampsia to take 75 mg to 150 mg of
aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the baby. Women at high risk are
those with any of the following:
• hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy
• chronic kidney disease
• autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or
antiphospholipid syndrome
• type 1 or type 2 diabetes
• chronic hypertension. [2010, amended 2019]
1.1.3 Advise pregnant women with more than 1 moderate risk factor for pre-eclampsia
to take 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the baby.
Factors indicating moderate risk are:
• nulliparity
• age 40 years or older
• pregnancy interval of more than 10 years
• body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m2 or more at first visit
• family history of pre-eclampsia
• multi-fetal pregnancy. [2010, amended 2019]

Other pharmaceutical agents
1.1.4 Do not use the following to prevent hypertensive disorders during pregnancy:
• nitric oxide donors
• progesterone
• diuretics
• low molecular weight heparin. [2010]
Nutritional supplements
1.1.5 Do not recommend the following supplements solely with the aim of preventing
hypertensive disorders during pregnancy:
• magnesium
• folic acid
• antioxidants (vitamins C and E)
• fish oils or algal oils
• garlic. [2010]
Diet
1.1.6 Do not recommend salt restriction during pregnancy solely to prevent gestational
hypertension or pre-eclampsia. [2010]
Lifestyle
1.1.7 Give the same advice on rest, exercise and work to women with chronic
hypertension or at risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy as healthy
pregnant women. See the NICE guideline on antenatal care. [2010, amended

Diabetes
1.1.8 For women with pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes, see the NICE
guideline on diabetes in pregnancy. [2019]
1.2 Assessment of proteinuria in hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy
1.2.1 Interpret proteinuria measurements for pregnant women in the context of a full
clinical review of symptoms, signs and other investigations for pre-eclampsia.
[2019]
1.2.2 Use an automated reagent-strip reading device for dipstick screening for
proteinuria in pregnant women in secondary care settings. [2019]
1.2.3 If dipstick screening is positive (1+ or more), use albumin:creatinine ratio or
protein:creatinine ratio to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women. [2019]
1.2.4 Do not use first morning urine void to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women.
[2019]
1.2.5 Do not routinely use 24-hour urine collection to quantify proteinuria in pregnant
women. [2019]
1.2.6 If using protein:creatinine ratio to quantify proteinuria in pregnant women:
• use 30 mg/mmol as a threshold for significant proteinuria
• if the result is 30 mg/mmol or above and there is still uncertainty about the
diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re-testing on a new sample, alongside
clinical review. [2019]
1.2.7 If using albumin:creatinine ratio as an alternative to protein:creatinine ratio to

diagnose pre-eclampsia in pregnant women with hypertension:
• use 8 mg/mmol as a diagnostic threshold
• if the result is 8 mg/mmol or above and there is still uncertainty about the
diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re-testing on a new sample, alongside
clinical review. [2019]
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on assessment
of proteinuria.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G:
assessment of proteinuria.
1.3 Management of chronic hypertension in
pregnancy
Pre-pregnancy advice
1.3.1 Offer women with chronic hypertension referral to a specialist in hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment. [2010,
amended 2019]
1.3.2 Advise women who take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs):
• that there is an increased risk of congenital abnormalities if these drugs are
taken during pregnancy
• to discuss alternative antihypertensive treatment with the healthcare
professional responsible for managing their hypertension, if they are planning
pregnancy
• to discuss alternative treatment with the healthcare professional responsible
for managing their condition, if ACE inhibitors or ARBs are being taken for

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
other conditions such as renal disease. [2010, amended 2019]
In 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
issued a drug safety update on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
antagonists: not for use in pregnancy, which states 'Use in women who are
planning pregnancy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, in which
case the potential risks and benefits should be discussed'.
1.3.3 Stop antihypertensive treatment in women taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs if they
become pregnant (preferably within 2 working days of notification of pregnancy)
and offer alternatives. [2010]
1.3.4 Advise women who take thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics:
• that there may be an increased risk of congenital abnormalities and neonatal
complications if these drugs are taken during pregnancy
• to discuss alternative antihypertensive treatment with the healthcare
professional responsible for managing their hypertension, if they are planning
pregnancy. [2010, amended 2019]
1.3.5 Advise women who take antihypertensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics that the limited evidence available has
not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such treatments.
[2010, amended 2019]
Treatment of chronic hypertension
1.3.6 Offer pregnant women with chronic hypertension advice on:
• weight management
• exercise
• healthy eating
• lowering the amount of salt in their diet.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 61
--- Страница 12 ---
Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Provide this advice in line with the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults.
[2019]
1.3.7 Continue with existing antihypertensive treatment if safe in pregnancy, or switch
to an alternative treatment, unless:
• sustained systolic blood pressure is less than 110 mmHg or
• sustained diastolic blood pressure is less than 70 mmHg or
• the woman has symptomatic hypotension. [2019]
1.3.8 Offer antihypertensive treatment to pregnant women who have chronic
hypertension and who are not already on treatment if they have:
• sustained systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher or
• sustained diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher. [2019]
1.3.9 When using medicines to treat hypertension in pregnancy, aim for a target blood
pressure of 135/85 mmHg. [2019]
1.3.10 Consider labetalol to treat chronic hypertension in pregnant women. Consider
nifedipine for women in whom labetalol is not suitable, or methyldopa if both
labetalol and nifedipine are not suitable. Base the choice on any pre-existing
treatment, side-effect profiles, risks (including fetal effects) and the woman's
preference. [2019]
At the time of publication (June 2019), some brands of nifedipine were
specifically contraindicated during pregnancy by the manufacturer in its summary
of product characteristics. Refer to the individual summaries of product
characteristics for each preparation of nifedipine for further details. See NICE's
information on prescribing medicines.
1.3.11 Offer pregnant women with chronic hypertension aspirin 75 mg to 150 mg once
daily from 12 weeks. [2019]
Although its use is common in UK clinical practice, at the time of publication
(June 2019), aspirin did not have a UK marketing authorisation for this indication.

must be prescribed. The prescriber should see the summary of product
characteristics for the manufacturer's advice on use in pregnancy. See NICE's
information on prescribing medicines.
1.3.12 Offer placental growth factor (PLGF)-based testing to help rule out pre-eclampsia
between 20 weeks and 36 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy, if women with
chronic hypertension are suspected of developing pre-eclampsia. (See the NICE
diagnostics guidance on PLGF-based testing to help diagnose suspected preterm
pre-eclampsia). [2019, amended 2023]

Antenatal appointments
1.3.13 In women with chronic hypertension, schedule additional antenatal appointments
based on the individual needs of the woman and her baby. This may include:
• weekly appointments if hypertension is poorly controlled
• appointments every 2 to 4 weeks if hypertension is well-controlled. [2010,
amended 2019]
Timing of birth
1.3.14 Do not offer planned early birth before 37 weeks to women with chronic
hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/110 mmHg, with or without
antihypertensive treatment, unless there are other medical indications. [2010,

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
1.3.15 For women with chronic hypertension whose blood pressure is lower than 160/
110 mmHg after 37 weeks, with or without antihypertensive treatment, timing of
birth and maternal and fetal indications for birth should be agreed between the
woman and the senior obstetrician. [2010]
1.3.16 If planned early birth is necessary (see recommendation 1.5.7 in the section on
timing of birth), offer a course of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium
sulfate if indicated, in line with the NICE guideline on preterm labour and birth.
[2010, amended 2019]
Postnatal investigation, monitoring and treatment
1.3.17 In women with chronic hypertension who have given birth, measure blood
pressure:
• daily for the first 2 days after birth
• at least once between day 3 and day 5 after birth
• as clinically indicated if antihypertensive treatment is changed after birth.
[2010]
1.3.18 In women with chronic hypertension who have given birth:
• aim to keep blood pressure lower than 140/90 mmHg
• continue antihypertensive treatment, if required (for choice of
antihypertensive during the postnatal period, see the section on
antihypertensive treatment during the postnatal period, including during
breastfeeding)
• offer a review of antihypertensive treatment 2 weeks after the birth, with
their GP or specialist. [2010, amended 2019]

1.3.20 Offer women with chronic hypertension a medical review 6 to 8 weeks after the
birth with their GP or specialist as appropriate. [2010, amended 2019]
1.4 Management of gestational hypertension
Assessment and treatment of gestational hypertension
1.4.1 In women with gestational hypertension, a full assessment should be carried out
in a secondary care setting by a healthcare professional who is trained in the
management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. [2010, amended 2019]
1.4.2 In women with gestational hypertension, take account of the following risk
factors that require additional assessment and follow-up:
• nulliparity
• age 40 years or older
• pregnancy interval of more than 10 years

－ rise in alanine transaminase (over 70 IU/litre, or twice upper limit of
normal range) or
－ fall in platelet count (under 150,000/microlitre)
• signs of impending eclampsia
• signs of impending pulmonary oedema
• other signs of severe pre-eclampsia
• suspected fetal compromise
• any other clinical signs that cause concern. [2019]
1.5.3 Consider using either the fullPIERS or PREP-S validated risk prediction models to
help guide decisions about the most appropriate place of care (such as the need
for in utero transfer) and thresholds for intervention. [2019]
1.5.4 When using a risk prediction model, take into account that:
• fullPIERS is intended for use at any time during pregnancy
• PREP-S is intended for use only up to 34 weeks of pregnancy
• fullPIERS and PREP-S models do not predict outcomes for babies. [2019]

• progressive deterioration in liver function, renal function, haemolysis, or
platelet count
• ongoing neurological features, such as severe intractable headache, repeated
visual scotomata, or eclampsia
• placental abruption
• reversed end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery doppler velocimetry, a non-
reassuring cardiotocograph, or stillbirth.
Other features not listed above may also be considered in the decision to
plan early birth. [2019]
Be aware that some pulse oximeters can underestimate or overestimate
oxygen saturation levels, especially if the saturation level is borderline.
Overestimation has been reported in people with dark skin. See also the NHS
England Patient Safety Alert on the risk of harm from inappropriate
placement of pulse oximeter probes.

setting
Anticonvulsants
1.8.1 If a woman in a critical care setting who has severe hypertension or severe pre-
eclampsia has or previously had an eclamptic fit, give intravenous magnesium
sulfate. [2010]
1.8.2 Consider giving intravenous magnesium sulfate to women with severe pre-
eclampsia who are in a critical care setting if birth is planned within 24 hours.
[2010]
1.8.3 Consider the need for magnesium sulfate treatment, if 1 or more of the following
features of severe pre-eclampsia is present:
• ongoing or recurring severe headaches
• visual scotomata

The MHRA has issued a warning about the risk of skeletal adverse effects in
the neonate following prolonged or repeated use of magnesium sulfate in
pregnancy. Maternal administration of magnesium sulfate for longer than 5 to
7 days in pregnancy has been associated with skeletal adverse effects and
hypocalcaemia and hypermagnesemia in neonates. If use of magnesium
sulfate in pregnancy is prolonged or repeated, consider monitoring of
neonates for abnormal calcium and magnesium levels and skeletal adverse
effects.
1.8.5 Do not use diazepam, phenytoin or other anticonvulsants as an alternative to
magnesium sulfate in women with eclampsia. [2010, amended 2019]
Antihypertensives
1.8.6 Treat women with severe hypertension who are in critical care during pregnancy
or after birth immediately with 1 of the following:
• labetalol (oral or intravenous)
• oral nifedipine
• intravenous hydralazine. [2010, amended 2019]
At the time of publication (June 2019), some brands of nifedipine were
specifically contraindicated during pregnancy by the manufacturer in its
summary of product characteristics. Refer to the individual summaries of
product characteristics for each preparation of nifedipine for further details.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.8.7 In women with severe hypertension who are in critical care, monitor their
response to treatment:
• to ensure that their blood pressure falls
• to identify adverse effects for both the woman and the baby
• to modify treatment according to response. [2010]

first dose of intravenous hydralazine in the antenatal period. [2010]
Corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation
1.8.9 If early birth is considered likely within 7 days in women with pre-eclampsia, offer
a course of antenatal corticosteroids in line with the NICE guideline on preterm
labour and birth. [2010, amended 2019]
Corticosteroids to manage HELLP syndrome
1.8.10 Do not use dexamethasone or betamethasone for the treatment of HELLP
syndrome. [2010]
Fluid balance and volume expansion
1.8.11 Do not use volume expansion in women with severe pre-eclampsia unless
hydralazine is the antenatal antihypertensive. [2010]
1.8.12 In women with severe pre-eclampsia, limit maintenance fluids to 80 ml/hour
unless there are other ongoing fluid losses (for example, haemorrhage). [2010]

1.9 Antihypertensive treatment during the
postnatal period, including during breastfeeding
For the indications in recommendations 1.9.4, 1.9.6 and 1.9.8, in 2009, the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a drug safety update on
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists: recommendations on how to
use during breastfeeding, and a subsequent clarification was issued in 2014 stating
that 'although ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are generally not
recommended for use by breastfeeding mothers, they are not absolutely
contraindicated. Healthcare professionals may prescribe these medicines during
breastfeeding if they consider that this treatment is essential for the lactating mother.
In mothers who are breastfeeding older infants, the use of captopril, enalapril, or
quinapril may be considered if an ACE inhibitor is necessary for the mother. Careful
follow-up of the infant for possible signs of hypotension is recommended'.
For the indications in recommendations 1.9.5 and 1.9.6, at the time of publication
(June 2019), some brands of nifedipine were specifically contraindicated during
pregnancy by the manufacturer in its summary of product characteristics. Refer to
the individual summaries of product characteristics for each preparation of nifedipine
for further details.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
1.9.1 Advise women with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that their treatment can
be adapted to accommodate breastfeeding, and that the need to take
antihypertensive medication does not prevent them from breastfeeding. [2019]
1.9.2 Explain to women with hypertension who wish to breastfeed that:
• antihypertensive medicines can pass into breast milk
• most antihypertensive medicines taken while breastfeeding only lead to very
low levels in breast milk, so the amounts taken in by babies are very small
and would be unlikely to have any clinical effect
• most medicines are not tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women, so

disclaimers in the manufacturer's information are not because of any specific
safety concerns or evidence of harm.
Make decisions on treatment together with the woman, based on her
preferences. [2019]
1.9.3 As antihypertensive agents have the potential to transfer into breast milk:
• consider monitoring the blood pressure of babies, especially those born
preterm, who have symptoms of low blood pressure for the first few weeks
• when discharged home, advise women to monitor their babies for
drowsiness, lethargy, pallor, cold peripheries or poor feeding. [2019]
1.9.4 Offer enalapril to treat hypertension in women during the postnatal period, with
appropriate monitoring of maternal renal function and maternal serum potassium.
[2019]
1.9.5 For women of black African or Caribbean family origin with hypertension during
the postnatal period, consider antihypertensive treatment with:
• nifedipine or
• amlodipine if the woman has previously used this to successfully control her
blood pressure. [2019]
1.9.6 For women with hypertension in the postnatal period, if blood pressure is not
controlled with a single medicine, consider a combination of nifedipine (or
amlodipine) and enalapril. If this combination is not tolerated or is ineffective,
consider either:
• adding atenolol or labetalol to the combination treatment or
• swapping 1 of the medicines already being used for atenolol or labetalol.
[2019]
1.9.7 When treating women with antihypertensive medication during the postnatal
period, use medicines that are taken once daily when possible. [2019]

hypertension in women in the postnatal period who are breastfeeding or
expressing milk. [2010, amended 2019]
1.9.9 Treat women with hypertension in the postnatal period who are not breastfeeding
and who are not planning to breastfeed in line with the NICE guideline on

Increased risk is compared to the background risk in women who did not have
hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Absolute risks are not reported, because these
will vary considerably, depending on the follow-up time (range from 1 to 40 years
postpartum).
1.10.3 Advise women who have had a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy to discuss
how to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertensive
disorders, with their GP or specialist. This may include:
• avoiding smoking, as recommended in the NICE guideline on tobacco
• maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as recommended in the NICE guideline on

monitoring, the use of antihypertensives in breastfeeding and advice and follow-up. A
research recommendation from the 2010 guideline which was superseded by these new
research recommendations was deleted, and 3 research recommendations where research
was now underway or had been completed were also deleted.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect practice. They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the
committee's discussion.
Assessment of proteinuria
Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.7
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee were aware that there is often over-reliance on a proteinuria result in the
diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, and agreed that healthcare professionals should use the
results of a full clinical review, including severity of hypertension and other signs and
symptoms, before making a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.
The committee amended the recommendation on automated dipstick tests from the 2010
guideline to emphasise that this should be used as a screening tool for proteinuria. The
committee highlighted the importance of using automated dipstick analysis in secondary
care rather than visual analysis, which they were aware from their experience has a higher
error rate.
Protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) were both shown to have
high specificity and high sensitivity at the chosen thresholds (30 mg/mmol and 8 mg/mmol
respectively), and therefore either could be used depending on local availability. The
committee agreed that using both tests together did not have any additional diagnostic
benefit.
There was some evidence that using the first morning urine void in assessment of
proteinuria can lead to lower diagnostic accuracy, and so the committee recommended
against using this.
As PCR and ACR show very high diagnostic accuracy, they should be used in place of
24-hour urine collection, which is awkward for women and could delay identification of
proteinuria. However, there are rare occasions when it might be more appropriate to use

conditions#notice-of-rights). of 61
--- Страница 48 ---
Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
24-hour collection (for example, women with renal complications), and so the committee
agreed it should not be ruled out entirely.
There was good evidence that a PCR of 30 mg/mmol had good diagnostic accuracy,
showing high sensitivity and specificity and should be used as the threshold for significant
proteinuria. However, the committee recommended retesting for results above 30 mg/
mmol if there is still diagnostic uncertainty (for example, the woman has no other clinical
signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia) because there is large variation in protein excretion
during the day and from day to day. The committee agreed that this would prevent women
being diagnosed with pre-eclampsia on the basis of a single raised PCR result.
Evidence from a single study showed high sensitivity and specificity for an ACR result of
8 mg/mmol to diagnose proteinuria. However, the committee were also aware of further
results from a large, UK-based study, which provided further evidence for the efficacy of a
threshold of 8 mg/mmol in the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia. The committee were
aware that this threshold is different to that used for detection of microalbuminuria in the
non-pregnant population. However, they agreed that, on the basis of the evidence
reviewed, it was appropriate to use a threshold of 8 mg/mmol for pregnant women.
As with PCR, the committee were aware that women are sometimes diagnosed with pre-
eclampsia on the basis of a single raised ACR, and that this may lead to over-diagnosis.
Therefore, they made a recommendation to consider repeating the ACR measurement if
there was ongoing clinical uncertainty about the diagnosis.
No evidence was reviewed that examined the timing of repeat testing for either ACR or
PCR, and so no recommendations could be made regarding this.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendation to take account of other clinical features when assessing women for
suspected pre-eclampsia might lead to an increased need for follow-up and surveillance.
However, this will also reduce the chance that a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is missed by
raising awareness of the multi-system nature of the disease, and so could reduce the
number of women who go on to develop complications from undiagnosed pre-eclampsia.
Not all secondary care units currently use automated dipstick analysis to screen for
proteinuria, so the recommendations might increase the need for automated reagent-strip
reading devices. However, the accuracy and reliability of screening will be improved,

conditions#notice-of-rights). of 61
--- Страница 49 ---
Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
reducing the need for further investigations for some women and correctly identifying
more women who need further testing or investigations.
Moving from 24-hour urine collection to spot urine ACR or PCR will save time, with
potential for faster diagnosis, and a reduction in inaccuracies because of incomplete
samples. It is also likely to improve quality of life, as the process of completing a 24-hour
urine collection is time-consuming and awkward.
A PCR of 30 mg/mmol is already used routinely as a diagnostic threshold and therefore
should not change practice. Currently units may use different ACR levels for diagnosis and
so the recommendation to use 8 mg/mmol will standardise practice.
Recommendations have been made for the use of either ACR or PCR allowing local
decisions to use whichever test is available, so this should not affect practice.
Repeating the PCR or ACR test may incur a small additional cost. However, this should
reduce the false positive rate, and mean some women will avoid unnecessary follow-up or
intensive monitoring (such as hospital admission) if their proteinuria resolves and is shown
to be transient.

Treatment of chronic hypertension
Recommendations 1.3.6 to 1.3.12
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed that pregnant woman with chronic hypertension should be offered
lifestyle advice similar to other adults with hypertension, and in line with the NICE
guideline on hypertension in adults.
There was very little evidence available on treatment initiation thresholds for chronic
hypertension in pregnancy, so the committee based their recommendations on the values
specified in the recent Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) and the NICE
guideline on hypertension in adults. There was evidence for target blood pressure levels
from the large CHIPS trial, so the committee made recommendations based on this.

--- Страница 50 ---
Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
There was some very limited evidence of both benefits and harms for different
antihypertensive medicines. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend one
treatment over another. As labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa had been recommended in
the previous guideline (for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia), and these
medicines had been used for many years in pregnancy, the committee agreed they should
be preferred treatment options for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Labetalol is
specifically licensed for use in pregnancy and so is suggested as the first-line option, with
nifedipine as the next alternative, and methyldopa as the third option (as it may lead to
more side effects and be the least effective option of the 3).
There was some very limited evidence for the benefits of aspirin in reducing preterm births
and neonatal unit admissions, so the committee retained the recommendation on aspirin
from the previous guideline, but incorporated it into the section on the treatment of
chronic hypertension in pregnancy. The committee noted that the studies used different
doses of aspirin (ranging from 50 mg to 150 mg daily), and that common practice in the UK
was to offer 75 mg to 150 mg, therefore this dose range was recommended.
The committee were aware of the link between chronic hypertension and both pre-existing
and gestational diabetes, therefore they made an overarching recommendation at the
beginning of the guideline to cross-refer to the existing NICE guideline on diabetes in
pregnancy.
The committee made a new recommendation referring to the NICE diagnostics guidance
on placental growth factor (PLGF) testing as this may be applicable to women with chronic
hypertension.
As there is currently a lack of evidence on the difference in outcomes between different
antihypertensive medications, and concerns about possible adverse neonatal events from
beta blockers, the committee made research recommendations on these topics.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Based on these recommendations, a clear blood pressure target should now be set for
women with chronic hypertension in pregnancy who need antihypertensive treatment to
improve consistency of treatment targets.
Starting treatment for hypertension and offering aspirin to women with chronic
hypertension who are pregnant are standard care, so these recommendations are not

expected to change practice significantly.
Return to recommendations
Monitoring and treatment of gestational
hypertension
Recommendations 1.4.3 and 1.4.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee updated the table from the previous guideline on the management of
pregnancy with gestational hypertension. There was very little evidence available on
treatment initiation thresholds for gestational hypertension in pregnancy, so the committee
made recommendations using the values specified in the recent Control of Hypertension in
Pregnancy Study (CHIPS). There was evidence for target blood pressure levels from the
large CHIPS trial, so the committee made recommendations based on this. The committee
made a new recommendation referring to the NICE diagnostics guidance on placental
growth factor (PLGF) testing as this is applicable to women with gestational hypertension.
The committee were aware of the link between gestational hypertension and both pre-
existing and gestational diabetes, therefore they made an overarching recommendation at
the beginning of the guideline to cross-refer to the existing NICE guideline on diabetes in
pregnancy.
There was no evidence on fetal monitoring in gestational hypertension, so the committee
made a research recommendation on the optimal fetal monitoring strategy to detect small
for gestational age infants.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations reflect current clinical practice in many units, but may help
standardise practice across the NHS for units that currently use other blood pressure
targets.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Assessment of women with pre-eclampsia
Recommendations 1.5.2 to 1.5.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed, based on their clinical expertise, that women with pre-eclampsia
should have a full clinical assessment at every antenatal appointment and should be
admitted to hospital if there are any concerns about the wellbeing of the woman or her
baby. The committee agreed that this would include (but was not limited to) reasons such
as severe hypertension or other features of pre-eclampsia indicating increased risk of
adverse outcomes.
There was some evidence that the fullPIERS and PREP-S models can help identify women
at different risks of adverse outcomes because of pre-eclampsia. There was more
extensive validation of the fullPIERS model, and the validation studies were conducted in
populations from a range of healthcare settings. The PREP-S model had been developed
using a UK population, and validated using data from similar multinational settings. It was
noted that further validation of PREP-S was unlikely to be conducted, because of the cost
of conducting these studies. The committee therefore agreed that both models could be
considered as options, in addition to a full clinical assessment, to help guide decisions
relating to interventions and place of care.
The tools predict adverse outcomes in women, but are not designed to predict outcomes
for babies. The committee agreed it was important to highlight this.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The use of a full clinical assessment and validated models to predict risk may improve
consistency in current practice with regard to admission to hospital for women with pre-
eclampsia. Some centres offer admission to all women with pre-eclampsia, whereas others
only offer it to a small proportion of women. The guidance might increase the number of
women who are admitted to hospital in some centres if admission is not currently routine,
but might decrease admission in other centres, thus standardising practice.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Monitoring and treatment of pre-eclampsia and
timing of birth
Recommendations 1.5.5, 1.5.7 and 1.5.12
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee updated the table from the previous guideline on the management of
pregnancy with pre-eclampsia. There was limited evidence on the best place of treatment
for women with pre-eclampsia. Because of this, the committee made recommendations
based on other evidence they reviewed (see evidence review C), which showed that
women should be admitted if there were concerns for the wellbeing of the woman or her
baby, or a high risk of complications of pre-eclampsia predicted using the fullPIERS or
PREP-S model. (See the section of the guideline on assessing pre-eclampsia and evidence
review C for more details on the use of the fullPIERS and PREP-S models.)
There was no evidence on treatment initiation thresholds or target blood pressure levels
for pre-eclampsia, so the committee based their recommendations on the NICE guideline
on hypertension in adults and the values specified in the Control of Hypertension In
Pregnancy Study (CHIPS; see evidence review A), which included women with chronic or
gestational hypertension.
There was some very limited evidence of both benefits and harms for different
pharmacological interventions. However, as there was not enough evidence to recommend
one treatment over another, the committee adopted the choices from the previous
guideline and recommended choosing a treatment based on previous treatments, side-
effect profiles and the woman's preferences. Labetalol is specifically licensed for use in
pregnancy and so is suggested as the first-line option, with nifedipine as the next
alternative, and methyldopa as the third option (as it may lead to more side effects and be
the least effective option of the 3).
There was limited evidence on the benefits and harms of planned early birth compared
with expectant management of pregnancy in women with pre-eclampsia, so the
committee recommended that decisions about timing of birth should be based on whether
the woman and baby are at risk of adverse outcomes if pregnancy is prolonged. These
recommendations were based on those from the previous guideline, and expanded based
on international guidelines, which were used by the committee in their clinical practice.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Based on the data from HYPITAT-II study, the committee also agreed that pregnancies in
women with pre-eclampsia could be managed with continued surveillance to 37 weeks,
unless there were specific concerns or indications to offer a planned early birth before
then.
There was limited evidence to guide the best place of care for women with pre-eclampsia
and their babies, so the committee made a research recommendation.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations are in line with current best clinical practice, so are unlikely to
cause a significant change in practice.
Currently, some units admit all women with pre-eclampsia routinely, some only admit
women who they believe to be at a high risk of complications, and some admit very few.
Standardising practice could therefore increase or reduce the number of women who will
be admitted, depending on a unit's current practice, but is likely to reduce unwanted
variance between units.
Return to recommendations
Antihypertensive treatment during the postnatal
period, including during breastfeeding
Recommendations 1.9.1 to 1.9.7 and 1.9.9
Why the committee made the recommendations
There was very little evidence on the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive agents in
postnatal women, so the committee made recommendations based on the NICE guideline
on hypertension in adults, with adaptations based on the potential effects of medicines on
the baby. The committee therefore recommended the use of an angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as first-line treatment, except in women of African or Caribbean
family origin, in whom a calcium-channel blocker would be used first line. The choice of
second-line medicine was modified from the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults as
angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are not recommended
during breastfeeding. Therefore, the committee agreed that beta-blockers should be used

conditions#notice-of-rights). of 61
--- Страница 55 ---
Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
as the second-line antihypertensive agent. The committee also agreed that the medicines
with once-daily administration should be used wherever possible and for this reason the
committee recommended enalapril in preference to captopril (which is taken 3 times daily)
and atenolol as an alternative to labetalol (which is taken 2 to 4 times daily).
Based on their experience, the committee made recommendations on advice for women
who wish to breastfeed while taking antihypertensives, and on the monitoring of babies
whose mothers are taking antihypertensives.
As there was very little evidence on the effectiveness and safety of antihypertensives for
postnatal use, the committee revised the research recommendation made in the 2010
guideline.
How the recommendations might affect practice
There is currently wide variation in practice over use of antihypertensive treatment in the
postnatal period, and these recommendations may reduce variation in practice. The
recommendations could lead to an increase in the use of atenolol instead of labetalol in
the postnatal period.
Return to recommendations
Risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy and long-term cardiovascular disease
Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
Long-term follow-up studies of women who have experienced hypertensive disorders
during pregnancy showed an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease and a
higher prevalence of hypertensive disorders in subsequent pregnancies compared with
women unaffected by hypertensive disorders.
There was no evidence on which interventions could reduce the risk of recurrence of

How the recommendations might affect practice
Providing guidance and advice to women on future risks and signposting appropriate care
and lifestyle advice may be an additional activity for some healthcare professionals,
compared with current practice.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
Context
Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy affect around 8% to 10% of all pregnant women
and can be associated with substantial complications for the woman and the baby. Women
can have hypertension before pregnancy or it can be diagnosed in the first 20 weeks
(known as chronic hypertension), new onset of hypertension occurring in the second half
of pregnancy (gestational hypertension) or new hypertension with features of multi-organ
involvement (pre-eclampsia).
Although the proportion of women with pregnancy hypertensive disorders overall appears
to have stayed reasonably stable, maternal mortality from hypertensive causes has fallen
dramatically: less than 1 woman in every million who gives birth now dies from pre-
eclampsia. There is consensus that introduction of the 2010 NICE evidence-based
guidelines, together with the findings from the confidential enquiry into maternal deaths,
has made a pivotal contribution to this fall in maternal mortality. However, hypertension in
pregnancy continues to cause substantial maternal morbidity, stillbirths and neonatal
deaths, and perinatal morbidity. Women with hypertension in pregnancy are also at
increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life.
Variations in care contribute to inequity in adverse outcomes. Adoption and
implementation of evidence-based national guidelines have a central role in reducing this
variance and improving care and outcomes across the maternity service. Research that
has been done since publication of the previous guideline has addressed areas of
uncertainty and highlighted where the recommendations can be updated. A surveillance
report from 2017 identified new studies in the following areas:
• management of pregnancy with chronic hypertension
• management of pregnancy with gestational hypertension
• management of pregnancy with pre-eclampsia
• breastfeeding
• advice and follow-up care at transfer to community care.
The scope of this update was limited to these sections; it did not include other areas being
looked at by other groups (for example, screening strategies for pre-eclampsia, which is

being evaluated by the UK National Screening Committee), and did not look into
alternative approaches to categorisation of hypertension in pregnancy (for example,
looking at treatment for all types of pregnancy hypertension together, rather than within
the subdivisions of chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia).
This update has also clarified the basis for the current definition of pre-eclampsia, in order
to better align with the stated aims of the 2010 guideline to be consistent with those
agreed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP).
The aim of the 2019 guideline is to present updated evidence-based recommendations,
relevant to practising clinicians, while identifying outstanding areas of uncertainty that
need further research. There is a strong argument for uptake of these new guidelines into
clinical practice, in order to minimise unnecessary variance and provide optimal care for
women and their babies. In doing this, low rates of maternal mortality should be
maintained, and progress on reduction of maternal morbidity and perinatal morbidity and
mortality can be pursued.

Update information
April 2023: In recommendations 1.3.12 and 1.4.4, we updated the information about when
placental growth factor (PLGF)-based testing for pre-eclampsia should be carried out. This
brings it in line with our diagnostics guidance on PLGF-based testing to help diagnose
suspected preterm pre-eclampsia.
June 2019: We have reviewed the evidence on the assessment of proteinuria and the
treatment of women with chronic and gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia,
breastfeeding and advice on discharge. These recommendations are marked [2019].
We have also made some changes without an evidence review:
• Combined, updated and clarified advice throughout to make it simpler to follow.
• Updated advice on pre-eclampsia in line with the NICE guidelines on antenatal care
and pre-term labour and birth.
• Amended dose information for aspirin use in pre-eclampsia in line with current national
guidance.
• Updated advice on rest, exercise and work for women with pre-eclampsia in line with
the NICE guideline on antenatal care.
• Expanded the advice on the risks of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
to treat hypertension in pregnancy.
• Expanded and amended the advice on chlorothiazide to thiazide and thiazide-like
diuretics, because chlorothiazide is no longer widely used.
• Updated terminology used for various aspects of treatment in line with current
practice.
• Updated the advice on when to offer planned early birth and action to take
beforehand.
• Updated the advice on continuing antihypertensive treatment after birth, including
treatment with methyldopa.
• Added cross references where suitable to NICE guidance on breastfeeding.

Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management (NG133)
• Updated guidance if necessary to be more specific on which healthcare professionals
are responsible for undertaking reviews and checks.
• Updated scan and test times for women with chronic hypertension in pregnancy, and
why scans and tests may be needed.
• Updated advice about creating care plans and who should be involved.
• Updated advice on anti-convulsants.
• Updated advice on angiotensin-receptor blockers during breastfeeding.
• Updated definitions and terms used to reflect current clinical practice.
These recommendations are marked [2010, amended 2019].
Recommendations marked [2010] last had an evidence review in 2010. In some cases,
minor changes have been made to the wording to bring the language and style up to date,
without changing the meaning.
Minor changes since publication
October 2023: We updated links to the NICE guideline on intrapartum care, which has
been updated.
October 2022: We added text to indicate that pulse oximetry may be less reliable in
people with dark skin. We also added a link to the NHS patient safety alert on the risk of
harm from inappropriate placement of pulse oximeter probes. See recommendation 1.5.7.
August 2022: We corrected the term 'first pregnancy' to 'nulliparity' in recommendation
1.1.3.
