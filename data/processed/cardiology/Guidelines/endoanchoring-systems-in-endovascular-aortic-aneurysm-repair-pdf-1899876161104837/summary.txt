1 Recommendations 1.1 For people with unfavourable aneurysm morphology needing an endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) as a primary procedure, or for people with an existing EVAR who need a secondary procedure, evidence on the safety of using endoanchoring systems is adequate. Evidence on efficacy is limited in quantity and quality. Therefore, for these people, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research. Find out what special arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 For people with favourable aneurysm morphology needing an EVAR as a primary procedure, evidence on the safety of using endoanchoring systems is adequate. However, evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality.
