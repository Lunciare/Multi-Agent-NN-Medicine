Endoanchoring systems in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair

are often caused by an inadequate seal. The procedure 2.4 Endoanchoring systems aim to improve the fixation of the stent–graft used in EVAR. They may be used prophylactically or therapeutically at the same time as the primary procedure or during a later, secondary procedure to treat an endoleak or migration. 2.5 Endoanchoring implants are inserted under general or local anaesthesia. The implants are deployed through an applier device consisting of a catheter and a control handle. The catheter is advanced until the distal end contacts the stent–graft and vessel wall. The number of implants needed depends on the type of stent–graft and the size of the native vessel. They are placed as evenly as possible around the circumference of the stent–graft. The catheter is then removed, the holes in the femoral arteries are sutured and the groin wounds are closed. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 8 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 2 systematic reviews, 1 non-randomised comparative study, 2 cohort studies, 1 single-arm study
