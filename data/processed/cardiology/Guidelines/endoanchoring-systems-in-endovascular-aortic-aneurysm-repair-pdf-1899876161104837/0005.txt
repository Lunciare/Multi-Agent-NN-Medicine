Endoanchoring systems in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair

detailed review of the evidence from 8 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 2 systematic reviews, 1 non-randomised comparative study, 2 cohort studies, 1 single-arm study that was also included in the systematic reviews, a case report, and a case series of reports from the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database. It is presented in the summary of key evidence section in the interventional procedures overview. Other relevant literature is in the appendix of the overview. 3.2 The professional experts and the committee considered the key efficacy outcomes to be: prevention of aneurysm rupture and prevention of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair graft migration. 3.3 The professional experts and the committee considered the key safety outcomes to be: bleeding, infection and device migration. 3.4 Patient commentary was sought but none was received. Committee comments 3.5 The committee was informed that: • The risk of migration with endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is related to the anatomy of the aorta and the choice of endograft. • Using endoanchors in a primary EVAR procedure increases the exposure to X-rays during the procedure. • Endoanchors are difficult to remove. • This procedure is primarily
