Endoanchoring systems in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair

The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Aortic aneurysms develop when the wall of the aorta weakens, causing it to bulge and form a balloon-like expansion. They can happen in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysms) or, more commonly, below the diaphragm (abdominal aortic aneurysms). Current treatments 2.2 The standard treatment for aortic aneurysm is either open surgical or endovascular repair. During open surgical repair, the aneurysm is opened and a graft is sewn in above and below the weakened area to allow normal blood flow. Endovascular repair is a minimally invasive alternative to open repair. A graft is mounted on a stent, which is inserted into the aorta through catheters placed in the femoral arteries. The stent–graft is deployed under X-ray guidance and positioned across the aneurysm. 2.3 In endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedures, the stent–graft can sometimes leak (endoleak) or move out of place (migrate), or a person's anatomy can make its placement difficult. Type 1 endoleaks happen around the top or bottom of grafts and are often caused by an inadequate seal. The procedure 2.4 Endoanchoring systems aim to improve the fixation of the stent–graft used in EVAR. They may be used prophylactically or therapeutically
