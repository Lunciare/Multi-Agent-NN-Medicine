choice of endograft. • Using endoanchors in a primary EVAR procedure increases the exposure to X-rays during the procedure. • Endoanchors are difficult to remove. • This procedure is primarily intended to be used for people with unfavourable aneurysm morphology and this is where most of the evidence comes from. • This procedure is also used for people with favourable aneurysm morphology who develop an intraoperative complication such as an endoleak during a primary EVAR. Data collection in this group of people would be helpful.
