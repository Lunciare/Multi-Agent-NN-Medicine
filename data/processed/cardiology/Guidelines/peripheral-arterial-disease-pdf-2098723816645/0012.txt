after a duplex ultrasound are offered MRA. Data source: Local data collection. Process Proportion of people with PAD being considered for revascularisation needing further imaging after a duplex ultrasound who receive MRA. Numerator: the number of people in the denominator receiving MRA. Denominator: the number of people with PAD being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound. Data source: Local data collection. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers ensure that imaging equipment is adequately available, and that people with PAD who are being considered for revascularisation and need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound are offered MRA. Healthcare practitioners ensure that they offer MRA to people with PAD who are being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound imaging. Commissioners ensure that they commission services with adequate availability of imaging equipment and which offer MRA to people with PAD being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound. People with peripheral arterial disease whose healthcare practitioner thinks surgery might help to improve their blood flow, are offered imaging tests (for example, an ultrasound) to see whether surgery would be suitable.
