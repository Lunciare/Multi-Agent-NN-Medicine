Quality statements Statement 1 People who have symptoms of, or who are at risk of developing, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are offered a clinical assessment and ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement. Statement 2 People with PAD are offered an assessment for cardiovascular comorbidities and modifiable risk factors. Statement 3 People with intermittent claudication are offered a supervised exercise programme. Statement 4 People with PAD being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound are offered magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Statement 5 People with intermittent claudication are offered angioplasty only when imaging has confirmed it is appropriate, after advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been given and after a supervised exercise programme has not improved symptoms. Quality statement 1: Identification and assessment of peripheral arterial disease Quality statement People who have symptoms of, or who are at risk of developing, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are offered a clinical assessment and ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement. Rationale Early identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PAD means that treatment can begin earlier, potentially slowing disease progression and improving quality of life through better mobility and reduced pain. Early identification and treatment of PAD and its
