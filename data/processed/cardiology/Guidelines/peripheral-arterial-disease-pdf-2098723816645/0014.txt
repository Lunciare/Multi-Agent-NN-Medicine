[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, recommendations 1.5.3, 1.5.5, 1.6.2 and 1.6.4] Quality statement 5: Angioplasty for intermittent claudication Quality statement People with intermittent claudication are offered angioplasty only when imaging has confirmed it is appropriate, after advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been given, and after a supervised exercise programme has not improved symptoms. Rationale Angioplasty can be used to treat intermittent claudication, but it is an invasive procedure and should only be used after non-invasive options (including reinforcement of the importance of lifestyle changes and participation in supervised exercise programmes) have not improved symptoms, and imaging has confirmed that angioplasty
