PAD means that treatment can begin earlier, potentially slowing disease progression and improving quality of life through better mobility and reduced pain. Early identification and treatment of PAD and its risk factors may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the need for lower limb amputation. A comprehensive assessment should include both a clinical assessment with structured history taking, and ABPI measurement with a hand-held doppler ultrasound scan to ensure an accurate diagnosis and quantification of disease severity. Quality measures Structure (a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that health and social care practitioners receive training to recognise the symptoms of PAD. Data source: Local data collection. (b) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that people who have symptoms of, or who are at risk of developing, PAD are offered a clinical assessment and ABPI measurement. Data source: Local data collection. (c) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that all healthcare practitioners undertaking hand-held doppler ultrasound assessment of ABPI are appropriately trained. Data source: Local data collection. Process (a) Proportion of people who have symptoms of PAD who receive a clinical assessment and ABPI measurement. Numerator: the number of people in the denominator receiving a clinical assessment
