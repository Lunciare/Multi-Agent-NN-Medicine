[Adapted from NICE's guideline on peripheral arterial disease, recommendation 1.5.2] Quality statement 4: Imaging Quality statement People with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound are offered magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Rationale Imaging should only be performed in people with PAD if it is likely to provide information that will influence their management. Duplex ultrasound followed by MRA, where clinically appropriate and if needed, offers the most accurate, safe and cost-effective imaging strategy for people with PAD. However, local training and expertise and the availability of imaging equipment may be variable. Quality measures Structure (a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that healthcare practitioners undertaking imaging are appropriately trained in the use of duplex ultrasound and MRA for PAD. Data source: Local data collection. (b) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that people with PAD being considered for revascularisation who need further imaging after a duplex ultrasound are offered MRA. Data source: Local data collection. Process Proportion of people with PAD being considered for revascularisation needing further imaging after a duplex ultrasound who
