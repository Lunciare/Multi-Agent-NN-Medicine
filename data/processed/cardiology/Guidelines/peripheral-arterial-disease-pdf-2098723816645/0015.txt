only be used after non-invasive options (including reinforcement of the importance of lifestyle changes and participation in supervised exercise programmes) have not improved symptoms, and imaging has confirmed that angioplasty is suitable. Greater use of non-invasive treatments may reduce the need for angioplasty and improve overall outcomes for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Quality measures Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that people with intermittent claudication are offered angioplasty only when imaging has confirmed it is appropriate, advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been given and a supervised exercise programme has not improved symptoms. Data source: Local data collection. Process Proportion of people with intermittent claudication receiving angioplasty who have had imaging to confirm angioplasty is appropriate, received advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors and undergone a supervised exercise programme that did not improve symptoms. Numerator: the number of people in the denominator who have had imaging to confirm angioplasty is appropriate, received advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors and undergone supervised exercise programme that did not improve symptoms. Denominator: the number of people with intermittent claudication who receive angioplasty. Data source: Local data collection. What the quality statement means for different audiences
