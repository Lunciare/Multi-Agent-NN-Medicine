Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

done within 6 hours of symptom onset have a high diagnostic accuracy. Taking into account the invasive risks of lumbar puncture, the difficulty of monitoring patients during MRI and the costs of both procedures, the committee concluded that these procedures should not be routinely offered if a CT head scan, done within 6 hours of symptom onset and reported and documented by an appropriately experienced radiologist, shows no evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. In these circumstances alternative diagnoses should be considered and advice sought from a specialist, for example in neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology or stroke medicine. If the CT head scan is done more than 6 hours after symptom onset, the evidence showed that diagnostic accuracy is reduced and false-negative results are more likely. The committee therefore agreed that further investigation with a lumbar puncture should be considered if a CT head scan done more than 6 hours after ictus does not confirm the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage. When a lumbar puncture is indicated, the committee agreed that it should be done at least 12 hours after symptom onset, when bilirubin formation is sufficient to be detected reliably. The committee considered that the diagnostic accuracy of earlier lumbar puncture (to
