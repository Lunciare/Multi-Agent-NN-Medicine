Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

be done at least 12 hours after symptom onset, when bilirubin formation is sufficient to be detected reliably. The committee considered that the diagnostic accuracy of earlier lumbar puncture (to detect blood in the cerebrospinal fluid) is likely to be low because it can take several hours for blood to appear in the lumbar subarachnoid sac. There was limited evidence on the relative accuracy of non-contrast CT head scanning at various time intervals greater than 6 hours after symptom onset, so the committee made a recommendation for research on timing of CT head scans. Referral and transfer to a specialist neurosurgical centre If subarachnoid haemorrhage is diagnosed, the committee noted that an urgent decision is needed on whether to transfer the person to specialist care. The committee decided to make a consensus recommendation to stress the importance of an urgent discussion with a specialist neurosurgical centre. Although evidence on a number of severity scores showed an association with morbidity and mortality, there was inconsistency across the scores and the evidence was not sufficient to recommend the use of any score on its own. The committee agreed that, although severity scoring can be a useful clinical descriptor, decisions on transfer should
