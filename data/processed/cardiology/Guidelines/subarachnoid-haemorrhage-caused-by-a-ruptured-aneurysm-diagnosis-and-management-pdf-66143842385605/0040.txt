with neurosurgical clipping, although a small amount of evidence suggested that endovascular coiling might be more beneficial. Endovascular coiling is less invasive and potentially safer, so the committee agreed that it should be offered as the first option, taking factors such as aneurysm characteristics and the amount and location of subarachnoid blood into account. The committee agreed that neurosurgical clipping should be considered if endovascular coiling is not a suitable treatment option. They stressed that any procedure to secure the aneurysm should be performed without delay to minimise the risk of rebleeding. Newer, more expensive interventional technologies are being used but there is little evidence on their effectiveness, so the committee made a recommendation for research on novel endovascular interventions. How the recommendations might affect practice Endovascular coiling accounts for around 75% of interventions done in current practice and the recommendation is not expected to change this. Most interventions are carried out within 48 hours of admission. However, this may vary according to the availability of interventional neuroradiologists and vascular neurosurgeons, and the capacity of neurosurgical centres. For people admitted during weekends, endovascular coiling should be available from the same interventional neuroradiology teams who will provide thrombectomy for stroke, in
