interventional treatment is not suitable for some people who have a major neurological deficit after an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, and that the costs of long-term nursing care or rehabilitation can be considerable. Very little evidence was found for this group, so the committee made a recommendation for research on interventions for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage in people with major neurological deficit. Severity scoring systems might help clinicians identify people for whom intervention is likely to be justified, but none of the severity scoring systems currently in use reliably predicts morbidity and mortality in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. In addition, the committee agreed that clinical state and severity score can vary over time, especially soon after symptom onset. Decisions on clinical management should therefore be based on a holistic patient assessment rather than solely on a severity score. Factors that should be considered by clinicians and discussed with the patient include: neurological status, performance status and comorbidities. The evidence was not sufficient to determine the clinical effectiveness of endovascular coiling compared with neurosurgical clipping, although a small amount of evidence suggested that endovascular coiling might be more beneficial. Endovascular coiling is less invasive and potentially safer, so the committee agreed that
