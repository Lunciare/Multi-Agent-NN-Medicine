Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

There was no evidence on diagnosing acute hydrocephalus. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that hydrocephalus is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure such as an altered level of consciousness or neurological deterioration, and that the diagnosis should be confirmed by comparing a CT head scan with previous CT or other head scans to show an increase in the size of the ventricular system. The committee agreed that MRI offers no advantage over CT for diagnosing hydrocephalus in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, is more expensive and is a difficult procedure for people who are unwell. The committee noted that acute hydrocephalus can lead to severe disability or death if not treated promptly by drainage or diversion of cerebrospinal fluid. There was no evidence on the effectiveness of different techniques for drainage or diversion in acute hydrocephalus. The committee agreed that either drainage or diversion could be considered. They also made a recommendation for research on managing acute hydrocephalus. Chronic hydrocephalus There was little evidence to inform recommendations on diagnosing and managing chronic hydrocephalus. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that chronic hydrocephalus is uncommon and typically presents several weeks or months
