Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

reasonable time frame and have little impact on clinical practice. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current practice. Return to recommendations Intracranial hypertension Recommendation for research Why the committee did not make a recommendation There was little evidence on diagnosing and treating intracranial hypertension. The committee agreed that the diagnostic accuracies of transcranial doppler and ultrasound measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter are too low for reliable detection of intracranial hypertension when compared with direct intracranial pressure measurement. The committee also acknowledged that there is no evidence that interventions to lower intracranial pressure improve clinical outcome. The committee agreed that raised intracranial pressure is common in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, but intracranial hypertension that impedes blood flow to the brain and contributes to brain injury is generally only seen in the most severely ill. These people are usually unconscious or need ventilation in an intensive care unit. They are a heterogeneous population and management varies widely, with some clinicians advocating routine monitoring of intracranial pressure to guide intervention (such as drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, hypertonic saline or vasopressor therapy) to lower intracranial pressure and maintain cerebral perfusion. Other clinicians favour management without intracranial pressure monitoring. Intracranial
