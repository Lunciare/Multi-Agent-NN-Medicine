They should document a proposed treatment plan based on the following options: • endovascular coiling • neurosurgical clipping • no interventional procedure, with monitoring to check for clinical improvement and reassess the options for treatment. 1.2.5 Do not use a subarachnoid haemorrhage severity score in isolation to determine the suitability of any management option. 1.2.6 If interventional treatment to secure the aneurysm is an option, offer: • endovascular coiling or • neurosurgical clipping if endovascular coiling is not suitable. 1.2.7 Discuss the proposed treatment plan and any alternative options with the person, and their family or carers if appropriate, then agree and document a final treatment plan (see recommendations 1.5.5 to 1.5.7). 1.2.8 If interventional treatment is planned, ensure that it is carried out at the earliest opportunity to prevent rebleeding.
