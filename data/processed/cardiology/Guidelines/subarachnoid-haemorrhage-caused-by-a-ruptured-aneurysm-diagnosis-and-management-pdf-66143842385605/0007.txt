the head without delay to people with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage to identify the cause of the bleeding and to guide treatment. 1.1.19 Diagnose an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage if: • CT angiography of the head shows an intracranial arterial aneurysm and • the pattern of subarachnoid blood is compatible with aneurysm rupture. 1.1.20 Seek specialist opinion without delay from an interventional neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon if: • CT angiography of the head shows an intracranial arterial aneurysm and • the pattern of subarachnoid blood is not compatible with aneurysm rupture. 1.1.21 If CT angiography of the head does not identify the cause of the subarachnoid haemorrhage and an aneurysm is still suspected, consider digital subtraction angiography (DSA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) if DSA is contraindicated. 1.1.22 Diagnose an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage if: • DSA or MRA shows an intracranial arterial aneurysm and • the pattern of subarachnoid blood is compatible with aneurysm rupture. 1.1.23 Think about other diagnoses if DSA or MRA does not show an intracranial arterial aneurysm. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on detecting an aneurysm. Full details
