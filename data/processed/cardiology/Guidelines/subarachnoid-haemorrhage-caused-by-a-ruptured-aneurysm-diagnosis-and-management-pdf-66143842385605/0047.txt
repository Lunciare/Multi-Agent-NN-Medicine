infarction. Intravenous fluid is usually given to ensure euvolemia and if symptoms persist a vasopressor is administered to raise systemic blood pressure. The committee agreed with this approach, but added that the improvements seen after these measures may be temporary, and there was no evidence of impact on longer-term outcomes. Treatment for people whose condition is not improved by vasopressor therapy varies widely. Some clinicians recommend cerebral angiography and intra-arterial therapies, including intra-arterial vasodilators and angioplasty. However, the committee were unable to reach a consensus on the use of intra-arterial therapies. They made recommendations for research on intra-arterial therapies to manage delayed cerebral ischaemia and vasopressors to manage delayed cerebral ischaemia. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice. Return to recommendation Follow-up care plan Recommendations 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence from surveys and interviews with people who had an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage showed that those who did not receive clear information about their medical care after discharge felt anxious and 'abandoned'. Those who were given this information, together with details of who to contact for ongoing advice, said they felt more supported. The committee agreed that the follow-up care plan should
