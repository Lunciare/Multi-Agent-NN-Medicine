options be discussed with the person. How the recommendations might affect practice Current management of unruptured aneurysms varies. The recommendations are not expected to lead to substantial changes in practice.

The committee agreed that blood pressure should be controlled in line with the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults. There was no evidence on long-term blood pressure control specifically for people with a history of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, so the committee made a recommendation for research on blood pressure targets. Conditions treated with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant There was little evidence about the effect of an antiplatelet or anticoagulant on the risk of recurrent intracranial bleeding. The committee agreed that, in their experience, these medicines are safe for people with a secured aneurysm following an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. For people with a higher risk of recurrence, specialist advice should be sought to judge the balance between the risk of recurrent
