neurosurgeons, and the capacity of neurosurgical centres. For people admitted during weekends, endovascular coiling should be available from the same interventional neuroradiology teams who will provide thrombectomy for stroke, in line with the recommendations on thrombectomy in the NICE guideline on stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s. However, provision of neurosurgical clipping during weekends may necessitate changes to services such as the setting up of appropriate networks. Return to recommendations Monitoring and investigating for deterioration Recommendations 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 Why the committee made the recommendations There was no evidence on the routine use of direct intracranial pressure monitoring for raised intracranial pressure. Very limited evidence from 1 study on transcranial doppler monitoring for vasospasm suggested an increase in mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay compared with no transcranial doppler monitoring. The committee agreed that these outcomes were unlikely to be directly caused by the transcranial doppler monitoring. However, they were concerned that such monitoring might influence subsequent decisions, for example about investigations or interventions, and so indirectly affect outcomes. They therefore agreed that transcranial doppler monitoring should only be used in the context of clinical research. The committee noted that there is increasing enthusiasm for the use
