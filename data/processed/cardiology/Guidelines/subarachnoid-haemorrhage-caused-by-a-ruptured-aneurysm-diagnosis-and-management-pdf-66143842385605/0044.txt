Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

little evidence to inform recommendations on diagnosing and managing chronic hydrocephalus. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that chronic hydrocephalus is uncommon and typically presents several weeks or months after an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, with reduced consciousness, gait disturbance or other neurological symptoms. As with acute hydrocephalus, the committee agreed that chronic hydrocephalus is suspected based on symptoms and signs and a diagnosis should be confirmed based on a comparison of current CT head scans with previous CT or other head scans. In current clinical practice most people with persisting or progressive symptoms and radiological evidence of ventricular dilatation are offered drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, which improves symptoms in the majority. If the likelihood of symptom improvement is uncertain, some clinicians advocate a trial of temporary drainage, for example, serial lumbar punctures, before considering permanent diversion of cerebrospinal fluid. The committee agreed with this approach. The committee discussed making a recommendation for research on chronic hydrocephalus but concluded that research in this area might not be feasible within a reasonable time frame and have little impact on clinical practice.
