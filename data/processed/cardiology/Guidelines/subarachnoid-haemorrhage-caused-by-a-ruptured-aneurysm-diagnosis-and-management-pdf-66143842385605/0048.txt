Those who were given this information, together with details of who to contact for ongoing advice, said they felt more supported. The committee agreed that the follow-up care plan should be included in the person's medical record and discharge correspondence. How the recommendations might affect practice The amount and quality of information given to people about follow-up care after an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage varies. This recommendation can be expected to improve the provision of this information. Return to recommendations Follow-up neuroimaging Recommendation 1.4.4 Why the committee made the recommendation No clinical evidence was found on follow-up neuroimaging. Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that there is a risk of aneurysm recurrence, progression of non-culprit aneurysms and formation of new aneurysms. They agreed that follow-up imaging should be considered, based on the person's clinical situation and risk factors. How the recommendation might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice. Return to recommendation Managing non-culprit (unruptured) aneurysms Recommendations 1.4.5 to 1.4.7 Why the committee made the recommendations There was not enough good evidence to enable the committee to recommend a preferred management option for non-culprit aneurysms, although they agreed that the risk of a non-culprit aneurysm rupturing is higher
