Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

was not sufficient to recommend the use of any score on its own. The committee agreed that, although severity scoring can be a useful clinical descriptor, decisions on transfer should be based on a holistic patient assessment rather than a severity score on its own, to avoid inappropriate withholding of specialist neurosurgical care from people whose score indicates a poor clinical condition. The committee noted that evidence to support the prognostic accuracy of the severity scores was weak and made a recommendation for research on predictors of death and disability. How the recommendations might affect practice Centres that routinely perform lumbar puncture after a negative CT head scan may see a reduction in the use of lumbar puncture in people with an early negative CT head scan. Reliance on severity scoring to determine transfer to specialist centres may reduce, leading to more people appropriately being transferred for treatment. Return to recommendations Detecting an aneurysm Recommendations 1.1.18 to 1.1.23 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence showed that CT angiography has a high level of accuracy in identifying aneurysms causing subarachnoid haemorrhage but evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was less compelling. CT angiography is the quickest
