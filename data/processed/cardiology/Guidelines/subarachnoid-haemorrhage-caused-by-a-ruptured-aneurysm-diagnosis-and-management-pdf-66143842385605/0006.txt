puncture sample shows evidence of elevated bilirubin (xanthochromia) on spectrophotometry. 1.1.15 Think about alternative diagnoses if the lumbar puncture sample shows no evidence of elevated bilirubin (xanthochromia) on spectrophotometry. Referral and transfer to a specialist neurosurgical centre 1.1.16 Urgently discuss with a specialist neurosurgical centre the need for transfer of care of a person with a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage to a specialist neurosurgical centre. 1.1.17 Do not use a subarachnoid haemorrhage severity score in isolation to determine the need for, or timing of, transfer of care to a specialist neurosurgical centre. Be aware that the risk of rebleeding is highest within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: diagnostic accuracy of investigations and evidence review C: severity scoring systems. Detecting an aneurysm 1.1.18 Offer CT angiography of the head without delay to people with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage to identify the cause of the bleeding and to guide treatment. 1.1.19 Diagnose an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
