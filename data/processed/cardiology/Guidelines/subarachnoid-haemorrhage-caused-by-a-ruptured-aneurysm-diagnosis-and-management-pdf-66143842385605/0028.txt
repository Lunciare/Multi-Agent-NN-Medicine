Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

The committee's experience indicated that a 'thunderclap' headache is a presenting symptom in most people with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, they noted that this type of headache is a common presentation in emergency departments and around 10% of people who present with this symptom have a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage confirmed; the majority are diagnosed with other conditions, for example, migraine. The committee agreed that other symptoms and signs are also commonly seen in people with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. These can be used, together with clinical judgement, to support clinical assessment and guide decisions on further diagnostic investigations. The committee noted that these symptoms and signs of subarachnoid haemorrhage can also be caused by a number of other conditions. Therefore, a senior clinician should confirm the assessment of subarachnoid haemorrhage and arrange immediate referral for further investigation. There is good evidence showing that non-contrast CT head scans carried out within 6 hours of symptom onset are highly accurate and can be used to rule out a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore avoiding the need for further investigation with a lumbar puncture. CT head scans done more than 6 hours after symptom onset are less accurate (see the section on diagnosing
