therefore avoiding the need for further investigation with a lumbar puncture. CT head scans done more than 6 hours after symptom onset are less accurate (see the section on diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage for more information). Evidence on decision tools, including the Ottawa Subarachnoid Haemorrhage Rule for Headache Evaluation, showed that these tools have a high level of accuracy in ruling out subarachnoid haemorrhage, but are less accurate at ruling it in, with a large number of false-positive identifications. Although these tools are beneficial in ensuring that no cases are missed, over-reliance on them risks harm from unnecessary imaging and invasive investigations. The committee noted that the tools use a broad range of symptoms and signs that are not specific to subarachnoid haemorrhage. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations may be useful for non-specialist clinicians, but are not expected to lead to significant changes in practice. Non-contrast CT head scans are the usual first-line investigation for suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage, and this is not expected to change.
