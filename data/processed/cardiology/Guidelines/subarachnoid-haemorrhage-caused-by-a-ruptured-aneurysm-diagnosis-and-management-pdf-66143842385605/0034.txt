a high level of accuracy in identifying aneurysms causing subarachnoid haemorrhage but evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was less compelling. CT angiography is the quickest to perform, is non-invasive, does not usually necessitate sedation or general anaesthesia and is available in most centres. MRA and DSA are more complex and time- consuming procedures that need specialist input and have a higher risk of complications. DSA is regarded as the 'gold standard' investigation and is currently commonly carried out when CT angiography is negative but there is a high suspicion of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, whereas the complexities involved in obtaining high-quality MRA images make this less beneficial. The committee agreed that DSA should be reserved for instances when CT angiography has not detected a suspected aneurysm. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations largely reflect current practice and are not expected to lead to changes.
