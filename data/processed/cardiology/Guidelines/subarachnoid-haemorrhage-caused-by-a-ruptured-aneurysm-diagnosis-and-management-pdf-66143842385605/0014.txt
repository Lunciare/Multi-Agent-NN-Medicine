Managing non-culprit (unruptured) aneurysms 1.4.5 A multidisciplinary team (MDT) that includes an interventional neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon should evaluate the options for managing non-culprit (unruptured) aneurysms, including: • endovascular coiling • neurosurgical clipping • conservative management and follow-up monitoring. 1.4.6 When evaluating the options for managing a non-culprit aneurysm, the MDT should take into account: • the size and location of the aneurysm • the estimated lifetime risk of the aneurysm rupturing • the estimated risk of each treatment option • any comorbidities • the person's preferences. 1.4.7 Discuss the proposed management plan and any alternative options with the person (and their family or carers as appropriate). Base the discussion on the factors listed in recommendation 1.4.6. Agree and document a final management plan.
