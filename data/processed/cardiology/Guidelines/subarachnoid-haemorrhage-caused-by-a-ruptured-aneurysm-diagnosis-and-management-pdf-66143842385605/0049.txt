Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

not enough good evidence to enable the committee to recommend a preferred management option for non-culprit aneurysms, although they agreed that the risk of a non-culprit aneurysm rupturing is higher in people who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage than those who have not. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that the overall probability of a non-culprit aneurysm rupturing is low, so interventional treatment of all non-culprit aneurysms is unlikely to be a cost-effective strategy. They agreed that conservative management usually includes monitoring of the aneurysm with MRA to detect changes in the aneurysm's size or shape. The committee were in agreement that the frequency of monitoring should be based on a balance between the risks of aneurysm rupture and the risks of interventional treatment, and take into account multidisciplinary team, neuroradiological and neurosurgical opinion, and the person's preferences. The committee's experience was that people with unruptured aneurysms who are offered conservative management are often anxious about the possibility of a future rupture. They therefore recommended that all treatment options be discussed with the person. How the recommendations might affect practice Current management of unruptured aneurysms varies. The recommendations are not expected to lead to substantial changes in practice.
