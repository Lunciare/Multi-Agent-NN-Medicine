some reductions in mortality, rebleeding, disability and delayed cerebral ischaemia with nimodipine, most of the evidence available was graded as low or very low quality, predominately due to imprecision of outcome data, and risk of bias. There was a high risk of uncertainty around a number of outcomes due to significant statistical imprecision around the summary effect estimates, with wide confidence intervals crossing the thresholds for clinical significance. The committee noted that the studies in the evidence review were conducted in the 1980s, with a lack of more recent evidence. In most of the studies, nimodipine was commenced up to 96 hours after ictus and continued for up to 3 weeks before neurosurgical management. Therefore, the committee had reservations about the applicability of this evidence to current practice, in which people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage are frequently treated by endovascular coiling within 48 hours of ictus. The committee could not be sure that the benefits from nimodipine are maintained with current treatments to secure the ruptured aneurysm, but they agreed that, without evidence of significant harms, a recommendation to consider nimodipine was appropriate in the acute management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The committee noted that the use of nimodipine is
