Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on pain relief and neurological assessment. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: medical management strategies. Diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage 1.1.10 Diagnose a subarachnoid haemorrhage if the non-contrast CT head scan shows blood in the subarachnoid space. 1.1.11 If a CT head scan done within 6 hours of symptom onset and reported and documented by a radiologist shows no evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage: • do not routinely offer a lumbar puncture • think about alternative diagnoses and discuss with a senior clinical decision- maker • seek advice from a specialist. 1.1.12 If a CT head scan done more than 6 hours after symptom onset shows no evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage, consider a lumbar puncture. 1.1.13 Allow at least 12 hours after symptom onset before doing a lumbar puncture to diagnose a subarachnoid haemorrhage. 1.1.14 Diagnose a subarachnoid haemorrhage if the lumbar puncture sample shows evidence of elevated bilirubin (xanthochromia) on spectrophotometry. 1.1.15 Think about alternative diagnoses if the lumbar puncture sample shows no evidence of elevated bilirubin (xanthochromia) on spectrophotometry.
