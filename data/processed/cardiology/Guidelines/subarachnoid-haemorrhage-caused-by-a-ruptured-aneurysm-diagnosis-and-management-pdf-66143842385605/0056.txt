Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

varies widely. The recommendations are expected to encourage discussion that is tailored to the person's preferences. Return to recommendations Context Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a bleed into the fluid-filled subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord. Spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage accounts for 5% of all strokes and is estimated to occur in 2 to 20 people per 100,000 per year. In around 80% of people, the bleed arises from rupture of an intracranial arterial aneurysm. Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is slightly more common in women than men, and can occur across a wide range of ages with a median age at presentation between 50 and 60. The main symptom of subarachnoid haemorrhage is a sudden and severe 'thunderclap' headache but there may also be neck stiffness, altered consciousness or seizures. The condition is more easily diagnosed in people presenting with severe symptoms, unconsciousness or sudden onset acute headache but some people with subarachnoid haemorrhage present with less severe or non-specific symptoms and signs. A high index of suspicion and holistic clinical assessment are therefore required to avoid missed diagnoses. Urgent investigation to confirm a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage facilitates treatment to prevent rebleeding from the ruptured aneurysm and reduces disability and death.
