Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Assessment and referral for diagnostic investigation Recommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.7 Why the committee made the recommendations People with a suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage can present with a wide range of symptoms and signs. There was little evidence to indicate which symptoms or signs specifically point to a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage. The committee agreed that the consequences of a missed diagnosis may be severe and include disability and death. Urgent investigation is required to confirm a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage and facilitate early treatment to prevent rebleeding from the ruptured aneurysm. Clinicians should therefore be alert to the possibility of subarachnoid haemorrhage in people presenting with unexplained acute severe headache, reduced consciousness, seizure, focal neurological deficit or other suggestive symptoms. Some people present with non- specific symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, photophobia, or neck pain or stiffness. In these cases, a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage is more likely to be missed. The committee's experience indicated that a 'thunderclap' headache is a presenting symptom in most people with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, they noted that this type of headache is a common
