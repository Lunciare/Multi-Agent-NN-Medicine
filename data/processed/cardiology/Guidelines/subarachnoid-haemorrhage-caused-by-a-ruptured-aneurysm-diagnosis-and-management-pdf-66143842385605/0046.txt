Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

guide intervention (such as drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, hypertonic saline or vasopressor therapy) to lower intracranial pressure and maintain cerebral perfusion. Other clinicians favour management without intracranial pressure monitoring. Intracranial pressure can be monitored by inserting an intracranial pressure bolt or using an external ventricular drain inserted to manage acute hydrocephalus. The committee acknowledged that insertion of a pressure bolt is associated with risk, and monitoring of intracranial pressure will only improve outcome if it leads to effective intervention. The committee debated the variation in current practice and were not able to reach a consensus on the role of interventions to diagnose and treat intracranial hypertension, and so they made a recommendation for research. Return to recommendation for research Delayed cerebral ischaemia Recommendation 1.3.6 Why the committee made the recommendation There was very little evidence on delayed cerebral ischaemia so the committee based the recommendation on their clinical experience. They noted that current practice for managing delayed cerebral ischaemia is to maintain cerebral blood flow to prevent or limit cerebral infarction. Intravenous fluid is usually given to ensure euvolemia and if symptoms persist a vasopressor is administered to raise systemic blood pressure. The committee agreed with this approach, but added
