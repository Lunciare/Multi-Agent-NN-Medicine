For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on managing the culprit aneurysm. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review L: interventions to prevent rebleeding, evidence review C: severity scoring systems and evidence review M: timing of interventions to prevent rebleeding. Other NICE guidance on endovascular procedures for culprit aneurysms • NICE interventional procedures guidance on endovascular insertion of an intrasaccular wire-mesh blood-flow disruption device for intracranial aneurysms • NICE interventional procedures guidance on coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. 1.3 Monitoring and managing complications Monitoring and investigating for deterioration Transcranial doppler monitoring for deterioration 1.3.1 Do not use transcranial doppler monitoring to guide clinical management of an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage except in the context of clinical research. Unexplained neurological deterioration 1.3.2 For people with unexplained neurological deterioration after a subarachnoid haemorrhage, offer a non-contrast CT head scan as the first diagnostic investigation to determine the cause.
