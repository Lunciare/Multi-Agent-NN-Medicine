Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

that, without evidence of significant harms, a recommendation to consider nimodipine was appropriate in the acute management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The committee noted that the use of nimodipine is entrenched in clinical practice and was surprised at the lack of more compelling contemporary evidence for the use of enteral nimodipine in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The lack of recent evidence influenced their decision to make a weak recommendation for the use of nimodipine. The committee also made a recommendation for research on nimodipine to determine its place in current practice. Most of the evidence related to the use of oral nimodipine but some was drawn from studies that included intravenous nimodipine. The committee were aware that intravenous nimodipine has a high cost and were uncertain whether it is likely to be cost effective in patients who are unconscious or ventilated, or unable to swallow. The committee were also aware that some clinicians recommend administration of crushed nimodipine tablets to these patients via a nasogastric tube to avoid the need to use intravenous nimodipine. The committee noted that intravenous nimodipine may be useful for patients in whom poor absorption of the drug is suspected. Based on these observations
