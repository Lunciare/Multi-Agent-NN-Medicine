Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

recommendations Pain relief and neurological assessment Recommendations 1.1.8 and 1.1.9 Why the committee made the recommendations Although there was limited evidence on the use of specific analgesia or sedation, the committee agreed that pain in adults with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage should be managed with analgesics in line with standard clinical practice. Headache is usually treated with simple analgesics such as paracetamol, escalating to opioids as needed. The committee agreed that the sedative and pupillary effect of opioid analgesics should be taken into account when doing a neurological assessment, but should not preclude their use. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations generally reflect current practice and are not likely to result in changes. Return to recommendations Diagnosing a subarachnoid haemorrhage Recommendations 1.1.10 to 1.1.17 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee looked at evidence on non-contrast CT head scans, lumbar puncture and MRI. In the studies, the CT scans were reviewed by either a general radiologist or a neuroradiologist. There was good evidence showing that CT head scans done within 6 hours of symptom onset have a high diagnostic accuracy. Taking into account the invasive risks of lumbar puncture, the difficulty of monitoring patients during MRI and the
