The committee recognised that first-degree relatives of people who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage are at higher risk of intracranial arterial aneurysm than the general population. The committee agreed that investigating for aneurysms in first-degree relatives may produce health benefits but could also lead to harm, including unnecessary anxiety and a consequent increase in visits to GPs and emergency departments. Moreover, the optimal timing and frequency of investigations to detect and monitor intracranial aneurysms in first-degree relatives is unknown. The committee were aware that the NHS does not currently support routine screening for intracranial arterial aneurysms in relatives and any change in NHS policy could have a significant resource impact. The committee acknowledged that in current practice investigation is typically only recommended for people thought to have a significant risk of having a brain aneurysm that could rupture at some point in the future, and this would usually only apply to people with 2 or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. This reflects the advice given on the NHS website on screening for brain aneurysms. The committee agreed that the
