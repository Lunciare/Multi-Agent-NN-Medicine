Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

are therefore required to avoid missed diagnoses.

This guideline aims to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment.

It also identifies areas where evidence is lacking and recommends research to help inform future guidance.
