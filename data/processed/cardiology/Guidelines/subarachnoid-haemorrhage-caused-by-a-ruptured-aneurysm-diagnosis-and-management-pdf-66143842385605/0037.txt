the need to use intravenous nimodipine. The committee noted that intravenous nimodipine may be useful for patients in whom poor absorption of the drug is suspected. Based on these observations and their experience, the committee agreed that intravenous nimodipine should be reserved for patients in whom enteral administration is not suitable. Reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism The committee noted that NICE's guideline on reducing the risk of hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes assessment of bleeding risk and alternatives to pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, and is therefore suitable for people admitted to hospital with a subarachnoid haemorrhage before their aneurysm is secured and after it is secured. Short-course tranexamic acid Evidence on tranexamic acid in the management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage was mixed, and most was from small studies from the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the evidence suggested that short courses of intravenous tranexamic acid started immediately after diagnosis and before a planned intervention (endovascular coiling or neurosurgical clipping) reduce the risks of rebleeding. However, there was no evidence showing that they reduce death or disability. The committee were aware that short-course tranexamic acid is occasionally used in current practice if interventional treatment to secure the aneurysm is suitable but
