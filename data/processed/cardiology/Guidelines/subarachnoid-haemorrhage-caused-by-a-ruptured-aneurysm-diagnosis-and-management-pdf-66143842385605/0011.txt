determine the cause. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring and investigating for deterioration. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: monitoring for raised intracranial pressure and vasospasm. Hydrocephalus 1.3.3 Base a diagnosis of acute or chronic hydrocephalus on the person's symptoms and signs, and on a comparison of current and previous CT or other brain imaging. Acute hydrocephalus 1.3.4 Consider drainage or diversion of cerebrospinal fluid for people with neurological deterioration caused by acute hydrocephalus. Chronic hydrocephalus 1.3.5 For people with persistent or progressive symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of chronic hydrocephalus, consider drainage or permanent diversion of cerebrospinal fluid. If there is uncertainty about the likely benefit of permanent diversion, consider a trial of temporary drainage to assess the need for permanent diversion. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on hydrocephalus. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: detecting hydrocephalus and evidence review H: managing hydrocephalus. Delayed cerebral ischaemia
