Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured aneurysm: diagnosis and management

affect outcomes. They therefore agreed that transcranial doppler monitoring should only be used in the context of clinical research. The committee noted that there is increasing enthusiasm for the use of this modality and made a recommendation for research on transcranial doppler monitoring. There was no evidence on the investigation of unexplained neurological deterioration in people with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The committee agreed that in current practice unexplained neurological deterioration is initially investigated with a non-contrast CT scan, which can indicate the cause of deterioration including ventricular enlargement suggestive of hydrocephalus, cerebral ischaemia, intracranial haematoma or evidence of rebleeding. How the recommendations might affect practice In current practice the use of transcranial doppler monitoring varies widely. The recommendation is likely to stop this type of monitoring in centres that use it in routine practice. CT head scans are used to investigate unexplained neurological deterioration in current practice and the recommendation will not affect this. Return to recommendations Hydrocephalus Recommendations 1.3.3 to 1.3.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Acute hydrocephalus There was no evidence on diagnosing acute hydrocephalus. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that hydrocephalus is suspected on the basis of symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure
