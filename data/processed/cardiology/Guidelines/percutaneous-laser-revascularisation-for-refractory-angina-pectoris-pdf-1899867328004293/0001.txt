Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris

1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on percutaneous laser revascularisation (PLR) for refractory angina pectoris shows no efficacy and suggests that the procedure may pose unacceptable safety risks. Therefore, this procedure should not be used. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 Angina pectoris is chest discomfort, often described as pressure or pain, typically occurring on exertion. It is caused by inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle, usually because of coronary artery disease. Refractory angina is a severe angina form that cannot be controlled by normal medical or surgical treatment. 2.1.2 Angina treatment depends on symptoms, medical history and angiography findings. Treatments include anti-anginal medication and revascularisation interventions (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery). For patients with refractory angina, these treatments have either failed or are not clinically suitable. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris is carried out with the patient under local anaesthesia. A catheter is inserted through the femoral artery, and advanced to the heart under fluoroscopic guidance. Ischaemic areas are selected for treatment using echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scan and coronary angiography. A laser device is then used to create a number of channels in
