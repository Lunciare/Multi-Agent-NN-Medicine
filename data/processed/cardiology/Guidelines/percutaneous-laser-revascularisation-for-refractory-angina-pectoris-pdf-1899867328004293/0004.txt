were included in the meta-analysis, exercise tolerance differences at either 6 or 12 months were not significant. 2.3.5 In the RCTs of 298 and 141 patients there was no difference in the proportion of patients whose Canadian Cardiac Society Angina (CCSA) score improved by two or more classes at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.33). In an RCT of 82 patients, the proportion of patients with an improved CCSA score of two or more classes compared with baseline was not significantly different from patients treated with sham therapy at 12-month follow-up (35% [14/40]; 14% [6/42], respectively) (p = 0.04). 2.3.6 Specialist Advisers listed the key efficacy outcome as reduction of angina, which may or not be associated with objective measures, including improvement of perfusion scans, angina status and exercise capacity. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 A meta-analysis of five RCTs including 819 patients reported no difference in mortality (up to 30-day follow-up) between PLR-treated patients and medically managed patients (three RCTs), spinal cord stimulation (one RCT) or sham therapy (two RCTs) (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.4 to 4.9). 2.4.2 In six RCTs including 938 patients, the pooled myocardial infarction rate was higher in PLR-treated patients (7% [34/515]) than in the control groups (4%
