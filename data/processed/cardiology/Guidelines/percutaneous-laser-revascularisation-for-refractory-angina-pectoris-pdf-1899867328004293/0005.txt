95% CI 0.4 to 4.9). 2.4.2 In six RCTs including 938 patients, the pooled myocardial infarction rate was higher in PLR-treated patients (7% [34/515]) than in the control groups (4% [17/423]). One RCT of 221 patients reported higher left bundle branch block rates following PLR (5% [5/110]) compared with medical management (1% [1/111]) (significance and follow-up not stated). 2.4.3 Randomised controlled trials of 298 and 221 patients reported left ventricular perforation rates of 1% (2/196) and 3% (3/110), respectively, in PLR-treated patients (none were reported in patients treated with comparators; events occurring during 30-day follow-up or within 24 hours, respectively; significance not stated for either). In a case series of 25 patients treated with PLR, the myocardial perforation rate was 4% (1/ 25). A case series of 30 patients treated with PLR reported that 3% (1/ 30) of patients had pericardial tamponade during the procedure. 2.4.4 Among four RCTs, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack occurred more frequently in patients treated with PLR (4% [10/285]) than in patients in the control arms of the studies (2% [5/287]) (significance and follow-up not stated). 2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers listed adverse events reported in the literature as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and puncture site
