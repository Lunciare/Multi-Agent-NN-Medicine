fluoroscopic guidance. Ischaemic areas are selected for treatment using echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scan and coronary angiography. A laser device is then used to create a number of channels in the myocardium. 2.2.2 A number of different types of laser can be used for this procedure. 2.3 Efficacy Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the systematic review. 2.3.1 A meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1040 patients reported no difference in mortality at 12-month follow-up between PLR-treated patients and medically managed patients (three RCTs), spinal cord stimulation (one RCT) or sham therapy (two RCTs) (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 1.7). 2.3.2 An RCT of 298 patients reported no difference in mean myocardial perfusion test score (using single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] imaging; scoring system not described) between patients treated with high-dose PLR (defined as 20–25 laser pulses), low-dose PLR (defined as 10–15 laser pulses) or sham therapy (17.7 points, 19.3 points and 17.3 points, respectively at 6-month follow-up [p =
