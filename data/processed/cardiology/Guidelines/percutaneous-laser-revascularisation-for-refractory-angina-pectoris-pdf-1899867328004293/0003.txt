Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris

high-dose PLR (defined as 20–25 laser pulses), low-dose PLR (defined as 10–15 laser pulses) or sham therapy (17.7 points, 19.3 points and 17.3 points, respectively at 6-month follow-up [p = 0.35]). 2.3.3 An RCT of 221 patients comparing PLR with medical management reported no difference in mean left ventricular ejection fraction between PLR-treated patients (median 51%) and medically managed patients (median 50%) at 3-month follow-up (significance not stated). An RCT of 82 patients reported no difference in mean left ventricular ejection fraction between patients treated with PLR (64%) and sham therapy (63%) at 12-month follow-up (significance not stated). 2.3.4 A meta-analysis of three RCTs reported no difference in post-procedural exercise tolerance using the Bruce Protocol Stress Test (a treadmill test) in patients treated with PLR compared with other interventions. A meta- analysis of five RCTs reported that exercise tolerance for PLR-treated patients was 17.7 seconds greater than in patients treated with comparators at 12-month follow-up (95% CI 4.4 to 31.0). When only studies with adequate patient blinding to allocated treatment were included in the meta-analysis, exercise tolerance differences at either 6 or 12 months were not significant. 2.3.5 In the RCTs of 298 and 141 patients there was no difference
