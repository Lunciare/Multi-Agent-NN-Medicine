1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of totally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting does not appear adequate for this procedure to be used without special arrangements for consent and for audit or research. 1.2 Clinicians wishing to undertake totally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting should take the following actions. • Inform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts. • Ensure that patients understand the uncertainty about the procedure's safety and efficacy and provide them with clear written information. Use of NICE's information for the public is recommended. • Enter all patients having totally endoscopic robotically assisted coronary artery bypass grafting onto the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research's National Congenital Heart Disease Audit Database. Contact bartshealth.nicor-generalenquiries@nhs.net for details. 1.3 Publication of safety and efficacy outcomes will be useful. NICE may review the procedure upon publication of further evidence. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 In coronary artery disease, plaque deposits on the inner walls of the coronary arteries lead to narrowing or occlusion, and subsequently decreased oxygen supply to the heart.
