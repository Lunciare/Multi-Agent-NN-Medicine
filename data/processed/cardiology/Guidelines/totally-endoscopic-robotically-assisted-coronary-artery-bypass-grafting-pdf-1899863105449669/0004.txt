procedure was performed on the beating heart, the operating time ranged from 3 hours 30 minutes to 8 hours (mean 5 hours 47 minutes). In a further 37 patients (29 of whom had the beating heart procedure), the mean operating time for the early cases in the series was 4 hours 40 minutes, but this was reduced to 3 hours 6 minutes following the introduction of endoscopic stabilisation. The mean length of stay in an intensive care unit varied from 14 hours to 74 hours, and the mean total length of hospital stay ranged from 5.0 to 15.4 days. The upper limits for length of stay were following multiple vessel surgery.

They also noted that patency rates of coronary bypass grafts were not sufficiently well documented. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Conversion rates to open procedures (either mini-thoracotomy or full sternotomy) were reported in all case series and ranged from 19% (5 of 27) to 51% (19 of 37) of procedures initiated as TECAB. 2.4.2 There were no cases of operative mortality associated with the TECAB procedure (n=142). 2.4.3 In
