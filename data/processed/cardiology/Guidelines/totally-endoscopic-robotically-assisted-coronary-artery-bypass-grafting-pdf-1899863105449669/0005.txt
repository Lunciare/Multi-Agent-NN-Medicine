19% (5 of 27) to 51% (19 of 37) of procedures initiated as TECAB. 2.4.2 There were no cases of operative mortality associated with the TECAB procedure (n=142). 2.4.3 In a case series of 45 patients, operative complications included port access failure in 7% (3 of 45) of patients, prolonged cross clamp time in 9% (4 of 45), myocardial infarction in 2% (1 of 45), hypoxic brain damage in 2% (1 of 45) and internal thoracic artery injury in 2% (1 of 45) of patients. 2.4.4 In a series of 45 patients, 4% (2 of 45) needed secondary intervention because of bleeding from the site of anastomosis. There were no cases of wound infection at the port site throughout the series. For more details, refer to the sources of evidence. 2.4.5 The specialist advisors noted theoretical complications as myocardial infarction, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and fatal haemorrhage. They also noted that there is potential for stenosis or occlusion at the site of anastomosis. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 There are a number of other procedures for treating patients with coronary artery disease, but no good studies have been found that compare these with TECAB.
