Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
This guideline partially replaces TA73.
This guideline is the basis of QS21 and QS68.
This guideline should be read in conjunction with NG185.
Overview
This guideline covers assessing and diagnosing recent chest pain in people aged 18 and
over and managing symptoms while a diagnosis is being made. It aims to improve
outcomes by providing advice on tests (ECG, high-sensitivity troponin tests, multislice CT
angiography, functional testing) that support healthcare professionals to make a speedy
and accurate diagnosis.
NICE has also produced a guideline on managing acute coronary syndromes.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Adults with chest pain of recent onset, their families and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Providing information for people with chest pain
1.1.1.1 Discuss any concerns people (and where appropriate their family or carer/
advocate) may have, including anxiety when the cause of the chest pain is
unknown. Correct any misinformation. [2010]
1.1.1.2 Offer people a clear explanation of the possible causes of their symptoms and
the uncertainties. [2010]
1.1.1.3 Clearly explain the options to people at every stage of investigation. Make joint
decisions with them and take account of their preferences:
• Encourage people to ask questions.
• Provide repeated opportunities for discussion.
• Explain test results and the need for any further investigations. [2010]
1.1.1.4 Provide information about any proposed investigations using everyday, jargon-
free language. Include:
• their purpose, benefits and any limitations of their diagnostic accuracy
• duration

--- Страница 6 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
• level of discomfort and invasiveness
• risk of adverse events. [2010]
1.1.1.5 Offer information about the risks of diagnostic testing, including any radiation
exposure. [2010]
1.1.1.6 Address any physical or learning difficulties, sight or hearing problems and
difficulties with speaking or reading English, which may affect people's
understanding of the information offered. [2010]
1.1.1.7 Offer information after diagnosis as recommended in the relevant disease
management guidelines:
• NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes
• NICE guideline on stable angina
• NICE guideline on generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults
• NICE guideline on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia in
adults. [2010]
1.1.1.8 Explain if the chest pain is non-cardiac and refer people for further investigation if
appropriate. [2010]
1.1.1.9 Provide individual advice to people about seeking medical help if they have
further chest pain. [2010]
1.2 People presenting with acute chest pain
This section of the guideline covers the assessment and diagnosis of people with recent
acute chest pain or discomfort, suspected to be caused by an acute coronary syndrome
(ACS). The term ACS covers a range of conditions including unstable angina, ST-segment-
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI).
The guideline addresses assessment and diagnosis irrespective of setting, because

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
people present in different ways. For early management of these conditions, follow the
NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes.
1.2.1 Initial assessment and referral to hospital
1.2.1.1 Check immediately whether people currently have chest pain. If they are pain
free, check when their last episode of pain was, particularly if they have had pain
in the last 12 hours. [2010]
1.2.1.2 Determine whether the chest pain may be cardiac and therefore whether this
guideline is relevant, by considering:
• the history of the chest pain
• the presence of cardiovascular risk factors
• history of ischaemic heart disease and any previous treatment
• previous investigations for chest pain. [2010]
1.2.1.3 Initially assess people for any of the following symptoms, which may indicate an
ACS:
• pain in the chest and/or other areas (for example, the arms, back or jaw)
lasting longer than 15 minutes
• chest pain associated with nausea and vomiting, marked sweating,
breathlessness, or particularly a combination of these
• chest pain associated with haemodynamic instability
• new onset chest pain, or abrupt deterioration in previously stable angina,
with recurrent chest pain occurring frequently and with little or no exertion,
and with episodes often lasting longer than 15 minutes. [2010]
1.2.1.4 Do not use people's response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) to make a diagnosis.
[2010]
1.2.1.5 Do not assess symptoms of an ACS differently in men and women. Not all people
with an ACS present with central chest pain as the predominant feature. [2010]

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
1.2.1.6 Do not assess symptoms of an ACS differently in ethnic groups. There are no
major differences in symptoms of an ACS among different ethnic groups. [2010]
1.2.1.7 Refer people to hospital as an emergency if an ACS is suspected (see
recommendation 1.2.1.3) and:
• they currently have chest pain or
• they are currently pain free, but had chest pain in the last 12 hours, and a
resting 12-lead ECG is abnormal or not available. [2010]
1.2.1.8 If an ACS is suspected (see recommendation 1.2.1.3) and there are no reasons for
emergency referral, refer people for urgent same-day assessment if:
• they had chest pain in the last 12 hours, but are now pain free with a normal
resting 12-lead ECG or
• the last episode of pain was 12 to 72 hours ago. [2010]
1.2.1.9 Refer people for assessment in hospital if an ACS is suspected (see
recommendation 1.2.1.3) and:
• the pain has resolved and
• there are signs of complications such as pulmonary oedema.
Use clinical judgement to decide whether referral should be as an emergency
or urgent same-day assessment. [2010]
1.2.1.10 If a recent ACS is suspected in people whose last episode of chest pain was more
than 72 hours ago and who have no complications such as pulmonary oedema:
• carry out a detailed clinical assessment (see recommendations 1.2.4.2 and
1.2.4.3)
• confirm the diagnosis by resting 12-lead ECG and blood troponin level
• take into account the length of time since the suspected ACS when
interpreting the troponin level.

--- Страница 9 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
Use clinical judgement to decide whether referral is necessary and how
urgent this should be. [2010]
1.2.1.11 Refer people to hospital as an emergency if they have a recent (confirmed or
suspected) ACS and develop further chest pain. [2010]
1.2.1.12 When an ACS is suspected, start management immediately in the order
appropriate to the circumstances (see the section on immediate management of
a suspected acute coronary syndrome) and take a resting 12-lead ECG (see the
section on resting 12-lead ECG). Take the ECG as soon as possible, but do not
delay transfer to hospital. [2010]
1.2.1.13 If an ACS is not suspected, consider other causes of the chest pain, some of
which may be life-threatening (see recommendations 1.2.6.5, 1.2.6.7 and 1.2.6.8).
[2010]
1.2.2 Resting 12-lead ECG
1.2.2.1 Take a resting 12-lead ECG as soon as possible. When people are referred, send
the results to hospital before they arrive if possible. Recording and sending the
ECG should not delay transfer to hospital. [2010]
1.2.2.2 Follow local protocols for people with a resting 12-lead ECG showing regional
ST-segment elevation or presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB)
consistent with an acute STEMI until a firm diagnosis is made. Continue to
monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010]
1.2.2.3 Follow the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes for people with a resting
12-lead ECG showing regional ST-segment depression or deep T wave inversion
suggestive of a NSTEMI or unstable angina until a firm diagnosis is made.
Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010]
1.2.2.4 Even in the absence of ST-segment changes, have an increased suspicion of an
ACS if there are other changes in the resting 12-lead ECG, specifically Q waves
and T wave changes. Consider following the NICE guideline on acute coronary
syndromes if these conditions are likely. Continue to monitor (see

recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010]
1.2.2.5 Do not exclude an ACS when people have a normal resting 12-lead ECG. [2010]
1.2.2.6 If a diagnosis of ACS is in doubt, consider:
• taking serial resting 12-lead ECGs
• reviewing previous resting 12-lead ECGs
• recording additional ECG leads.
Use clinical judgement to decide how often this should be done. Note that
the results may not be conclusive. [2010]
1.2.2.7 Obtain a review of resting 12-lead ECGs by a healthcare professional qualified to
interpret them as well as taking into account automated interpretation. [2010]
1.2.2.8 If clinical assessment (as described in recommendation 1.2.1.10) and a resting
12-lead ECG make a diagnosis of ACS less likely, consider other acute conditions.
First consider those that are life-threatening such as pulmonary embolism, aortic
dissection or pneumonia. Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4).
[2010]
1.2.3 Immediate management of a suspected acute coronary
syndrome
Management of ACS should start as soon as it is suspected, but should not delay transfer
to hospital. The recommendations in this section should be carried out in the order
appropriate to the circumstances.
1.2.3.1 Offer pain relief as soon as possible. This may be achieved with GTN (sublingual
or buccal), but offer intravenous opioids such as morphine, particularly if an acute
myocardial infarction (MI) is suspected. [2010]
1.2.3.2 Offer people a single loading dose of 300 mg aspirin as soon as possible unless
there is clear evidence that they are allergic to it.

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
If aspirin is given before arrival at hospital, send a written record that it has been
given with the person.
Only offer other antiplatelet agents in hospital. Follow the NICE guideline on acute
coronary syndromes. [2010]
1.2.3.3 Do not routinely administer oxygen, but monitor oxygen saturation using pulse
oximetry as soon as possible, ideally before hospital admission. Only offer
supplemental oxygen to:
• people with oxygen saturation (SpO ) of less than 94% who are not at risk of
2
hypercapnic respiratory failure, aiming for SpO of 94% to 98%
2
• people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are at risk of
hypercapnic respiratory failure, to achieve a target SpO of 88% to 92% until
2
blood gas analysis is available. [2010]
Be aware that some pulse oximeters can underestimate or overestimate
oxygen saturation levels, especially if the saturation level is borderline.
Overestimation has been reported in people with dark skin. See also the NHS
England Patient Safety Alert on the risk of harm from inappropriate
placement of pulse oximeter probes.
1.2.3.4 Monitor people with acute chest pain, using clinical judgement to decide how
often this should be done, until a firm diagnosis is made. This should include:
• exacerbations of pain and/or other symptoms
• pulse and blood pressure
• heart rhythm
• oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry
• repeated resting 12-lead ECGs and
• checking pain relief is effective. [2010]
1.2.3.5 Manage other therapeutic interventions using the NICE guideline on acute

coronary syndromes. [2010]
1.2.4 Assessment in hospital for people with a suspected acute
coronary syndrome
1.2.4.1 Take a resting 12-lead ECG and a blood sample for high-sensitivity troponin I or
T measurement (see the section on use of biochemical markers for diagnosis of
an acute coronary syndrome) on arrival in hospital. [2010, amended 2016]
1.2.4.2 Carry out a physical examination to determine:
• haemodynamic status
• signs of complications, for example, pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock
and
• signs of non-coronary causes of acute chest pain, such as aortic dissection.
[2010]
1.2.4.3 Take a detailed clinical history unless a STEMI is confirmed from the resting
12-lead ECG (that is, regional ST-segment elevation or presumed new LBBB).
Record:
• the characteristics of the pain
• other associated symptoms
• any history of cardiovascular disease
• any cardiovascular risk factors and
• details of previous investigations or treatments for similar symptoms of chest
pain. [2010]

--- Страница 13 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
1.2.5 Use of biochemical markers for diagnosis of an acute
coronary syndrome
1.2.5.1 Do not use high-sensitivity troponin tests for people in whom ACS is not
suspected. [2016]
1.2.5.2 For people at high or moderate risk of MI (as indicated by a validated tool),
perform high-sensitivity troponin tests as recommended in the NICE diagnostics
guidance on myocardial infarction. [2016]
1.2.5.3 For people at low risk of MI (as indicated by a validated tool):
• perform a second high-sensitivity troponin test as recommended in the NICE
diagnostics guidance on myocardial infarction if the first troponin test at
presentation is positive.
• consider performing a single high-sensitivity troponin test only at
presentation to rule out NSTEMI if the first troponin test is below the lower
limit of detection (negative). [2016]
1.2.5.4 Ensure that patients understand that a detectable troponin on the first high-
sensitivity test does not necessarily indicate that they have had an MI. [2016]
1.2.5.5 Do not use biochemical markers such as natriuretic peptides and high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein to diagnose an ACS. [2010]
1.2.5.6 Do not use biochemical markers of myocardial ischaemia (such as ischaemia-
modified albumin) as opposed to markers of necrosis when assessing people
with acute chest pain. [2010]
1.2.5.7 When interpreting high-sensitivity troponin measurements, take into account:
• the clinical presentation
• the time from onset of symptoms
• the resting 12-lead ECG findings
• the pre-test probability of NSTEMI

• the length of time since the suspected ACS
• the probability of chronically elevated troponin levels in some people
• that 99th percentile thresholds for troponin I and T may differ between sexes.
[2010, amended 2016]
1.2.6 Making a diagnosis
1.2.6.1 When diagnosing MI, use the universal definition of myocardial infarction. This is
the detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers values [preferably cardiac
troponin (cTn)] with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper
reference limit and at least one of the following:
• symptoms of ischaemia
• new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new
LBBB
• development of pathological Q waves in the ECG
• imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall
motion abnormality
• identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography. [2010, amended
2016]
1.2.6.2 When a raised troponin level is detected in people with a suspected ACS,
reassess to exclude other causes for raised troponin (for example, myocarditis,
aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism) before confirming the diagnosis of ACS.
[2010]
1.2.6.3 When a raised troponin level is detected in people with a suspected ACS, follow
the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes until a firm diagnosis is made.
Continue to monitor (see recommendation 1.2.3.4). [2010]
1.2.6.4 When a diagnosis of ACS is confirmed, follow the NICE guideline on acute
coronary syndromes. [2010]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 15 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
1.2.6.5 Reassess people with chest pain without raised troponin levels and no acute
resting 12-lead ECG changes to determine whether their chest pain is likely to be
cardiac.
If myocardial ischaemia is suspected, follow the recommendations on stable
chest pain in this guideline (see the section on people presenting with stable
chest pain). Use clinical judgement to decide on the timing of any further
diagnostic investigations. [2010, amended 2016]
1.2.6.6 Do not routinely offer non-invasive imaging or exercise ECG in the initial
assessment of acute cardiac chest pain. [new 2016]
1.2.6.7 Only consider early chest computed tomography (CT) to rule out other diagnoses
such as pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection, not to diagnose ACS. [2010]
1.2.6.8 Consider a chest X-ray to help exclude complications of ACS such as pulmonary
oedema, or other diagnoses such as pneumothorax or pneumonia. [2010]
1.2.6.9 If an ACS has been excluded at any point in the care pathway, but people have
risk factors for cardiovascular disease, follow the appropriate guidance, for
example, the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease and the NICE guideline on
hypertension in adults. [2010]
1.3 People presenting with stable chest pain
This section of the guideline addresses the assessment and diagnosis of intermittent
stable chest pain in people with suspected stable angina.
1.3.1.1 Exclude a diagnosis of stable angina if clinical assessment indicates non-anginal
chest pain (see recommendation 1.3.3.1) and there are no other aspects of the
history or risk factors raising clinical suspicion. [2016]
1.3.1.2 If clinical assessment indicates typical or atypical angina (see recommendation
1.3.3.1), offer diagnostic testing (see the sections on diagnostic testing for people
in whom stable angina cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone,
additional diagnostic investigations and use of non-invasive functional testing for

--- Страница 16 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
myocardial ischaemia). [2016]
1.3.2 Clinical assessment
1.3.2.1 Take a detailed clinical history documenting:
• the age and sex of the person
• the characteristics of the pain, including its location, radiation, severity,
duration and frequency, and factors that provoke and relieve the pain
• any associated symptoms, such as breathlessness
• any history of angina, MI, coronary revascularisation or other cardiovascular
disease and
• any cardiovascular risk factors. [2010]
1.3.2.2 Carry out a physical examination to:
• identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease
• identify signs of other cardiovascular disease
• identify non-coronary causes of angina (for example, severe aortic stenosis,
cardiomyopathy) and
• exclude other causes of chest pain. [2010]
1.3.3 Making a diagnosis based on clinical assessment
1.3.3.1 Assess the typicality of chest pain as follows:
• Presence of three of the features below is defined as typical angina.
• Presence of two of the three features below is defined as atypical angina.
• Presence of one or none of the features below is defined as non-anginal
chest pain.

--- Страница 17 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
Anginal pain is:
• constricting discomfort in the front of the chest, or in the neck, shoulders,
jaw or arms
• precipitated by physical exertion
• relieved by rest or GTN within about 5 minutes. [2010, amended 2016]
1.3.3.2 Do not define typical and atypical features of anginal chest pain and non-anginal
chest pain differently in men and women. [2010]
1.3.3.3 Do not define typical and atypical features of anginal chest pain and non-anginal
chest pain differently in ethnic groups. [2010]
1.3.3.4 Take the following factors, which make a diagnosis of stable angina more likely,
into account when estimating people's likelihood of angina:
• age
• whether the person is male
• cardiovascular risk factors including:
－ a history of smoking
－ diabetes
－ hypertension
－ dyslipidaemia
－ family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD)
• other cardiovascular disease
• history of established CAD, for example, previous MI, coronary
revascularisation. [2010]
1.3.3.5 Unless clinical suspicion is raised based on other aspects of the history and risk

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
factors, exclude a diagnosis of stable angina if the pain is non-anginal (see
recommendation 1.3.3.1). Features which make a diagnosis of stable angina
unlikely are when the chest pain is:
• continuous or very prolonged and/or
• unrelated to activity and/or
• brought on by breathing in and/or
• associated with symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, tingling or
difficulty swallowing.
Consider causes of chest pain other than angina (such as gastrointestinal or
musculoskeletal pain). [2010]
1.3.3.6 Consider investigating other causes of angina, such as hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, in people with typical angina-like chest pain and a low likelihood
of CAD. [2010, amended 2016]
1.3.3.7 Arrange blood tests to identify conditions which exacerbate angina, such as
anaemia, for all people being investigated for stable angina. [2010]
1.3.3.8 Only consider chest X-ray if other diagnoses, such as a lung tumour, are
suspected. [2010]
1.3.3.9 If a diagnosis of stable angina has been excluded at any point in the care
pathway, but people have risk factors for cardiovascular disease, follow the
appropriate guidance, for example, the NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease
and the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults. [2010]
1.3.3.10 For people in whom stable angina cannot be excluded on the basis of the clinical
assessment alone, take a resting 12-lead ECG as soon as possible after
presentation. [2010, amended 2016]
1.3.3.11 Do not rule out a diagnosis of stable angina on the basis of a normal resting
12-lead ECG. [2010]
1.3.3.12 Do not offer diagnostic testing to people with non-anginal chest pain on clinical

1.3.3.13 A number of changes on a resting 12-lead ECG are consistent with CAD and may
indicate ischaemia or previous infarction. These include:
• pathological Q waves in particular
• LBBB
• ST-segment and T wave abnormalities (for example, flattening or inversion).
Note that the results may not be conclusive.
Consider any resting 12-lead ECG changes together with people's clinical
history and risk factors. [2010]
1.3.3.14 For people with confirmed CAD (for example, previous MI, revascularisation,
previous angiography) in whom stable angina cannot be excluded based on
clinical assessment alone, see recommendation 1.3.4.4 about functional testing.
[2010, amended 2016]
1.3.3.15 Consider aspirin only if the person's chest pain is likely to be stable angina, until a
diagnosis is made. Do not offer additional aspirin if there is clear evidence that
people are already taking aspirin regularly or are allergic to it. [2010]
1.3.3.16 Follow the NICE guideline on stable angina while waiting for the results of
investigations if symptoms are typical of stable angina. [2010]
1.3.4 Diagnostic testing for people in whom stable angina cannot
be excluded by clinical assessment alone
The Guideline Development Group emphasised that the recommendations in this guideline
are to make a diagnosis of chest pain, not to screen for CAD. Most people diagnosed with
non-anginal chest pain after clinical assessment need no further diagnostic testing.
However in a very small number of people, there are remaining concerns that the pain
could be ischaemic.

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
1.3.4.1 Include the typicality of anginal pain features (see recommendation 1.3.3.1) in all
requests for diagnostic investigations and in the person's notes. [2010, amended
2016]
1.3.4.2 Use clinical judgement and take into account people's preferences and
comorbidities when considering diagnostic testing. [2010]
1.3.4.3 Offer 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography if:
• clinical assessment (see recommendation 1.3.3.1) indicates typical or atypical
angina or
• clinical assessment indicates non-anginal chest pain but 12-lead resting ECG
has been done and indicates ST-T changes or Q waves. [2016]
1.3.4.4 For people with confirmed CAD (for example, previous MI, revascularisation,
previous angiography), offer non-invasive functional testing when there is
uncertainty about whether chest pain is caused by myocardial ischaemia. See the
section on use of non-invasive functional testing for myocardial ischaemia for
further guidance on non-invasive functional testing. An exercise ECG may be
used instead of functional imaging. [2010]
See also NICE's medical technologies guidance on HeartFlow FFRCT for
estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography. Using
HeartFlow FFR may avoid the need for invasive coronary angiography and
CT
revascularisation for some patients
1.3.5 Additional diagnostic investigations
1.3.5.1 Offer non-invasive functional imaging (see the section on use of non-invasive
functional testing for myocardial ischaemia) for myocardial ischaemia if 64-slice
(or above) CT coronary angiography has shown CAD of uncertain functional
significance or is non-diagnostic. [2016]
1.3.5.2 Offer invasive coronary angiography as a third-line investigation when the results
of non-invasive functional imaging are inconclusive. [2016]

1.3.6 Use of non-invasive functional testing for myocardial
ischaemia
1.3.6.1 When offering non-invasive functional imaging for myocardial ischaemia use:
• myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single photon emission computed
tomography (MPS with SPECT) or
• stress echocardiography or
• first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion or
• MR imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.
Take account of locally available technology and expertise, the person and
their preferences, and any contraindications (for example, disabilities, frailty,
limited ability to exercise) when deciding on the imaging method. [This
recommendation updates and replaces recommendation 1.1 of NICE's
technology appraisal guidance on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the
diagnosis and management of angina and myocardial infarction]. [2016]
1.3.6.2 Use adenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine as stress agents for MPS with
SPECT and adenosine or dipyridamole for first-pass contrast-enhanced MR
perfusion. [2010]
1.3.6.3 Use exercise or dobutamine for stress echocardiography or MR imaging for
stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. [2010]
1.3.6.4 Do not use MR coronary angiography for diagnosing stable angina. [2010]
1.3.6.5 Do not use exercise ECG to diagnose or exclude stable angina for people without
known CAD. [2010]

1.3.7 Making a diagnosis following investigations
Box 1 Definition of significant coronary artery disease
Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) found during CT coronary angiography is ≥
70% diameter stenosis of at least one major epicardial artery segment or ≥ 50%
diameter stenosis in the left main coronary artery:
Factors intensifying ischaemia
Such factors allow less severe lesions (for example, ≥ 50%) to produce angina:
• reduced oxygen delivery: anaemia, coronary spasm
• increased oxygen demand: tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy
• large mass of ischaemic myocardium: proximally located lesions
• longer lesion length.
Factors reducing ischaemia which may render severe lesions (≥ 70%)
asymptomatic:
• Well-developed collateral supply.
• Small mass of ischaemic myocardium: distally located lesions, old infarction in the
territory of coronary supply. [2016]
1.3.7.1 Confirm a diagnosis of stable angina and follow the NICE guideline on stable
angina when:
• significant CAD (see box 1) is found during invasive or 64-slice (or above) CT
coronary angiography or
• reversible myocardial ischaemia is found during non-invasive functional
imaging. [2016]

1.3.7.2 Investigate other causes of chest pain when:
• significant CAD (see box 1) is not found during invasive coronary angiography
or 64-slice (or above) CT coronary angiography or
• reversible myocardial ischaemia is not found during non-invasive functional
imaging. [2016]
1.3.7.3 Consider investigating other causes of angina, such as hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy or syndrome X, in people with typical angina-like chest pain if
investigation excludes flow-limiting disease in the epicardial coronary arteries.

Recommendations for research
In 2010, the guideline committee made the following recommendations for research. The
committee's full set of recommendations for research is detailed in the full guideline.
1 Cost-effectiveness of multislice CT coronary
angiography for ruling out obstructive coronary
artery disease in people with troponin-negative
acute coronary syndromes
Is multislice CT coronary angiography a cost-effective first-line test for ruling out
obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in people with suspected troponin-negative
acute coronary syndromes?
Why this is important
Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines state that in troponin-negative ACS
with no ST-segment change on the ECG, 'a stress test is recommended… in patients with
significant ischaemia during the stress test, coronary angiography and subsequent
revascularisation should be considered'. Yet stress testing has relatively low sensitivity and
specificity for diagnosing CAD in this group of people. Therefore a significant proportion of
at-risk people are missed while others with normal coronary arteries are subjected to an
unnecessary invasive coronary angiogram. Multislice CT coronary angiography is highly
sensitive and provides a potentially useful means for early rule-out of CAD in troponin-
negative acute coronary disease. We need to know whether it is cost effective compared
with exercise ECG as a first test in the diagnostic work-up of this group.
2 Refining the use of telephone advice in people
with chest pain
In what circumstances should telephone advice be given to people calling with chest pain?
Is the appropriateness influenced by age, sex or symptoms?

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 25 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
Why this is important
The telephone is a common method of first contact with healthcare services, and
produces a near uniform emergency response to chest pain symptoms. Such a response
has considerable economic, social and human costs. Research should be conducted to
clarify if an emergency response in all circumstances is appropriate, or if there are
identifiable factors such as age, sex or associated symptoms that would allow a modified
response and a more appropriate use of resources.
3 Establishing a national registry for people who
are undergoing initial assessment for stable angina
Can a national registry of people presenting with suspected angina be established to allow
cohort analysis of treatments, investigations and outcomes in this group? Such a registry
would provide a vital resource for a range of important research projects, including:
• development and validation of a new score for assessing the pre-test probability of
disease, addressing outstanding uncertainties in the estimation of the pre-test
probability of CAD based on simple measures made at initial assessment (history,
examination, routine bloods, resting 12-lead ECG)
• assessment of the extent to which new circulating biomarkers add additional
information to measures made at initial assessment
• provision of a framework for trial recruitment without significant work-up bias allowing
evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic test performance of CT-based, MR,
echocardiography and radionuclide technologies.
Why this is important
A national prospective registry of consecutive people with suspected stable angina before
initial diagnostic testing does not currently exist in the UK or in any other country.
Establishing such a registry would offer the following methodological strengths: statistical
size, representative patients without work-up bias, contemporary data. This would
overcome key problems in much of the existing evidence base.
Accurate assessment of pre-test likelihood of coronary disease is needed to inform the
cost-effective choice of investigative technologies such as CT coronary calcium scoring

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 26 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
for people with chest pain that may be caused by myocardial ischaemia. The data on
which pre-test likelihood is based date from 1979 in a US population and may not be
applicable to contemporary UK populations. There remain continuing uncertainties about
the initial assessment of people with suspected stable angina. For example, the possible
contributions of simple clinical measures such as body mass index, routine blood markers
(for example, haemoglobin) or novel circulating biomarkers to estimates of the pre-test
likelihood of CAD are not known and require further assessment in the whole population
and in predefined subgroups including ethnic minorities.
4 Information about presenting and explaining
tests
All people presenting with chest pain will need to decide whether to accept the diagnostic
and care pathways offered. How should information about the diagnostic pathway and the
likely outcomes, risks and benefits, with and without treatment, be most effectively
presented to particular groups of people, defined by age, ethnicity and sex?
Why this is important
Methods of communication (both the content and delivery) will be guided by current
evidence-based best practice. Controlled trials should be conducted based on well-
constructed randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of different
methods of communication on the understanding of the person with chest pain. Such
studies might consider a number of delivery mechanisms, including advice and discussion
with a clinician or a specialist nurse, as well as specific information leaflets or visual data.
Any trials should also investigate the feasibility of introducing a suggested guideline
protocol to be used with all people presenting with chest pain when faced with options
concerning their clinical pathway.
Only by clearly explaining and then discussing the proposed diagnostic and care pathways
can the healthcare professional be reasonably certain that informed consent has been
obtained and that a patient's moral, ethical and spiritual beliefs, expectations, and any
misconceptions about their condition, have been taken into account. Consideration should
be given to any communication problems the person may have.

Putting this guideline into practice
NICE has produced tools and resources to help you put this guideline into practice.
Putting recommendations into practice can take time. How long may vary from guideline to
guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed.
Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.
Changes recommended for clinical practice that can be done quickly – like changes in
prescribing practice – should be shared quickly. This is because healthcare professionals
should use guidelines to guide their work – as is required by professional regulating bodies
such as the General Medical and Nursing and Midwifery Councils.
Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not
doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of
recommendations were all implemented at once).
Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on
their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to
recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.
Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:
1. Raise awareness through routine communication channels, such as email or
newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all
relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice
straight away.
2. Identify a lead with an interest in the topic to champion the guideline and motivate
others to support its use and make service changes, and to find out any significant issues
locally.
3. Carry out a baseline assessment against the recommendations to find out whether
there are gaps in current service provision.
4. Think about what data you need to measure improvement and plan how you will collect
it. You may want to work with other health and social care organisations and specialist

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 28 ---
Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
groups to compare current practice with the recommendations. This may also help identify
local issues that will slow or prevent implementation.
5. Develop an action plan, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and
make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to
implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases.
6. For very big changes include milestones and a business case, which will set out
additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could
develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior
organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information
professionals.
7. Implement the action plan with oversight from the lead and the project group. Big
projects may also need project management support.
8. Review and monitor how well the guideline is being implemented through the project
group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant
boards and local partners.
NICE provides a comprehensive programme of support and resources to maximise uptake
and use of evidence and guidance. See our into practice pages for more information.

Recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin: assessment and diagnosis (CG95)
Context
Conditions causing chest pain or discomfort, such as an acute coronary syndrome or
angina, have a potentially poor prognosis, emphasising the importance of prompt and
accurate diagnosis. Treatments are available to improve symptoms and prolong life, hence
the need for this guideline.
This guideline covers the assessment and diagnosis of recent onset chest pain or
discomfort of suspected cardiac origin. In deciding whether chest pain may be cardiac and
therefore whether this guideline is relevant, a number of factors should be taken into
account. These include the person's history of chest pain, their cardiovascular risk factors,
history of ischaemic heart disease and any previous treatment, and previous investigations
for chest pain.
For pain that is suspected to be cardiac, there are two separate diagnostic pathways
presented in the guideline. The first is for people with acute chest pain and a suspected
acute coronary syndrome, and the second is for people with intermittent stable chest pain
in whom stable angina is suspected. The guideline includes how to determine whether
myocardial ischaemia is the cause of the chest pain and how to manage the chest pain
while people are being assessed and investigated.
As far as possible, the recommendations in this guideline have been listed in the order in
which they will be carried out and follow the diagnostic pathways. But, as there are many
permutations at each decision point, it has been necessary to include frequent cross-
referencing to avoid repeating recommendations several times.
The algorithms presented in full guideline show the two diagnostic pathways.
This guideline does not cover the diagnosis and management of chest pain that is
unrelated to the heart (for example, traumatic chest wall injury, herpes zoster infection)
when myocardial ischaemia has been excluded. The guideline also recognises that in
people with a prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease, chest pain or discomfort is not
necessarily cardiac.
The term 'chest pain' is used throughout the guideline to mean chest pain or discomfort.
The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product

Update information
November 2016: New recommendations have been added for the assessment and
diagnosis of acute chest pain and the assessment and diagnosis of stable chest pain.
These are marked as [2016].
Where recommendations end [2010], the evidence has not been reviewed since the
original guideline.
We have also made some changes without an evidence review:
• some 2010 recommendations have been updated to align with the 2016
recommendations
• some recommendations have been updated to clarify the use of high-sensitivity
troponin testing
• some recommendations have been updated to remove reference to estimate of the
likelihood of coronary artery disease
• reference to autopsy as a diagnostic criterion has been removed.
These recommendations are marked [2010, amended 2016].
Minor changes since publication
October 2022: We added text to indicate that pulse oximetry may be less reliable in
people with dark skin. We also added a link to the NHS patient safety alert on the risk of
harm from inappropriate placement of pulse oximeter probes. See recommendation 1.2.3.3.
November 2020: We linked to the updated guideline on acute coronary syndromes.
August2020: We linked to updated diagnostics guidance in recommendations on use of
biochemical markers for diagnosis (section 1.2.5).
