days and • good functional status and • a life expectancy of 1 year or more and • a low risk of bleeding. [2012] See NICE's interventional procedures guidance on ultrasound-enhanced, catheter-directed thrombolysis for deep vein thrombosis. PE 1.6.2 Consider pharmacological systemic thrombolytic therapy for people with PE and haemodynamic instability(see also the section on anticoagulation treatment for PE with haemodynamic instability). [2012] 1.6.3 Do not offer pharmacological systemic thrombolytic therapy to people with PE and haemodynamic stability with or without right ventricular dysfunction (see also the section on anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE). If the person develops haemodynamic instability, refer to recommendation 1.6.2. [2015] See NICE's interventional procedures guidance on ultrasound-enhanced, catheter-directed thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism. 1.7 Mechanical interventions Inferior vena caval filters 1.7.1 Do not offer an inferior vena caval (IVC) filter to people with proximal DVT or PE unless: • it is part of a prospective clinical study or • anticoagulation is contraindicated or a PE has occurred during anticoagulation treatment (see recommendations 1.7.2 and 1.7.3). [2020] 1.7.2 Consider an IVC filter for people with proximal DVT or PE when anticoagulation treatment is contraindicated. Remove the IVC filter when anticoagulation treatment is no longer contraindicated and
