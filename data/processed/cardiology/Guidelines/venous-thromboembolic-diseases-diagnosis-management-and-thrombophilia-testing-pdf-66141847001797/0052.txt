Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

effect of UFH wears off relatively quickly if treatment needs to be stopped. The committee did not review the evidence on thrombolytic therapy and the 2012 recommendation that it be considered for this population is unchanged. Anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE with renal impairment or established renal failure Renal impairment increases the risk of anticoagulants accumulating in the body, which can increase bleeding risk. There was very limited evidence on anticoagulant treatment for VTE in people with renal impairment. Based on their expertise and the SPC for each treatment, the committee agreed that LMWH, UFH or DOACs are suitable options to treat VTE in people with renal impairment. However, dabigatran is not an option for people with more severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance 15 ml/min to 29 ml/min) based on its SPC. For people with estimated creatinine clearance less than 15 ml/min the main options are UFH or LMWH given either on their own or with a VKA until oral anticoagulation is established and in the therapeutic range. The committee emphasised the importance of following the SPCs and locally agreed protocols, and seeking advice from specialist colleagues or a multidisciplinary team to ensure correct dosing and monitoring.
