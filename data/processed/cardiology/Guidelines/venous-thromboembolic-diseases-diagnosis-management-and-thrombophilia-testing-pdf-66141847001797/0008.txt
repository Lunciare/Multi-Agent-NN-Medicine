quantitative test. [2020] 1.1.14 When using a point-of-care or laboratory D-dimer test, consider an age-adjusted D-dimer test threshold for people aged over 50. [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on D-dimer testing. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: D-dimer testing in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Signs or symptoms of PE 1.1.15 For people who present with signs or symptoms of PE, such as chest pain, shortness of breath or coughing up blood, assess their general medical history, do a physical examination and offer a chest X-ray to exclude other causes. [2012] Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (the PERC rule) 1.1.16 If clinical suspicion of PE is low based on the overall clinical impression (from general medical history, physical examination and any initial investigations such as electrocardiography or chest X-ray), and other diagnoses are feasible, consider using the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) to help determine whether any further investigations for PE are needed. Be aware that the PERC rule has not been validated in people with COVID-19. [2020, amended
