testing are immediately available, laboratory testing is preferable because it provides more rigorous quality assurance and greater certainty of diagnostic accuracy. However, if laboratory-based testing is not immediately available, the committee were in agreement that offering immediate point-of-care testing is more beneficial for patients than delaying diagnosis by waiting for laboratory testing. Although point-of-care tests are more expensive than laboratory tests, a cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the additional cost may be offset by faster results that reduce the need for additional GP time and unnecessary interim anticoagulation. Evidence on fully quantitative point-of-care D-dimer tests for DVT suggested that they are as accurate as laboratory tests and more accurate than qualitative or semi-quantitative tests. There is little evidence on these tests for PE but the committee agreed that the evidence on DVT is applicable to PE because it is very unlikely that there is a biological reason that the accuracy of the tests would differ between these groups. The committee were aware that quantitative tests are more commonly used than qualitative or semi- quantitative tests. However, because the latter types of tests are still used in some services, they specified that point-of-care tests should be fully quantitative. Age-adjusted D-dimer test thresholds
