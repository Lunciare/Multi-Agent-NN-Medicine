Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

expected to lower costs by reducing the need for clinical visits, INR monitoring and managing bleeding events. The use of aspirin may increase for people who decline long- term anticoagulation. This may reduce VTE recurrence in people who would otherwise not receive treatment. Return to recommendations Inferior vena caval filters Recommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.4 Why the committee made the recommendations There was little good evidence on inferior vena caval (IVC) filters. The evidence in a number of populations, including people about to have surgery, people with cancer, people with a high risk of having a subsequent PE and people with a high risk of a poor outcome from a subsequent PE, did not show a benefit from IVC filters. The committee therefore agreed that the use of IVC filters should be restricted to prospective clinical studies (including but not limited to prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials) unless anticoagulation is contraindicated or a PE has occurred during anticoagulation treatment. They made a recommendation for research to further investigate the effectiveness of IVC filters. For people with proximal DVT or PE and a contraindication to anticoagulation treatment, a small amount of new evidence has become available since the 2012 guideline
