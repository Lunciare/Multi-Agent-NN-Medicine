(2003) Evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of suspected deep-vein thrombosis. DVT likely (Wells score 2 points or more) 1.1.3 Offer people with a likely DVT Wells score (2 points or more): • a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan, with the result available within 4 hours if possible (if the scan result cannot be obtained within 4 hours follow recommendation 1.1.4) • a D-dimer test if the scan result is negative.
