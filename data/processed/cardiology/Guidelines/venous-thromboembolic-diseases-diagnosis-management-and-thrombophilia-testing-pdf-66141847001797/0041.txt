or semi- quantitative tests. However, because the latter types of tests are still used in some services, they specified that point-of-care tests should be fully quantitative. Age-adjusted D-dimer test thresholds In people aged over 50, there was limited prospective evidence available for DVT and only retrospective evidence available for PE. This evidence suggested that adjusting D-dimer test thresholds for age improves the usefulness of these tests for ruling out VTE in this age group. The evidence also suggested that age adjustment does not reduce the accuracy of the tests in identifying VTE. The committee noted that adjusting test thresholds for age could be beneficial in reducing anxiety and unnecessary imaging for people with suspected DVT or PE. Although the evidence was not plentiful, the committee agreed that, taken together with the potential benefits, it was sufficient to support a recommendation suggesting age adjustment in D-dimer test thresholds for people aged over 50. How the recommendations might affect practice Services that do not currently provide quantitative point-of-care D-dimer tests may need to acquire new equipment and provide training on how to conduct and interpret the tests. It is uncertain what impact this would have on practice, because it is unclear what
