Therefore, the committee decided that the current pathway for diagnosing PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), including the use of D-dimer testing, is still appropriate for people with COVID-19. Healthcare professionals would still have a high suspicion of PE for people who rapidly deteriorate with symptoms indicative of PE. The committee noted that people with COVID-19 who need supplemental oxygen or other respiratory support will be receiving prophylactic or therapeutic doses of anticoagulation depending on the severity of illness. They agreed that it may not be appropriate to stop this management, even when the results of the imaging investigations are negative. This is because immunothrombosis occurring at the capillary level associated with COVID-19 is beyond the sensitivity of standard CT pulmonary angiogram. NICE's guideline on managing COVID-19 has advice on when to stop anticoagulation for primary prevention in this population. How the recommendations might affect practice The following text covers the 2023 changes to the recommendations. Imaging investigations are indicated in people with a low-risk Wells score but positive D-dimer test. People with COVID-19, a low-risk Wells score and elevated D-dimers are likely to have imaging based on the current diagnostic pathway. As there may be other reasons for elevated
