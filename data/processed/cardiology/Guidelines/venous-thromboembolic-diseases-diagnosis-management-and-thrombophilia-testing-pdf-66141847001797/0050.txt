is less cost effective than other treatments. However, the committee decided not to make a recommendation precluding its use because they were aware that it may be needed in rare circumstances. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) was associated with increased bleeding complications, greater recurrence rates of VTE and higher mortality rates than other treatments so the committee did not think it should be offered routinely. They recognised that it may be a suitable option for some people with VTE. Anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE in people at extremes of body weight (less than 50 kg or more than 120 kg) Body weight can influence the absorption, distribution and elimination of anticoagulants, and their therapeutic effect can be altered at extremes of body weight. Because of this, and based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that body weight should be taken into account and therapeutic monitoring considered when choosing anticoagulation for people whose weight is outside the range of 50 kg to 120 kg. There was little evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different anticoagulants for people at extremes of body weight, and the evidence was limited to obesity defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 and above
