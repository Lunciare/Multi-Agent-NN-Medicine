Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

of direct-acting oral anticoagulants based on individual patient data What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with each other, with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) plus a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), with LMWH alone, with placebo and with aspirin for the initial and long-term treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) based on individual patient data from existing trials? [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on anticoagulation treatment for confirmed DVT or PE. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: pharmacological treatment in people with suspected or confirmed DVT and/or PE. 3 Prediction tools compared with clinical judgement What is the prognostic accuracy of a tool to predict both VTE recurrence and major bleeding compared with clinical judgement in people with unprovoked proximal DVT or PE? [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on long-term anticoagulation for secondary prevention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review F: what factors determine the optimum duration of pharmacological
