Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

V/Q SPECT or V/Q planar scan cannot be done immediately, offer interim therapeutic anticoagulation (see the section on interim therapeutic anticoagulation for suspected DVT or PE). [2012, amended 2020] 1.1.19 If PE is identified by CTPA, V/Q SPECT or V/Q planar scan: • offer or continue anticoagulation treatment (see the section on anticoagulation treatment for confirmed DVT or PE) or • if anticoagulation treatment is contraindicated, consider a mechanical intervention (see the section on mechanical interventions). For people with PE and haemodynamic instability, see the section on thrombolytic therapy. [2012, amended 2020] 1.1.20 If PE is not identified by CTPA, V/Q SPECT or V/Q planar scan: • consider a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan if DVT is suspected [2012, amended 2020] • if DVT is not suspected: － stop interim therapeutic anticoagulation, but do not stop: ◇ long-term anticoagulation when used for secondary prevention [2012, amended 2020], or ◇ short-term anticoagulation when used for primary VTE prevention in people with COVID-19 (see the recommendations on VTE prophylaxis in the NICE guideline on managing COVID-19) [2023] － think about alternative diagnoses [2012, amended 2020] － tell the person that it is not likely they have PE. Discuss with them the signs
