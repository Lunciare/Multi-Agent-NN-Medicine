This recommendation is expected to increase its use in a subgroup of people in whom clinical suspicion of PE is low and for whom discharge is being considered. Increased use of PERC can be expected to reduce the need for D-dimer testing and imaging for people with none of the PERC criteria for PE, leading to some reductions in waiting times in primary care and emergency departments. It will also help to avoid unnecessary anticoagulation treatment. However, the overall impact of this recommendation is not expected to be substantial because of the limited population it affects. Return to recommendation Outpatient treatment for low-risk pulmonary embolism Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.4 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee noted that outpatient treatment for people with PE who have a low risk of poor outcomes is increasingly being used in settings such as ambulatory care units. There was limited evidence comparing outpatient with inpatient treatment for PE so the committee were unable to reach firm conclusions about the overall benefits and risks of outpatient treatment. However, no evidence
