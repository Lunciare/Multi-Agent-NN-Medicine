increase community prescribing of anticoagulation treatment. However, more use of DOACs may also increase the need for expensive reversal agents. Current VTE management for people at extremes of body weight is not expected to change substantially. For people with haemodynamically unstable PE, UFH is currently used in clinical practice and the recommendation is not expected to affect the frequency of its use in this group. More people with renal impairment are likely to be offered a DOAC or LMWH, reducing the use of UFH. This can be expected to produce cost savings by increasing the number of people with renal impairment who can have outpatient care for VTE. For people with active cancer, it is expected that there will be an increase in the use of DOACs and a concomitant decrease in the use of more expensive treatments such as LMWH alone. This will also reduce the amount of district nursing support needed to provide assistance with parenteral therapies. For people with VTE and antiphospholipid syndrome, the use of DOACs is expected to decrease.
