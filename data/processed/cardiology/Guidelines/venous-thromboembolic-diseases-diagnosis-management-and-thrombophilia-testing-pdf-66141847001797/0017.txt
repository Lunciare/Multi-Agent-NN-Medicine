on: • DVT or PE in people at extremes of body weight • PE with haemodynamic instability • DVT or PE with renal impairment or established renal failure • DVT or PE with active cancer • DVT or PE with triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. [2020] 1.3.8 Offer either apixaban or rivaroxaban to people with confirmed proximal DVT or PE (but see recommendations 1.3.11 to 1.3.20 for people with any of the clinical features listed in recommendation 1.3.7). If neither apixaban nor rivaroxaban is suitable offer: • LMWH for at least 5 days followed by dabigatran or edoxaban or • LMWH concurrently with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for at least 5 days, or until the international normalised ratio (INR) is at least 2.0 in 2 consecutive readings, followed by a VKA on its own. [2020] 1.3.9 Do not routinely offer unfractionated heparin (UFH) with a VKA to treat confirmed proximal DVT or PE unless the person has renal impairment or established renal failure (see recommendations 1.3.13 and 1.3.14) or an increased risk of bleeding. [2020] 1.3.10 Do not routinely offer self-management or self-monitoring of INR to people who have had DVT or PE and are having treatment with a VKA.
