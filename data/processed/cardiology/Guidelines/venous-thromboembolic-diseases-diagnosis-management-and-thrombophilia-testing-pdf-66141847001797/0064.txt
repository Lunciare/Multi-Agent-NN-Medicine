Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

in services that do not currently provide these reviews. Giving patients who stop anticoagulation treatment information on signs and symptoms and a point of contact should ensure that a comprehensive safety net is in place. Discussions about the benefits and risks of stopping or continuing anticoagulation treatment may increase the time needed for consultations, particularly if a prediction tool is used as part of the decision-making process. Using HAS-BLED can be expected to reduce long-term anticoagulation treatment in people with a high risk of major bleeding. The recommendations are not expected to change practice for people with renal impairment or extremes of body weight. For people with antiphospholipid syndrome, it is expected that DOAC use will decrease, with a concomitant increase in the use of LMWH with a VKA. For people with active cancer, DOAC use can be expected to increase, with LMWH on its own becoming a less common treatment. For people with none of these clinical features, greater use of DOACs, particularly apixaban, for long-term treatment can be expected to lower costs by reducing the need for clinical visits, INR monitoring and managing bleeding events. The use of aspirin may increase for people who decline long- term anticoagulation.
