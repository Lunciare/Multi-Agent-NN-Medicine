3 months (6 months for people with active cancer) after an unprovoked DVT or PE. Base the decision on the balance between the person's risk of VTE recurrence and their risk of bleeding. Discuss the risks and benefits of long-term anticoagulation with the person, and take their preferences into account. [2020] 1.4.4 Explain to people with unprovoked DVT or PE and a low bleeding risk that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment are likely to outweigh the risks. [2020] 1.4.5 Do not rely solely on predictive risk tools to assess the need for long-term anticoagulation treatment. [2020] 1.4.6 Consider using the HAS-BLED score for major bleeding risk to assess the risk of major bleeding in people having anticoagulation treatment for unprovoked proximal DVT or PE. Discuss stopping anticoagulation if the HAS-BLED score is 4 or more and cannot be modified. [2020] 1.4.7 Take into account the person's preferences and their clinical situation when selecting an anticoagulant for long-term treatment. [2020] 1.4.8 For people who do not have renal impairment, active cancer, established triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome or extreme body weight (less than 50 kg or more than 120 kg): • offer continued treatment with the current anticoagulant if it is
