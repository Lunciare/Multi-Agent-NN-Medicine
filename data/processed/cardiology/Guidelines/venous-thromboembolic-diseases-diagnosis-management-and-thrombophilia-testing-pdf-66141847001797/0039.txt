Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

test. People with COVID-19, a low-risk Wells score and elevated D-dimers are likely to have imaging based on the current diagnostic pathway. As there may be other reasons for elevated D-dimer levels in the COVID-19 population and because the evidence suggests an increase in false-positive D-dimer results, these recommendations may lead to an increase in the number of people who have imaging but turn out not to have VTE. However, the incidence rate for COVID-19-related hospital admissions is currently much lower compared with that during the early pandemic, so imaging rates may not increase substantially in practice. VTE prevention with anticoagulation for people with COVID-19 who need supplemental oxygen or other respiratory support is standard practice. Therefore, the recommendations for continuing this management following a negative imaging result is unlikely to result in a change in practice or an increase in resources.

However, if laboratory-based testing is not immediately available, the
