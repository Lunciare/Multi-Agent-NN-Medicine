4 hours, offer people with a DVT Wells score of 2 points or more: • a D-dimer test, then • interim therapeutic anticoagulation (see the section on interim therapeutic anticoagulation for suspected DVT or PE) and • a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan with the result available within 24 hours. [2012, amended 2020] 1.1.5 For people with a positive proximal leg vein ultrasound scan: • offer or continue anticoagulation treatment (see the section on anticoagulation treatment for confirmed DVT or PE) or • if anticoagulation treatment is contraindicated, offer a mechanical intervention (see the section on mechanical interventions). For people with symptomatic iliofemoral DVT, see the section on thrombolytic therapy. [2012] 1.1.6 For people with a negative proximal leg vein ultrasound scan and a positive D-dimer test result: • stop interim therapeutic anticoagulation, but do not stop: － long-term anticoagulation when used for secondary prevention [2012, amended 2020], or － short-term anticoagulation when used for primary venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in people with COVID-19 (see the recommendations on VTE prophylaxis in the NICE guideline on managing COVID-19) [2023] • offer a repeat proximal leg vein ultrasound scan 6 to 8 days later and － if the repeat scan result is
