Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

study. In particular, the apixaban study did not include patients with provoked VTE unless it was caused by a persistent risk factor, so a larger proportion of patients in the apixaban study had unprovoked VTE compared with the rivaroxaban studies. This made it difficult to compare the results of the studies. Because of this, the committee were not confident that apixaban should be the only option for a DOAC and recommended a choice of apixaban or rivaroxaban. Sensitivity analyses were carried out varying the drug prices but these analyses did not change any of the conclusions from the economic model. The committee recognised that apixaban or rivaroxaban might not be suitable for everyone, so they included options for treatment with LMWH followed by dabigatran or edoxaban, or LMWH with a VKA. The committee also made a recommendation for research on DOACs compared with each other and with other anticoagulants. The evidence did not support a recommendation for fondaparinux. It showed that fondaparinux is more likely to result in bleeding and is less cost effective than other treatments. However, the committee decided not to make a recommendation precluding its use because they were aware that it may be needed in rare
