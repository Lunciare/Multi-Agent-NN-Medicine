affect the action of these drugs. In studies that recruited only people with active cancer and VTE, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and LMWH were found to be similarly effective, although bleeding complications were more frequent with DOACs. These studies did not look at apixaban or dabigatran. In studies that looked at apixaban and dabigatran and in which a small number of people within the study population had active cancer, the effects of apixaban and dabigatran were similar in people with and without cancer. Economic evidence based on these studies showed apixaban to be the most cost- effective option, although the evidence for apixaban was based on a relatively small number of people. The committee agreed that, if suitable, a DOAC should be considered to treat VTE in people with active cancer but, because of the limitations of the evidence, they could not be more specific about the choice of DOAC. The committee noted the potential for interactions between anticoagulants and other drugs people with active cancer may be taking, such as chemotherapy drugs, and the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding with some types of tumours. The evidence suggested a higher rate of gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeds in people with active
