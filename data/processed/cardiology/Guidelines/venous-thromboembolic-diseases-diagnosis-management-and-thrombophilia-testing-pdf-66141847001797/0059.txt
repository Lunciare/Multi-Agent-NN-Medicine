For people with unprovoked DVT or PE, the benefits and risks of continuing anticoagulation treatment are less certain and the committee agreed that they need to be carefully balanced. However, for most people with a low bleeding risk, the committee agreed that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment outweigh the risks. The committee agreed that the
