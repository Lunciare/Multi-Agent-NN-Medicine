They agreed that, although the decision between a temporary and permanent IVC filter would be made on a case-by-case basis, most IVC filters are likely to be temporary. It is therefore prudent to have a plan in place for removal of the IVC filter at the time of fitting it, to ensure it is removed promptly when no longer needed. How the recommendations might affect practice It is expected that the overall impact of the recommendations will be to reduce the use of IVC filters. For people with VTE at acute risk of thrombosis, clinicians may fit an IVC filter as part of a clinical trial. Return to recommendations Investigations for cancer Recommendations 1.8.1 and 1.8.2 Why the committee made the recommendations Unprovoked VTE is associated with an increased risk of cancer, which may be undiagnosed when the VTE occurs. The committee agreed that a physical examination and review of medical history (including previous investigations such as
