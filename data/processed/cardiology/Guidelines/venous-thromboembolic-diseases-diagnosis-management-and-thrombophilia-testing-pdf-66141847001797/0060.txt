Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

be carefully balanced. However, for most people with a low bleeding risk, the committee agreed that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment outweigh the risks. The committee agreed that the tools currently available to predict the risk of recurrence of VTE or the risk of bleeding are not sufficiently accurate or validated to be used as the sole basis for a decision, and that using them in such a manner might result in incorrect predictions and subsequent harm to the person. However, they also agreed that, in certain circumstances, a clinical prediction tool can be a useful adjunct to discussion with people offered long-term anticoagulation treatment. For bleeding risk, evidence on the HAS-BLED score showed that it can identify people with unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who are at particularly high risk of major bleeding and might benefit from stopping anticoagulation. For VTE recurrence, there was very limited evidence, and that evidence suggested that these tools are not sufficiently accurate to be used in practice. Because of the uncertainty in predicting VTE recurrence and the risk of major bleeding, the committee made recommendations for research to develop a new prediction tool for VTE recurrence and major bleeding combined and research
