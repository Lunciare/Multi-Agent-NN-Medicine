Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

choosing an interim anticoagulant, clinicians should always take individual clinical circumstances into account, including whether the person is at an extreme of body weight, has PE with haemodynamic instability, renal impairment, active cancer or established triple positive antiphospholipid syndrome. Anticoagulation treatment for confirmed DVT or PE Evidence suggested that treatment with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is less likely to result in bleeding complications than treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Additionally, people taking a DOAC benefit by being able to have an oral treatment and avoid the frequent monitoring that is necessary with other types of anticoagulation treatment. Within the DOACs, there was evidence showing that apixaban is the most cost-effective option. because it results in the fewest bleeds. Rivaroxaban is the second most cost- effective option and only slightly less cost effective than apixaban. However, the committee had reservations about this evidence because the inclusion criteria setting out which patients took part in the studies were not the same in each study. In particular, the apixaban study did not include patients with provoked VTE unless it was caused by a persistent risk factor, so a larger proportion of patients in the
