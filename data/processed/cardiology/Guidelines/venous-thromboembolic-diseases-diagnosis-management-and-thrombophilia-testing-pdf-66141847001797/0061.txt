predicting VTE recurrence and the risk of major bleeding, the committee made recommendations for research to develop a new prediction tool for VTE recurrence and major bleeding combined and research to compare this tool with clinical judgement. Continuing or changing current treatment The committee agreed that there are risks involved in switching anticoagulant treatment, particularly if there have been no adverse events with the current treatment. They also expressed concerns about convenience for people who are asked to switch from a DOAC with no monitoring to a VKA regimen with frequent monitoring, or problems with adherence if switching from a VKA to a DOAC. Based on these concerns and their clinical experience, the committee agreed that if treatment is continued beyond 3 months, the first option for most people should be to continue the current treatment if it is well tolerated.

However, the committee were not entirely convinced by this evidence because the study of apixaban had stricter inclusion criteria, setting out which patients took part, than the other studies. Additionally, the studies recorded a very low number of major bleeds, leading
