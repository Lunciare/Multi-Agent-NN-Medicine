Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

The committee emphasised the importance of following the SPCs and locally agreed protocols, and seeking advice from specialist colleagues or a multidisciplinary team to ensure correct dosing and monitoring. Anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE with active cancer There was very little evidence available on the duration of anticoagulation treatment for people with DVT or PE and active cancer. The committee agreed, based on the evidence and their experience, that anticoagulation treatment should continue for 3 to 6 months and then be reviewed. They noted that most of the evidence on VTE in people with active cancer looked at treatment over a period of 6 months, but agreed that some people need shorter treatment durations and it is good practice to determine the length of treatment on a case-by-case basis. The effectiveness of DOACs compared with other anticoagulation treatments in people with active cancer has not been studied sufficiently to enable firm conclusions to be made. Evidence from studies in people without cancer may not be applicable because cancer could affect the action of these drugs. In studies that recruited only people with active cancer and VTE, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and LMWH were found to be similarly effective, although bleeding complications
