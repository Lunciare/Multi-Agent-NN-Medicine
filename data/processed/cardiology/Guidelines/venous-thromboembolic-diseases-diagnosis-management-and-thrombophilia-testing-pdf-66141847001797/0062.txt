the study of apixaban had stricter inclusion criteria, setting out which patients took part, than the other studies. Additionally, the studies recorded a very low number of major bleeds, leading to uncertainty about the effects of the different anticoagulation treatments on the likelihood of major bleeding. Apixaban was shown by the economic evidence to be the most cost-effective long-term treatment so the committee agreed that switching to apixaban should be considered as an option for people currently taking a DOAC other than apixaban. Sensitivity analyses were carried out varying the drug prices but these analyses did not change any of the conclusions from the economic model. There was a lack of evidence on longer-term treatment for people with renal impairment, active cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome or extremes of body weight. Based on their clinical experience, the committee agreed that continuing the current treatment, if it is well tolerated, should be considered for people in these groups, taking into account their preferences and clinical situation. For people who do not continue anticoagulation treatment, evidence showed that aspirin is better than no treatment at reducing DVT or PE recurrence for up to 2 years, although there was no difference in DVT or PE
