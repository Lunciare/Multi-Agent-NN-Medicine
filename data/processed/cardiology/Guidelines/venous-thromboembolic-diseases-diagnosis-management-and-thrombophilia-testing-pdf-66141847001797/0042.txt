to acquire new equipment and provide training on how to conduct and interpret the tests. It is uncertain what impact this would have on practice, because it is unclear what proportion of primary care centres already use point-of-care testing. Facilities for point-of- care testing are only needed if rapid laboratory testing is not available. The number of D-dimer tests that are adjusted for age is likely to increase, leading to a reduction in the number of additional investigations for VTE. Return to recommendations Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (the PERC rule) Recommendation 1.1.16 Why the committee made the recommendation In people with signs or symptoms of PE, but in whom clinical suspicion of PE is low (based on the overall clinical impression and that other diagnoses are feasible), there was some evidence showing that applying the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule) can safely identify people who are unlikely to benefit from any further investigations for PE. The committee agreed that using the PERC rule can reduce anxiety and avoid unnecessary D-dimer testing, imaging and interim anticoagulation treatment for people with a low probability of PE and none of the PERC criteria. However, the evidence was limited so the committee agreed
