Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review F: what factors determine the optimum duration of pharmacological treatment for DVT or PE in people with a VTE? 4 Lower-dose thrombolysis for people with acute PE and right ventricular dysfunction Does lower-dose thrombolysis reduce the risk of major bleeding and improve outcomes for people with acute PE and right ventricular dysfunction? [2015] 5 Diagnosis of DVT What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of a whole-leg ultrasound scan compared with a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan in the diagnosis of acute DVT? [2012] Other recommendations for research 6 Treatment strategy for people who use intravenous drugs What is the optimal pharmacological treatment strategy for DVT or PE in people who use intravenous drugs? [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale section on anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE in people who use intravenous drugs. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: pharmacological treatment in people with suspected or confirmed DVT and/or PE. 7 Predicting VTE recurrence and major bleeding What is
