drugs, and the possibility of an increased risk of bleeding with some types of tumours. The evidence suggested a higher rate of gastrointestinal and genitourinary bleeds in people with active cancer having treatment with a DOAC compared with those having LMWH. The committee agreed that DOACs may be unsuitable for people with tumours that are associated with an increased risk of these types of bleeds (such as people with gastrointestinal malignancies). However, they agreed that treatment decisions for people with active cancer need to be made on a case-by-case basis. The committee made provision for people with active cancer if a DOAC is not suitable by including LMWH alone and LMWH with a VKA as alternatives. Although LMWH alone is commonly used in practice and is the only licensed option to treat VTE in active cancer, it is not cost effective compared with DOACs and reducing its use would be beneficial in conserving NHS resources. Sensitivity analyses were carried out varying the drug prices but these analyses did not change any of the conclusions from the economic model. The committee recognised that there are circumstances in which LMWH is the most suitable treatment option and agreed that it could be
