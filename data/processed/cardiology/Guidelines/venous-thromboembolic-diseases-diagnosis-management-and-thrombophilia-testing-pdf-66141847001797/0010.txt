(2000) Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patients' probability of pulmonary embolism: increasing the model's utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer. PE likely (Wells score more than 4 points) 1.1.18 For people with a likely PE Wells score (more than 4 points): • offer a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) immediately if possible or • for people with an allergy to contrast media, severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) or a high risk from irradiation, assess the suitability of a ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V/Q SPECT) scan or, if a V/Q SPECT scan is not available, a V/Q planar scan, as an alternative to CTPA. If a CTPA, V/Q SPECT or V/Q planar scan cannot be done immediately, offer interim therapeutic anticoagulation (see the section on interim therapeutic anticoagulation for suspected DVT or PE).
