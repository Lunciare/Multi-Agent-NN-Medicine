Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

comparative effectiveness of different anticoagulants for people at extremes of body weight, and the evidence was limited to obesity defined as a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 and above rather than body weight. However, the committee noted that the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) for several anticoagulants specify body weight rather than obesity and agreed that using the same criterion as the SPCs would make the recommendations clearer and easier to implement. Because of the uncertainty about the most effective anticoagulant treatment for this group, the committee included a subgroup based on body weight in their recommendation for research on DOACs compared with each other and with other anticoagulants. Anticoagulation treatment for PE with haemodynamic instability The committee agreed that intravenous UFH should be offered to people with PE and haemodynamic instability because the anticoagulant effect needs to be carefully controlled for these people. People with haemodynamic instability have poor peripheral circulation and because UFH is administered intravenously it allows for a more certain therapeutic effect. Additionally, the anticoagulant effect of UFH wears off relatively quickly if treatment needs to be stopped. The committee did not review the evidence on thrombolytic therapy and the 2012 recommendation that it be
