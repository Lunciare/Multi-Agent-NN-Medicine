[2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendations on reviewing anticoagulation treatment and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on long-term anticoagulation for secondary prevention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in: • evidence review F: what factors determine the optimum duration of pharmacological treatment for DVT or PE in people with a VTE? • evidence review D: pharmacological treatment in people with suspected or confirmed deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism (for recommendations 1.4.1 and 1.4.7 to 1.4.11). Evidence review G: economic modelling report for pharmacological treatment also underpins recommendation 1.4.8. 1.5 Information and support for people having anticoagulation treatment 1.5.1 Give people having anticoagulation treatment verbal and written information about: • how to use anticoagulants • how long to take anticoagulants • possible side effects of anticoagulants and what to do if these occur • how other medications, foods and alcohol can affect oral anticoagulation treatment • any monitoring needed for their anticoagulant treatment • how anticoagulants may affect their dental treatment • taking anticoagulants if they are planning pregnancy
