Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

VKA to this group. Anticoagulation treatment for DVT or PE in people who use intravenous drugs VTE can be difficult to treat in people who use intravenous drugs. They often have problems with access to medical care and adherence to prescribed treatments. There is a lack of good evidence on the comparative clinical and cost effectiveness of treatments and doses for VTE in this population. The committee made a recommendation for research with the aim of improving VTE treatment in people who use intravenous drugs. Treatment failure The committee acknowledged that VTE can recur despite anticoagulant treatment and used their knowledge and experience to outline steps that can be taken if treatment fails. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations are expected to lead to increased use of DOACs, particularly apixaban and rivaroxaban, to treat suspected and confirmed VTE. This should reduce the need for resources to monitor INR, manage bleeding complications and administer parenteral anticoagulation. The recommendation to start anticoagulation treatment before blood test results are available may increase community prescribing of anticoagulation treatment. However, more use of DOACs may also increase the need for expensive reversal agents. Current VTE management for people at extremes of body weight
