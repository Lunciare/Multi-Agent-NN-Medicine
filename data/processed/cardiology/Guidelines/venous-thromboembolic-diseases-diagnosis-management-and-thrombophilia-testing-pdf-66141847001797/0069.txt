Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

an increased risk of cancer, which may be undiagnosed when the VTE occurs. The committee agreed that a physical examination and review of medical history (including previous investigations such as imaging) are worthwhile precautions for people who have had an apparently unprovoked DVT or PE. However, the evidence did not show any benefit from further investigations for cancer for people who have no signs or symptoms. Moreover, these investigations can be costly, time consuming, potentially invasive or pose a radiation risk, and cause anxiety. The committee therefore agreed that further investigations for cancer should not be offered to people without relevant signs or symptoms. How the recommendations might affect practice A physical examination and a review of medical history is current practice for people with unprovoked DVT or PE. The recommendations can be expected to reduce costs by reducing further investigations for cancer in people without symptoms or signs. Return to recommendations Context In venous thromboembolism (VTE), a blood clot forms in a vein, usually in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. This is known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. The blood clot can dislodge and travel in the blood, particularly to the pulmonary arteries. This is
