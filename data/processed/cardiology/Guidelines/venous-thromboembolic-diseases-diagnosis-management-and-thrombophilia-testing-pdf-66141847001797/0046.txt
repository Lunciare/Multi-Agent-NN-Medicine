limited evidence comparing outpatient with inpatient treatment for PE so the committee were unable to reach firm conclusions about the overall benefits and risks of outpatient treatment. However, no evidence showed that outpatient treatment is less effective or less safe than inpatient treatment for people with low-risk PE. The committee agreed that outpatient care offers substantial benefits for people with PE and for hospital services and should be considered for those with suspected or confirmed low-risk PE. The committee emphasised the importance of clear arrangements for monitoring and follow-up to ensure that outpatients receive the same quality of care as inpatients. They noted that specialist services with expertise in thrombosis are not available at all times and agreed that it is important for people with VTE to know who they can contact if they need advice outside normal service hours. How the recommendations might affect practice Outpatient treatment for PE is common practice in many services with ambulatory care units. These recommendations might lead to the establishment of ambulatory care units in services that do not currently have them, and this will reduce hospital stays in those services.
