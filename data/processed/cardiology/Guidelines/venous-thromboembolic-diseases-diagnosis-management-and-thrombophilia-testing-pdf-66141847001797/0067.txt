recommendation to offer temporary IVC filters to people who cannot have anticoagulation treatment. However, they recognised that these people have a high risk of recurrent VTE and a limited number of alternative treatments, so agreed that a recommendation to consider an IVC filter for them is justified. They also agreed to retain the 2012 advice to remove the IVC filter when anticoagulation is no longer contraindicated, adding that anticoagulation treatment should be established before the IVC filter is removed. There was very limited evidence on the use of IVC filters for people who have a PE while taking anticoagulation treatment for an initial proximal DVT or PE. The evidence suggested a reduction in short-term mortality from all causes in people in this group who had an IVC filter fitted. Because of the limited amount of evidence, the committee agreed that IVC filters could be considered for people in this group only after problems with adherence or other causes of hypercoagulability have been excluded, and different anticoagulation treatments or treatment regimens have been explored. The committee reasoned that, in many cases, optimising anticoagulation treatment will obviate the need for an IVC filter. The committee noted that the type of IVC filter
