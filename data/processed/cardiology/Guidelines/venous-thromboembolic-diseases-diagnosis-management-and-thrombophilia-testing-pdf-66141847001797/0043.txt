D-dimer testing, imaging and interim anticoagulation treatment for people with a low probability of PE and none of the PERC criteria. However, the evidence was limited so the committee agreed to recommend that the PERC rule be considered as part of initial assessment for PE. The committee noted that the largest randomised trial evaluating the implementation of the PERC rule used a percentage to quantify low risk (less than 15% risk of PE). However, the committee agreed with the recent report by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) on diagnosing PE in emergency departments, that this judgement is difficult to quantify in practice. They therefore decided that using wording such as 'low risk' would be less confusing. The committee described that identification of low risk is based on clinical gestalt informed by general medical history, physical examination and initial investigations. For example, a healthcare professional may consider using the PERC to rule out PE from the differential diagnosis if the presenting patient was young with new onset atraumatic chest pain or shortness of breath, but who had no concerning historical or clinical features for PE and a feasible alternative diagnosis (such as lower respiratory tract infection). The committee noted that
