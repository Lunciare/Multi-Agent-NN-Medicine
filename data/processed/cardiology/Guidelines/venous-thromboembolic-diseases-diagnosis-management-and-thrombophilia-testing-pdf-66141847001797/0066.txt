Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testing

effectiveness of IVC filters. For people with proximal DVT or PE and a contraindication to anticoagulation treatment, a small amount of new evidence has become available since the 2012 guideline was published. This evidence did not show a clear difference in outcomes such as mortality and VTE recurrence between people who were given IVC filters and those who were not. One study found evidence of an increase in DVT occurrence (in people with an undefined initial VTE event) at 1 year in the group given IVC filters. However, based on their experience and knowledge of IVC filters, the committee agreed that they can help to reduce the risk of PE when therapeutic anticoagulation cannot be given. The committee also had concerns about the inherent risks involved in using IVC filters, including the invasive nature of the procedure for placing them and the potential for complications such as migration or fracture of the filter. In light of this, the committee agreed that the evidence was not sufficient to retain the 2012 recommendation to offer temporary IVC filters to people who cannot have anticoagulation treatment. However, they recognised that these people have a high risk of recurrent VTE and a limited number
