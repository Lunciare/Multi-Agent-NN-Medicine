in the prasugrel group (clopidogrel 781 of 6,795 patients [12.1%] and prasugrel 643 of 6,813 patients [9.9%], hazard ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73 to 0.90], p<0.001). In the clopidogrel group there were also statistically significantly more non-fatal myocardial infarctions (clopidogrel 620 of 6,795 patients [9.5%] and prasugrel 475 of 6,813 patients [7.3%], hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.85], p<0.001); deaths from cardiovascular causes, non- fatal myocardial infarctions or urgent target vessel revascularisation (clopidogrel 798 of 6,795 patients [12.3%] and prasugrel 652 of 6,813 patients [10.0%], hazard ratio 0.81 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.89], p<0.001); stent thromboses (clopidogrel 142 of 6,795 patients [2.4%] and prasugrel 68 of 6,813 patients [1.1%], hazard ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.36 to 0.64], p<0.001); and deaths from cardiovascular causes, non- fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal stroke or rehospitalisations for ischaemia (clopidogrel 938 of 6,795 patients [14.6%] and prasugrel 797 of 6,813 patients [12.3%], hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.76 to 0.92], p<0.001) than in the prasugrel group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the number of deaths from cardiovascular causes (clopidogrel 150 of 6,795 patients [2.4%] and prasugrel 133 of 6,813 patients [2.1%], hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.70
