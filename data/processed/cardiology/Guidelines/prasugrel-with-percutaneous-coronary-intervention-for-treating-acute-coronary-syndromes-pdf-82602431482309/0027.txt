It stated that although prasugrel reduces major adverse cardiac events and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndromes at high risk of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stents, there is no evidence that prasugrel reduces mortality. The professional group commented that prasugrel should not be offered to people aged 75 years or older, weighing less than 60 kg or with a past history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke.
