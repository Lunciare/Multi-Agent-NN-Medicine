Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

primary end point at 30 days (clopidogrel 7.0% and prasugrel 5.0%, hazard ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.82], p<0.0001) as well as at the 15-month follow up (clopidogrel 4.5% and prasugrel 3.6%, hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.97], p=0.027). 4.1.13 The Assessment Group stated that no statistically significant difference in non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding was noted in the core clinical cohort between patients in the prasugrel and clopidogrel treatment arms. However, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of clopidogrel when major and minor bleeding events were combined (clopidogrel 3.0% and prasugrel 3.9%, hazard ratio 1.26 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.57], p=0.03). The Assessment Group commented that analysis of the net clinical benefit outcome (death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or non-CABG-related non-fatal TIMI major bleeding) favoured the use of prasugrel in the core clinical cohort (clopidogrel 641 of 5,383 patients [12.5%] and prasugrel 522 of 5,421 patients [10.2%], hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89], p<0.001). 4.1.14 The Assessment Group stated that statistically significant differences in favour of prasugrel were reported for the outcomes of definite stent thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.29 to 0.60], p<0.001) and definite or probable
