of any variety (STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina). 4.2 Cost effectiveness Manufacturer's economic model 4.2.1 The manufacturer submitted an economic model similar to the model described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention. The economic model had a Markov model structure with 2 phases. The first phase spanned the duration of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and the second phase extrapolated outcomes and costs beyond the trial, up until death or a time horizon of 40 years. Rather than using data from the trial directly in the model, separate risk equations for primary end point events were obtained from individual patient data from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. These risk equations were then used to model events and hospitalisation. Mortality was modelled based on adjustment of population life tables, to reflect the impact on longer-term mortality of the events modelled over the short term. Patients entered the model at the point of experiencing an acute coronary syndromes event, immediately before having percutaneous coronary intervention. Some aspects of the submitted economic model had been updated based on feedback during the original appraisal of prasugrel. These revisions included: • the sensitivity analysis
