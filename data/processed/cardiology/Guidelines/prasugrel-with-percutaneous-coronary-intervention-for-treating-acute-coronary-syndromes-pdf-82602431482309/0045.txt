Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

both treatment arms and the incremental difference would be expected to be minimal. 4.2.22 The Assessment Group considered that it was inappropriate to calculate an ICER for the overall core clinical cohort. It reported separate results from the model for the 4 patient subgroups: STEMI with diabetes, STEMI without diabetes, unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes and unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes. For each subgroup, deterministic cost-effectiveness results were presented at 1, 15, 10, 20 and 40 years after the initial percutaneous coronary intervention. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness results were presented at 5-year and 40-year follow up. 4.2.23 For the STEMI with diabetes subgroup, the ICER was £31,915 per QALY gained at year 1 of follow up (incremental cost £230, incremental QALYs 0.007). The ICER decreased to £4,603 per QALY gained at year 5 (incremental cost £269, incremental QALYs 0.059), £2,139 per QALY gained at year 10 (incremental cost £275, incremental QALYs 0.129), and at year 40 it was £1,640 per QALY gained (incremental cost £447, incremental QALYs 0.272). The Assessment Group conducted one-way sensitivity analyses, the results of which indicated that uncertainty from individual model parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in this subgroup.
