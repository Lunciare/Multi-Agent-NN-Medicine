Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial can be generalised to patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI in England. However, taking into account the slight advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel beyond the period when preloading is relevant, and that the ICERs are well within the range usually considered to be cost effective by NICE (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained), the Committee concluded that prasugrel can be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with clopidogrel for treating people with unstable angina or NSTEMI with and without diabetes. 4.3.17 Regarding the cost-effectiveness of prasugrel compared with ticagrelor, the Committee noted that neither the Assessment Group nor the manufacturer had included ticagrelor in their economic modelling. Given the lack of a cost-effectiveness analysis, the Committee concluded that it was unable to calculate a precise ICER for this comparison. It agreed, however, that given the similar cost-effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel and that of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, and their similar treatment costs, it was reasonable to accept that prasugrel is similarly cost-effective to ticagrelor. 5 Implementation 5.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013
