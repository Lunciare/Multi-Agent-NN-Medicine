Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

without diabetes. The Committee noted that, for patients with STEMI and diabetes, the 40-year ICER from the Assessment Group's model was £1,600 per QALY gained. For patients with STEMI and without diabetes, the 40-year ICER from the Assessment Group's model was £6,600 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that prasugrel was a cost-effective use of NHS resources compared with clopidogrel for treating people with STEMI with and without diabetes. 4.3.16 The Committee considered the ICER for a 10 mg dose of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI with and without diabetes. The Committee noted that for patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI and diabetes, prasugrel dominated clopidogrel at the 40-year time horizon. For patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes, the 40-year ICER from the Assessment Group's model was £4,700 per QALY gained. It accepted that the difference between the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and clinical practice in the time delay between diagnosis and treatment meant that there is uncertainty about whether the results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial can be generalised to patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI in England. However, taking into account the slight advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel beyond the period
