Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

hospital admissions with a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction recorded between April 2012 and March 2013 in the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), 40% were STEMIs and 60% were NSTEMIs. The average age of people with STEMI and NSTEMI was 65 years and 72 years respectively. Twice as many men had myocardial infarctions as women. 2.4 Long-term management of acute coronary syndromes includes the use of aspirin in combination with a thienopyridine (clopidogrel, prasugrel) or acyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine (ticagrelor). NICE has produced guidelines on myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation: The acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) and unstable angina and NSTEMI: early management (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes). NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction with ST-segment-elevation (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) recommends that after STEMI, patients treated with clopidogrel in combination with low-dose aspirin during the first 24 hours after the myocardial infarction should continue with treatment for at least 4 weeks. Thereafter, standard treatment, including low-dose aspirin, should be given unless there are other indications to continue clopidogrel in combination with aspirin. In its guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI: early management (now replaced
