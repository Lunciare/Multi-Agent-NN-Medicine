the trial after their 6-month or 9-month visit. 4.1.22 In the overall trial population, a statistically significant benefit of ticagrelor was found for the primary composite end point (ticagrelor 9.8% and clopidogrel 11.67%, hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.77 to 0.92], p<0.001). When the individual components of the composite end point were disaggregated, the reduction in the primary end point was driven by statistically significant reductions in death from vascular causes (hazard ratio 0.79 [95% CI 0.69 to 0.91], p=0.001) and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.75 to 0.95], p=0.005). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 arms of the trial for the end points of major bleed (primary safety end point) and major fatal or life-threatening bleed. However, statistically significant differences in favour of clopidogrel were evident for the end points of total major and minor bleed (hazard ratio 1.11 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.20], p=0.008) and non-CABG-related major bleed (hazard ratio 1.19 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.38], p=0.03). 4.1.23 The Assessment Group stated that the TITRON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials were not comparable, and so a comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor based on these trials was inappropriate. It noted that TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO
