Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

which indicated that uncertainty from individual model parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in this subgroup. Varying discount rates for costs and outcomes had the largest effect on the ICER, but it remained within the range of £4,000 to £9,000 per QALY gained. Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up resulted in a higher estimated ICER of £7,073 per QALY gained obtained from small incremental cost and QALY estimates (incremental cost £609 and incremental QALYs 0.086). 4.2.25 For the unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes subgroup, the ICER at year 1 of follow up was £76,856 per QALY gained (incremental cost £259, incremental QALYs 0.003). At year 5 of follow up, the ICER for prasugrel decreased to £2,846 per QALY gained (incremental cost £96, incremental QALYs 0.034). From year 10 and beyond prasugrel dominated (that is, was less costly and more effective than) clopidogrel (at year 40 of follow up: incremental cost −£77, incremental QALYs 0.176). The Assessment Group undertook one-way sensitivity analyses, which indicated that uncertainty from event incidence and fatality rates had the largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between −£1,000 and £400 per QALY gained).
