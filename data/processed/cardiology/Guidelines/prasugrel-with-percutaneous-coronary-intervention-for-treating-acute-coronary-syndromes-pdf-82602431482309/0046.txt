Group conducted one-way sensitivity analyses, the results of which indicated that uncertainty from individual model parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in this subgroup. Varying discount rates for costs and outcomes had the largest effect on the ICER, but it remained within the range of £1,000 to £2,500 per QALY gained. Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up for this subgroup resulted in a higher estimated ICER of £1,732 per QALY gained (incremental cost £515 and incremental QALYs 0.297). 4.2.24 For the STEMI without diabetes subgroup, the ICER at year 1 of follow up was £224,302 per QALY gained (incremental cost £422, incremental QALYs 0.002). The ICER decreased to £29,607 per QALY gained at year 5 of follow up (incremental cost £465, incremental QALYs 0.016), £13,370 per QALY gained at year 10 (incremental cost £482, incremental QALYs 0.036), and at year 40 the ICER had decreased to £6,626 per QALY gained (incremental cost £555, incremental QALYs 0.084). The Assessment Group conducted one-way sensitivity analyses, the results of which indicated that uncertainty from individual model parameters had a minor effect on the ICER in this subgroup.
