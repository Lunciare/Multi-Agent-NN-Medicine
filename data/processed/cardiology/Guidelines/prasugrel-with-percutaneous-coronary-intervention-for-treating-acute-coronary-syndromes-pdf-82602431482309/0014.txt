stated that the core clinical cohort was identified post hoc and defined by regulatory criteria, and that the study should therefore be considered as an exploratory analysis. 4.1.10 The Assessment Group stated that the patients in the overall trial population of TRITON-TIMI 38 and the core clinical cohort as reported in Wiviott et al. (2011) appeared to be similar in terms of baseline characteristics. These included the proportion of patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI (74% and 73% respectively), the proportion of males (74% and 79%), and the proportion of patients with diabetes (23% and 22%). The Assessment Group noted that the proportions of patients reported were not presented by treatment trial arm. However, it also noted that Wiviott et al. stated that patients in the core clinical cohort randomised to prasugrel and clopidogrel were well matched, and that 50% of the core clinical cohort was randomised to prasugrel. 4.1.11 For the patients in the core clinical cohort, prasugrel showed a clinically significant and robust reduction in the primary end point compared with clopidogrel (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke; clopidogrel 569 of 5,383 patients [11.0%] and prasugrel 433 of 5,421 patients [8.3%], hazard ratio 0.74
