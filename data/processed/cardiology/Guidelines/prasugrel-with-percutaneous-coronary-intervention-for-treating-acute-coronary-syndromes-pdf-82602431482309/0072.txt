Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

Group's economic data were obtained from the CAPRIE study, which had a maximum follow up of 3 years, and that these data were used to extrapolate results of the health economic analysis up to 40 years. The Committee agreed that, although the extrapolation of short-term clinical data over longer time horizons could only increase overall uncertainty, it is necessary in economic modelling and longer time horizons are generally preferable. The Committee noted that the time horizon within which the results would fall to within the range usually considered to be cost effective by NICE (£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained) is likely to be much less than 40 years. The Committee considered that despite uncertainty in the ICERs arising from this 40 year extrapolation, the results were sufficiently robust to permit their use, and concluded that the 40 year time horizon was the most appropriate for decision making. 4.3.15 The Committee considered the ICERs for a 10 mg dose of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in patients with STEMI with and without diabetes. The Committee noted that, for patients with STEMI and diabetes, the 40-year ICER from the Assessment Group's model was £1,600 per QALY gained. For patients with STEMI and
