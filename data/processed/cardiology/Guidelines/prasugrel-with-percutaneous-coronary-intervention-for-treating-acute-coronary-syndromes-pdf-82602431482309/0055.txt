Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

NSTEMI, if angiography is performed within 48 hours of admission, the loading dose should only be given at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention. The clinical specialist highlighted that the results from TRILOGY (designed to compare the effectiveness of prasugrel plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with NSTEMI who were treated with medical management) demonstrated that for the primary end point of the trial (composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke in patients under the age of 75 years) there was no statistically significant difference between the groups treated with prasugrel or clopidogrel and that similar frequencies of bleeding events were reported for both treatment groups. The Committee heard from the Assessment Group that because the patients recruited to TRILOGY were not treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, data from the trial was peripheral to this appraisal. Although the Committee accepted that new data on prasugrel had become available since the publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention, it concluded that these new data were not particularly generalisable to the population being appraised (that is, people with acute coronary syndromes who are to
