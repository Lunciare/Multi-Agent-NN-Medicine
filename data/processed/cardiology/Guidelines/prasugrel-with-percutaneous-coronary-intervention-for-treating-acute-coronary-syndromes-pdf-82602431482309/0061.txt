Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

suggested that there was a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel for myocardial infarctions of varying type, size and timing. However, the Committee heard differing opinions from the clinical specialists about whether non-clinical myocardial infarctions have a similar impact to clinical myocardial infarctions on clinical effectiveness and if they can therefore be considered equally. The Committee considered that the similarity of the clinical effectiveness between the treatments was unproven, and because of the difficulty in relating results of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial to clinical practice in England, the relative effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was uncertain. 4.3.6 The Committee concluded that, despite being well conducted, the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial was not wholly applicable to current clinical practice in England. When considering the absence of preloading with clopidogrel, the limitations of the end points used, and the greater incidence of bleeding adverse events (when major and minor bleeding events were combined) with prasugrel, the Committee agreed that there was uncertainty about whether prasugrel was clinically superior to clopidogrel in terms of net clinical benefit for either the overall trial population or the Committee's preferred population, the core clinical cohort (see section 4.3.3). The Committee therefore considered
