list of preference weights for use in economic evaluations; the study used the US version of the EQ-5D. To calculate utility weights for use in the economic evaluation, background UK population norms (free of disease) varied by age and sex, as described by Kind et al. (1999), were applied to all patients in the study. The utility decrements for acute coronary syndromes and stroke or myocardial infarction were then used alongside these background utility estimates. Finally, the manufacturer assumed that for a major bleed a decrement of 25% of the population (utility) norm was applicable for a 14-day period. 4.2.3 The key categories of cost estimates in the manufacturer's submission were related to hospitalisations and drug costs. Only hospitalisations related to end points or to serious adverse events needing re-hospitalisation and potentially related to the acute coronary syndrome condition or the percutaneous coronary intervention were included in the manufacturer's cost analysis. Re- hospitalisations were valued at a weighted average unit cost per hospitalisation (using NHS reference costs) and differences in hospitalisation rates were applied by geographic location. The weighted average unit cost per hospitalisation was £3,070 for clopidogrel and £3,081 for prasugrel. Patients were assumed to be treated with either
