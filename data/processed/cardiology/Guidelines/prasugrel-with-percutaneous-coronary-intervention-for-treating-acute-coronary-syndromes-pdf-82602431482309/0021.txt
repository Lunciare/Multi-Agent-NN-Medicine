Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

EQ-5D self-report questionnaire and the EQ visual analogue scale. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at days 30, 180, 360 and 450 after the baseline measurement was taken, or at the last visit. Improvements in quality of life were observed early (between baseline and 30 days) and these improvements remained at 12 months. There were no statistically significant differences between prasugrel and clopidogrel. The Assessment Group also noted that the study had recruited fewer people than was initially planned (475 compared with 3000), and raised concerns about how representative the sub-study was of the TRITON TIMI 38 trial population. The Assessment Group was therefore unable to draw any conclusions about the health-related quality of life of patients treated with prasugrel or clopidogrel in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Prasugrel compared with ticagrelor 4.1.20 The Assessment Group noted that there were no trials directly comparing prasugrel with ticagrelor. It considered performing an indirect comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor using data from TRITON-TIMI 38 and the PLATO trial, with clopidogrel as the common comparator. 4.1.21 NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes recommends ticagrelor as a treatment option (in combination with low-dose aspirin) for up
