have been overstated in the overall trial population and core clinical cohort population of the TRITON-TIMI 38 study. 4.3.5 A second source of uncertainty concerning the clinical data from TRITON-TIMI 38 was the use of a composite end point that included non-clinically detected myocardial infarctions (shown by biomarkers and ECG readings). The Committee noted that the main positive result in favour of prasugrel was a decrease in non- fatal myocardial infarctions including non-clinical myocardial infarctions, which would have increased composite end point event rates for clopidogrel reported in the trial. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that non-clinical myocardial infarctions are often included in composite end points of cardiology studies to ensure that the trials are statistically powered to detect differences in outcomes. The Committee considered whether any statistically significant differences would remain between prasugrel and clopidogrel if only clinical myocardial infarctions (symptomatic) were included. The Committee noted the evidence submitted by the manufacturer on the definition of myocardial infarction and the Assessment Group's review of the evidence, which suggested that there was a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel for myocardial infarctions of varying type, size and timing. However, the Committee heard differing opinions
