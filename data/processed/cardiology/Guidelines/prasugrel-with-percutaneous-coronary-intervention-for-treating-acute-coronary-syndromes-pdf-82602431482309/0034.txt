infarctions such that the underlying rate was 50% of that of the trial. The results of the scenario analyses showed that when using alternative utility values, relative risks for mortality and myocardial infarction, the ICER for prasugrel compared with clopidogrel remained below £20,000 per QALY gained. Assessment Group's assessment of the manufacturer's economic model 4.2.8 The Assessment Group provided a critique of the manufacturer's economic model. It stated that in the long-term component of the model, there was an assumption that differences established between the prasugrel and clopidogrel treatment arms of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial will be preserved indefinitely at the level observed at the end of the trial. However, the Assessment Group considered that there is no reason to believe that further serious non-fatal events will not continue to occur to patients in both cohorts. It stated that if events during the trial are presumed to influence later survival, then it is also likely that any such events in subsequent periods will also have important effects. Because active treatment with clopidogrel or prasugrel will have stopped, it can be expected that event rates will be similar in both treatment arms. The Assessment Group commented that as a result of
