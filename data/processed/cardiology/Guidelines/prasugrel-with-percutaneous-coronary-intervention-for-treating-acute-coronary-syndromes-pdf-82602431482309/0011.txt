Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

between the groups in the number of deaths from cardiovascular causes (clopidogrel 150 of 6,795 patients [2.4%] and prasugrel 133 of 6,813 patients [2.1%], hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.70 to 1.12], p=0.31); non-fatal strokes (clopidogrel 60 of 6,795 patients [1.0%] and prasugrel 61 of 6,813 patients [1.0%], hazard ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.45], p= 0.93); or deaths from any cause (clopidogrel 197 of 6,795 patients [3.2%] and prasugrel 188 of 6,813 patients [3.0%], hazard ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.78 to 1.16], p=0.64). 4.1.6 In the overall cohort, statistically significantly fewer patients in the clopidogrel group than in the prasugrel group met the primary safety end point (non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding) during the 15-month follow-up period (clopidogrel 1.8% and prasugrel 2.4%, hazard ratio 1.32 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.68], p=0.03). The net clinical benefit (composite of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and non-CABG-related non-fatal TIMI major bleed) statistically significantly favoured prasugrel (clopidogrel 13.9% and prasugrel 12.2%, hazard ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.79 to 0.95, p=0.004]). 4.1.7 The manufacturer presented an analysis of pre-specified subgroups for the overall cohort in its submission. These subgroups included STEMI, unstable angina or NSTEMI, people with diabetes and types
