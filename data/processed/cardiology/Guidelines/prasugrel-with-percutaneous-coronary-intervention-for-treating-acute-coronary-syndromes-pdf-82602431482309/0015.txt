point compared with clopidogrel (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke; clopidogrel 569 of 5,383 patients [11.0%] and prasugrel 433 of 5,421 patients [8.3%], hazard ratio 0.74 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.84], p<0.001) with a favourable net clinical outcome (composite of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and non-CABG-related non-fatal thrombolysis in myocardial infarction [TIMI] major bleed; clopidogrel 641 of 5,383 patients [12.5%] and prasugrel 522 of 5,421 patients [10.2%], hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.71 to 0.89], p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of the number of patients with non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding (clopidogrel 73 of 5,337 patients [1.5%] and prasugrel 91 of 5,390 patients [1.9%], hazard ratio 1.24 [95% CI 0.91 to 1.69], p=0.17). The Assessment Group commented that the results for both composite outcomes appeared to be driven by the number of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. 4.1.12 The Assessment Group stated that for the core clinical cohort, prasugrel was more effective than clopidogrel on the primary end point at 30 days (clopidogrel 7.0% and prasugrel 5.0%, hazard ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.60 to 0.82], p<0.0001) as well as at the 15-month follow up (clopidogrel 4.5%
