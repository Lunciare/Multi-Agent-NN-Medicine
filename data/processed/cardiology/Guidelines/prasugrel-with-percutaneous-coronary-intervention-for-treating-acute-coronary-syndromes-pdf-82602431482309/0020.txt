the clopidogrel loading dose during the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. In clinical practice in England and Wales, patients undergoing planned percutaneous coronary intervention receive the clopidogrel loading dose before the procedure. • The clinical efficacy in the trial was largely driven by statistically significant differences in non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Non-fatal myocardial infarctions included both clinical myocardial infarctions (symptomatic) and non-clinical myocardial infarctions (shown by biomarkers and electroencephalograph [ECG] readings). The Assessment Group considered that the size and timing of the loading dose of clopidogrel and the impact these factors have on the primary outcome of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial remain unclear. However, the manufacturer's re-analysis of myocardial infarctions (see section 4.1.8) provided a convincing case that prasugrel is effective across all types of myocardial infarction when compared with clopidogrel. 4.1.19 The Assessment Group noted that health-related quality of life was assessed in a sub-study of TRITON-TIMI 38 using the Angina Frequency and Physical Limitations Scores scales of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the London School of Hygiene Dyspnoea Questionnaire score, the EQ-5D self-report questionnaire and the EQ visual analogue scale. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at days 30, 180, 360 and 450 after the baseline measurement was taken,
