Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

clinical effectiveness (see sections 4.3.7, 4.3.8, 4.3.9, and 4.3.10), the Committee agreed that an advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel was plausible in patients without an increased risk of bleeding (under the age of 75 and weighing more than 60 kg) if they had ST-segment-elevation or had diabetes (with STEMI or NSTEMI). However, in people with NSTEMI without diabetes, it was less certain whether there was an advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel. The Committee noted that the Assessment Group had presented cost-effectiveness results for these subgroups and concluded that these results were the most appropriate for the cost-effectiveness decision-making. 4.3.14 The Committee considered the cost-effectiveness results from the Assessment Group's economic model. It noted that the Assessment Group had provided cost-effectiveness results for each of the subgroups at time horizons of 1, 5, 10 and 40 years. It noted that all of the ICERs at 10 or 40 years were below £20,000 per QALY gained (ranging from prasugrel dominating [that is, it was less costly and more effective than clopidogrel] to £14,276 per QALY gained at 10 years, and from prasugrel dominating to £6,626 per QALY gained at 40 years), however, at 5 years the ICERs for people with STEMI without
