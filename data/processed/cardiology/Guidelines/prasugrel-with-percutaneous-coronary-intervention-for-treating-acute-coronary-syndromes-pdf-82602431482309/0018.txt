or NSTEMI without diabetes. The Assessment Group also highlighted that it was able to extract economic data about these subgroups from the manufacturer's economic model. 4.1.16 In summary, the results for the core clinical cohort of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial demonstrated statistically significant differences in favour of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel across a range of outcomes and clinical subgroups. In terms of safety (bleeding events), there was no statistically significant difference between the prasugrel and clopidogrel groups for non-CABG-related major bleeding. Only 1 statistically significant difference between prasugrel and clopidogrel was noted and this was for the combined outcome of TIMI major and minor bleeding, for which statistically significantly more events occurred with prasugrel than with clopidogrel. 4.1.17 The Assessment Group reported the efficacy, bleeding and net clinical benefit for patients aged 75 years and older, weighing less than 60 kg or with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups for the primary efficacy end point (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) or the primary safety end point (non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding). The results for the primary efficacy end point were 16.0% in the clopidogrel
