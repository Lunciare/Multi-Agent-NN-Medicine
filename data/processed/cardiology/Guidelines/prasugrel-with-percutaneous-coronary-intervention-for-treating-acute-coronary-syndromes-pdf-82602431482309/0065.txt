Committee then considered the use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the subgroup of patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It noted that in the core clinical cohort, the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel in these patients appeared to be consistent with the effectiveness in patients with STEMI. The Committee, aware of the views expressed by the clinical specialists, considered that the lack of a preloading dose in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial may have underestimated the effectiveness of clopidogrel in this subgroup. The Committee therefore concluded that there was uncertainty about whether prasugrel was clinically superior to clopidogrel in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI. The Committee therefore concluded it was appropriate to consider patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI as a separate subgroup in its decision-making. 4.3.11 The Committee also discussed patients excluded from its preferred core clinical cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38, that is, patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, patients aged 75 years or older and patients weighing less than 60 kg. The Committee noted that a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack is listed as a contraindication in the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel and that the
