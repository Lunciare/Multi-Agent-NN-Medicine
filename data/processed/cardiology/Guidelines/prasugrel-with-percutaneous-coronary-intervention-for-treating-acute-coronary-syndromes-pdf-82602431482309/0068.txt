Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

that an indirect comparison should have been performed, recognising that it would have been imperfect. It noted that the clinical specialists stated that ticagrelor is used in clinical practice in England and that prasugrel and ticagrelor are considered similarly effective for treating patients with STEMI. However, the clinical specialists were unable to comment similarly on the comparative effectiveness of prasugrel with ticagrelor in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, because prasugrel is not often used in these groups. The Committee noted that the Assessment Group had highlighted several published indirect comparisons in its report and that the Assessment Group considered the results from these publications to be unreliable given the differences in the trials. Nonetheless, the Committee discussed the results of the published indirect comparisons of prasugrel and ticagrelor, which reported that there were no statistically significant differences in overall death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or their composite. The publications also reported that although prasugrel was associated with a significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis, ticagrelor was associated with a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding and major bleeding associated with cardiac surgery. The Committee concluded that, on balance, it was not able to distinguish the clinical effectiveness
