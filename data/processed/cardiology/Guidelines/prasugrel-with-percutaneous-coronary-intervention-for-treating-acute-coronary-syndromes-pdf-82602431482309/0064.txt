be appropriate to consider prasugrel for the treatment of people with diabetes having percutaneous coronary intervention in its decision-making. 4.3.9 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel in patients who are clopidogrel-resistant (that is, patients whose platelet levels do not respond adequately to the dosage of clopidogrel with which they are treated). The Committee understood that these patients may be at risk of further events if their treatment is not adjusted adequately, but the Committee was aware that it was not routine clinical practice to test for platelet response to clopidogrel. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that in around a quarter of patients having percutaneous coronary intervention, stent thrombosis can occur despite clopidogrel treatment. The Committee recognised that these patients could reasonably be considered to be at high risk of further cardiovascular events, are clearly identified and so could benefit from the option of treatment with prasugrel. Because of this, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to consider patients with clopidogrel resistance in its decision-making. 4.3.10 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the subgroup of patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). It noted that in the core clinical
