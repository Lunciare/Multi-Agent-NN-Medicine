that no significant new evidence had become available since the publication of the previous appraisal comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel. The Committee heard from one of the clinical specialists that although there were no new data comparing prasugrel with clopidogrel, new data had become available on prasugrel in patients with NSTEMI: specifically the ACCOAST and TRILOGY trials. The clinical specialist highlighted that the results from ACCOAST (designed to assess the effectiveness of pre-treatment with prasugrel in patients with NSTEMI prior to angiography and at time of percutaneous coronary intervention compared with no pre-treatment) indicated that pre-treatment with prasugrel did not reduce the rate of occurrence of the primary end point (composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent revascularisation or glycoprotein llb/lla inhibitor rescue therapy), but that the rate of major bleeding complications was statistically significantly increased. The Committee was aware that since the publication of the ACCOAST results, the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel had been updated to explicitly state that in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, if angiography is performed within 48 hours of admission, the loading dose should only be given at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention. The clinical specialist highlighted that the
