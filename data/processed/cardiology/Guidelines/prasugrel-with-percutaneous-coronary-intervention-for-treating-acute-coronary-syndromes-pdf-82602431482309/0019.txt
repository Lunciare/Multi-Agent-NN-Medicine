causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) or the primary safety end point (non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding). The results for the primary efficacy end point were 16.0% in the clopidogrel group and 16.1% in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.84 to 1.24], p=0.83). The results for the primary safety end point were 3.3% in the clopidogrel group and 4.3% in the prasugrel group (hazard ratio 1.42 [95% CI 0.93 to 2.15], p=0.10). 4.1.18 Overall, the Assessment Group considered that the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial was robustly designed and of strong methodological quality. The Assessment Group highlighted, that during the original appraisal of prasugrel, the Appraisal Committee identified 3 areas of uncertainty about the generalisability of the results from TRITON-TIMI 38 to people in England and Wales. These were: • The loading dose of clopidogrel administered in the trial was 300 mg, whereas a loading dose of 600 mg may be administered in clinical practice in England and Wales. • The majority (74%) of patients in the trial received the clopidogrel loading dose during the percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. In clinical practice in England and Wales, patients undergoing planned percutaneous coronary intervention receive the clopidogrel loading dose before the
