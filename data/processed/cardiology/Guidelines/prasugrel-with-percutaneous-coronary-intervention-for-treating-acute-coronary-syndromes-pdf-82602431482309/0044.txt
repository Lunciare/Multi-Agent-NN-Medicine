Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

value of −0.1 and conducted sensitivity analyses. 4.2.20 The Assessment Group discounted costs and outcomes annually at 3.5% and carried out one-way sensitivity analyses using 0% and 6% discount rates for both costs and outcomes. The Assessment Group's model generated results at the end of every year from trial randomisation. However, deterministic results were reported at 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 years, and probabilistic results at 5 and 40 years. 4.2.21 The Assessment Group assumed that follow-up secondary prophylaxis was limited to low-dose aspirin. The Assessment Group stated that it made this assumption for convenience and to avoid the possibility of obscuring the primary comparison between prasugrel and clopidogrel use. For the same reason, the Assessment Group did not incorporate other post-stroke and post-myocardial infarction care including surgery and other medication options. The Assessment Group did not incorporate the adverse effects of aspirin therapy, the possibility that people stop aspirin treatment or the risk of bleeding events associated with long-term prophylaxis, because all these issues would affect patients in both treatment arms and the incremental difference would be expected to be minimal. 4.2.22 The Assessment Group considered that it was inappropriate to calculate an ICER for the overall core
