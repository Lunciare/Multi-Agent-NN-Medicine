Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

from event incidence and fatality rates had the largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between −£1,000 and £400 per QALY gained). Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up confirmed that prasugrel dominated clopidogrel with a small net cost saving and positive incremental benefit (incremental cost −£120 and incremental QALYs 0.191). 4.2.26 For the unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes subgroup the ICER for prasugrel compared with clopidogrel was £1,101,662 per QALY gained at the end of the first year, as a result of the inclusion of the full additional cost of treatment (incremental cost £413, incremental QALYs 0.00037). The ICER for prasugrel decreased to £52,288 per QALY gained at year 5 of follow up (incremental cost £346, incremental QALYs 0.007), £14,276 per QALY gained at year 10 (incremental cost £280, incremental QALYs 0.020) and at year 40 the ICER decreased to £4,667 per QALY gained (incremental cost £248, incremental QALYs 0.053). The Assessment Group undertook one-way sensitivity analyses, which indicated that uncertainty from event incidence and fatality rates had the largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between £2,500 and £6,500 per QALY gained). Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up resulted in a lower estimated ICER
