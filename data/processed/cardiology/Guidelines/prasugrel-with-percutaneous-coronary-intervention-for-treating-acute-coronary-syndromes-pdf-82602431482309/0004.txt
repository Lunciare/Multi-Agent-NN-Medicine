including low-dose aspirin, should be given unless there are other indications to continue clopidogrel in combination with aspirin. In its guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI: early management (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes), NICE recommends that clopidogrel in combination with low-dose aspirin should be continued for 12 months after the most recent acute episode of NSTEMI. Thereafter, standard care, including treatment with low-dose aspirin alone, is recommended unless there are other indications to continue clopidogrel in combination with aspirin. 2.5 NICE recommends prasugrel in combination with aspirin as an option for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with acute coronary syndromes having percutaneous coronary intervention, only when: immediate primary percutaneous intervention for STEMI is necessary; stent thrombosis has occurred during clopidogrel treatment; or the person has diabetes (NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention). NICE also recommends ticagrelor in combination with low-dose aspirin for up to 12 months as an option for people with STEMI who are to be treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, NSTEMI or unstable angina (NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes). 2.6 Since the publication of
