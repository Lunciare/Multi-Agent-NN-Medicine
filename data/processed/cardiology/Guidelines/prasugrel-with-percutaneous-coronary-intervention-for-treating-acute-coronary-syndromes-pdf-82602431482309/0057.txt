than 75 years and with a body weight of 60 kg or more. 4.3.4 The Committee identified 2 main areas of uncertainty in the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Firstly, the Committee heard from clinical specialists that, in clinical practice, clopidogrel is administered several hours before percutaneous coronary intervention (preloading) in most non-urgent procedures carried out in England. Additionally, the preloaded dose of clopidogrel is often 600 mg. This dose and timing of clopidogrel therefore differed from that used in TRITON-TIMI 38 in which 300 mg (as in the marketing authorisation for clopidogrel) was given without preloading (see section 4.1.2). The Committee discussed the dose of clopidogrel. It heard from the manufacturer of prasugrel that the CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial (published after the original appraisal of prasugrel (NICE technology appraisal 182) and designed to assess the effectiveness of a standard or double dose of clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes) showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the results for the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke) for those having a higher dose of clopidogrel (600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on
