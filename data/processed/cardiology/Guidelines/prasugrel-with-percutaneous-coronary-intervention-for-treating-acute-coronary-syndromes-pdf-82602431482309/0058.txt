Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

results for the primary composite outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke) for those having a higher dose of clopidogrel (600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2 to 7, and then 75 mg daily) compared with those having a lower dose (300 mg on day 1 then 75 mg daily). The Committee accepted that the results from the CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial suggested there was no clear benefit from the 600 mg dose of clopidogrel compared with the 300 mg dose and agreed that the efficacy results seen in TRITON-TIMI 38 with a 300 mg loading dose were unlikely to have differed materially from those seen if the 600 mg dose was used (although a higher rate of bleeding in the clopidogrel group may have been seen). The Committee then discussed the timing of the loading dose of clopidogrel. It heard from the manufacturer of prasugrel that the results of TRITON-TIMI 38 showed that the benefit seen with prasugrel was relatively consistent over time, as shown through the similarity of the hazard ratios for the primary efficacy end point in the prasugrel group throughout the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. This implied a relative advantage for prasugrel could
