preloading dose of clopidogrel. Having taken all the above factors into consideration, the Committee agreed that prasugrel could have an advantage over clopidogrel for patients with STEMI who need immediate primary percutaneous coronary intervention. 4.3.8 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel in patients with diabetes in the core clinical cohort who were having percutaneous coronary intervention. It noted that in these patients, prasugrel reduced the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or death from cardiovascular causes compared with clopidogrel to a greater extent than for the licensed population of patients (including those without diabetes). The Committee, aware of the views expressed by the clinical specialists, considered that the lack of a preloading dose in the trial may have underestimated the effectiveness of clopidogrel in the population with diabetes. It agreed, however, that diabetes represented an important and definable risk factor for more severe cardiovascular disease and greater risk of cardiovascular events during and after percutaneous coronary intervention. The Committee therefore concluded that it would be appropriate to consider prasugrel for the treatment of people with diabetes having percutaneous coronary intervention in its decision-making. 4.3.9 The Committee then considered the use of prasugrel in patients
