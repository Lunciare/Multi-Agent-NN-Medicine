a significantly lower risk of any major bleeding and major bleeding associated with cardiac surgery. The Committee concluded that, on balance, it was not able to distinguish the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel and ticagrelor in patients with STEMI, unstable angina, or NSTEMI. However, in the case of STEMI only, there was some support for the possibility of clinical equivalence. Cost effectiveness 4.3.13 The Committee considered the economic models submitted by the manufacturer and the Assessment Group. The Committee considered the cost-effectiveness results for the comparison of prasugrel and clopidogrel. The Committee noted that the manufacturer and the Assessment Group had presented cost-effectiveness results (for the 10 mg dose of prasugrel only) for different populations and so the results could not be directly compared, although all of the results for prasugrel 10 mg compared with clopidogrel were below £20,000 per QALY gained at a time horizon of 40 years. The Committee then discussed which of the cost-effectiveness data it should consider in its decision making. Bearing in mind its considerations on clinical effectiveness (see sections 4.3.7, 4.3.8, 4.3.9, and 4.3.10), the Committee agreed that an advantage of prasugrel over clopidogrel was plausible in patients without an increased risk of bleeding (under
