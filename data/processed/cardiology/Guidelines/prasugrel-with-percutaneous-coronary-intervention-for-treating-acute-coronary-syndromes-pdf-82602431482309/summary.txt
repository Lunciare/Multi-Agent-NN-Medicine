1 Recommendations This guidance replaces NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention. 1.1 Prasugrel 10 mg in combination with aspirin is recommended as an option within its marketing authorisation, that is, for preventing atherothrombotic events in adults with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina [UA], non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) having primary or delayed percutaneous coronary intervention. 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Acute coronary syndromes refers to a group of symptoms associated with acute myocardial ischaemia with or without infarction. It encompasses a spectrum of disorders or syndromes including acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris. Acute coronary syndromes are usually the result of an acute or sub- acute primary reduction of myocardial oxygen supply provoked by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque (build-up of material in a heart vessel) associated with inflammation, thrombosis, vasoconstriction and microembolisation.
