Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

the patient experienced non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke (disabling or non-disabling), or ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (disabling or non-disabling). The patient may also have experienced no event during the year, and therefore stay in the same health state, or may have died if they experienced fatal myocardial infarction, fatal haemorrhagic stroke, fatal ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other vascular death, or non-vascular death. 4.2.15 The main source of data used to populate the Assessment Group's long-term model was the CAPRIE clinical trial. The Assessment Group stated that its clinical adviser had confirmed that CAPRIE data was an appropriate trial source for extrapolating long-term vascular events and that no better source had become available since 2010. The CAPRIE trial was a double-blind placebo comparison of clopidogrel with aspirin involving 19,185 patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases manifested as either ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Only CAPRIE data from 5,741 patients with myocardial infarctions and without a history of other vascular events were used to populate the Assessment Group's long-term model. The manufacturer of clopidogrel carried out extensive re-analyses of the CAPRIE trial data as requested by the Assessment Group in order to estimate independent
