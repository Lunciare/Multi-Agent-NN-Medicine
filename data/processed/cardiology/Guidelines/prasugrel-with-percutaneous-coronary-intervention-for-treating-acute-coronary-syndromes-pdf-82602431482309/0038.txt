trial, supplemented by data provided by the manufacturer of dipyridamole from the PROFESS clinical trial. The Assessment Group stated that the myocardial infarction subpopulation analysis submitted for NICE's technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular events addresses issues similar to those in this appraisal and was based largely on data from the myocardial infarction subpopulation in the CAPRIE trial. In order to reduce the time in generating model results from an individual patient simulation approach, the Assessment Group restructured the economic model submitted for NICE's technology appraisal guidance on clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular events into a long-term Markov chain for the purpose of this appraisal. 4.2.14 In the Assessment Group's long-term model the initial health state was determined by the worst previous event (none, myocardial infarction or stroke), the number of prior events (none, 1, 2, or 3 or more) and whether the event was disabling or not. Moving into another health state was determined by whether the patient experienced non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke (disabling or non-disabling), or ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (disabling or non-disabling). The patient may also have experienced no event
