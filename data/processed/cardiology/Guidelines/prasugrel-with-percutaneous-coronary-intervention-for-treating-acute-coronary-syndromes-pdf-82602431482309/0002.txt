artery, resulting in necrosis of the tissue supplied by that artery or ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This condition is treated immediately with reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention). Acute coronary syndrome without STEMI is classified as either unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). NSTEMI differs from unstable angina primarily in the severity of myocardial ischaemia. In NSTEMI, the ischaemia is severe enough to result in the release of biochemical markers of myocardial injury into the blood. Immediate treatment for these conditions aims to prevent progression to total occlusion of the artery and, for people at high risk of myocardial infarction, may include coronary revascularisation, either by means of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft. 2.3 Acute coronary syndromes become more prevalent with increasing age and incidence is higher in men than women. There were around 32,000 hospital admissions for unstable angina in England in 2012 to 2013, and it is estimated that there are about 82,000 myocardial infarctions in the country every year. Of the 80,974 hospital admissions with a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction recorded between April 2012 and March 2013 in the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), 40% were STEMIs and 60% were
