Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

hospitalisation rates were applied by geographic location. The weighted average unit cost per hospitalisation was £3,070 for clopidogrel and £3,081 for prasugrel. Patients were assumed to be treated with either aspirin and clopidogrel or aspirin and prasugrel for 12 months. The cost for prasugrel was calculated at £10.20 per day for the loading dose and £1.70 per day for the maintenance dose (MIMS August 13, based on £47.56 per pack of 28 tablets). The cost of clopidogrel was calculated at £0.24 per day for the loading dose and £0.07 per day for the maintenance dose (NHS Drug Tariff, based on £1.83 per pack of 28 75 mg tablets). The cost of aspirin was calculated as £0.01 per day for the maintenance dose. 4.2.4 The manufacturer considered 5 subgroups in its cost-effectiveness analysis, resulting in the following incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): • For the all acute coronary syndromes licensed population (excluding prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack and including patients who are now recommended to be treated with a 5 mg maintenance dose), the ICER was £11,660 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. • For the core clinical cohort (excluding prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack and those weighing less than
