with clopidogrel or prasugrel will have stopped, it can be expected that event rates will be similar in both treatment arms. The Assessment Group commented that as a result of this process, it is likely that over time the disease histories of patients will converge, and so any initial advantage for either treatment will progressively decrease. Assessment Group's economic model 4.2.9 The Assessment Group carried out a systematic review to identify existing economic evaluations of prasugrel. Of the 15 potentially eligible references identified, none of the papers met the full inclusion criteria that had been set. The review identified the 3 studies included in the manufacturer's review of cost-effectiveness evidence – two from a US perspective and one which used the economic model originally submitted during NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention but these were excluded by the Assessment Group. 4.2.10 The Assessment Group developed a 2-phase economic model: a short-term statistical model of the data from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and a long-term model projecting outcomes and costs at the end of the first phase up to a maximum of 40 years. The model compared dual antiplatelet
