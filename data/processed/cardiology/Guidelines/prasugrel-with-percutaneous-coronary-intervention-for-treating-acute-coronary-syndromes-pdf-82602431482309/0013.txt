infarctions of varying type, size and timing. • A subgroup analysis of the 3,146 patients with diabetes in TRITON-TIMI 38 (Wiviott et al. 2008) showed that patients with diabetes tended to have a greater reduction in ischaemic events without an observed increase in non- CABG-related TIMI major bleeding, and therefore showed a greater net treatment benefit with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel. Assessment Group's report 4.1.9 The Assessment Group's report focused on the results of the core clinical cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38, as reported in Wiviott et al. (2011). The Assessment Group explained that during NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention, the Appraisal Committee agreed that the core clinical cohort population was the most relevant because the excluded patients were either explicitly excluded from the marketing authorisation or were not supported by trial evidence (because the trial was based on the full 10 mg dose). The Assessment Group noted that the authors of the Wiviott et al. study stated that the core clinical cohort was identified post hoc and defined by regulatory criteria, and that the study should therefore be considered as an exploratory analysis. 4.1.10 The Assessment
