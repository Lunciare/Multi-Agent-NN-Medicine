Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

having percutaneous coronary intervention. Some aspects of the submitted economic model had been updated based on feedback during the original appraisal of prasugrel. These revisions included: • the sensitivity analysis encompassing the entire population as opposed to a 'typical' patient profile • scenario analysis using the Evidence Review Group's suggestions for utility values, amended long-term relative risk of mortality and reduced incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction • the (reduced) price of generic clopidogrel • updated costs. 4.2.2 Although the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial included a health-related quality of life sub-study, the manufacturer stated that it was not possible to provide robust health-related quality of life estimates because of the very small numbers of patients with events included in the analysis. Therefore, the manufacturer conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies relevant to the modelled trial population. Mean utility decrements for acute coronary syndromes (0.041) and stroke or myocardial infarction (0.052) were taken directly from a US study (Sullivan et al., 2006) that was designed to produce a specific list of preference weights for use in economic evaluations; the study used the US version of the EQ-5D. To calculate utility weights for use in the economic evaluation, background UK
