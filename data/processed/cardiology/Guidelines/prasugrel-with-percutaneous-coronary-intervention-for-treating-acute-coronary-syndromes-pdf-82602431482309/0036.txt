Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and a long-term model projecting outcomes and costs at the end of the first phase up to a maximum of 40 years. The model compared dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months from time of percutaneous coronary intervention with either clopidogrel in combination with low-dose aspirin or prasugrel in combination with low-dose aspirin. As a result of the lack of clinical evidence available, the Assessment Group did not compare prasugrel with ticagrelor. 4.2.11 The Assessment Group accepted the manufacturer's statistical model for the initial phase (up to 12 months) but replaced the long-term projection with a more detailed representation of subsequent cardiovascular events, accumulating patient histories, alteration in health states and associated care costs, as well as health-related quality of life. 4.2.12 The Assessment Group's decision model assessed 4 mutually exclusive subgroups of the core clinical cohort (that is, all patients with acute coronary syndromes, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, excluding those with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, those aged 75 years or older or weighing less than 60 kg). The 4 subgroups were: • treated for STEMI and with diagnosed diabetes • treated for STEMI and without diagnosed diabetes • treated for unstable angina
