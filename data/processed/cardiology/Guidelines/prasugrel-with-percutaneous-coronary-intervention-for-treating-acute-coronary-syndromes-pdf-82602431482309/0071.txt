Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

£14,276 per QALY gained at 10 years, and from prasugrel dominating to £6,626 per QALY gained at 40 years), however, at 5 years the ICERs for people with STEMI without diabetes and NSTEMI without diabetes were over £20,000 per QALY gained (£29,607 and £52,288 per QALY gained respectively). The Committee noted that the QALY gains for prasugrel over the 40-year time horizon for the STEMI without diabetes and the unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes subgroups were small (0.084 and 0.053 respectively), as was the difference in costs between prasugrel and clopidogrel treatment (STEMI without diabetes: clopidogrel total cost £21,167, prasugrel total cost £21,722, incremental cost £555; UA/NSTEMI without diabetes: clopidogrel total cost £20,328, prasugrel total cost £20,576, incremental cost £248). It accepted that, as a result, the cost effectiveness of prasugrel was highly sensitive to changes in key model assumptions. The Committee therefore considered which time horizon was the most appropriate for its decision-making. The Committee noted that the clinical data used in the second phase of the Assessment Group's economic data were obtained from the CAPRIE study, which had a maximum follow up of 3 years, and that these data were used to extrapolate results of the health
