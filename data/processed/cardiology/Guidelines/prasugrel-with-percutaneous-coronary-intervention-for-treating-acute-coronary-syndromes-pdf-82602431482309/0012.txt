p=0.004]). 4.1.7 The manufacturer presented an analysis of pre-specified subgroups for the overall cohort in its submission. These subgroups included STEMI, unstable angina or NSTEMI, people with diabetes and types of stent placements. The analysis showed that there was no evidence to suggest that the overall treatment effect was different in the subgroups compared with the overall cohort. 4.1.8 The manufacturer also provided post-hoc subgroup analyses from other publications, which included the following: • A subgroup analysis of the 1218 myocardial infarctions that occurred during TRITON-TIMI 38 based on a paper by Morrow et al. (2009) showed that there was a consistent reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarctions with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel for myocardial infarctions of every size as measured by biomarker elevation, with the greatest absolute reduction seen in those myocardial infarctions associated with the greatest extent of myocardial necrosis. The manufacturer highlighted that this analysis showed that prasugrel statistically significantly reduced spontaneous and procedural myocardial infarction compared with clopidogrel, and that this was consistent across myocardial infarctions of varying type, size and timing. • A subgroup analysis of the 3,146 patients with diabetes in TRITON-TIMI 38 (Wiviott et al. 2008) showed that patients with diabetes tended
