Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

the TITRON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials were not comparable, and so a comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor based on these trials was inappropriate. It noted that TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO were similar in many ways: both trials were conducted in a population with acute coronary syndromes, used clopidogrel as a comparator and reported the same primary composite efficacy end point (death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, or non-fatal stroke during the follow-up period). However, there were substantial differences in several characteristics of the studies. TRITON-TIMI 38 included patients with acute coronary syndromes who were early invasively managed and scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention within 72 hours of symptom onset, whereas PLATO included a broad acute coronary syndromes population with symptom onset within 24 hours. TRITON-TIMI 38 only allowed a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel whereas PLATO allowed a 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose. TRITON-TIMI 38 had a 15-month follow-up period, whereas PLATO had a 12-month follow-up period. 4.1.24 The Assessment Group highlighted that the manufacturer of prasugrel had not provided an indirect comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor in its submission for this appraisal. Although the Assessment Group considered an indirect comparison to be inappropriate, it identified
