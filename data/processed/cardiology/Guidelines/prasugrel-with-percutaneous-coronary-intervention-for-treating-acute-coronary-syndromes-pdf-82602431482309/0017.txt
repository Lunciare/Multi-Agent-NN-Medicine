Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

that statistically significant differences in favour of prasugrel were reported for the outcomes of definite stent thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.29 to 0.60], p<0.001) and definite or probable stent thrombosis (hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.62], p<0.001) in the core clinical cohort. There were also statistically significantly fewer myocardial infarctions in the prasugrel group compared with the clopidogrel group (clopidogrel 9.4% and prasugrel 6.7%, hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.62 to 0.81], p<0.001). 4.1.15 The Assessment Group reviewed a Forest plot from the Wiviott et al. publication that showed the relative effectiveness of prasugrel compared with clopidogrel across a range of subgroups within the core clinical cohort. The Assessment Group noted that the clinical effectiveness of prasugrel appeared to be consistent across the range of subgroups presented, including STEMI, unstable angina or NSTEMI and patients with and without diabetes. It highlighted that no specific clinical-effectiveness data were available for patients with STEMI and diabetes, STEMI without diabetes, unstable angina or NSTEMI with diabetes, or unstable angina or NSTEMI without diabetes. The Assessment Group also highlighted that it was able to extract economic data about these subgroups from the manufacturer's economic model. 4.1.16 In summary, the results
