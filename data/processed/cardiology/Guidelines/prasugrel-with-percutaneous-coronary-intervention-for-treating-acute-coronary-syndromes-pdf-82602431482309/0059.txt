Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

through the similarity of the hazard ratios for the primary efficacy end point in the prasugrel group throughout the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. This implied a relative advantage for prasugrel could have arisen even after the pre-loading of clopidogrel. The Committee also heard from the manufacturer that the management of patients with NSTEMI in clinical practice has changed since the publication of the original appraisal of prasugrel (NICE technology appraisal 182) as the 'door-to-needle time' for patients in England decreases, so too does the time for pre-loading with clopidogrel. The Committee agreed that there is still limited evidence on the importance of the timing of the clopidogrel loading dose and so its effect on patient outcomes remains an issue. The Committee therefore considered that more cardiovascular events could have occurred in the clopidogrel group in the trial than might be experienced in a similar cohort of patients having percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice in England. As a result, the advantages of prasugrel over clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular events may have been overstated in the overall trial population and core clinical cohort population of the TRITON-TIMI 38 study. 4.3.5 A second source of uncertainty concerning the clinical data from TRITON-TIMI
