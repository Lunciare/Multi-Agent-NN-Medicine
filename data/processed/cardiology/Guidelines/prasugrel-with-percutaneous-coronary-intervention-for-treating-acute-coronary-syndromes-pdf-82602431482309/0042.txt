95% CI £1,623.66 to £1,984.47) and in the disabling stroke health state it is £5,537.72 (standard error £282.54, 95% CI £4,983.95 to £6,091.50). 4.2.18 The Assessment Group obtained the continuing health-state EQ-5D utility value for patients who were event-free or suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction (but no strokes) and who were alive 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention from the economic sub-study of the PLATO clinical trial. The values were based on the weighted average of patients meeting those criteria. Utility parameters reflecting sex differences and mild versus severe strokes for patients suffering at least 1 stroke or transient ischaemic attack were obtained from a study of EQ-5D observations as part of the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC). The Assessment Group used an annual loss of utility estimated from the UK population EQ-5D norms, which was calculated by fitting a linear regression trend line to all people aged 35 years or older. The results were used to adjust the initial health state utilities of each subgroup for the differences in mean age between the TRITON-TIMI 38 cohort and OXVASC data. This decrement was also applied annually to the results of the model to reflect the average decline of utility score with
