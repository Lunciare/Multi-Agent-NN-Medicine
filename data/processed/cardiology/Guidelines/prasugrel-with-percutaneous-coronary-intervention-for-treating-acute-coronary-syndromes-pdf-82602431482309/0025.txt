Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

prasugrel had not provided an indirect comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor in its submission for this appraisal. Although the Assessment Group considered an indirect comparison to be inappropriate, it identified 4 publications reporting an indirect comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor based on TRITON-TIMI 38 and the PLATO trials. These publications reported that there were no statistically significant differences in overall death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or their composite. Prasugrel was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of stent thrombosis, and ticagrelor was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of any major bleeding and major bleeding associated with cardiac surgery. 4.1.25 The Assessment Group identified an ongoing trial designed to assess whether ticagrelor is superior to prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and planned invasive strategy (ISAR-REACT 5). This study is due to complete in October 2018 (the final data collection date for primary outcome measure is October 2016). The results of this study should allow a formal comparison of the efficacy of prasugrel compared with ticagrelor. Submission statements from other consultees 4.1.26 A professional group commented that although evidence supporting the use of prasugrel in STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention is unclear, the data
