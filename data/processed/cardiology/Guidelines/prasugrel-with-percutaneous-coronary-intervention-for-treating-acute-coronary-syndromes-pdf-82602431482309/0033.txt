deterministic sensitivity analyses on the core clinical cohort population (excluding prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack and those 75 years or older or weighing less than 60 kg). The following changes to the model resulted in ICERs of more than £13,000 per QALY gained (an increase of more than £1,000 from the base-case ICER): • discounting at 6% for both costs and effects (ICER £16,475 per QALY gained) • relative risks for all-cause mortality associated with clinical events reduced by 50% (ICER £20,619 per QALY gained) • clopidogrel pre-loading adjustment set at 70% (ICER £13,959 per QALY gained). 4.2.6 The manufacturer did not carry out probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 4.2.7 The manufacturer also carried out a series of scenario analyses for each of the following: • using alternative values obtained from the Health Outcomes Data Repository (HODaR) database • amending the long-term relative risks of mortality (by ignoring the impact of acute coronary syndromes before events that occurred in the TRITON- TIMI 38 trial) • reducing the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions such that the underlying rate was 50% of that of the trial. The results of the scenario analyses showed that when using alternative utility values, relative risks for mortality
