Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

in England, treatment options for people with STEMI are prasugrel in combination with aspirin, ticagrelor in combination with low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel in combination with low-dose aspirin, along with percutaneous coronary intervention followed by dual antiplatelet treatment. It also understood that people in England with NSTEMI are offered treatments depending on their Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) or TIMI score. Medical management using aspirin is an option for people at the lowest risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, whereas people at higher risk are offered percutaneous coronary intervention along with either ticagrelor, or clopidogrel and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. In patients with NSTEMI and diabetes, prasugrel is an alternative to clopidogrel or ticagrelor. The Committee heard from patient experts and clinical specialists that, overall, prasugrel is a useful addition to the treatment options available. It has a potentially key advantage over clopidogrel because of its faster antiplatelet action. However, the Committee also noted that prasugrel increased the chance of (potentially fatal) bleeding compared with clopidogrel. The Committee also heard from the clinical specialists that there was variation in opinion among clinicians in England as to which of prasugrel, ticagrelor or clopidogrel should be considered
