had the largest effect on the estimated ICER (ranging between £2,500 and £6,500 per QALY gained). Probabilistic analysis at 40 years of follow up resulted in a lower estimated ICER of £4,154 per QALY gained (incremental cost £212 and incremental QALYs 0.051). Summary of the deterministic base-case results from the manufacturer and the Assessment Group 4.2.27 Table 1 illustrates the differences in the cost-effectiveness estimates for the 3 different models: the Evidence Review Group's exploratory analyses from NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention, the manufacturer's model, and the Assessment Group's model for the current appraisal.
