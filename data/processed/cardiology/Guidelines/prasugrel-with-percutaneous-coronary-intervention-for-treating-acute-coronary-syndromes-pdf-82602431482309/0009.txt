Prasugrel with percutaneous coronary intervention for treating acute coronary syndromes

myocardial infarction (TIMI) major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), non-CABG-related TIMI life-threatening bleeding, and TIMI major bleeding (a fall in haemoglobin of 5 g/100 ml or more) or minor bleeding (a fall in haemoglobin of 3 g to less than 5 g/100 ml). 4.1.4 Wiviott et al. (2011) reported the results for a core clinical cohort of the TRITON-TIMI 38 population (n=10,084). This cohort consisted of patients younger than 75 years, weighing 60 kg or more, and with no history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. This subpopulation was described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention as the 'target population' or 'licensed population' for treatment with prasugrel. Manufacturer's submission 4.1.5 The manufacturer's submission focused on the results of the overall cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38. At 15 months, the composite primary end point for the overall cohort population of TRITON-TIMI 38 (n= 13,608) occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the clopidogrel group than in the prasugrel group (clopidogrel 781 of 6,795 patients [12.1%] and prasugrel 643 of 6,813 patients [9.9%], hazard ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73 to 0.90], p<0.001).
