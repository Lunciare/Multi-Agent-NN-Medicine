These recommendations were based on a single randomised controlled trial (PLATO). The PLATO trial was an international, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy phase 3 trial comparing ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin in 18,624 patients admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndromes with or without STEMI. Patients were randomised to the trial irrespective of planned intervention and therefore the patient population included patients with acute coronary syndromes who were to be medically managed as well as those who were to have percutaneous coronary intervention. The trial follow up was for 12 months, but the trial protocol stipulated that once the requisite number of events (1780) had accrued, patients had to leave the trial after their 6-month or 9-month visit. 4.1.22 In the overall trial population, a statistically significant benefit of ticagrelor was found for the primary composite end point (ticagrelor 9.8%
