As such, there is no robust new evidence to challenge the original guidance defining the patient population for whom prasugrel should be a treatment option. The group stated that the benefit of prasugrel therapy is limited to patients younger than 75 years, weighing more than 60 kg and without a history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke. It commented that data produced after NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182 on prasugrel for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes with percutaneous coronary intervention do not support extending the use of prasugrel to all patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes, whether treated medically or by urgent revascularisation. It noted evidence from subgroup analyses for efficacy of prasugrel over clopidogrel in the reduction of stent thrombosis in patients receiving an intracoronary stent for treatment of acute coronary syndromes. 4.1.27 The professional group commented that since the publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance 182
