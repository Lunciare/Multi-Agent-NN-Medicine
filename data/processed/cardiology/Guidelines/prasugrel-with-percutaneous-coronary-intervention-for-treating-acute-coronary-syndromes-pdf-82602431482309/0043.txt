age between the TRITON-TIMI 38 cohort and OXVASC data. This decrement was also applied annually to the results of the model to reflect the average decline of utility score with increasing age. 4.2.19 The Assessment Group commented that 7 events in its model would be expected to result in additional utility decrement in the first year of follow up during early recovery. The Assessment Group identified a specific value for non-fatal myocardial infarction using an analysis of UK Prospective Diabetes Study trial results which compared utility values for events occurring within 12 months against those occurring earlier. Sources for non-fatal stroke parameters gave contradictory figures, suggesting that there is no clear additional early disutility effect beyond the long-term continuing effect of a stroke. As a result, the Assessment Group set these parameters to zero and conducted one-way sensitivity analyses on these parameters instead. No sources were identified for utility values for fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, other vascular death or non-vascular death. The Assessment Group assigned these parameters a notional value of −0.1 and conducted sensitivity analyses. 4.2.20 The Assessment Group discounted costs and outcomes annually at 3.5% and carried out one-way sensitivity analyses using 0% and 6% discount rates
