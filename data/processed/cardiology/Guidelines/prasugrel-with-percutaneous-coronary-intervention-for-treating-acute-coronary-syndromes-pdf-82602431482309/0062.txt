to clopidogrel in terms of net clinical benefit for either the overall trial population or the Committee's preferred population, the core clinical cohort (see section 4.3.3). The Committee therefore considered whether there were any identifiable subgroups of patients for whom prasugrel might show superiority over clopidogrel with less uncertainty. 4.3.7 The Committee considered the clinical evidence for prasugrel in the subgroup of patients with STEMI. In clinical practice, there is only a short time between diagnosis and primary percutaneous intervention in these patients. The Committee considered the subgroup results presented by the Assessment Group for the core clinical cohort which indicated a trend towards benefit for prasugrel compared to clopidogrel in patients with STEMI across end points. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that the onset of antiplatelet activity was more consistent and faster with prasugrel than with clopidogrel. The delayed onset of antiplatelet activity with clopidogrel was of particular concern when immediate percutaneous coronary intervention was needed because there would be little or no time to give a preloading dose of clopidogrel. Having taken all the above factors into consideration, the Committee agreed that prasugrel could have an advantage over clopidogrel for patients with STEMI who need immediate
