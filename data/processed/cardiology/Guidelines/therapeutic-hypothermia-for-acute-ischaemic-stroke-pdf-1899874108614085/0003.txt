the cooling device. Cooling devices can be surface (ice-cold saline, surface cooling, cooling helmets and nasal cooling) or endovascular systems. After cooling, the body is slowly rewarmed, at a rate of 0.25°C to 0.5°C every hour. Rewarming takes about 8 hours. During cooling, patients need close cardiovascular monitoring in an intensive care environment, and may also need intubation and sedation. Drugs, including neuromuscular blockers, may be used to manage shivering. 2.5 The procedure may be used with thrombolysis (intravenous alteplase), mechanical thrombectomy or other vascular reperfusion techniques. 2.6 The aim of the procedure is to reduce the risk of secondary brain damage. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 To inform the committee, NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 9 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 1 systematic review, 3 randomised controlled trials (1 of which was a conference abstract and used for safety data only), 3 non- randomised comparative studies and 2 case series. It is presented in table 2 of the interventional procedures overview. Other relevant literature is in the appendix
