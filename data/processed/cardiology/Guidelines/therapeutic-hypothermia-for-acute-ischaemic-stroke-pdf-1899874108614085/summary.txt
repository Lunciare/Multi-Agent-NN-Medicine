1 Recommendations 1.1 Current evidence on the safety of therapeutic hypothermia for acute ischaemic stroke shows that there are serious complications. Evidence on efficacy does not show any meaningful improvement in outcomes. Therefore, this procedure should not be used. Find out why NICE recommends not to use some procedures on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Acute ischaemic stroke is characterised by the sudden loss of blood circulation to an area of the brain and a corresponding loss of neurological function. This may lead to symptoms such as numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg on 1 side of the body, and often problems with speech and swallowing.
