stroke. Current treatments 2.2 Patients suspected to be having an acute ischaemic stroke should have rapid assessment and early intervention with specialist care according to NICE's guideline on stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s. Recanalisation strategies, such as thrombolysis, attempt to re-establish blood flow so that cells starved of oxygen can be rescued before they are irreversibly damaged. Effective stroke care also includes specialised supportive care and rehabilitation when appropriate. The procedure 2.3 The timing, duration and degree of therapeutic hypothermia in trials has varied. Typically, however, cooling has been attempted as close to stroke onset as possible (usually within 6 hours) and continued for at least 12 to 24 hours, with body temperature maintained at 33°C to 36°C. This guidance only refers to the use of therapeutic hypothermia and not to other targeted temperature management approaches that treat or prevent pyrexia. 2.4 Before the procedure, the patient's temperature is measured and further temperature monitoring is done continuously with an internal (intravesical, rectal or oesophageal) probe connected to the cooling device. Cooling devices can be surface (ice-cold saline, surface cooling, cooling helmets and nasal cooling) or endovascular systems. After cooling, the body is slowly rewarmed, at a rate
