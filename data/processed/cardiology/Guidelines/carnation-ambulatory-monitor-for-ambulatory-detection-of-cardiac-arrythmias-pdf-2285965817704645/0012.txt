be more expensive than Novacor 'T' test 4 when both device and clinical care costs were considered. Strengths and limitations This randomised study was done in the UK but was limited by having a small sample size. Most of the comparisons are with the Novacor 'R' test 4 device because it was viewed to be the most commonly used external cardiac monitor in the UK that can record for more than 48 hours. The study reviewed the 4 devices at separate intervals rather than at the same time which limits the comparability between devices. However, this was thought to be reasonable because of the risk of artefacts being generated on the recordings. People in the study had dual chamber permanent pacemakers implanted which is not generalisable to the atrial fibrillation population. Rho et al. (2018) Study size, design and location Prospective comparative single centre study of 29 adults needing ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in the US. Intervention and comparator All patients simultaneously wore a CAM and Zio XT monitor for 7 days. Key outcomes A total of 86.7 plus or minus 0.6 arrhythmias were detected using Zio XT and 121.7 plus or minus 2.1 for CAM (p<0.001). Of the arrhythmias
