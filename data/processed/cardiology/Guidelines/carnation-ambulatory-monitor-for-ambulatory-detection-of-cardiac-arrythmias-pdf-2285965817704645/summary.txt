Summary • The technology described in this briefing is Carnation Ambulatory Monitor (CAM). It is an ambulatory cardiac monitor used for detecting cardiac arrhythmias. • The innovative aspects are a low noise floor, leading to more accurate and clearer signal detection. The device can also be worn for up to 14 days. • The intended place in therapy would be as an alternative to existing ambulatory cardiac monitors in people with suspected arrhythmias. • The main points from the evidence summarised in this briefing are from 4 studies (including 3 prospective comparative studies and 1 retrospective study in children) including a total of 125 adults and children.
