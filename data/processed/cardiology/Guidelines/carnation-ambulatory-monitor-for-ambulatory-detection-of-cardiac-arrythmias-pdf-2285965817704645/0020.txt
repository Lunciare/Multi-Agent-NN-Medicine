Carnation Ambulatory Monitor for ambulatory detection of cardiac arrythmias

useful to have a 14-day monitoring study comparing other similar patch-type devices used in the NHS. One expert said that larger population studies would be needed. One expert said that cost compared with Holter monitors would be a barrier to wider uptake of the device. They said that there would be a reduction in capital cost but an increase in consumables cost if the device replaced Holter monitoring. Patient organisation comments Representatives from 3 patient organisations, Syncope Trust And Reflex anoxic Seizures (STARS), AF Association, and Arrhythmia Alliance, gave the following comments. The benefits of the device are that its more comfortable than a Holter monitor and is less obstructive when doing everyday activities. This includes being able to wear the device while showering and exercising. It is also discrete, which reduces the risk of social stigma or embarrassment because of wearing the device. They also said that the device is easy to apply and remove. The results were also received quickly. Earlier detection of arrhythmias could lead to faster treatment and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes including strokes. This device may particularly benefit people with intermittent symptoms which may be hard to identify when using a 12-lead electrocardiogram
