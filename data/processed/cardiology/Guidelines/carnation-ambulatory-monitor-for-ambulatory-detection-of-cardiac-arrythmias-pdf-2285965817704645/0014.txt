in the US and New Zealand. Intervention and comparator All patients simultaneously wore a CAM and Holter monitor for 24 hours. Key outcomes The CAM patch identified rhythms in 23 people (46%) that changed management, compared with 6 in the Holter group (12%; p<0.01). All 6 Holter recordings with clinically significant arrhythmias were also found when using the CAM patch. The CAM patch ECG intervals PR, QRS and QT correlated well with the Holter ECG intervals having correlation coefficients of 0.93, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively. In terms of comfort, 48 people (96%) preferred wearing the CAM patch. Strengths and limitations The study compared 2 devices at the same time on the same person, which allowed direct data comparison. However, the CAM patch was only used for 24 hours (in line with normal Holter monitor use) which limits the evidence on comfort of CAM patch use for up to 14 days. Romme et al. (2021) Study size, design and location Retrospective study of 25 children aged 0 to 15 months needing ECG monitoring in the US. Intervention and comparator CAM patches worn for 48 hours. Five children wore a secondary CAM patch horizontally (leading to a total of 33 reports). Key
