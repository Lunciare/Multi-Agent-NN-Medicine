7 days. Key outcomes A total of 86.7 plus or minus 0.6 arrhythmias were detected using Zio XT and 121.7 plus or minus 2.1 for CAM (p<0.001). Of the arrhythmias identified, atrial tachycardia was most diagnosed, and was more frequently identified with CAM than Zio XT (22.3 plus or minus 0.6 compared with 8.7 plus or minus 3.2, p<0.001). ECG clarity was ranked as high in all 29 CAM reports (100%) and on 4.5 (16%) of the Zio XT reports (p<0.001). Higher ECG clarity was mostly because of the greater ability to see P-waves when using the CAM device. Patient experiences were comparable and positive for both devices. Strengths and limitations This prospective study had a small sample size. The analysis was done using multiple reviewers with averaged rhythms decisions to compensate for subjectivity in individual reviewing opinions. Company analysis centres were also unaware of the research to prevent analysis bias. Smith et al. (2017) Study size, design and location Prospective comparative study including 50 adults needing continuous ECG recording in the US and New Zealand. Intervention and comparator All patients simultaneously wore a CAM and Holter monitor for 24 hours. Key outcomes The CAM patch identified rhythms in 23
