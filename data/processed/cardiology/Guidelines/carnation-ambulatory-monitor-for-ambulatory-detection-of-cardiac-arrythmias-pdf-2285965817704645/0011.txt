Carnation Ambulatory Monitor for ambulatory detection of cardiac arrythmias

known atrial fibrillation in the UK. Intervention and comparator All patients acted as their own control and wore 4 external cardiac monitors (Zio XT, NUUBO vest, CAM, Novacor 'R' test 4) for 2 weeks each in randomised order. All patients also had dual chamber permanent pacemakers implanted, which detect arrhythmias to a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Key outcomes CAM measures of atrial fibrillation burden were compared with the implanted pacemaker. The CAM device was found to correlate with the pacemaker (R-square value 0.9618). CAM more accurately identified the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation than the Novacor 'R' test 4 device (odds ratio 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 32.1; p=0.042). Zio XT was also significantly more accurate than Novacor 'R' test 4 (odds ratio 12.3; 95% CI 1.4 to 110.3; p=0.02). CAM was significantly more comfortable during initial application than Novacor 'R' test 4 (p=0.024), but there was no significant different in comfort between the devices during the recording phase. All the devices were found to be more expensive than Novacor 'T' test 4 when both device and clinical care costs were considered.
