post and be self-applied by the patient and then posted back after the monitoring period. This could be more convenient than other monitoring options available and reduce the need for hospital visits. One expert further commented that this will also benefit people with poor mobility, where attending hospital appointments may be more difficult. Potential system impact One expert said that the diagnostic pathway is unlikely to change. However, because of improved comfort compared with Holter monitors, people are more likely to use the device for the entire monitoring period. This could lead to increased diagnostic yield through having a longer, continuous, monitoring period. The device could also reduce in-hospital work through reports being done externally and could lead to time savings for device preparation because of the device being single use. One expert said that the cost of the device is likely to be offset by an improved diagnostic yield, which can reduce need for repeat testing or repeat appointments. It could also reduce hospital physiologist time needed for data analysis and reporting, if the assessment was done externally. One expert further said that this would reduce hospital waiting times for cardiac monitoring. Applying the device at home and posting
