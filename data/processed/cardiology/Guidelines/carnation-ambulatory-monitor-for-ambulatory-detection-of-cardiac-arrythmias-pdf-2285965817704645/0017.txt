available. One expert said that the device was a novel solution during the COVID-19 pandemic to manage diagnostic waits for cardiac monitors. Two experts said that device would be more comfortable for people to use than standard care which uses Holter monitors. This is because Holter monitors uses standard electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes with wires connecting to a recording box. The experts agreed the patch-type devices are less intrusive than standard ambulatory monitors and are becoming more widely used in the NHS. Potential patient impact Two experts said that when compared with Holter monitors, these patch-type devices are less intrusive because there is no need for cables and they are smaller and water resistant (and so does not need to be removed when showering). One expert said that longer monitoring is also likely to improve diagnostic yield, especially in those with relatively infrequent symptoms. If diagnostic yield is improved it is also likely to reduce the need for more invasive procedures. Two experts noted that the device can be sent via post and be self-applied by the patient and then posted back after the monitoring period. This could be more convenient than other monitoring options available and reduce the need for
