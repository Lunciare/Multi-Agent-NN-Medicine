Carnation Ambulatory Monitor for ambulatory detection of cardiac arrythmias

ECG monitoring in the US. Intervention and comparator CAM patches worn for 48 hours. Five children wore a secondary CAM patch horizontally (leading to a total of 33 reports). Key outcomes The mean age was 4.2 plus or minus 5 months and the mean weight was 5.3 plus or minus 2.4 kg. P-waves were identifiable in all 33 reports and led to changes in medical management in 30% of children. Horizontal patch placement led to smaller amplitude P- waves. Strengths and limitations This study included children who weighed less than 10 kg. The company specify that their device is for use in children and adults weighing more than 10 kg. The retrospective study sample size was small and the monitoring time was limited to 48 hours, which may not be reflective of real-world use. Sustainability The company claims the technology will reduce the number of clinic visits needed. The device is also smaller than other patch monitors and the battrode can be recycled. The device packaging is made of paper and cardboard which can be recycled. There is no published evidence to support these claims.
