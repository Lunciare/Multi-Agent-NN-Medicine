Clinical and technical evidence A literature search was carried out for this briefing in accordance with the interim process and methods statement for medtech innovation briefings. This briefing includes the most relevant or best available published evidence relating to the clinical effectiveness of the technology. Further information about how the evidence for this briefing was selected is available on request by contacting mibs@nice.org.uk. Published evidence Four studies are summarised in this briefing. This includes 3 prospective comparative studies in adults and 1 retrospective single-arm study in children. A total of 125 people were included in the studies. The clinical evidence and its strengths and limitations is summarised in the overall assessment of the evidence. Overall assessment of the evidence Two of the included full text papers compare using Carnation Ambulatory Monitor (CAM) with either Holter monitors or Zio XT. One study compared 4 external cardiac monitors and uses an implanted pacemaker to test for recording accuracy. These studies found that the CAM device led to equivalent or enhanced detection of atrial fibrillation. There was positive patient
