Carnation Ambulatory Monitor for ambulatory detection of cardiac arrythmias

Summary • The technology described in this briefing is Carnation Ambulatory Monitor (CAM). It is an ambulatory cardiac monitor used for detecting cardiac arrhythmias. • The innovative aspects are a low noise floor, leading to more accurate and clearer signal detection. The device can also be worn for up to 14 days. • The intended place in therapy would be as an alternative to existing ambulatory cardiac monitors in people with suspected arrhythmias. • The main points from the evidence summarised in this briefing are from 4 studies (including 3 prospective comparative studies and 1 retrospective study in children) including a total of 125 adults and children. They show that CAM is at least as effective as other ambulatory cardiac monitors in adults with suspected arrhythmias. • Key uncertainties around the evidence are that the study sample sizes are small. • The cost of CAM is between £110 and £145 per person (if the analysis is done in the hospital) or £150 to £200 per person (if the analysis is done externally by the company; all excluding VAT), depending on the number of days recorded, if the device is posted and analysis costs.
