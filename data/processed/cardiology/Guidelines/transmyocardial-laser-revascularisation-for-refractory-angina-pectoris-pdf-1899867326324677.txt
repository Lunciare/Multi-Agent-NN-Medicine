Transmyocardial laser
revascularisation for refractory
angina pectoris
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 27 May 2009

Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful

discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on transmyocardial laser revascularisation (TMLR) for refractory
angina pectoris shows no efficacy, based on objective measurements of
myocardial function and survival. Current evidence on safety suggests that the
procedure may pose unacceptable risks. Therefore, this procedure should not be
used.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications and current treatments
2.1.1 Angina pectoris is chest discomfort, often described as pressure or pain, typically
occurring on exertion. It is caused by inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart
muscle, usually because of coronary artery disease. Refractory angina is a severe
angina form that cannot be controlled by normal medical or surgical treatment.
2.1.2 Angina treatment depends on symptoms, medical history and angiography
findings. Treatments include anti-anginal medication and revascularisation
interventions (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass
surgery). For patients with refractory angina, these treatments have either failed
or are not clinically suitable.

Transmyocardial laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris (IPG301)
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Transmyocardial laser revascularisation (TMLR) for refractory angina pectoris is
carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia. Ischaemic areas are
selected for treatment using echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scan and
coronary angiography before surgery. A left thoracotomy is performed and the
pericardium opened. A laser device is then used to create a number of channels
in the myocardium. Transoesophageal echocardiography confirms complete
passage across the myocardial wall by the laser.
2.2.2 A number of different types of laser can be used for this procedure.
2.3 Efficacy
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the
published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about
this procedure.
2.3.1 A meta-analysis of 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs; total 1,359 patients)
found no difference in 12-month mortality between TMLR-treated patients and
controls treated either medically or with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG;
odds ratio [OR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5 to 1.8). Nor was there any
difference in mortality when studies comparing TMLR plus CABG against CABG
alone were excluded (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.5 to 1.2).
2.3.2 An RCT of 100 patients treated either with TMLR or medically reported that
myocardial contractility (assessed with stress echocardiography or single photon
emission computed tomography [SPECT]; lower value indicating worse function)
was significantly lower in TMLR-treated patients (1.49±0.44) than those treated
medically (1.56±0.47) at 12-month follow-up (p<0.05). Six other RCTs found no
significant difference in myocardial perfusion (examined with stress testing or
perfusion scanning) in TMLR-treated patients, compared with patients treated
medically. A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (total 323 patients) reported greater mean
improvement (from baseline) in total exercise time in TMLR-treated patients
compared with those treated medically at 6-month follow-up (pooled mean
difference 120.1 seconds; 95% CI 4.5 to 235.7).

2.3.3 A meta-analysis of 3 studies (total 135 patients) reported an improvement from
baseline in angina score (measured using four-point scales) in TMLR-treated
patients compared with those treated medically, with a reduction in mean
difference in angina score between TMLR and non-TMLR treatment groups of
-1.8 (95% CI -2.4 to -1.1) at 6-month follow-up and -1.0 (95% CI -1.7 to -0.3) at
12-month follow-up.
2.3.4 Five RCTs measured quality of life with different instruments. One RCT showed
no significant difference between TMLR-treated patients and patients treated
with thoracic sympathectomy, while the other 4 RCTs found significant
improvements in quality of life for TMLR-treated patients compared with those
treated medically (significance not stated). None of the studies had blinded
patients to their treatment.
2.3.5 Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as angina severity reduction,
exercise capacity improvement, reduced medicine use and increased quality of
life.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs indicated no difference in postoperative mortality
between TMLR-treated patients and controls treated medically or with CABG
(pooled OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.7). However, when 2 trials comparing TMLR
plus CABG against CABG alone were excluded, postoperative mortality was
greater in TMLR-treated patients than controls (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.93).
2.4.2 In 7 RCTs the subsequent myocardial infarction rate was higher in TMLR-treated
patients than in controls (6% [41 of 633] compared with 2% [11 of 651]; follow-up
period 12 months; significance not stated).
2.4.3 An RCT of 100 patients reported that postoperative heart failure occurred more
frequently in TMLR-treated patients (34% [17 of 50]) than in medically treated
patients (0% [0 of 50]), but significance was not stated. An RCT of 182 patients
reported that thromboembolic events occurred more frequently in TMLR-treated
patients (10% [9 of 92]) than those treated medically (3% [3 of 90]), but
significance and follow-up were not stated.

2.4.4 A case series of 169 TMLR-treated patients reported that 14% (23 of 169)
developed acute non-inflammatory pericarditis following the procedure (sequelae
not reported). In a case series of 20 TMLR-treated patients, acute mitral
regurgitation was reported in 5% (1 of 20). An international multicentre case
series of 932 patients reported cardiac tamponade in less than 1% (5 of 932) of
patients.
2.4.5 A retrospective non-randomised controlled trial of 255 patients reported that
neurological complications occurred more frequently after TMLR plus CABG (3%
[1 of 36]) than after CABG alone (1% [3 of 219]), but significance and follow-up
were not stated.
2.4.6 Specialist advisers stated that adverse events reported in the literature included
death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and wound and other
infections.
2.5 Other comments
2.5.1 The committee noted that some studies showed improvements in symptoms and
quality of life, but considered that these were likely to be placebo responses in
the light of evidence that showed no objective benefits.
2.5.2 The committee considered evidence on TMLR alone for refractory angina
pectoris, and also on TMLR performed concomitantly with CABG.
