to 1.34, p=0.005). In 2 of the studies reporting this outcome, angiography was done at 3 and 6 months; in the third study, angiograms were done at a median of 12.6 months. Neither of the randomised controlled trials included in this analysis showed any statistically significant difference between the groups. 4.3 The systematic review of 44 studies reported less postoperative pain in patients following endoscopic saphenous vein harvesting than after open saphenous vein harvest (12 studies, n=663, unstandardised mean difference -1.48, 95% CI -2.38 to -0.59, p=0.001, I2=98% [significant heterogeneity]). A similar result was obtained when the analysis was limited to randomised controlled trials only (unstandardised mean difference -1.75, 95% CI -3.17 to -0.32, p=0.02). Significant heterogeneity was observed in both analyses, partly because of differences in the device system used across studies. 4.4 The specialist advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as reduced hospital stay, reduced risk of leg wound infections, early mobility, early rehabilitation and return to normal activities after CABG, reduced rate of readmissions, freedom from myocardial infarction, freedom from re-intervention, and patient satisfaction. 5 Safety This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure.
