Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting

in damage to the vein, which could decrease patency and lead to increased rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, mid-term myocardial infarction, mid-term mortality, recurrence of angina, repeat revascularisation rates and decreased survival over the long term. 6 Committee comments 6.1 When it considered endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting in 2010 (see section 7), the Committee had concerns about safety in the short and medium term. These concerns were related to the possible reduction in patency rates of endoscopically harvested vein grafts, with increased risks of re-intervention, myocardial infarction and death compared against open harvesting techniques. Evidence published since that time included large numbers of patients, and the Committee judged that it did not show increased occlusion rates or incidences of re-intervention, myocardial infarction or death for endoscopically harvested grafts. 6.2 The Committee noted the importance of training and regular experience for any clinician doing this procedure. 6.3 The Committee noted positive comments from patients about their experiences of the procedure.
