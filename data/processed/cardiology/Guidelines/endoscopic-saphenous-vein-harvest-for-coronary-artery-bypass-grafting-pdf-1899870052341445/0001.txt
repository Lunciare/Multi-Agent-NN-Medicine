1 Recommendations 1.1 Current evidence on the efficacy and safety of endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. 1.2 The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research runs the UK Central Cardiac Audit Database (UKCCAD) and clinicians should enter details of all patients undergoing endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for CABG onto this database. 2 Indications and current treatments 2.1 Coronary artery disease refers to hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries as a result of atherosclerosis. This can cause angina and myocardial infarction, and result in heart failure. One treatment option for coronary artery disease is coronary artery bypass grafting, which is normally done using autologous vein or arterial grafts. Vein grafts are most commonly done using the great saphenous vein. 2.2 The conventional method of harvesting the saphenous vein is an 'open' technique using 1 or more incisions in the leg. This technique may result in local complications including wound infection, dehiscence and persistent pain. Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest aims to reduce these problems by using much smaller incisions. 3 The procedure 3.1 The procedure
