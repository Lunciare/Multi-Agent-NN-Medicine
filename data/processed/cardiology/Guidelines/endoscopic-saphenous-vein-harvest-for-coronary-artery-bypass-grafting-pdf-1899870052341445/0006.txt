Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting

5.2 Wound infection was reported in a lower proportion of patients treated by endovascular vein harvest than in patients treated by open saphenous vein harvest in the systematic review of 44 studies (log-relative risk 0.31, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.42, p<0.0001, I2=43%). A similar result was reported from the analysis of randomised controlled trials only (log-relative risk 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.44, p<0.0001). Wound infection was reported in less than 1% of patients treated by endoscopic saphenous vein harvest and 2% of patients treated by open saphenous vein harvest in the non-randomised comparative study of 1,988 patients (p=0.03). 5.3 Severe leg wound complications needing surgical revision were reported in 1% and 2% of patients treated by endoscopic and open saphenous vein harvest respectively (p=not significant) in the non-randomised comparative study of 885 patients. 5.4 Necrotising fasciitis was reported in 1 patient in a case report. The patient developed symptoms 3 weeks after the procedure, and surgical exploration of the wound showed extensive necrosis. Treatment included radical debridement, intravenous antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics, and a split-thickness skin graft. 5.5 Compartment syndrome was reported in 1 patient in a case report. Symptoms of leg tightness, swelling and tenderness occurred 4
