Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting

44 studies including 269,474 patients reported no statistically significant difference in mid-term mortality between patients treated by endoscopic or open saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; log-relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.03, p=0.12, median follow-up 22.5 months). A non-randomised comparative study of 4,709 patients treated by endoscopic or open saphenous vein harvest reported that there was no difference between the groups for the main outcome measure of mid-term mortality, repeat revascularisation and myocardial infarction combined (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.74, p=0.51) in 2,665 propensity-matched patients (533 versus 2,132). A non- randomised comparative study of 1,988 patients treated by endoscopic or open saphenous vein harvest reported overall rates of revascularisation, death and myocardial infarction of 6% and 7% respectively (p=0.18) with a mean follow-up of 22 months. 4.2 The systematic review of 44 studies reported an increased incidence of vein graft stenosis in the endoscopic group compared with the open group (3 studies, n=3,229, log-rate ratio 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.34, p=0.005). In 2 of the studies reporting this outcome, angiography was done at 3 and 6 months; in the third study, angiograms were done at a median of
