Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting

in local complications including wound infection, dehiscence and persistent pain. Endoscopic saphenous vein harvest aims to reduce these problems by using much smaller incisions. 3 The procedure 3.1 The procedure is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia, at the same time as coronary artery bypass grafting. An endoscope is usually inserted through a short incision near the knee, to visualise the subcutaneous plane in which the great saphenous vein lies. Carbon dioxide insufflation may be used to open this space. The vein is mobilised by blunt dissection and its tributaries are clipped and divided before removing the dissected segment of vein. The subcutaneous tunnel may be packed with an antibiotic-soaked swab, which is removed before wound closure. A compression bandage is applied to the leg to minimise haematoma. 4 Efficacy This section describes efficacy outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview. 4.1 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 44 studies including 269,474 patients reported no statistically significant difference in mid-term mortality between patients treated by endoscopic or open saphenous vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; log-relative
