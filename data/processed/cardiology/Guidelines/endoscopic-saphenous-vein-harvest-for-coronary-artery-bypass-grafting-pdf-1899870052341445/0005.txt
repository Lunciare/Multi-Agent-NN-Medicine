freedom from re-intervention, and patient satisfaction. 5 Safety This section describes safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview. 5.1 The systematic review and meta-analysis of 44 studies reported a lower incidence of 30-day mortality in patients treated by endoscopic saphenous vein harvest than in patients who had open saphenous vein harvest (log-relative risk 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 0.90, p=0.005). This difference was no longer statistically significant when only randomised controlled trials were analysed (log-relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.11, p=0.58). In-hospital mortality was 1% after both endoscopic and open saphenous vein harvest in the non- randomised comparative study of 4,709 patients (2,665 propensity-matched patients [533 versus 2,132]). Mortality within 30 days occurred in 2% of patients treated by endoscopic saphenous vein harvest and 4% of patients treated by open saphenous vein harvest in the non-randomised comparative study of 1,988 patients (478 propensity-matched patients, p=0.26). 5.2 Wound infection was reported in a lower proportion of patients treated by endovascular vein harvest than in patients treated by open saphenous vein harvest in the systematic review of
