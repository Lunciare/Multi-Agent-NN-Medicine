Leadless cardiac pacemaker implantation for bradyarrhythmias

in people without atrioventricular block. Single-chamber ventricular pacemakers may be used for atrioventricular block alone or with sick sinus syndrome in people with continuous atrial fibrillation, or people who have specific factors such as frailty or comorbidities that influence the balance of risks and benefits in favour of single-chamber pacing. The procedure 2.3 The aim of implanting a leadless cardiac pacemaker is to detect cardiac bradyarrhythmias and deliver electric pulses to the heart to increase the heart rate. The leadless pacemaker has a built-in pulse generator, battery and electrodes. The procedure is done under local anaesthesia, with or without sedation, in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the proximal end of the pacemaker is attached to a deflectable bespoke delivery catheter system and inserted percutaneously through the femoral vein using a dedicated introducer sheath. It is then advanced into the right atrium through the tricuspid valve, into the right ventricle and positioned near the apex or lower septum. Contrast may be injected into the right ventricle to visualise the desired location. Once positioned, the pacemaker is deployed and securely implanted into the endocardial wall using a fixation mechanism (a screw-in helix or nitinol tines). An electrode at the distal
