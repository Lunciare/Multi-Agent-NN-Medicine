Leadless cardiac pacemaker implantation for bradyarrhythmias

therapy. 1.7 NICE may review this procedure on publication of further evidence. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Bradyarrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can result in a slow heart rate (bradycardia), usually defined as less than 60 beats per minute. There are a range of causes including diseases such as sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block. The most common causes are the natural ageing process, ischaemic heart disease, heart valve disorders and heart failure. If untreated, bradycardia may lead to fatigue, fainting, palpitations, dizziness, heart failure and an increased risk of death. Current treatments 2.2 Bradyarrhythmias are managed with pacemakers, as described in NICE technology appraisal guidance on dual-chamber pacemakers for symptomatic bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome and/or atrioventricular block and dual-chamber pacemakers for symptomatic bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome without atrioventricular block. Dual-chamber pacing is recommended for symptomatic bradycardia caused by sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, or a combination of sick sinus syndrome and/or atrioventricular block, and also for sick sinus syndrome in people without atrioventricular block. Single-chamber ventricular pacemakers may be used for atrioventricular block alone or with sick sinus syndrome in people with continuous atrial fibrillation, or people who have
