desired location. Once positioned, the pacemaker is deployed and securely implanted into the endocardial wall using a fixation mechanism (a screw-in helix or nitinol tines). An electrode at the distal end of the pacemaker delivers electrical impulses that pace the heart. Electrical measurements are taken and, if satisfactory, the pacemaker is released from the catheter and the catheter is removed. If the position is suboptimal, the pacemaker can be detached from the endocardium and repositioned prior to final release of the delivery catheter. 2.4 The pacemaker is programmed using an external programmer that transmits signals to it. The pacemaker can be retrieved using a catheter retrieval system, if device dislodgement is discovered at follow-up. 2.5 The device can only detect and pace the right ventricle (single chamber) in contrast to some conventional pacemakers that can provide dual- chamber (right atrium and right ventricle) detection and pacing. It is therefore suitable for people who only need single-chamber ventricular pacing. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 To inform the committee, NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 8 sources,
