Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guidance represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, health
professionals are expected to take this guidance fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients. The application of the
recommendations in this guidance is at the discretion of health professionals and their
individual patients and do not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to
make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation
with the patient and/or their carer or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to provide the funding required to
enable the guidance to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients
wish to use it, in accordance with the NHS Constitution. They should do so in light of their
duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance
equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection
fraction (TA929)
1 Recommendations
1.1 Empagliflozin is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an
option for treating symptomatic chronic heart failure with preserved or
mildly reduced ejection fraction in adults.
1.2 If people with the condition and their clinicians consider empagliflozin to
be 1 of a range of suitable treatments (including dapagliflozin), after
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of all the options, use the
least expensive. Take account of administration costs, dosage, price per
dose and commercial arrangements.
Why these recommendations were made
Chronic heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction is usually treated
with standard care (loop diuretics, and treatment for other conditions the person may
have). People may also have dapagliflozin which is already recommended in NICE's
technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin. Empagliflozin works in a similar way to
dapagliflozin and would be offered to the same population.
Evidence from a clinical trial shows that empagliflozin plus standard care reduces the
combined risk of dying from cardiovascular causes or likelihood of first hospitalisation for
heart failure compared with placebo plus standard care. There is no clinical trial evidence
directly comparing empagliflozin with dapagliflozin. The trials for empagliflozin and
dapagliflozin have some differences, including the populations included in the trials and
how outcomes are defined. When adjustments for these differences are made, an indirect
comparison suggests the treatments have similar clinical effectiveness and a similar effect
on quality of life.
A cost comparison suggests empagliflozin has similar costs to dapagliflozin. So,
empagliflozin is recommended. Empagliflozin should be started on the advice of a heart
failure specialist.
For all evidence see the committee papers. To see what NICE did for dapagliflozin, see the
committee discussion section in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin.

Dosage in the marketing authorisation
2.3 The dosage schedule is available in the summary of product
characteristics for empagliflozin.
Price

3 Implementation
3.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information
Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013 requires integrated care boards,
NHS England and, with respect to their public health functions, local
authorities to comply with the recommendations in this appraisal within
3 months of its date of publication. Because empagliflozin has been
recommended through the cost comparison process, NHS England and
integrated care boards have agreed to provide funding to implement this
guidance 30 days after publication.
3.2 The Welsh ministers have issued directions to the NHS in Wales on
implementing NICE technology appraisal guidance. When a NICE
technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or
other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and
resources for it within 2 months of the first publication of the final
appraisal document.
3.3 When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make
sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraphs above. This
means that, if a patient has chronic heart failure with preserved or mildly
reduced ejection fraction and the clinician responsible for their care
thinks that empagliflozin is the right treatment, it should be available for
use, in line with NICE's recommendations.

4 Appraisal committee members and
NICE project team
Appraisal committee members
The 4 technology appraisal committees are standing advisory committees of NICE. This
topic was considered by the lead team of committee C, which includes the chair.
Committee members are asked to declare any interests in the technology to be appraised.
If it is considered there is a conflict of interest, the member is excluded from participating
further in that appraisal.
NICE project team
Each technology appraisal is assigned to a team consisting of 1 or more health technology
analysts (who act as technical leads for the appraisal), a technical adviser and a project
manager.
