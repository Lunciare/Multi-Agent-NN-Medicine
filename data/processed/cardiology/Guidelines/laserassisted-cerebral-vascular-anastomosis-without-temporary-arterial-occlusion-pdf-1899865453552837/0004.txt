Laser-assisted cerebral vascular anastomosis without temporary arterial occlusion

high-flow bypass was successfully created in 97% (75 out of 77) of cases. A patent anastomosis was not achieved in 3% (2 out of 77) of cases because the excised section of the targeted artery wall did not attach to the laser tip on withdrawal. A second procedure was required in 8 patients (10%), usually because of postoperative graft thrombosis. 2.3.2 In a second case series of 15 patients with carotid artery occlusion and recurrent ischaemic symptoms, transcranial Doppler ultrasound of 11 patients who survived to 6 months showed that a patent bypass was maintained in 91% (10 out of 11) of them. 2.3.3 In two case series of 77 and 34 patients, 68% (52 out of 77) and 79% (27 out of 34) of patients were independent (using the modified Rankin scale) at 2 to 4-month and 3.3-year follow-up, respectively. In the first study, functional health improved in 14% (11 out of 77) of patients, was unchanged in 65% (50 out of 77) and had decreased in 21% (16 out of 77) at 2 to 4-month follow-up. In the second study, Rankin score (a measure of functional capacity) had improved in 71% (24 out of 34) of patients at
