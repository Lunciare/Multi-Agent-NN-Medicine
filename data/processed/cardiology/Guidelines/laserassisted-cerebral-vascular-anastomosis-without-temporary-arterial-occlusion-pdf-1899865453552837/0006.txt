Laser-assisted cerebral vascular anastomosis without temporary arterial occlusion

(16 out of 77), by haemorrhage in 5% (4 out of 77) and by other intracranial events in 3% (2 out of 77) of patients. Procedure-related complications resulting in a Rankin score of 3 to 5 occurred in 9% (7 out of 77) of patients. 2.4.3 The case series of 15 patients with carotid artery occlusion reported that ischaemic stroke occurred in 20% (3 out of 15) of patients and dysphasia with right-sided weakness occurred in 13% (2 out of 15). 2.4.4 The Specialist Advisers considered the theoretical adverse events of the procedure to include leakage of the anastomosis and laser damage to the bypass vessel wall leading to late stenosis. 3 Further information 3.1 This guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion). 3.2 NICE has produced interventional procedures guidance on extracranial to intracranial bypass for intracranial atherosclerosis.
