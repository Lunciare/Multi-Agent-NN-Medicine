ring. A combined laser–vacuum suction catheter is introduced through the bypass graft into the platinum ring on the wall of the recipient vessel. Using vacuum suction and laser pulses, a disc-shaped area is resected in the wall of the recipient vessel. This punched-out disc is withdrawn while still attached to the vacuum catheter, completing the anastomosis without interrupting cerebral blood flow. The graft is then temporarily clipped to prevent backflow while the resected wall is closed (in direct extracranial/ intracranial bypass) or the proximal anastomosis is formed (in indirect interposition extracranial/intracranial bypass). When interposition grafts are used, the proximal anastomosis is performed using a standard end-to-end or end-to-side anastomosis. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more details, see the overview. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In a case series of 77 patients with intracranial aneurysms undergoing bypass using laser-assisted cerebral vascular anastomosis without temporary arterial occlusion, a patent high-flow bypass was successfully created in 97% (75 out of 77) of cases. A patent anastomosis was not achieved in 3% (2 out of 77) of cases because the excised
