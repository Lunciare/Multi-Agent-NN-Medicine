Laser-assisted cerebral vascular anastomosis without temporary arterial occlusion

out of 77) at 2 to 4-month follow-up. In the second study, Rankin score (a measure of functional capacity) had improved in 71% (24 out of 34) of patients at discharge and 74% (25 out of 34) at 3.3-year follow-up. Of the 27 patients who had pre-existing cranial nerve compression in the second study, 30% (10 out of 27) resolved at the same follow-up. 2.3.4 The Specialist Advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to be graft patency (including angiographic assessment) without further stenosis and lack of haemorrhage during the procedure. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 In four studies, postoperative mortality (up to 30-day follow-up) following laser- assisted cerebral vascular anastomosis without temporary arterial occlusion was reported to be 7% (1 out of 15), 6% (2 out of 34), 4% (3 out of 77) and 0% (0 out of 1), respectively. The indication for the procedure varied between studies. 2.4.2 The case series of 77 patients with intracranial artery aneurysms in whom the procedure was used reported persistent deficit caused by ischaemia in 21% (16 out of 77), by haemorrhage in 5% (4 out of 77) and by other intracranial events in 3% (2 out of 77) of patients.
