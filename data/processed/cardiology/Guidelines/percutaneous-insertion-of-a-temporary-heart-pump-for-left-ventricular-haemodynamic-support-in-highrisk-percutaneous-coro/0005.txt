to be taken from the left ventricle and pumped into the ascending aorta. 2.5 Different miniature, catheter-based, intravascular devices are available and the precise implantation technique varies according to the device. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 To inform the committee, NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 10 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 4 systematic reviews, 3 case series, 1 randomised controlled trial and 2 case reports, and is presented in table 2 of the interventional procedures overview. Other relevant literature is in appendix A of the overview. 3.2 The specialist advisers and the committee considered the key efficacy outcomes to be: procedural success and completeness of revascularisation, haemodynamic stability, survival to hospital discharge, survival at 30 days, and rate of major adverse cardiac events. 3.3 The specialist advisers and the committee considered the key safety outcomes to be: vascular damage, bleeding, haemolysis and left ventricle damage. 3.4 Four commentaries from patients who had experience of this procedure were received, which were discussed by the committee.
