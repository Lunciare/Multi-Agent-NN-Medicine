Percutaneous insertion of a temporary heart pump for left ventricular haemodynamic

situation allows. 1.4 The procedure should only be done in specialised centres by clinicians and teams with specialised training in the use of this technology and experience in complex percutaneous coronary interventions. 1.5 Further research should report details of patient selection and subsequent management. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Additional support for the heart is not usually needed with angioplasty or percutaneous coronary intervention. However, a subset of high-risk patients may benefit from some form of heart support during their angioplasty procedure. This includes those with extensive or complex coronary artery disease (unprotected left main disease, last remaining vessel or multi-vessel disease), poor left ventricular function, ongoing myocardial ischemia, cardiogenic shock and comorbidity, in whom revascularisation may not otherwise be possible. Current treatments 2.2 Temporary percutaneous mechanical haemodynamic support can be used prophylactically in some elective high-risk angioplasty procedures or in urgent procedures. The aim is to support the patient's circulatory system, provide blood flow to increase cardiac output, unload the ventricle and improve blood flow to maintain haemodynamic stability. This minimises myocardial ischemia and reduces the risk of haemodynamic collapse during the procedure. Intra-aortic balloon pumps or extra-corporeal pumps may be used for temporary
