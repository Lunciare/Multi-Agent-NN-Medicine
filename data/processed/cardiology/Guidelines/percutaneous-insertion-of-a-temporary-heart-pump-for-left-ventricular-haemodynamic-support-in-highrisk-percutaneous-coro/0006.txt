Percutaneous insertion of a temporary heart pump for left ventricular haemodynamic

bleeding, haemolysis and left ventricle damage. 3.4 Four commentaries from patients who had experience of this procedure were received, which were discussed by the committee. Committee comments 3.5 The committee noted that: • Evidence of benefit for patients with cardiogenic shock is limited. In the evidence reviewed, there were only a small number of patients with cardiogenic shock who could not have percutaneous coronary intervention and the outcomes of these patients are poor. • The use of the procedure may allow intervention in patients who would otherwise be unable to have percutaneous coronary intervention. This may include patients who have had previous coronary artery surgery. • The risks of bleeding has reduced with improvement in the design of the technology. • More than 1 device is available for use in this procedure and the technology is evolving.
