flow to maintain haemodynamic stability. This minimises myocardial ischemia and reduces the risk of haemodynamic collapse during the procedure. Intra-aortic balloon pumps or extra-corporeal pumps may be used for temporary percutaneous mechanical haemodynamic support. Percutaneous left ventricular-assist devices for haemodynamic support are sometimes used instead of intra-aortic balloon pumps or extra-corporeal pumps. The procedure 2.3 Inserting a temporary percutaneous mechanical haemodynamic support device may be done before or during percutaneous coronary intervention in selected high-risk patients, and is then taken out when the patient is stable. 2.4 The procedure is done under local anaesthesia. An introducer sheath is inserted into a large artery (usually the femoral or axillary artery) and a guidewire is passed into the left ventricle. A catheter with an integrated pump at its distal end is passed over the guidewire, into the large vessel and into the left ventricle. Fluoroscopic imaging is used during the procedure. The catheter is then attached to an automated external console, which controls the pump speed and monitors its function, allowing blood to be taken from the left ventricle and pumped into the ascending aorta. 2.5 Different miniature, catheter-based, intravascular devices are available and the precise implantation technique varies according to the
