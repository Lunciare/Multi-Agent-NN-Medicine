progress in reducing salt in everyday foods. As a result, products with no added salt are now increasingly available. However, it is taking too long to reduce average salt intake among the population. Furthermore, average intake among children is above the level recommended by Public Health England, and some children consume as much salt as adults. Progress towards a low-salt diet needs to be accelerated as a matter of urgency. Policy goal • Reduce population-level consumption of salt. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. What action should be taken? • Accelerate the reduction in salt intake among the population. Aim for a maximum intake of 6 g per day per adult by 2015 and 3 g by 2025. • Ensure children's salt intake does not exceed age-appropriate guidelines (these guidelines should be based on up-to-date assessments of the available scientific evidence). • Promote the benefits of a reduction in the population's salt intake to the European Union (EU). Introduce national legislation if necessary. • Ensure national policy on salt in England is not weakened by less effective action in other parts of the EU. • Ensure food producers and
