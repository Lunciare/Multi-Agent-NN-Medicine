Many of the risk factors that the PDG considered are also associated with other health-related conditions including some common cancers, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease and mental wellbeing. The strategies discussed in this guidance are likely to help prevent some of these other health conditions. (Certainly, they are not likely to increase the risk of any common chronic diseases.) However, it was not possible to consider each of these other health conditions in detail. 1.74 Daily consumption of products containing plant sterols and stanols may reduce blood cholesterol by about 10%, and so may reduce CVD mortality substantially. However, it was not clear how a recommendation on their use might impact on inequalities in health. The PDG believes this issue deserves further attention. 1.75 Agricultural and transport policy and practice (and associated issues) has a powerful impact on people's diet and physical activity levels. It also has an impact on climate change and sustainable development (which, in turn, can affect health). An analysis of transport patterns in London and how they could be changed indicates the extent of this synergy (Woodcock et al. 2009). One scenario described a 'sustainable transport future' featuring more physically active travel and low-emission
