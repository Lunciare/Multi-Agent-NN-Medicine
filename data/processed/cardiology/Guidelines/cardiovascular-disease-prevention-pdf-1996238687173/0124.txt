a mixed pattern for the effect of MRFI programmes on physical activity (the majority of studies are disbeneficial). Three CBA studies and two RCTs demonstrate a favourable net effect. Three CBA studies demonstrate inconclusive net effects and four CBA studies demonstrate a disbeneficial net effect. The most optimistic result is from a CBA study, reporting an 11.5% net increase in the number of people doing strenuous physical activity more than three times per week. The least optimistic result is from a CBA study, reporting a 6% net decrease in the number of people who were physically active.
