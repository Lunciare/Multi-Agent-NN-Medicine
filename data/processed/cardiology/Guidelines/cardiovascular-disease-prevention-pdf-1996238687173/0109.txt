Cardiovascular disease prevention

are reported in Prevention of cardiovascular disease at population level: modelling strategies for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Fieldwork Fieldwork was carried out to evaluate how relevant and useful NICE's recommendations are for practitioners and how feasible it would be to put them into practice. It was conducted with practitioners and commissioners who are involved in activities relevant to cardiovascular disease. They included those working in the food industry (such as food retailers, food producers and trade associations), local planning departments, local authority catering representatives and representatives from the NHS and PCTs. The fieldwork comprised: • Eight half-day workshops. • Nine case studies (interviews involving practitioners, commissioners and professionals). Each reviewed recommendations made in the following specific areas: － health impact assessments － CVD prevention programmes (two case studies) － take-away planning － training caterers － public sector food provision － physically active travel － the dairy industry － reformulation of food. • Telephone interviews covering the following topics: mass media, government departments, and key food industry producers. The studies were commissioned to ensure there was ample geographical coverage. The main issues arising from these studies are set out in appendix C under fieldwork findings.
