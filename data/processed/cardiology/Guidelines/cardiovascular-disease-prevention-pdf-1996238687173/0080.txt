Cardiovascular disease prevention

is often contamination between the two groups which can lead to an underestimation of any beneficial effects. • It is ethically wrong, and practically impossible, to randomly allocate country- wide populations to controlled trials. The best evidence available has to be gleaned from other research designs, in particular, natural experiments, epidemiological models and cost effectiveness and cost–benefit analyses. 1.69 The potential effect of any intervention may change according to the initial level of risk. For instance, it may be easier to reduce salt consumption among a population with a high intake than among a population where intakes of salt are lower. However, epidemiological modelling suggests that substantial reductions in CVD rates can be achieved by reducing the major risk factors as much as possible. This is the case even in countries where CVD mortality rates are already relatively low, such as Italy (Palmieri et al. 2009). 1.70 The economic modelling used for this guidance was based on conservative assumptions. Nevertheless, it suggested that the recommended population- based approaches are likely to be consistently cost saving (see considerations 1.33 and 1.45 and appendix C). Interpreting the evidence 1.71 The PDG recognised that empirical data alone, even from the best conducted investigation,
