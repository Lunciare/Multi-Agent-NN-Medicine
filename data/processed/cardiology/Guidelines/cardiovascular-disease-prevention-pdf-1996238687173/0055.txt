Cardiovascular disease prevention

ability to choose healthier options. Social and economic action can also change people's risk of CVD (in such cases, the health outcomes are side effects, albeit desirable). 1.19 The recommendations in this guidance do not, in the main, rely on individual choice. Rather, they aim to improve social environments and thus ensure the healthy choice is the easy choice. The emphasis is on changing policies, systems, regulations, the physical environment and other 'upstream' factors. This approach is likely to reduce, rather than increase, health inequalities and is congruent with NICE's guidance on behaviour change. Population-level approaches: cost effectiveness 1.20 The financial modelling for this guidance shows that considerable cost savings could be made. Using a number of conservative assumptions, it found that halving CVD events across England and Wales (a population of 50 million) would result in discounted savings in healthcare costs of approximately £14 billion per year. Reducing mean population cholesterol or blood pressure levels by 5% would result in discounted annual savings of approximately £0.7 billion and £0.9 billion respectively. Reducing population cardiovascular risk by even 1% would generate discounted savings of approximately £260 million per year. 1.21 A 3 g reduction in mean daily salt intake by
