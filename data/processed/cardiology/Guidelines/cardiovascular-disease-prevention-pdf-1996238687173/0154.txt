for which there was direct evidence of effectiveness. Interventions modelled included: • The North Karelia project, including the effect of a net percentage reduction in serum cholesterol of 3% for men and 1% for women, and a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 3% for men and 5% for women. • The Stanford Five City Project, the effect of a 4% reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 2% decrease in serum cholesterol among the general population. • Legislation to ban trans fats and so reduce trans fatty acid (TFA) levels in the population so that it only accounts for approximately 0.7% of total energy intake. • Legislation to reduce the population's salt intake by 3 g and 6 g per day. The modelling made a number of conservative assumptions. It found that halving CVD events across the entire England and Wales population of 50 million would result in discounted savings of approximately £14 billion per year. Reducing mean population cholesterol or blood pressure levels by 5% would result in discounted annual savings of approximately £0.7 billion and £0.9 billion respectively. Reducing population cardiovascular risk by even 1% would generate discounted savings of approximately £260 million per year. Additional benefits
