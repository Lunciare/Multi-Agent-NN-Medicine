used to develop this guidance Introduction The reviews, expert reports and economic analysis include full details of the methods used to select the evidence (including search strategies), assess its quality and summarise it. The minutes of the PDG meetings provide further detail about the Group's interpretation of the evidence and development of the recommendations. All supporting documents are listed in appendix E. Key questions The key questions were established as part of the scope. They formed the starting point for the reviews of evidence and were used by the PDG to help develop the recommendations. The overarching questions were: • Which multiple risk-factor interventions are effective and cost effective in preventing the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) within a given population (primary prevention)? • How does effectiveness and cost effectiveness vary between different population groups? The subsidiary question was: What barriers and facilitators influence the effectiveness of multiple risk-factor programmes aimed at reducing CVD (or the risk factors associated with CVD) among a given population (including subgroups experiencing health inequalities, where the data allows)? These questions were made more specific for each review (see reviews for further details). Single risk factors were considered using expert testimony. See appendix C. Reviewing
