and how they could be changed indicates the extent of this synergy (Woodcock et al. 2009). One scenario described a 'sustainable transport future' featuring more physically active travel and low-emission vehicles to cut CO2 emissions by three-fifths. The report points out that physically active travel could bring substantial benefits: the incidence of heart disease and stroke could fall by 10% to 20%, with reductions in breast cancer (12% to 13%), dementia (8%) and depression (5%). Reductions in air pollution would bring additional health benefits. 1.76 Agriculture and food production account for 10% to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions (Friel et al. 2009). Livestock farming is responsible for four-fifths of these emissions (including methane). A 30% fall in adult consumption of saturated fat from animal sources (and an associated fall in livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions) would reduce heart disease by around 15% in the UK. If additional, positive effects are taken into account (such as a reduction in the prevalence of obesity and diet-related cancers) the health gains might been even more substantial. 1.77 Monitoring is crucial. The PDG commended the regular Food Standards Agency/ Department of Health-sponsored surveys. These include the National diet and nutrition survey (NDNS) and the Low
