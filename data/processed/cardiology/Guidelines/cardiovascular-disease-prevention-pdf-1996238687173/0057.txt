1.22 The PDG noted that CVD death rates are no longer falling among young and middle aged people in the UK (for instance, they are no longer falling among those aged 35 to 54 in the most socially disadvantaged groups in Scotland), the USA and Australia. This reflects a combination of adverse risk factors including smoking, a poor diet and disadvantage (O'Flaherty et al. 2009). 1.23 The prevalence of obesity and overweight continues to rise (National Heart Forum 2010). This, in turn, will lead to a rise in type 2 diabetes which can increase the risk of CVD. The risk of CHD is particularly high among women with diabetes (Barrett-Connor et al. 1991). 1.24 Epidemiological studies indicate that approximately 45 to 75% of the recent fall in CVD deaths in Westernised industrialised countries was the result of a reduction in the major risk factors. This includes a reduction in smoking prevalence and salt and saturated fat consumption. 1.25 The decline in CVD deaths noted above began long before effective treatments were introduced. In Finland and Iceland, coronary heart disease mortality rates declined by 63% between 1982 and 1997. Seventy five per cent of this was attributed to a reduction in
