Cardiovascular disease prevention

programme evaluations using different summary effect measures demonstrate a mixed effect of multiple risk factor interventions (MRFI) on CVD mortality (the majority of programmes were beneficial) with two controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies demonstrating a net decrease in CVD mortality and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating no net change. Limited evidence from 4 out of 38 programme evaluations, using different summary effect measures, demonstrate a mixed effect of MRFI on CVD morbidity (the majority disbeneficial) with one CBA study and one RCT demonstrating a net increase in morbidity and one RCT demonstrating no net change in morbidity. The effect of one programme on morbidity and mortality is unclear. Evidence statement R3.E1b Blood cholesterol: A large body of evidence from 15 CBA studies and 5 RCTs demonstrates a mixed direction of effect (majority of programmes beneficial) of MRFI programmes on blood cholesterol. Fourteen studies (nine CBA and five RCTs) demonstrate a beneficial net effect. Four CBA studies demonstrate no net effect or inconclusive net effects and two CBA studies demonstrate a disbeneficial net effect. The most optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting a 0.7mmol/l net reduction in blood cholesterol. The least optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting
