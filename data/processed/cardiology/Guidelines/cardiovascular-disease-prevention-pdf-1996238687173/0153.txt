including changing behaviours which increase the risk. However, when the findings from all programmes were summarised, the overall effect on health outcomes was uncertain. In addition, as these programmes were conducted many years ago, the findings may not be generally applicable in the UK now. The cost-effectiveness analysis strongly suggests that legislation likely to reduce the risk of CVD can be expected to produce a net cost saving to the public sector, as well as improving health. (Unless a very large sum of money needs to be spent on implementation.) For example, implementing a CVD prevention programme based on the North Karelia project would result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately £7000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). For the Stanford Five City Project, the total healthcare cost savings almost equal the estimated cost of the project. The benefits of reducing the prevalence of smoking would also make the programme cost saving. At the request of the Programme Development Group (PDG), the scope of the modelling was extended beyond programmes for which there was direct evidence of effectiveness. Interventions modelled included: • The North Karelia project, including the effect of a net percentage reduction in serum cholesterol of 3% for
