Policies may cover spatial planning, transport, food retailing and procurement. Organisations that may get involved could include statutory, public sector and civil society groups (examples of the latter are charities, clubs, self-help and community groups). When developing CVD programmes, take account of relevant recommendations in NICE's guidelines on tobacco, walking and cycling, physical activity: brief advice for adults in primary care, exercise referral schemes to promote physical activity, behaviour change: general approaches, physical activity and the environment, community engagement: improving health and wellbeing and reducing health inequalities, maternal and child nutrition, physical activity in the workplace, cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early, physical activity for children and young people and overweight and obesity management. • Only develop, plan and implement a strategic, integrated media campaign as part of a wider package of interventions to address CVD risk factors. Media campaigns should be based on an acknowledged theoretical framework.
