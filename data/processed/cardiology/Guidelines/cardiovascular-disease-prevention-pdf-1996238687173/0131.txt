Cardiovascular disease prevention

by other aspects of the nature of the intervention: Over the three reports, many other plausible reasons for the noted variation in effectiveness have been identified. These include: • duration of programme • intensity of programme • use of an underlying theoretical model to inform the design of the programme • pre-programme investigation of particular risk factors operating in a population • community involvement in planning and/or design of programme • adaptability of the programme as new challenges emerge • level of integration of the separate components of the programme • inclusion of environmental changes as part of the programme. Whether any of these factors account for differences in effectiveness which could not arise by chance alone has not been fully explored, and their potential importance can neither be confirmed nor refuted. Unfortunately, the extent to which the differences could ever be satisfactorily explored using the results from these evaluations is debatable given noted limitations in the reporting of the precise differences in nature of the programmes and the amount of statistical information available. Evidence statement R3.E5c Age: Fifteen programmes report participation in programme interventions and/or programme evaluation surveys according to age. One uncontrolled before-and-after study and 13 CBA studies
