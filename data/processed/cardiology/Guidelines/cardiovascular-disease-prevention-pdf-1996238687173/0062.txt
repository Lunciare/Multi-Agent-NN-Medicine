risk factors 1.32 The Strategy Unit report 'Food matters' (2008) concluded that some 70,000 premature UK deaths could be avoided with a healthier diet. More recently, the Food Standards Agency suggested that poor dietary health in the UK could contribute to up to 150,000 CVD deaths, and a further 155,000 cancer deaths, per year (Food Standards Agency 2009). 1.33 Much of the observational evidence that links diet to CVD is based on individual nutrients. However, the PDG recognised that their impact should also be considered in the context of the whole diet. It recognised that a 'healthier' diet is likely to comprise a favourable balance of food and nutrients and a reduction in the intake of harmful elements. In a typical Western diet, the latter include substantial amounts of salt, saturated fat and trans fats (Hu 2008). 1.34 A 'healthier' diet based on fruit, legumes, pulses, other vegetables, wholegrain foods, fish and poultry is consistently associated with lower levels of CVD risk factors (Fung et al. 2001; Lopez-Garcia et al. 2004) and lower CVD mortality (Heidemann et al. 2008; Osler et al. 2001). Vegetarian and 'Mediterranean' diets are also consistently associated with lower CVD mortality (Hu 2008; Mann et al.
