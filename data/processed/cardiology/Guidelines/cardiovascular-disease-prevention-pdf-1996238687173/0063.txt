2004) and lower CVD mortality (Heidemann et al. 2008; Osler et al. 2001). Vegetarian and 'Mediterranean' diets are also consistently associated with lower CVD mortality (Hu 2008; Mann et al. 2009). Interventions promoting these types of 'healthier' diet have been shown to be highly effective in reducing blood pressure, cholesterol and subsequently CVD (Appel et al. 1997; de Lorgeril et al. 1999). 1.35 The PDG emphasised its support for a healthy diet, as advocated in the 'eatwell' plate (Food Standards Agency 2007). 1.36 The PDG discussed whether it would be feasible for food labels to present calorie content in terms of the hours of physical activity required to use them up. There was no evidence to support this approach. However, there is evidence that presenting the total calorific content on food labels might help reduce intake (Ludwig and Brownell 2009). 1.37 Salt intake is a major determinant of CVD in the UK, mainly due to its effect on blood pressure. On average, 70% to 90% of people's intake comes from salt added during the manufacturing process; only 10% to 30% comes from adding it during cooking or at the table. Reducing the population's salt intake will, therefore, involve encouraging the
