study reports engagement in the programme increased willingness for future involvement. Evidence statement R4.3a There is evidence from five study reports that community programmes to address heart health can be affected by the broader political context. Evidence statement R4.3b This can effect diverse organisational elements such as: the availability of project funding, the development of partnerships between organisations and a sense of shared purpose at different administrative levels. Individual responses may also be affected through legislation incentives to healthier behaviours. Evidence statement R4.4a There is evidence from four study reports that high pricing can impact on people's ability and willingness to adopt healthy eating behaviours and to participate in organised physical activity. Evidence statement R4.7a Six study reports discuss factors relating to organisational and strategic issues. Evidence statement R4.7b There is evidence from four studies that short time frames limit the ability to plan and develop the programme, engage the community, develop partnerships and communication, meet targets and leave a positive legacy. Evidence statement R4.7c Leadership was identified as a key organisational benefit of programmes by three studies. It is required to develop partnerships and collaborations within communities, and is important at all levels, from volunteers to with senior administrators.
