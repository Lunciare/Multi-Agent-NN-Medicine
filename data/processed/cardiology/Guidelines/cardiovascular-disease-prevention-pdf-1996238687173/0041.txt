national stroke audit data is more conservative, putting the estimated 'first time' strokes a year at approximately 72,000 (33,000 among men and 39,000 among women). In addition, the British Heart Foundation estimates 96,000 new cases of angina in the UK each year (52,000 among men and about 43,000 among women) and around 113,000 heart attacks per year (67,000 among men and 46,000 among women). New cases of heart failure total around 68,000 a year (about 38,000 among men and 30,000 among women). Overall, CVD costs the UK approximately £30 billion annually (Luengo-Fernandez et al. 2006). Despite recent improvements, death rates in the UK from CVD are relatively high compared with other developed countries (only Ireland and Finland have higher rates). There is also considerable variation within the UK itself, geographically, ethnically and socially. For instance, premature death rates from CVD are up to six times higher among lower socioeconomic groups than among more affluent groups (O'Flaherty et al. 2009). In addition, death rates from CVD are approximately 50% higher than average among South Asian groups (Allender et al. 2007). The reduction in CVD-related risks among younger men (and perhaps women) over previous years seems to have stalled in England from
