Four studies (three CBA studies and one RCT) demonstrate a beneficial net effect. One CBA study demonstrates an inconclusive net effect and one CBA study demonstrates an unfavourable net effect. The most optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting a 24% net reduction in the number of people with high consumption of fat spread on bread. The least optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting a 3.3% net decrease in the use of unsaturated spreading fats.
