CBA study, reporting a 12.8% net increase in smoking prevalence. Evidence statement R3.E1e BMI: A large body of evidence from fourteen CBA studies and three RCTs demonstrate a mixed effect of MRFI programmes on body mass index (BMI) (the majority of programmes beneficial). Ten studies (seven CBA studies and three RCTs) demonstrate a beneficial net effect. Four CBA studies demonstrate no net effect or inconclusive net effects and three CBA studies demonstrate a disbeneficial net effect. The most optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting a 1.3kg/m2 net reduction in BMI. The least optimistic result was from a CBA study, reporting a 0.7kg/m2 net increase in BMI. Evidence statement R3.E1f Blood glucose: Limited evidence from 3 out of 38 programme evaluations, using different summary effect measures, demonstrate a mixed effect of MRFI on blood glucose. One RCT and one CBA study report mixed results: net decreases in men and net increases in women, whilst one CBA study demonstrates no net effect. Evidence statement R3.E1g Triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL) ratio or lipid levels: No evidence has been identified on the effects of MRFI programmes on triglyceride levels, HDL/LDL ratio or lipid levels. Evidence statement R3.E1h Dietary change –
