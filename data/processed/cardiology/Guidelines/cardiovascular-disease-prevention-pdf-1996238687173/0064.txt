salt added during the manufacturing process; only 10% to 30% comes from adding it during cooking or at the table. Reducing the population's salt intake will, therefore, involve encouraging the food industry to reduce the salt used in processed foods, as well as encouraging people to reduce the salt they add themselves. The PDG believes the former will best be achieved by using a combination of voluntary and regulatory action. 1.38 The UK population's per capita daily salt intake has fallen by 0.9 g in the last 5 years (a reduction of around 2% per year). This means people are consuming an average 8.6 g of salt per day. The reduction has mainly come about as a result of public awareness campaigns and a voluntary code of practice for industry, led by the Food Standards Agency. The voluntary agreement came into force in 2004 and was followed by progressive targets (in 2006 and 2009). The campaigns, which cost just £15 million, led to approximately 6000 fewer CVD deaths per year, saving the UK economy approximately £1.5 billion per annum. The PDG noted the new targets for 2010 and 2012. 1.39 Recent evidence shows that it is feasible to reduce the
