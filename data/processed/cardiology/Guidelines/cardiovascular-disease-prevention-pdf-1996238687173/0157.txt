Cardiovascular disease prevention

In general, representatives from the NHS and PCTs indicated that the regional CVD prevention recommendations were appropriate and that they supported current work on CVD prevention. Appendix D: Gaps in the evidence The Programme Development Group (PDG) identified a number of gaps in the evidence related to the programmes under examination based on an assessment of the evidence, stakeholder and expert comment and fieldwork. These gaps are set out below. 1. There is a lack of UK studies on the effectiveness of programmes to prevent CVD among black and minority ethnic groups living in the UK. 2. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting those with high risk factors who believe their health is bad. 3. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of providing emotional support and help to develop general coping skills as part of interventions to prevent CVD. 4. There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of CVD prevention programmes involving the families of those at risk. 5. There is a lack of controlled comparison studies looking at the effectiveness of lay health advisers in helping to prevent CVD. The group made 6 recommendations for research. Appendix E:
