The PDG also considered evidence and expert testimony on separate key risk factors. The reviews, together with the expert testimonies, are listed in appendix A. Relevant existing NICE guidance was also summarised. 1.2 The key CVD risk factors that can be modified are: smoking, a poor diet, obesity, lack of physical activity and high alcohol consumption (Emberson et al. 2004; Yusuf et al. 2004).

This 'clustering' also tends to have a disproportionate effect on people who are disadvantaged, further accentuating health inequalities. 1.3 The PDG noted that approximately 100,000 people die from smoking-related diseases in the UK every year. Tobacco accounts for approximately 29% of deaths from cancer, 13% of cardiovascular deaths and 30% of deaths from respiratory disease (Action on Smoking and Health 2008).
