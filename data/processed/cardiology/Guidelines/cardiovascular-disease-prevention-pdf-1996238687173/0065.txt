Cardiovascular disease prevention

saving the UK economy approximately £1.5 billion per annum. The PDG noted the new targets for 2010 and 2012. 1.39 Recent evidence shows that it is feasible to reduce the salt content of foods even further and that this would lead to substantial health benefits (Appel and Anderson 2010). For example, a 10% reduction in the salt content of items like bread and soup is not detected by consumers and does not, therefore, affect consumer choice. This would reduce both strokes and cardiovascular events. A reduction in mean salt intake of 3 g per day for adults (to achieve a target of 6 g daily) would lead to around 14,000 to 20,000 fewer deaths from CVD annually (Strazzullo et al. 2009). Using conservative assumptions, this means approximately 130,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) would be gained and around £350 million would be saved in healthcare costs. A reduction of 6 g per day would lead to twice the gain: some 260,000 QALYs and an annual saving of £700 million in healthcare costs. 1.40 Many children in the UK may be consuming as much salt as adults (He et al. 2008). Indeed, single helpings of soup or 'meal deals' may contain as
