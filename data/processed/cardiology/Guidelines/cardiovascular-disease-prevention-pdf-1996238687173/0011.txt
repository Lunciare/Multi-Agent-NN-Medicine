To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. What action should be taken? • Eliminate the use of IPTFAs for human consumption. • In line with other EU countries (specifically, Denmark and Austria), introduce legislation to ensure that IPTFA levels do not exceed 2% in the fats and oils used in food manufacturing and cooking. • Direct the bodies responsible for national surveys to measure and report on consumption of IPTFAs by different population subgroups, rather than only by mean consumption across the population as a whole. • Establish guidelines for local authorities to monitor independently IPTFA levels in the restaurant, fast-food and home food trades using existing statutory powers (in relation to trading standards or environmental health). • Create and sustain local and national conditions which support a reduction in the amount of IPTFAs in foods, while ensuring levels of saturated fat are not increased. Encourage the use of vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to replace oils containing IPTFAs. Saturated fats should not be used as an IPTFA substitute. • Develop UK-validated guidelines and information for the food service sector and local government on removing IPTFAs
