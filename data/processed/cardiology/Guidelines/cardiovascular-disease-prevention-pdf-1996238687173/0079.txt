Cardiovascular disease prevention

in the 1970s and 1980s. The age of the studies means a number of factors have to be taken into account when considering effectiveness. In particular: • The risk factor levels for CVD are likely to have changed. For instance, intake of salt and saturated fat and the prevalence of smoking may have fallen, while a sedentary lifestyle and rates of obesity may have increased. • The political and cultural environments which potentially influence the effectiveness of interventions may have changed substantially. 1.68 A number of issues have to be taken into account when considering evidence of the effectiveness of population-level interventions: • Changes may have come about inadvertently, for instance, as a result of a change in agriculture practice following economic developments. Any evaluation of such changes is likely to have been carried out after the event, using proxy data. • It is often difficult to find a suitable control population where conditions are relatively similar to those in the intervention group. Where a control group is used, there is often contamination between the two groups which can lead to an underestimation of any beneficial effects. • It is ethically wrong, and practically impossible, to randomly allocate country- wide
