intake (from 14% to 6 to 7% of total energy) might prevent approximately 30,000 CVD deaths annually. It would also prevent a corresponding number of new cases of CVD annually. (Note that low-fat products are not recommended for children under 2 years, but are fine thereafter.) Policy goal • Reduce population-level consumption of saturated fat. To achieve this, the evidence suggests that the following are among the measures that should be considered. What action should be taken? • Encourage manufacturers, caterers and producers to reduce substantially the amount of saturated fat in all food products. If necessary, consider supportive legislation. Ensure no manufacturer, caterer or producer is at an unfair advantage as a result. • Create the conditions whereby products containing lower levels of saturated fat are sold more cheaply than high saturated fat products. Consider legislation and fiscal levers if necessary. • Create favourable conditions for industry and agriculture to produce dairy products for human consumption that are low in saturated fat. • Continue to promote semi-skimmed milk for children aged over 2 years. This is in line with the American Heart Association's 2005 dietary recommendations for children and adolescents. Recommendation 3 Trans fats • Industrially-produced trans fatty acids
