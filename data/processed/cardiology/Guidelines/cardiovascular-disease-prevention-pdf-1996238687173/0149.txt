prior to funding. In addition, programmes and evaluations should allow sufficient time for outcomes to be achieved. Multiple methods may be needed to evaluate important aspects of CVD prevention programmes, such as community empowerment, that are not all easily captured through numerical outcome data. Programmes that measure only population-level changes may not capture large impacts for some individuals, and this may be important, especially where health inequalities are addressed. Evidence statement CE1 Three studies gave results in cost per life-year gained for population-based programmes compared to no intervention. The results ranged from cost-saving to £240,000 per life- year gained. Evidence statement CE2 Two studies gave results in cost per QALY or DALY (disability-adjusted life years) for population-based programmes compared to no intervention. Results ranged from £10 per QALY to £96 per DALY. Evidence statement CE3 Two studies gave results in cost per case prevented for population-based programmes compared to no intervention. Results ranged from cost saving to £22,000 per case prevented. Evidence statement CE4 Five studies reported results in cost per life-year gained for some form of screening strategy compared to no intervention. Results ranged from cost saving to £140,000 per life-year gained. Evidence statement CE5 Two studies gave results
