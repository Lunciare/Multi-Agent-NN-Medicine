ESC Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Guidelines

1. Assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (the likelihood of experiencing a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke) is the first step to guide recommendations on prevention. CVD risk can be calculated in people without CVD (‘primary prevention’) or with known CVD (‘secondary prevention’), and in people with certain conditions who are at higher risk of CVD (e.g., those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease). 2. For people without known CVD, risk can be classified as low, moderate, high or very high and can be assessed based on a person’s age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and smoking status. Other factors (e.g., ethnicity, psychosocial, socioeconomic or environmental factors) and health conditions may change your CVD risk (‘risk-modifiers’). The CVD risk is very high for all people with known CVD. 3. An informed discussion with your healthcare provider about CVD risk and treatment benefits tailored to your needs is recommended. Treatment decisions should be based on a shared decision-making process between you and your healthcare provider. 4. The Guidelines recommend that everyone follow certain recommendations, no matter their CVD risk. These include: • stopping smoking • following a healthy lifestyle in terms of nutrition, body weight and physical activity •
