their blood pressure, the ultimate treatment goal for systolic blood pressure is 120–130 mmHg for most adults aged <70 years, and <140 mmHg (down to 130 mmHg if tolerated) for those aged ≥70 years. For diastolic blood pressure, a goal of <80 mmHg is recommended for all people on medication. Antihypertensive treatment (medications that lower your blood pressure) in a two-medicine combination is recommended for most people. 12. For people with diabetes, a treatment goal of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <7.0% is recommended for most adults. Metformin is the first- line treatment for most people with diabetes without CVD, whereas newer medications (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RA] and sodium- glucose transport protein 2 [SGLT-2] inhibitors) are recommended for people with diabetes and CVD. Appendix Example of Calculation for Total CVD Risk Here, we use an example of a man without known CVD who visits his general practitioner in France. This man is 53 years old and is not taking any medications. His blood pressure is 146 (systolic)/87 (diastolic) mmHg. According to the most recent laboratory results, his non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level is 4.3 mmol/L. He is a non-smoker. The version of SCORE2 for populations at low CVD risk is used
