the most recent laboratory results, his non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level is 4.3 mmol/L. He is a non-smoker. The version of SCORE2 for populations at low CVD risk is used as the patient is <70 years old and he lives in France, which is a country with low CVD risk. The illustration below shows the appropriate chart. First, the correct age group is identified (50–54 years), then the systolic blood pressure group (140–159 mmHg) and non-HDL cholesterol group (4.0–4.9 mmol/L). According to this calculation, the patient has an estimated likelihood of 5% of experiencing a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event (such as heart attack or stroke) in the next 10 years. As such, this person has a moderate CVD risk. SCORE2 <50 years 50-69 years ≥70 years 10-year risk of (fatal and non-fatal) CV <2.5% <5% <7.5% 2.5 to <7.5% 5 to <10% 7.5 to <15% events in populations at low CVD risk ≥7.5% ≥10% ≥15% Women Men Non-smoking Smoking Non-smoking Smoking Non-HDL cholesterol This guide for patients is a simplified version of the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice.
