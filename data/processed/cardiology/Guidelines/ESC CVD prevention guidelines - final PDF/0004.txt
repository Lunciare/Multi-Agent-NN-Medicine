step is to achieve recommended goals for blood pressure and cholesterol levels through lifestyle recommendations and medication if needed. Once the first step is achieved, proceeding to the second step (even lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels) should follow, based on additional considerations (estimated 10-year and lifelong risk, other medical conditions you may have) as well as your personal preferences. The ultimate aim of the second step is to achieve the following optimal goals: • systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg (for people on medication) • low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <1.8 mmol/L (for people at high risk) or <1.4 mmol/L (for people at very high risk) In this stepwise process, the entire approach (both steps) has to be considered. 10. Statins are the first-line treatment for people requiring medication to lower their LDL-C levels. If the treatment goal (based on an individual’s CVD risk) is not reached with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, combination with a non-statin, lipid-lowering medication is recommended. 11. For people who require medication to lower their blood pressure, the ultimate treatment goal for systolic blood pressure is 120–130 mmHg for most adults aged <70 years, and <140 mmHg (down to 130 mmHg if tolerated) for
