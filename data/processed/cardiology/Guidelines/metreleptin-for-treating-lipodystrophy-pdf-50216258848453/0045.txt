Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

assumed that metreleptin's treatment effect on HbA1c will be maintained for a lifetime after stopping treatment. In the model, when people start metreleptin, their HbA1c level is fully reduced (in the first cycle), based on the change from baseline to 12 months from the NIH 991265/ 20010769 studies. In subsequent cycles, people have a yearly rise of 0.15% in their HbA1c level, regardless of whether they have or have not stopped metreleptin, or have supportive care. The yearly increase of 0.15% in HbA1c level was assumed from NICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes. It is intended to reflect disease progression in people with diabetes. This yearly rise continues up to a ceiling of 12%, which represents people whose diabetes is poorly controlled (based on clinical opinion from the Delphi panel). The ERG considered this persistence of effect after stopping treatment unrealistic. During technical engagement, the company explained that complications associated with diabetes develop over many years at a rate and extent that is related to the adequacy of glucose control. Therefore, a slow-offset period of treatment effect would be expected after stopping treatment. This is because the benefit of controlling blood glucose
