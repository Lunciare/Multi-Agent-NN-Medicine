Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

gained. The total costs and QALYs are considered by the company to be commercial in confidence and so cannot be reported here. 4.30 Considering both the company and ERG's scenario analyses, the committee's preferred assumptions were: • using the estimate directly obtained from the Delphi data to adjust transition probabilities in the liver model (rather than liver enzymes, see section 4.19) • reversing HbA1c to baseline level after stopping treatment (excluding 0.15% drift, see section 4.23) • maintaining liver benefit for 1 year when metreleptin is stopped (see section 4.24) • removing assumed lifetime maintenance of 50% of quality-of-life treatment differential and carer utility gain after stopping metreleptin (see section 4.25 and section 4.22) • correcting number of carers to 1.67 (rather than 2 in company base case, see section 4.22). The committee's preferred assumptions were associated with an ICER of £108,267 per QALY gained (for the overall population). The ICER for generalised lipodystrophy was £87,545 per QALY gained, and the ICER for partial lipodystrophy was £133,606 per QALY gained. Impact of the technology beyond direct health benefits and on the delivery of the specialised service 4.31 The committee discussed the effects of metreleptin beyond its direct health benefits. It
