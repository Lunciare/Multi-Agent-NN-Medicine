the company to model transition probabilities. The ERG preferred using the change in liver enzymes (trial-based data) estimated from the indirect treatment comparison (rather than the risk reduction estimate directly obtained from the Delphi panel) to adjust the baseline transition probability for the liver in their base case. The committee recalled that liver enzymes are a poor predictor for liver complications (see section 4.12). It agreed that the Delphi panel, based on clinical experts' judgement, would be an appropriate source to inform the liver transition probabilities in this case. It was also aware that the choice between liver enzymes and the Delphi panel estimates only had a minor impact on the cost-effectiveness estimate. The committee concluded that it was generally satisfied with the company's approach to modelling transition probabilities. Utility decrements for organ complications 4.20 The committee was aware that the clinical trials of metreleptin did not collect any quality-of-life data. In its resubmission, the company did a systematic literature review to identify sources of utility values from the literature. The utility decrement for pancreatitis was based on the discrete choice experiment (DCE) from the original submission. The DCE was done for a large sample of the general population, to
