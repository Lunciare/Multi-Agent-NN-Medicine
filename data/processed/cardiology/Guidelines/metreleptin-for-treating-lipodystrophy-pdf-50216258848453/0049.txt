Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

section 4.21) are modelled when metreleptin is stopped. The company assumed, in its base-case model, that 50% of the 0.12 differential and 50% of benefit to carers would be maintained over the patients' lifetime after stopping treatment. The ERG's base case removed the assumption of the 50% continued lifetime treatment benefits. This is because including it would suggest continued absence of hyperphagia and continued ability to work, but there is no evidence to support this. During the technical engagement, the company explained that the utility differential accounted not only for hyperphagia but also other symptoms not captured in the organ damage sub-models. The ERG noted that hyperphagia and inability to work accounted for about 80% of the utility differential according to the company's rescaled DCE. However, it recalled that the symptoms of hunger would return within days after stopping metreleptin (see section 4.13) and ability to work is not in NICE's reference case for consideration. The committee asked how much weight hyperphagia accounted for in the utility differential. The company explained it was not a primary driver but still had a weight of about 25%. The committee considered it appropriate to account for specific symptoms not related to organ damage
