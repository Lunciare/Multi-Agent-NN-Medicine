Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

89% of patients with generalised lipodystrophy and 85% with partial lipodystrophy had an event. This was severe in 44% and 39% of patients, respectively, and caused 8% and 2%, respectively, to stop treatment. • In the FHA101 study, around 78% of patients with generalised lipodystrophy and 84% with partial lipodystrophy had a TEAE. This was severe in 67% and 28% of patients, respectively, and caused 11% and 9%, respectively, to stop treatment. The company commented that stopping happened not only because of adverse events, but also because the studies included some patients for whom metreleptin was not effective because their condition was not related to leptin. Also, some patients stopped treatment because they were pregnant. The company added that TEAEs happened over a long period of time, more than 3 years in the NIH studies and over 2 years in the FHA101 study, and that several reported TEAEs (such as decreased appetite and weight, and hypoglycaemia) were consistent with metreleptin's mechanism of action. The clinical experts suggested that adherence is likely to improve in practice as the benefits of metreleptin become clear. The company and clinical experts also noted that episodes of pancreatitis improved with metreleptin compared with baseline. A
