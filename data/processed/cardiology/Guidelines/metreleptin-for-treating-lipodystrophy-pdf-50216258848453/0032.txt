with diabetes to target in clinical practice. The criteria of 'fasting triglycerides above 5.00 mmol/litre' was based on the value above which people with diabetes are at risk of pancreatitis. The committee understood the rationale for choosing the further restricted criteria for the subgroup of people with partial lipodystrophy. It acknowledged the ERG's concerns, but agreed that partial lipodystrophy with more severe metabolic status (that is, HbA1c above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), or fasting triglycerides above 5.00 mmol/litre, or both) may benefit more from metreleptin. Because the subgroup of people with partial lipodystrophy included in the economic model had less severe metabolic status (HbA1c 6.5% or more, or triglycerides 5.65 mmol/litre or more, or both), the estimated cost effectiveness for metreleptin was likely to be too high. The committee concluded it would take this into account in its decision making. Adverse events 4.15 The committee noted that the proportion of patients in the main clinical trials who had a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was high: • In the NIH studies, around 89% of patients with generalised lipodystrophy and 85% with partial lipodystrophy had an event. This was severe in 44% and 39% of patients, respectively, and caused 8% and 2%, respectively,
