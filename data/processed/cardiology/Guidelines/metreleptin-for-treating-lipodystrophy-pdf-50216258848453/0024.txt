added that HbA1c can predict for complications of the eye and nervous system, as in type 2 diabetes, but differently for other organ complications such as complications of the kidney, liver and heart. They also stated that many people can stop insulin completely after starting leptin treatment. The committee also considered the merit of liver enzymes as a surrogate outcome for liver complications. Clinical experts explained that these are poor predictors of liver disease. The company stated that, because it knew liver enzymes were not a good surrogate, it sought the opinion of clinical experts (through the Delphi panel) on the likely effect of metreleptin on liver disease. The committee asked about the likelihood of HbA1c and triglyceride levels falling without metreleptin. The clinical experts stated that if people had not previously been given any dietary advice, that giving it at the start of treatment could result in improved levels. But, the extent of improvement may be limited because of hyperphagia. In fact, they stated that without treatment, HbA1c levels are likely to reverse to their baseline values over 6 to 12 months, or sooner. The committee noted that evidence showed that metreleptin is effective in lowering HbA1c and triglyceride
