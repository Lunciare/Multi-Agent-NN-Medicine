Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

noted that response to metreleptin is heterogenous between people with generalised lipodystrophy and partial lipodystrophy. Evidence showed that metreleptin was associated with greater benefits in people with generalised lipodystrophy and children with congenital leptin deficiency may keep benefiting from metreleptin after a long period of treatment (see section 4.14). The heterogeneity is more obvious in partial lipodystrophy and people with more severe partial lipodystrophy are likely to benefit more from the treatment. This was the basis for the company's suggestion of further restricting the metabolic status of the partial lipodystrophy subgroup to HbA1c above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), fasting triglycerides above 5.00 mmol/litre, or both (see section 4.14). The committee noted that, because the more severe partial lipodystrophy subgroup was associated with greater benefit, including it in the cost-effectiveness model was likely to lower the cost-effectiveness estimates. But, the magnitude of that was difficult to quantify. Conclusion 4.36 The committee acknowledged that lipodystrophy, and hyperphagia in particular, has a substantial effect on the quality of life of patients, and their families and carers. It noted that the clinical evidence suggested metreleptin provides clinical benefits by reducing blood sugar, triglycerides and liver enzymes in people with lipodystrophy.
