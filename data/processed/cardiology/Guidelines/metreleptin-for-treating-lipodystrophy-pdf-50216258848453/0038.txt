risk of death in all states. The ERG noted that the company's sub-model structure is an improvement from previous submissions (see section 4.2). This is because it is better structured to account for the potential progression of complications related to lipodystrophy over time. However, it relies on the assumption that people with diabetes or elevated triglyceride levels, because of lipodystrophy, will follow a similar course to people with similar metabolic abnormalities but different aetiologies. It stated that this was an area of considerable uncertainty. The company explained that its choice to follow a diabetes framework for its model structure was in response to the committee's previous suggestion (see section 4.2). The model is based on the structure of the diabetes-related complications seen in the Sheffield diabetes model, and the established model structure from NICE's guideline on NAFLD to reflect liver disease progression. It chose the Sheffield diabetes model, among others, because it considered it the most robust, and it was previously used in a multiple technology assessment for diabetes. The committee was satisfied with the company's attempt to capture the disease progression using sub-models for each relevant organ. It was aware that there are uncertainties as to what extent people
