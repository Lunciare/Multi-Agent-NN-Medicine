Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

for triglyceride levels. Decreases in HbA1c and triglyceride levels were not statistically significant in the FHA101 study. Additional data from the early access programme (at 36-month follow up) that became available for the resubmission also suggested that metreleptin reduced HbA1c in both people with generalised and partial lipodystrophy (-1.1% and -1.2% respectively) and fasting triglyceride levels (-57.6% and -23.9%, respectively). No statistical significance was reported. The company also presented evidence on metreleptin's treatment effect on the liver enzymes, ALT and AST. This showed treatment effect in favour of metreleptin at 12-month follow up (see section 4.9). 4.12 The committee discussed HbA1c, triglyceride and liver enzyme levels as surrogates because changes in these outcomes were used to adjust long-term transitions between states in the modelling. As part of their resubmission, the company held a Delphi panel involving 10 international clinical experts (3 of whom were clinical experts from Addenbrooke's Hospital). The Delphi panel reached a consensus that HbA1c is a good predictor of diabetes-related complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, retinopathy and neuropathy in people with lipodystrophy. The company explained that the relationship between HbA1c and long-term clinical outcomes based on 30-year follow up in diabetes studies is established and widely
