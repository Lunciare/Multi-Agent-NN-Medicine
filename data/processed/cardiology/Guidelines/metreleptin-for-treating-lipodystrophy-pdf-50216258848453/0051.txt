The clinical expert can apply their own judgement and agree to continue to treat the lipodystrophy even if the criteria are not met. The committee noted that the company's stopping rule did not match the one from the clinical experts, but the rule proposed did incorporate significant clinical discretion. Application of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) weighting 4.27 The committee understood that NICE's interim process and methods of the highly specialised technologies programme (2017) specifies that a most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of below £100,000 per QALY gained for a highly specialised technology is normally considered an effective use of NHS resources. For a most plausible ICER above £100,000 per QALY gained, judgements about the acceptability of the highly specialised technology as an effective use of NHS resources must take account of the magnitude of the incremental therapeutic improvement. This is seen through the number of additional QALYs gained and by applying a 'QALY weight'. It understood that a weight between 1 and 3 can be applied when the QALY gain is between 10
