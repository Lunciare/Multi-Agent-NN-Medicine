Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

poor enough metabolic status at baseline to be eligible for the treatment under the current criteria. For example, people with high levels of triglycerides and a low level of HbA1c were enrolled at the time. The clinical experts also stated that the programme had a small sample size, and there were very few data on generalised lipodystrophy's response to metreleptin. This meant that no conclusion on efficacy could be made from the early access programme. The committee welcomed the company's attempt to gather additional clinical evidence to supplement the sparse evidence base. It agreed that the new evidence indicated that metreleptin treatment improves metabolic outcomes at 36-month follow up. But, the committee did not substantially improve its understanding of the relative effectiveness of metreleptin. It concluded that evidence from the early access programme itself was not sufficient to address the gaps in the clinical evidence base. Representativeness of the NIH follow-up study and the indirect treatment comparison 4.9 In response to the committee's concerns about the lack of evidence on metreleptin's relative effectiveness (see section 4.2), the company did an indirect treatment comparison. This used 3 methods (inverse probability weighting, multivariate regression analysis, and naive comparison) to estimate the treatment
