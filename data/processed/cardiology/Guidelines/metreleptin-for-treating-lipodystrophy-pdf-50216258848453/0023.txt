Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

and neuropathy in people with lipodystrophy. The company explained that the relationship between HbA1c and long-term clinical outcomes based on 30-year follow up in diabetes studies is established and widely accepted. The clinical experts explained that triglyceride levels were strongly linked to pancreatitis but that the association was harder to capture mathematically. The clinical experts agreed that HbA1c and triglyceride levels are used in clinical practice and are considered to be reasonably predictive of clinical outcomes. However, the relationship may not be identical to that in other disease areas such as diabetes. For example, the risk of early death is greater for people with lipodystrophy compared with people with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. They stated that, in general, people with lipodystrophy with lower HbA1c and triglyceride levels have a better prognosis than people with higher levels. They also noted that the effects of HbA1c and triglycerides were broadly correlated but there may be differences between individuals with lipodystrophy depending on other independent factors, for example, genetic factors. They added that HbA1c can predict for complications of the eye and nervous system, as in type 2 diabetes, but differently for other organ complications such as complications of the kidney,
