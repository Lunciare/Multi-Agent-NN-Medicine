Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

committee was satisfied with the company's attempt to capture the disease progression using sub-models for each relevant organ. It was aware that there are uncertainties as to what extent people with lipodystrophy will follow a similar course to people with diabetes and fatty liver disease. However, given the scarcity of evidence in lipodystrophy, the committee concluded that the model structure is appropriate for decision making. Transition probabilities adjusted by HbA1c for sub-models 4.18 The company used published literature for baseline transition probabilities for 4 of the sub-models that are diabetes-related complications: cardiovascular, kidney, neuropathy and retinopathy. Baseline transition probabilities were then adjusted according to the absolute change in HbA1c level from baseline to 12 months from NIH 991265/20010769, to generate probabilities for people having metreleptin. For the liver sub-model, the baseline transition probability for liver disease was derived from the model in NICE's guideline on NAFLD, and then adjusted using reduction in risk estimated from the Delphi panel (company's base case) or changes in liver enzymes from the indirect treatment comparison (company's scenario analysis). For the pancreas sub-model, the baseline transition probability for pancreatitis was directly sourced from the GL/PL natural history study. It was then adjusted using odds ratios
