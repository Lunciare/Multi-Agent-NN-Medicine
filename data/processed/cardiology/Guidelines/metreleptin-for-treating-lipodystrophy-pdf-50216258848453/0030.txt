Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

lipodystrophy represents a more severe group compared with the overall population of people with partial lipodystrophy in the NIH studies. This is because they are more at risk of organ damage and this best reflects the licensed indication. • The early access programme included people with partial lipodystrophy with baseline leptin below 12 nanogram/ml and HbA1c 6.5% or more, or triglycerides 5.65 mmol/litre or more, or both (used by the company for baseline patient distribution in the model). The early access programme also included people with partial lipodystrophy who did not meet these criteria (see section 4.8). • After the technical engagement, the company suggested further restricting the group of people with partial lipodystrophy from their original definition (HbA1c 6.5% or more, or triglycerides 5.65 mmol/litre or more, or both), to baseline HbA1c above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), or fasting triglycerides above 5.00 mmol/litre, or both. But, they accepted the HbA1c could be lower under exceptional circumstances such as in cases of extreme hyperphagia, or because of severe side effects from other glucose-lowering medications or other serious complications of inadequate metabolic control such as progressive liver disease. The company explained these restrictive criteria were developed based on the clinical evidence from
