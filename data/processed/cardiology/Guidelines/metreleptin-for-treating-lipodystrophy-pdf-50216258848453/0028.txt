The committee agreed that any additional information (qualitative or quantitative) about the experience of hyperphagia in people with lipodystrophy, and the effect metreleptin has on it, could substantially improve its understanding of the potential clinical benefits. It concluded that capturing the effect of metreleptin on hyperphagia could be challenging but was important to assess the nature and magnitude of any clinical benefits of metreleptin while patients are on treatment, and also after stopping treatment. Starting and stopping criteria 4.14 The committee queried whether all people diagnosed with lipodystrophy and covered by the marketing authorisation would be expected to have treatment with metreleptin. The clinical experts stated that most people with generalised lipodystrophy have hyperphagia and organ dysfunction, so would be expected to benefit from leptin treatment. The committee was also aware that everyone diagnosed with generalised lipodystrophy had leptin treatment as part of the early access programme at Addenbrooke's Hospital.
