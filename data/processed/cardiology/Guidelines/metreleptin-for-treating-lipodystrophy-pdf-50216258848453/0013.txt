Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

satisfied that people with lipodystrophy can be accurately identified, but noted that diagnosis in some people with milder forms of partial lipodystrophy may be delayed. Impact of the new technology Clinical trial evidence 4.7 The committee discussed the clinical evidence submitted by the company: • NIH 991265 was a pilot, dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of short-term leptin replacement (up to 8 months). After NIH 991265 ended, patients continued treatment in the extension study NIH 20010769 for long-term follow up. All but 1 patient who completed NIH 991265 moved to NIH 20010769. This meant the studies were treated as 1 study continuously enrolling patients with generalised (n=66) and partial lipodystrophy (n=41) over the course of 14 years. • FHA101 was an open-label, single-arm, expanded-access study with 9 patients with generalised lipodystrophy and 32 patients with partial lipodystrophy enrolled over the course of 6 years. Only 1 patient in these studies was recruited from the UK, but the clinical experts confirmed that the trial populations were generalisable to patients seen in clinical practice in England. The ERG highlighted that estimates of treatment effects were based on changes from baseline in single-arm metreleptin treatment studies during the first and
