the committee made these recommendations Lipodystrophy is a rare and serious condition that severely affects the quality of life of people with the condition, and their families and carers. For children and young people with the condition, it may also shorten their life expectancy. Supportive care includes lifestyle modifications such as an extreme low-fat diet and exercise, cosmetic surgery, and medication for diabetes and to lower lipids. There is no trial directly comparing metreleptin with supportive care. Results from clinical studies suggest that metreleptin appears to improve hyperphagia and reduces HbA1c and triglyceride levels in people with lipodystrophy. An indirect comparison with supportive care also suggests that metreleptin is more effective at improving HbA1c, triglyceride and liver enzyme levels, as well as episodes of acute pancreatitis at 12-month follow up. However, metreleptin's long-term effect and several assumptions in the economic modelling are uncertain. Despite this, metreleptin is likely to provide important clinical benefit and improve quality of life for people who have lipodystrophy, parents and carers. It also provides value for money within the context of a highly specialised service. So, it is recommended for use in the NHS. 2 The condition 2.1 Lipodystrophy is a rare, heterogeneous group of
