Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

at 12 months was also lower in the early access programme (-1.5% for those with generalised lipodystrophy) than in the NIH follow-up study (-1.94% for all patients). Given these differences and the fact that people enrolled in the early access programme are from the UK, the ERG stated that the early access programme should be used in the indirect treatment comparison instead of the NIH follow-up study. The company explained that the early access programme had a much smaller sample size (n=31) and started over a decade ago. The eligibility criteria have evolved along with the growing evidence base for people with lipodystrophy. The clinical experts highlighted the limitations of the early access programme data, namely that people did not have poor enough metabolic status at baseline when they were enrolled in the programme (see section 4.8). They added that the early access programme was not a research study, it was based on 'compassionate use' rather than formal clinical criteria. One of the clinical experts involved in the early access programme explained that recent outcomes are becoming more and more aligned with those of the NIH study follow up. This is because of the application of recent clinical inclusion criteria
