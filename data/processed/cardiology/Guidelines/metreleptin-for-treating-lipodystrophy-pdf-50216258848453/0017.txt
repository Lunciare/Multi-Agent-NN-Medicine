Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

metreleptin's relative effectiveness (see section 4.2), the company did an indirect treatment comparison. This used 3 methods (inverse probability weighting, multivariate regression analysis, and naive comparison) to estimate the treatment effect of metreleptin relative to supportive care for key clinical outcomes. Data used to inform the indirect treatment comparison were from the NIH 991265/ NIH 20010769 study (metreleptin arm) and the GL/PL natural history study (supportive care arm), respectively. Outcomes assessed included change from baseline in HbA1c, triglycerides and liver enzyme (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) levels, the incidence of acute pancreatitis and all-cause mortality. The results of the indirect treatment comparison showed statistically significant differences in favour of metreleptin on HbA1c, triglycerides, liver enzymes and reducing the risk of pancreatitis at 12-month follow up. It also suggested that survival was worse with metreleptin compared with supportive care, but the difference was not statistically significant. 4.10 The committee agreed in a previous meeting that the NIH follow-up study was representative of people with lipodystrophy in the UK and appropriate to be used for treatment comparison. However, with additional evidence available from the early access programme, the ERG raised 2 concerns related to the indirect treatment comparison. These were
