See the committee papers for full details of the evidence. History of the evaluation 4.1 Previously, 2 committee meetings were held for the evaluation of this topic. After the second committee meeting (12 February 2019), a final evaluation determination was drafted of the committee's considerations and conclusions based on the evidence presented. NICE received 2 appeals against that final evaluation determination. The appeal hearing did not take place because Aegerion (the marketing authorisation holder at the time) requested reconsideration of this topic (in line with the highly specialised interim methods and process guide). This was granted and the final evaluation determination was withdrawn. For reconsideration of the topic, the company also agreed to address the concerns outlined in the drafted final evaluation determination by presenting additional evidence and doing further analysis. Amryt, the company that is now the marketing authorisation holder, submitted the additional evidence and new analyses for reconsideration. The resubmission went through a technical engagement process in August 2020. 4.2 Concerns
