Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

Addenbrooke's Hospital. The marketing authorisation for partial lipodystrophy (for people aged 12 and over) was not restrictive. But, the committee was aware that several different subsets of people with partial lipodystrophy had been presented in the company evidence: • NIH studies 991265/20010769 included leptin level criteria in their definition of people with partial lipodystrophy (used for the indirect treatment comparison): － NIH 2001769: below 12.0 nanogram/ml in women, below 8.0 nanogram/ml in men, and below 6 nanogram/ml in children between 6 months and 5 years － NIH 991265: 8.0 nanogram/ml and below in women and 6.0 nanogram/ml and below in men － HbA1c 6.5% or more or triglycerides 5.65 mmol/litre or more, or both. • A subgroup of people with partial lipodystrophy from the NIH studies with baseline HbA1c 6.5% or more, or triglycerides 5.65 mmol/litre or more, or both (used for model inputs for the economic analysis, including baseline levels of metabolic surrogates and changes from baseline of HbA1c). The company considered that this subgroup of people with partial lipodystrophy represents a more severe group compared with the overall population of people with partial lipodystrophy in the NIH studies. This is because they are more at risk of organ
