important aspects of disease progression was not followed. • Starting and stopping criteria were not included in the economic model. • Rescaled utility estimated from the discrete choice experiment was more plausible than the original discrete choice experiment, but there were still uncertainties. • Carer utility decrement was based on literature and only applied to the supportive care arm. 4.3 The evaluation committee was aware that 1 issue (issue 5) was resolved during the technical engagement stage. It agreed that yearly rates of stopping treatment (8.93% in year 1, 5.63% in years 2 to 9 and 2.04% in year 10 onwards) were a good reflection of treatment stopping seen in the first year of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial and the decline in how many people stopped treatment over time. It agreed that it was better than applying a single stopping rate only based on those who chose to stop metreleptin in each population (1.5% for generalised lipodystrophy and 3.86% for partial lipodystrophy) from NIH trials. 4.4 There was 1 remaining area of uncertainty associated with the analyses presented (see the technical report in the final evaluation determination decision making. It discussed issue 1, issues 2 and 3
