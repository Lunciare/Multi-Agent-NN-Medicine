no or asymptomatic fibrosis, to advanced fibrosis, to compensated and then decompensated cirrhosis. • Cardiovascular sub-model: people start in the 'no cardiovascular disease' state, when they are at risk of experiencing cardiovascular complications (stroke, angina, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction). • Kidney sub-model is based on the structure of the Sheffield diabetes model. People start in the 'no chronic kidney disease' state, when they can transition through microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria to the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) health state. From ESRD, people can transition to receiving a kidney transplant (tunnel state), moving to the post-transplant state in the following cycle. • Neuropathy sub-model: people start in the 'no peripheral neuropathy' state and can progress to peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease with amputation, and can move to the post-amputation state in the following cycle. • Retinopathy sub-model: people start in the 'no retinopathy' state and can progress to blindness either directly, or by progressing through various retinal diseases such as background retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy and macular oedema. • People are at risk of death in all states.
