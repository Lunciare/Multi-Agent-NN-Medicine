Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

The utility decrement for pancreatitis was based on the discrete choice experiment (DCE) from the original submission. The DCE was done for a large sample of the general population, to estimate utility decrements associated with key lipodystrophy attributes. The utility decrements for the other organs were taken from published sources and those previously used and accepted in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. The committee agreed with using utility decrements from other conditions than lipodystrophy, given the scarcity of data for this condition. Also, to capture specific symptoms not already accounted for in the sub-models (that is, hyperphagia, polycystic ovary syndrome, inability to work and impaired physical appearance), the company's model applied a utility differential (compared with supportive care) of 0.12, based on the rescaled DCE from the original company submission (see section 4.2). The committee recalled it had had concerns relating to the validity of the utility values estimated from the DCE (see section 4.2). The company acknowledged the limitations but stated that no alternative value could be sourced from the literature. The patient expert explained that people with lipodystrophy with organ damage may also have fertility issues, pain and fatigue, so those
