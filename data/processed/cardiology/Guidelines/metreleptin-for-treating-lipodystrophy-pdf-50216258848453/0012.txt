clinical experts explained that lipodystrophy diagnosis may be delayed because it is not immediately recognised and is a rare condition. Diagnosing generalised lipodystrophy, particularly when congenital, is easier because people typically present at between 1 to 2 years old, and develop diabetes and damage in 1 or more organs by the time they are 2 or 3 years old. However, partial lipodystrophy usually presents later, and symptoms are heterogeneous, which makes diagnosis at an early stage of the disease difficult. The clinical experts highlighted that an earlier diagnosis is important to prevent disease progression. The patient experts supported the view of the clinical experts, stating that partial lipodystrophy can progress and become severe if undiagnosed and untreated. The company explained that some people may have a mutation that is unrelated to leptin deficiency but manifests with similar symptoms, emphasising that the right clinical diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. The clinical experts confirmed that patients are routinely genotyped as part of the NHS service at Addenbrooke's Hospital. The committee was satisfied that people with lipodystrophy can be accurately identified, but noted that diagnosis in some people with milder forms of partial lipodystrophy may be delayed.
