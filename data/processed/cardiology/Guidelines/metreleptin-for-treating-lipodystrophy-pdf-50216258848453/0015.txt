from the metreleptin early access programme (n=31, including all patients who had treatment since the start of the programme) at Addenbrooke's Hospital. Data were collected retrospectively, with clinicians entering patient data on baseline characteristics, organ damage and complications, laboratory values and metreleptin dose. The ERG noted that the additional data showed persistence of changes with metreleptin treatment up to 36 months, with a reduction in HbA1c and triglycerides (see section 4.11). But, there were no patient-reported outcomes or measures of patient experience (including hyperphagia) presented, despite some people having treatment for 10 years or more. The company explained that when the early access programme was set up in 2005 there was no pre-specified data collection protocol, so the only data available were from a review of patient medical records. In addition, clinical experts noted that the treatment eligibility criteria currently used were not in place when the programme was set up. Because the criteria were only introduced 2 years ago, not all people with partial lipodystrophy in the programme had poor enough metabolic status at baseline to be eligible for the treatment under the current criteria. For example, people with high levels of triglycerides and a low level of HbA1c
