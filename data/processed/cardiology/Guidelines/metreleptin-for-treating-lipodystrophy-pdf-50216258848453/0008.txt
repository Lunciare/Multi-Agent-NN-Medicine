The resubmission went through a technical engagement process in August 2020. 4.2 Concerns raised by the committee during the second meeting (reported in the final evaluation document that was withdrawn) included: • Lack of evidence on relative effectiveness of metreleptin on disease progression or important outcomes such as hyperphagia: － The systematic literature review may have missed some studies. － There was no evidence on change in patient experience and disease progression for people who did not have metreleptin. － Early access programme results did not improve the committee's understanding of metreleptin's relative effectiveness in the short or long term because they did not include long-term data or patient-reported outcomes (such as hyperphagia). • The economic model focused on mortality and did not capture important aspects of the condition; it oversimplified its underlying progression. The committee's suggestion of using a model structure with established diabetes or fatty liver disease models to capture some important aspects of disease progression was not followed. • Starting and stopping criteria were not included in the economic model. • Rescaled utility estimated from the discrete choice experiment was
