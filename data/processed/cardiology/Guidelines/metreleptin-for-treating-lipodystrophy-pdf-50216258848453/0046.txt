Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

is related to the adequacy of glucose control. Therefore, a slow-offset period of treatment effect would be expected after stopping treatment. This is because the benefit of controlling blood glucose with metreleptin would decline at a similar rate to benefit accruing. The ERG argued that there is no evidence for this. It noted that the company assumed the lag between glucose control (marked by HbA1c) and the effect on risk of complications in the model after stopping treatment. But, this lag was not modelled at the start of the treatment when people are at increased risk because of previous poor glucose control. It therefore removed this assumption (lifetime HbA1c benefit) in their base case so that HbA1c returned to baseline within the year after stopping metreleptin. The ERG also excluded the annual drift of 0.15% after stopping treatment, as was modelled in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on canagliflozin in combination therapy for treating type 2 diabetes. The clinical experts stated that HbA1c level is likely to revert to baseline levels over 6 to 12 months after stopping treatment (see section 4.12) and agreed that the ERG's base case best reflected this statement. The committee concluded that the likely delayed onset
