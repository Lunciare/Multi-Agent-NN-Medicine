Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

number of additional QALYs gained and by applying a 'QALY weight'. It understood that a weight between 1 and 3 can be applied when the QALY gain is between 10 and 30 QALYs. The committee considered that although there was uncertainty, the undiscounted QALY gains for the scenarios incorporating its preferred assumptions did not meet the criteria for applying a QALY weight. Cost-effectiveness results 4.28 The company's base case showed that metreleptin was associated with an ICER of £60,611 per QALY gained for the overall population. The ICER for generalised lipodystrophy was £46,000 per QALY gained, and the ICER for partial lipodystrophy was £81,584 per QALY gained. The total costs and QALYs are considered by the company to be commercial in confidence and so cannot be reported here. 4.29 The ERG's base case showed that metreleptin was associated with an ICER of £110,460 per QALY gained for the overall population. The ICER for generalised lipodystrophy was £92,593 per QALY gained, and the ICER for partial lipodystrophy was £130,334 per QALY gained. The total costs and QALYs are considered by the company to be commercial in confidence and so cannot be reported here. 4.30 Considering both the company and ERG's scenario
