likely to improve in practice as the benefits of metreleptin become clear. The company and clinical experts also noted that episodes of pancreatitis improved with metreleptin compared with baseline. A patient expert highlighted that she had gone from having frequent events of pancreatitis to no events since starting metreleptin treatment. The ERG noted that, in its original submission, the company only included data for pancreatitis as an adverse event happening after metreleptin withdrawal: 4 patients with generalised lipodystrophy and 2 patients with partial lipodystrophy had treatment- emergent pancreatitis across studies (1 patient died, 5 recovered). However, the ERG also noted that the NIH data indicated that patients had improvements in pancreatitis on metreleptin. The company noted that TEAEs were not reported in the data collected from the early access programme. The ERG highlighted that this contradicted the company's comments from the first evaluation committee meeting that additional adverse event information could be provided. The committee agreed that additional real- world data on adverse events would be informative. But, based on what it had heard from the experts, it concluded that the tolerability profile of metreleptin was likely to be acceptable. 4.16 In the NIH 991265/20010769 and FHA101 studies, 88% of
