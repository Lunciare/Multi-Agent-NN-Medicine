Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

over 6 to 12 months after stopping treatment (see section 4.12) and agreed that the ERG's base case best reflected this statement. The committee concluded that the likely delayed onset of treatment effect compared with the slow offset of treatment effect does not have a substantial impact on modelling. This is because the lag is only about 1 year and any delay would happen at the beginning and end of treatment. This means they, in part, would cancel each other out. The committee was satisfied with the company's approach of modelling HbA1c level while on treatment. But, it agreed that the duration after which HbA1c reverts to baseline levels (6 to 12 months) after stopping treatment should be reflected in the model. Metreleptin's treatment effect on liver disease after stopping treatment 4.24 Similarly, although there is no evidence of an effect of metreleptin on liver complications after stopping treatment, the company assumed (in their base case) that the liver benefit would remain for a lifetime after stopping treatment. This was based on clinical experts' opinion stating that residual liver benefit will be retained and that it would take several years to return to a baseline level of risk. Additionally, the
