There are 4 major subtypes: congenital (inherited) and acquired generalised lipodystrophy; and familial (inherited) and acquired partial lipodystrophy. 2.3 The prevalence of lipodystrophy depends on the subtype but is around 2.5 per 1 million of the population overall, with partial lipodystrophy being slightly more common. It is estimated that there are around 200 people with lipodystrophy in England; a proportion of these people will be eligible for metreleptin treatment. 2.4 There are no licensed treatments in the UK for lipodystrophy. The condition is currently managed with lifestyle modifications such as a low-fat diet and exercise; cosmetic surgery; and medication to manage the metabolic disturbances, including lipid-lowering drugs (for example, fibrates and statins) and antidiabetic therapy (for example, metformin, insulin, sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones). 2.5 A single National Specialist Service for people with lipodystrophy was established in 2011 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Treatment with metreleptin is currently provided there as part of an early access programme, under the National Severe Insulin Resistance Service at the hospital. 3 The technology 3.1 Metreleptin (Myalepta, Amryt) is an analogue of the human hormone leptin, which is secreted into the circulation from adipocytes.
