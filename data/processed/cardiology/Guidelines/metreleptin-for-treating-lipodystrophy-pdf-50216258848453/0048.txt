based on clinical experts' opinion stating that residual liver benefit will be retained and that it would take several years to return to a baseline level of risk. Additionally, the company applied the persisting lifetime liver benefit in addition to the period of treatment effect after stopping treatment. Therefore, the experts' statements were not reflected in the model appropriately. The clinical experts explained that some sustained slowing of liver damage may be maintained for months when metreleptin is stopped. The ERG remained uncertain of the true period and level of benefit when metreleptin is stopped. However, in their base case, the ERG included the 1-year efficacy after stopping treatment to reflect the possibility that there may be some residual benefit to the liver. The committee concluded that the ERG's analysis was appropriate and consistent with the clinical experts' views. Metreleptin's treatment effect on quality of life and patient-reported outcomes such as hyperphagia after stopping treatment 4.25 The committee discussed how the utility differential and carer utility (see section 4.20 and section 4.21) are modelled when metreleptin is stopped. The company assumed, in its base-case model, that 50% of the 0.12 differential and 50% of benefit to carers would be maintained
