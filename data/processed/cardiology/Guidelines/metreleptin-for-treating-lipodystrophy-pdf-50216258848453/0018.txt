Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

appropriate to be used for treatment comparison. However, with additional evidence available from the early access programme, the ERG raised 2 concerns related to the indirect treatment comparison. These were the representativeness of the NIH follow-up study used to inform the indirect treatment comparison compared with the early access programme, and the selection of covariates used to adjust for differences between patient cohorts in the indirect treatment comparison. The ERG noted differences in the effects of metreleptin treatment (particularly for changes in triglyceride levels) between the early access programme (see section 4.8) and the NIH follow-up study (see section 4.7). For example, for people with generalised lipodystrophy, the 12-month change in triglycerides was -3.5 mmol/ litre (based only on people for whom both baseline and 12-month data were available) in the early access programme, compared with -10.54 mmol/litre in the NIH follow up. The ERG noted that the early access programme estimate is closer to that of the GL/PL natural history study estimate of -4.43 mmol/litre. The change in HbA1c at 12 months was also lower in the early access programme (-1.5% for those with generalised lipodystrophy) than in the NIH follow-up study (-1.94% for all patients). Given these differences
