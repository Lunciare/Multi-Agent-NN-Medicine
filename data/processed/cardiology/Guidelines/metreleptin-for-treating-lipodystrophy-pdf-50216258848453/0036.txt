Cost to the NHS and value for money Company's economic model 4.17 The company developed a de novo individual patient-level model addressing previous committee concerns (see section 4.2). The model consists of 6 Markov sub-models. These simulate the progression of disease on distinct organ systems affected by lipodystrophy, capturing the key lipodystrophy-related complications that affect health-related quality of life, costs and mortality over the lifetime of people with lipodystrophy. The 6 organ sub-models are: pancreas, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney, neuropathy (nerves) and retinopathy (eyes). In each cycle (which lasted for 1 year), a person is simultaneously in a single discrete health state in each of the 6 independent organ sub-models. A person can die during each cycle, in which case they are removed from all sub-models into the death state. • Pancreas sub-model starts in the 'no pancreatitis' state when a person is at risk of developing pancreatitis. • Liver sub-model is based on NICE's guideline on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). People transition through health states, from having no or asymptomatic fibrosis, to advanced fibrosis, to compensated and then decompensated cirrhosis. • Cardiovascular sub-model: people start in the 'no cardiovascular disease' state, when they are at risk of
