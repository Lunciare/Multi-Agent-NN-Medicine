Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

comparison (company's scenario analysis). For the pancreas sub-model, the baseline transition probability for pancreatitis was directly sourced from the GL/PL natural history study. It was then adjusted using odds ratios estimated from the indirect treatment comparison (see section 4.9). 4.19 For the 4 diabetes-related sub-models, the ERG noted that the company did not adjust the transition probabilities based on triglycerides, because of a lack of data in the literature. The company explained that it meant that the transition probabilities were underestimated in cases when hypertriglyceridaemia contributes to the risk of a complication, such as cardiovascular disease. The committee noted that using only HbA1c to adjust the transition probabilities in the 4 diabetes-related sub-models could either under or overestimate metreleptin's treatment effect on those organ complications. But, the exact magnitude of that is unlikely to be quantified because of limited evidence. It agreed that, qualitatively, HbA1c has value as a surrogate for clinical outcomes in the cardiovascular, kidney, neuropathy and retinopathy sub-models. It was generally satisfied with the approach taken by the company to model transition probabilities. The ERG preferred using the change in liver enzymes (trial-based data) estimated from the indirect treatment comparison (rather than the risk reduction estimate directly
