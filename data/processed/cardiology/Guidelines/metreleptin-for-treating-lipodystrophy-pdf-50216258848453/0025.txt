Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

are likely to reverse to their baseline values over 6 to 12 months, or sooner. The committee noted that evidence showed that metreleptin is effective in lowering HbA1c and triglyceride levels. Evidence also showed that metreleptin may affect liver enzymes but their correlation with the progression of liver disease is less clear. The committee concluded that using HbA1c to predict diabetes-related complications in people with lipodystrophy is acceptable but the relationship between liver enzymes and liver disease is uncertain. Clinical and patient-perceived outcomes 4.13 The clinical studies did not include an objective measure to capture the effect of metreleptin on hyperphagia even though, as the patient experts explained, it is a defining characteristic of lipodystrophy with important physical and emotional consequences. The clinical experts agreed that treatment targeting hyperphagia is critical because eating less means some complications of lipodystrophy will improve. The clinical experts also explained that hyperphagia is caused by a deficiency in the hormone leptin (see section 2.1). They also noted that it was hard to predict the impact of metreleptin effect on hyperphagia and quality of life, because there is no simple relationship between eating less and quality of life. The committee acknowledged the expert comments and
