But, it concluded that the ERG's approach of removing the assumed lifetime maintenance of 50% utility differential to both patients and carers is preferred.

At 9 months after the start of metreleptin treatment, a specialist service review will see whether treatment should be stopped if the following metabolic criteria have not been met: an HbA1c reduction of at least 0.75% from baseline, or a fasting triglyceride reduction of at least 50% from baseline. A clinical expert stated that there was a consensus in European lipodystrophy centres to stop metreleptin at 6 to 9 months if the person did not take the treatment properly or did not engage with appointments, or there was no HbA1c reduction of at least 0.5% from baseline or a fall in fasting triglycerides of at least 50% from baseline.
