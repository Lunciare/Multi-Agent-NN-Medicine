other glucose-lowering medications or other serious complications of inadequate metabolic control such as progressive liver disease. The company explained these restrictive criteria were developed based on the clinical evidence from the NIH studies 991265/ 20010769, UK clinical expert experience and consensus from European lipodystrophy centres. The ERG pointed out that there was no clinical or economic evidence for this further restricted subgroup of partial lipodystrophy proposed by the company. It was concerned that the effect on the population size eligible for treatment was unknown given the lack of information on the number of people who would actually fulfil these criteria, including the exceptions. It noted that the narrower population would cause issues around application of the various data sources to UK clinical practice. The clinical experts explained that response to metreleptin is greater in people with lipodystrophy and with more severe metabolic status (that is, HbA1c and triglyceride levels) at baseline. They further explained that the criteria of 'HbA1c above 7.5%' was based on the recommended value for a person with diabetes to target in clinical practice. The criteria of 'fasting triglycerides above 5.00 mmol/litre' was based on the value above which people with diabetes are at risk of pancreatitis.
