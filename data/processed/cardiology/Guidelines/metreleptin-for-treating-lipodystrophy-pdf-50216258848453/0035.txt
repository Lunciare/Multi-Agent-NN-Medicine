what it had heard from the experts, it concluded that the tolerability profile of metreleptin was likely to be acceptable. 4.16 In the NIH 991265/20010769 and FHA101 studies, 88% of people developed antibodies to metreleptin, and 4% developed neutralising antibodies to metreleptin. This raised concern that developing neutralising antibodies could affect metabolic control and immune function. The company explained that neutralising antibodies were only reported in 4% of people. Therefore, it did not anticipate this affecting a significant proportion of people or affecting outcomes such as HbA1c and triglyceride levels in the long term. Clinical experts stated that neutralising antibodies are rare, and although relevant to some people, do not seem to be a frequent problem in clinical practice. The same issues are seen in other metabolic diseases, but it does not affect the efficacy of the drug. They noted that neutralising antibodies should still be monitored. The committee concluded that neutralising antibodies did not seem to be a significant issue, but this should still be monitored in the future.
