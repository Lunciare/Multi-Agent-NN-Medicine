Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

programme explained that recent outcomes are becoming more and more aligned with those of the NIH study follow up. This is because of the application of recent clinical inclusion criteria (see section 4.8). The clinical experts stated that the indirect treatment comparison would be better informed by the NIH follow-up study. The ERG was also concerned about the limited covariates adjusted for in the indirect treatment comparison. This is because important prognostic covariates such as baseline HbA1c and triglyceride levels were not controlled for in the analysis. The company argued that these were not confounding factors because they were not related to treatment allocation. The company also explored using additional covariates in a sensitivity analysis. But, it stated that this analysis was not feasible because of small sample size, the high proportion of missing data and the large number of potential covariates. The company explained that there was more than 90% of missing data and, despite a small sample number (n=31), the 3 methods it used to adjust for cofounders (inverse probability weighting, multivariate regression analysis, and naive comparison) showed consistent results with statistical significance. The company added that its approach was driven by clinical opinion and statistical principles. The
