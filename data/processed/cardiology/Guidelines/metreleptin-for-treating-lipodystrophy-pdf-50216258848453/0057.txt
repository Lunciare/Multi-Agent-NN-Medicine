Metreleptin for treating lipodystrophy

and carers. It noted that the clinical evidence suggested metreleptin provides clinical benefits by reducing blood sugar, triglycerides and liver enzymes in people with lipodystrophy. The indirect treatment comparison results presented by the company during the resubmission also indicated that metreleptin was associated with greater improvement in metabolic outcomes compared with supportive care. However, there are uncertainties in metreleptin's treatment effect on clinical outcomes in the long term. 4.37 The committee was generally satisfied with the company's modelling approach in the resubmission, which was based on established diabetes and fatty liver frameworks. It was aware that there are uncertainties about transition probabilities (see section 4.18) and utility values (see section 4.20) sourced from other disease areas, transition probabilities adjusted by change in HbA1c (see section 4.19), and metreleptin's assumed treatment effect on organ damage and quality of life after stopping treatment (see sections 4.23, 4.24 and 4.25). It also noted that metreleptin did not meet the criteria for a QALY weighting to be applied. The committee acknowledged the uncertainties and took into account the impact of metreleptin beyond direct health benefits (see section 4.31) and the likely overestimated cost-effectiveness results (see section 4.14 and section 4.35). As such, the committee
