The ERG used the mean of 1.67 in their base- case model as is usual in health economic modelling. The committee agreed with using 1.67 carers from the ERG because not all people with lipodystrophy will have 2 carers. It concluded that it was satisfied with the ERG's approach. Long-term effect of metreleptin on HbA1c, liver, quality of life, and patient-reported outcomes such as hyperphagia after stopping treatment Metreleptin's treatment effect on HbA1c after stopping treatment 4.23 Although there is no evidence on metreleptin's effect on HbA1c after stopping treatment, the company's model assumed that metreleptin's treatment effect on HbA1c will be maintained for a lifetime after stopping treatment. In the model, when people start metreleptin, their HbA1c level is fully reduced (in
