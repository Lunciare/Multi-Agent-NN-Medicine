Endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms

at 3 years and 70% at 5 years. Primary patency is defined as uninterrupted patency following revascularisation. Secondary patency implies that re-intervention has been required to restore patency. 2.3.2 A case series of 50 patients reported that 98% (56 out of 57) of aneurysms were completely excluded after endovascular repair. 2.3.3 The case series of 50 patients reported a limb salvage rate of 97% (55 out of 57). 2.3.4 A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 42 patients treated by endovascular or open repair reported that 14% (3 out of 21) of patients in the endovascular group required open repair because of endograft occlusion during a mean follow-up of 47 months. In the case series of 50 patients, stent-graft occlusion occurred in 16% (9.57) of aneurysms (2 were successfully treated by thrombolysis, 5 were treated by femoropopliteal bypass, 1 patient was asymptomatic and was not treated, and in the remaining patient, treatment of the occlusion was delayed leading to severe limb ischaemia requiring amputation). 2.3.5 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as successful exclusion of the aneurysm, long-term prevention of thrombosis and distal embolisation, prevention of rupture, and limb salvage. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Endograft thrombosis occurred in 10% (2 out
