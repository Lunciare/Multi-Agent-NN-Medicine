1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms is limited in quantity but shows no major safety concerns. Evidence on efficacy is inadequate because it is limited to the short-term. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. 1.2 Clinicians wishing to undertake endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms should take the following actions • Inform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts. • Ensure that patients and their carers understand the uncertainty about the procedure's long-term efficacy and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended.
