1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms is limited in quantity but shows no major safety concerns. Evidence on efficacy is inadequate because it is limited to the short-term. Therefore, this procedure should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. 1.2 Clinicians wishing to undertake endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms should take the following actions • Inform the clinical governance leads in their Trusts. • Ensure that patients and their carers understand the uncertainty about the procedure's long-term efficacy and provide them with clear written information. In addition, the use of NICE's information for the public is recommended. • Audit and review clinical outcomes of all patients having endovascular stent- grafting of popliteal aneurysms (see section 3.1). 1.3 Patient selection for this procedure should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team which should include a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist with specific training and experience in the technique. 1.4 NICE encourages further research into endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms and may review this procedure on publication of further evidence. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common peripheral aneurysms.
