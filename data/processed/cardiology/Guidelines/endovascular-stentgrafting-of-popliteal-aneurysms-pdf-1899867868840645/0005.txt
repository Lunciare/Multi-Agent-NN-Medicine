Endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms

outcomes as successful exclusion of the aneurysm, long-term prevention of thrombosis and distal embolisation, prevention of rupture, and limb salvage. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Endograft thrombosis occurred in 10% (2 out of 21) of patients treated by endovascular repair the day after the procedure in the RCT of 42 patients. In 1 patient, intra-arterial thombolytic therapy followed by an additional endovascular procedure was successful. The other patient required open repair after 72 hours. Acute thrombosis was reported in 6% (2 out of 23) of aneurysms within 24 hours of the procedure in the case series of 29 patients; both aneurysms were successfully recanalised with catheter-directed thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty or rheolytic thrombectomy. In this study, a further 4 patients were diagnosed with thrombosis during follow-up (1 was described as acute and 3 as subacute). 2.4.2 Stent fracture in 4% (3 out of 73) of aneurysms (2 leading to occlusion) and stent migration in 12% (9 out of 73) of aneurysms were reported in the case series of 60 patients. Stent migration was reported in 7% (4 out of 57) of procedures in the case series of 50 patients. 2.4.3 Stenosis was reported in 3% (2 out of 73) of procedures (timing
