Endovascular stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms

was reported in 7% (4 out of 57) of procedures in the case series of 50 patients. 2.4.3 Stenosis was reported in 3% (2 out of 73) of procedures (timing of events not stated) in the case series of 60 patients. These were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. 2.4.4 There was 1 report of distal embolisation necessitating amputation in the case series of 50 patients. 2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers listed anecdotal adverse events as stent occlusion leading to acute limb ischaemia, stent-graft thrombosis, graft failure due to repeated mechanical stress, endoleak and puncture-site arterial bleeding. They considered theoretical adverse events to include stent-graft infection and loss of aneurysm control. 3 Further information 3.1 This guidance requires that clinicians undertaking the procedure make special arrangements for audit. NICE has identified relevant audit criteria and has developed an audit tool (which is for use at local discretion). Sources of evidence The evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the overview.
