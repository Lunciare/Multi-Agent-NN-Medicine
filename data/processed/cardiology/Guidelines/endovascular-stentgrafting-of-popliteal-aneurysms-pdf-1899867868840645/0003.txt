information on the evidence, see the overview. 2.3.1 A meta-analysis of 320 patients treated by endovascular repair reported primary and secondary patency rates at 1 year of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79% to 88%) and 86% (95% CI 82% to 91%) respectively. In the same meta-analysis, comparative data were available for 159 patients: the primary patency rate at 1 year for endovascular repair was 84% (36 out of 43), compared with 85% (99 out of 116) for open repair (p=0.46). Secondary patency rates at 1 year were 86% (37 out of 43) for endovascular repair and 95% (110 out of 116) for open repair (p=0.07). A non-randomised comparative study of 43 patients (56 limbs; 15 endovascular and 41 open repair) reported primary patency rates of 83% and 88% respectively at 24-month follow-up (p=not significant). A case series of 60 patients at 24 months were 100% and 92% for endovascular and open repair respectively (p=not significant). A case series of 60 patients reported that the primary patency rate was 77% at 3 years and 70% at 5 years. Primary patency is defined as uninterrupted patency following revascularisation. Secondary patency implies that re-intervention has been required to restore patency. 2.3.2 A
