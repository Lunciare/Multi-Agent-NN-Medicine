aneurysms and may review this procedure on publication of further evidence. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common peripheral aneurysms. They can cause leg ischaemia by embolism or thrombosis and may rupture. Current treatment is usually by open surgical bypass grafting. Postoperative antiplatelet therapy is generally given. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Endovascular repair stent-grafting of popliteal aneurysms is carried out with the patient under local or general anaesthesia. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a stent- graft device is inserted into the femoral artery using standard catheter and guidewire techniques. Care is taken to ensure adequate length of anchoring stent in the normal vessel, both proximally and distally, to bridge the popliteal aneurysm and fully exclude the aneurysm from the circulation. 2.2.2 A range of different stents are available for this procedure. 2.3 Efficacy Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the overview. 2.3.1 A meta-analysis of 320 patients treated by endovascular repair reported primary and secondary patency rates at 1 year of 83% (95% confidence
