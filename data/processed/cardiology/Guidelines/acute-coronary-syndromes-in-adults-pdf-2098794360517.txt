Acute coronary syndromes in adults
Quality statements
Statement 1 Adults with a suspected acute coronary syndrome are assessed for acute
myocardial infarction using the criteria in the universal definition of myocardial infarction.
Statement 2 Adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or
unstable angina are assessed for their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events using
an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality to guide clinical
management.
Statement 3 Adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina who have an intermediate or higher
risk of future adverse cardiovascular events who are having coronary angiography (with
follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] if indicated), have it within 72 hours of
first admission to hospital.
Statement 4 Adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina who are clinically unstable have
coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) as soon as possible, but within
24 hours of becoming clinically unstable.
Statement 5 Adults who are unconscious after cardiac arrest caused by suspected acute
ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are not excluded from having
coronary angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated).
Statement 6 Adults with acute STEMI who present within 12 hours of onset of symptoms
have primary PCI, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, as soon as possible but
within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given.

 
Quality statement 1: Diagnosis of acute
myocardial infarction
Quality statement
Adults with a suspected acute coronary syndrome are assessed for acute myocardial
infarction using the criteria in the universal definition of myocardial infarction.
Rationale
Acute myocardial infarction can have a poor prognosis so prompt and accurate diagnosis
is important to ensure that appropriate treatment and care is offered as soon as possible.
Treatment for adults with suspected acute coronary syndrome is often started before a
diagnosis is confirmed. Confirming the diagnosis using the criteria in the universal
definition of myocardial infarction is important to ensure that any ongoing treatment is
appropriate and any inappropriate treatment is stopped.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (cardiac service providers) ensure that adults with a suspected acute
coronary syndrome are assessed for the presence of acute myocardial infarction using the
criteria in the universal definition of myocardial infarction.
Healthcare professionals ensure that they are aware of the universal definition of
myocardial infarction and assess adults with a suspected acute coronary syndrome for the
presence of acute myocardial infarction using the criteria in the universal definition.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services with staff with expertise in using
the criteria in the universal definition of myocardial infarction to diagnose acute myocardial
infarction in adults with a suspected acute coronary syndrome.
Adults with severe pain in the chest and/or in other areas (for example, the arms, back or
jaw)that might be a heart attack (a suspected acute coronary syndrome) are only given a
diagnosis of heart attack if their signs and symptoms meet an agreed definition.

Universal definition of myocardial infarction
A rise in cardiac biomarkers (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least 1 value above the
99th percentile of the upper reference limit and/or a fall in cardiac biomarkers, together
with at least 1 of the following:
• symptoms of ischaemia
• new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave changes or new left bundle
branch block
• pathological Q wave changes in the ECG
• imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
abnormality
• identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography.

Equality and diversity considerations
Symptoms of acute coronary syndromes should be assessed in the same way in men and
women and among people from different ethnic groups.

 
Quality statement 2: Risk assessment for
adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina
Quality statement
Adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina
are assessed for their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events using an established
risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality to guide clinical management.
Rationale
Assessing and categorising risk of future adverse cardiovascular events by formal risk
assessment (for example, using the GRACE scoring system) in people who have been
diagnosed with NSTEMI or unstable angina is important for determining early management
strategies. It also allows the benefits of treatment to be balanced against the risks of
treatment-related adverse events. Failure to categorise future risk can lead to people
being given inappropriate treatment.

specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

Service providers (cardiac service providers) ensure that local pathways are in place for
adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina to be assessed for their risk of future adverse
cardiovascular events using an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month
mortality. Providers should also raise awareness among healthcare professionals of the
importance of risk assessment in guiding clinical management.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Assessment for risk of future adverse cardiovascular events
Individual risk of future adverse cardiovascular events should be formally assessed using
an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality (for example, Global
Registry of Acute Cardiac Events [GRACE]).
The formal risk assessment should include:
• a full clinical history (including age, previous myocardial infarction and previous
percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting)
• a physical examination (including measurement of blood pressure and heart rate)
• resting 12-lead ECG (looking particularly for dynamic or unstable patterns that indicate
myocardial ischaemia)
• blood tests (such as troponin I or T, creatinine, glucose and haemoglobin).

Quality statement 3: Coronary
angiography and PCI within 72 hours for
NSTEMI or unstable angina
Quality statement
Adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina
who have an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events who are
having coronary angiography (with follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] if
indicated), have it within 72 hours of first admission to hospital.
Rationale
In people with an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events,
coronary angiography to define the extent and severity of coronary disease, done within
72 hours of admission to hospital, offers advantages over an initial conservative strategy,
provided there are no contraindications to angiography (such as active bleeding or
comorbidity). Services should provide coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if
indicated) as soon as it offers net clinical benefits; within 72 hours and sooner if possible.

Quality statement 4: Coronary
angiography and PCI for adults with
NSTEMI or unstable angina who are
clinically unstable
Quality statement
Adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina
who are clinically unstable have coronary angiography (with follow-on percutaneous
coronary intervention [PCI] if indicated) as soon as possible, but within 24 hours of
becoming clinically unstable.
Rationale
Coronary angiography is important to define the extent and severity of coronary disease.
The benefits of an early invasive strategy appear to be greatest in people at higher risk of
future adverse cardiovascular events. In people with NSTEMI or unstable angina who are
clinically unstable, coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) should be done
as soon as possible so that appropriate treatment can be given. It may reduce lengthy
hospital stays and prevent further cardiovascular events in both the short and long term.
The timing of coronary angiography will be different for each person, but should be within
24 hours of becoming clinically unstable.

specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

timeframes for patients. [Expert opinion]

 
Quality statement 5: Level of
consciousness and eligibility for coronary
angiography and primary PCI
Quality statement
Adults who are unconscious after cardiac arrest caused by suspected acute
ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are not excluded from having
coronary angiography (with follow-on primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] if
indicated).
Rationale
People who remain unconscious after cardiac arrest should not be treated differently from
people who are conscious. They should be able to have the same treatments within the
same timescales and should be admitted to centres capable of undertaking primary PCI.
Carrying out immediate primary PCI, if successful, could stabilise the person's heart and
may reduce the risk of further complications.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults who are unconscious after cardiac
arrest caused by suspected acute STEMI are not excluded from having coronary
angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated) because they are unconscious.
Data source: Local data collection.

 
Process

acute STEMI who receive coronary angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated).
Numerator – the number in the denominator receiving coronary angiography (with follow-

Denominator – the number of adults who were unconscious after cardiac arrest caused by
suspected acute STEMI.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (ambulance services and cardiac service providers) ensure that adults
who are unconscious after cardiac arrest caused by suspected acute STEMI are not
excluded from having coronary angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated).
Providers should also raise awareness among healthcare professionals of the importance
of not using level of consciousness to exclude adults from having coronary angiography
(with follow-on primary PCI if indicated).
Healthcare professionals ensure that they do not use level of consciousness after cardiac
arrest caused by suspected acute STEMI to exclude adults from having coronary
angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated).
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that can carry out coronary
angiography (with follow-on primary PCI if indicated) in adults who are unconscious after
cardiac arrest caused by suspected acute STEMI.
Adults who are unconscious after a type of heart attack called STEMI can have a test
called coronary angiography, and treatment to improve blood flow to the heart if needed,
even though they are unconscious.

Quality statement 6: Primary PCI for
acute STEMI
Quality statement
Adults with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present within
12 hours of onset of symptoms have primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as
the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, as soon as possible but within 120 minutes of
the time when fibrinolysis could have been given.
Rationale
Primary PCI is a form of reperfusion therapy which should be done as soon as possible.
This is because heart muscle starts to be lost once a coronary artery is blocked and the
sooner reperfusion therapy is delivered the better the outcome for the patient. If too much
time elapses the benefits of primary PCI may be lost. Because of the difficulty in timely
delivery, in some areas primary PCI is no longer the preferred coronary reperfusion
strategy over fibrinolysis. However, when performed early, primary PCI is more effective.
To ensure the best outcomes for adults with STEMI, the ambulance service and hospitals
delivering primary PCI should work together to minimise delays in treatment.

The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (ambulance services, accident and emergency service provider and
cardiac service providers) ensure that local pathways and transfer protocols are in place
for adults with acute STEMI who present within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms to be
offered primary PCI, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, as soon as possible
but within 120 minutes of when fibrinolysis could have been given.
Healthcare professionals ensure that they offer primary PCI, as the preferred coronary
reperfusion strategy, as soon as possible but within 120 minutes of when fibrinolysis could

symptoms.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that have the capacity and
expertise to provide primary PCI, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, as soon
as possible but within 120 minutes of when fibrinolysis could have been given (and at any
time of the day or night, including weekends) to adults with acute STEMI who present
within 12 hours of onset of symptoms. Commissioners should work with their service
providers to develop a single care pathway for coronary reperfusion.
Adults with a type of heart attack called STEMI whose symptoms started no more than
12 hours before first contacting a healthcare professional are offered a procedure to
improve blood flow to the heart (called percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI). They
should be able to have this as soon as possible, but within 120 minutes of when they could
have received fibrinolysis (a 'clot-busting' drug).
