Intraoperative fluorescence angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft

patency. These include digital palpation, electromagnetic flow measurement, Doppler studies, and conventional and thermal coronary angiography techniques. A limitation with many of the imaging techniques is that they provide poor resolution and definition of the grafts. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Intraoperative fluorescence angiography allows confirmation of the location of the coronary arteries and assessment of bypass graft function during coronary artery bypass procedures. The intraoperative fluorescence imaging system consists of a video camera and a laser diode that emits monochromatic light. The camera, guided by a range-detector diode, is positioned a safe distance above the heart. A small amount of indocyanine green (ICG) dye is then administered as a central venous injection. This dye fluoresces when illuminated using laser energy and the images are recorded digitally. Currently the technique is only semiquantitative, in that it permits assessment of graft flow as 'excellent', 'satisfactory' or 'poor' – it cannot provide an exact measure of graft flow. The penetrating depth of the laser beam is only around 1 mm, limiting the use of this technique to certain grafts.
