Intraoperative fluorescence angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft

patency 1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on intraoperative fluorescence angiography suggests that the procedure is safe enough for routine use in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency. 1.2 There is limited evidence on the diagnostic utility (that is, the extent to which knowledge of its results improves patients' outcomes) of this procedure, and clinicians should therefore audit and review the clinical value of intraoperative fluorescence angiography in all patients having the investigation. NICE may review the procedure upon publication of further evidence. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Coronary artery bypass grafting is one of the most common cardiac surgical interventions. In this procedure, a section of vessel from another part of the body is used to reroute (bypass) blood around a blocked coronary artery and improve blood flow to the heart. Early blockage of the graft and poor blood flow may be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. 2.1.2 Several techniques are used intraoperatively to assess graft patency. These include digital palpation, electromagnetic flow measurement, Doppler studies, and conventional and thermal coronary angiography techniques. A limitation with many of the imaging techniques is that they provide poor
