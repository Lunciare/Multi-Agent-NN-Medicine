Intraoperative fluorescence angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft

the use of this technique to certain grafts. For more details, see the overview. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 The evidence on efficacy is based on four case series studies, with three studies reporting on clinically relevant results. In one study, intraoperative graft patency was assessed in 200 patients: graft patency was confirmed in 192 patients (96%), and the additional information provided by the procedure resulted in graft revision of these eight patients. Similar results were reported in two other studies with 1.4% (4 out of 290) to 3.7% (4 out of 107) of grafts revised after the procedure. No other outcomes were reported. For more details, see the overview. 2.3.2 One Specialist Advisor considered there to be too little information available regarding efficacy. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Complications associated with this procedure appear to be uncommon. There were no reports of adverse events associated with the use of the ICG dye in evaluating the patency of coronary bypass grafts. Six additional papers were identified that described complications following the administration of ICG dye for indications other than coronary graft patency. Most of these were reports of patients developing anaphylactoid reactions, with an incidence ranging from 0.02% to 0.3%. For more details, see
