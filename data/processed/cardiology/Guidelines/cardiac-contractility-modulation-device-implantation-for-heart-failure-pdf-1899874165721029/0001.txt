1.1 The evidence on cardiac contractility modulation device implantation for heart failure raises no major safety concerns. However, the evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Further research should ideally be in the form of randomised controlled trials. These should report details of patient selection, duration and timing of stimulation, and duration of effect of stimulation. Outcomes should include ejection fraction, oxygen consumption, New York Heart Association classification and patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs that happen when the heart is not working well enough, leading to reduced blood flow to body tissues. It can lead to oedema in the lungs (causing breathlessness) and swelling of the legs. Other symptoms include reduced ability to exercise, fatigue and malaise. Heart failure can be caused by structural or functional abnormalities of the heart. Current treatments 2.2 NICE's guideline describes the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in adults.
