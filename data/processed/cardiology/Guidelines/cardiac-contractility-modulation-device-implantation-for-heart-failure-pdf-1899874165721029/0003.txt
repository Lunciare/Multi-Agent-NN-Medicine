This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 8 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 1 systematic review, 3 randomised controlled trials (2 of which were also included in the review), 1 non-randomised comparative study (included in the review) and 3 case series, and is presented in table 2 of the interventional procedures overview. Other relevant literature is in the appendix of the overview. 3.2 The committee considered the key efficacy outcomes to be improved ejection fraction, oxygen consumption during and following stimulation, New York Heart Association classification, rate of hospitalisation and quality of life. 3.3
