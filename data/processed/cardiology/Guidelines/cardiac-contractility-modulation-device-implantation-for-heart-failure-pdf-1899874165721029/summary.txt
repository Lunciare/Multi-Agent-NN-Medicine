1.1 The evidence on cardiac contractility modulation device implantation for heart failure raises no major safety concerns. However, the evidence on efficacy is inadequate in quantity and quality. Therefore, this procedure should only be used in the context of research. Find out what only in research means on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Further research should ideally be in the form of randomised controlled trials. These should report details of patient selection, duration and timing of stimulation, and duration of effect of stimulation.
