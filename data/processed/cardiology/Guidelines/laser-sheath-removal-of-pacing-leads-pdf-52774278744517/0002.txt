Laser sheath removal of pacing leads

separate them from the surrounding scar tissue. If this fails, open chest surgery may be required. Alternatively, in some cases, the leads may be detached from the pacemaker unit and simply left inside the patient. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Laser sheaths are similar to standard extraction sheaths, but vaporise rather than tear the scar tissue surrounding the pacing leads. The use of laser sheaths involves passing a double-layered sheath over the pacing leads. The inner layer of the sheath is made from fibre-optic material that transmits a laser beam; the outer layer is more rigid. The double-layered sheath is passed slowly over the lead and laser energy vaporises the scar tissue around the lead as the sheath is advanced over it. When scar tissue has been vaporised up to a point near the heart, the more rigid outer sheath is advanced to provide countertraction for removal of the pacing lead. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In the studies reviewed, complete lead removal ranged from 89% (596 out of 671 leads) to 98% (44 out of 45 leads). In a randomised controlled trial, complete lead removal was 94% (230 out of 244 leads) for patients in the laser group and 64%
