to 98% (44 out of 45 leads). In a randomised controlled trial, complete lead removal was 94% (230 out of 244 leads) for patients in the laser group and 64% (142 out of 221 leads) for patients in the non-laser group. In the same study, mean operation time per lead was 11 minutes in the laser group compared with 15 minutes in the non-laser group (p<0.04).

They considered it to be at least as efficacious as, and probably more efficacious than, standard techniques. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 In a randomised controlled trial, 3 of 153 patients randomised to laser sheath removal required subsequent surgery (two patients required a thoracotomy and one patient required a chest tube). One patient later died after a cardiac tamponade, but this was not directly related to the use of laser energy. In the largest case series, major complications (defined as cardiac tamponade, haemothorax, pulmonary embolism, lead migration and death) were observed in 2% (31 out of 1,684) of patients, and 1% (13 out of 1,684) of patients died in hospital.
