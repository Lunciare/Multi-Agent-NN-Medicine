1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of laser sheath removal of pacing leads appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 1.2 Laser sheath removal of pacing leads should be used only in patients for whom standard methods of removal are ineffective. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 This procedure is used to remove pacemaker leads that have been in place for a few months. Pacemaker leads may need to be removed or changed if they malfunction, cause heart rhythm problems or become infected. If the leads have been in place for more than a few months they can become tightly attached by scar tissue to the heart and to the veins through which they pass, making removal difficult and risky. This procedure may also be used to remove defibrillator leads.
