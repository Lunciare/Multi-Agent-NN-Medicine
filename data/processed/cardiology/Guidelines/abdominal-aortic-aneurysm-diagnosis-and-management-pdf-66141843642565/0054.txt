current clinical practice because it reflects what is already being done within the NHS. Data from the NHS AAA screening programme indicate that the risk of rupture for AAAs that are smaller than 5.5 cm is very low. The recommendations on EVAR could have a large impact on practice and will also affect the timing and type of information about treatment options given to patients. In light of the evidence reviewed, practice needs to be rebalanced towards open surgical repair for infrarenal aneurysms. The recommendations will minimise harm by reducing long-term mortality and the need for re-intervention as a result of the problems with EVAR. The reduction in EVAR, and so EVAR-related re-interventions, will result in significant cost savings for the NHS. A lack of recommendations on goal-directed therapy will not impact on practice. Basic haemodynamic management is routinely performed during most surgical procedures, but goal-directed therapy is not widely adopted during AAA surgery.
