determine whether tranexamic acid improves survival in people having EVAR or open surgical repair of a ruptured AAA. 6 Prehabilitation (including preoperative exercise programmes) for improving the outcome of aneurysm repair What is the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of prehabilitation, including preoperative exercise programmes, for improving outcomes of people who are having repair of an AAA? Why this is important NHS providers have started devoting resources to prehabilitation programmes, based on a relatively small body of evidence. Research is needed to determine if prehabilitation is effective and the optimal form it should take. Other recommendations for research 7 Direct oral anticoagulants after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair What are the benefits of postoperative use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for improving outcomes after repair of AAA? 8 Permissive hypotension Does permissive hypotension improve survival of patients undergoing repair of ruptured AAA? 9 Surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair What are the risks, benefits and cost implications of different surveillance protocols in people who have undergone EVAR? Rationale and impact Identifying asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.6 The committee were mindful that the NHS abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programme does not cover men
