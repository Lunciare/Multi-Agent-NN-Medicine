AAA repair, these features can include large abdominal wall defects or intra-abdominal adhesions. A hostile abdomen is most common in people who have had multiple previous episodes of intra-abdominal open surgery. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm arising below the arteries that supply the kidneys. Permissive hypotension A method of fluid administration that aims to reduce bleeding by keeping a person's blood pressure within a lower-than-normal range. Recommendations for research The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research. Key recommendations for research 1 Monitoring frequencies and repair thresholds What are the most effective and cost-effective frequencies for monitoring people with unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) of different diameters, and what is the optimal AAA threshold size (inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior diameter on ultrasound) for repair? Why this is important More frequent monitoring increases the chances of identifying aneurysms that have grown large enough to be considered for repair. However, monitoring requires resources and the absolute risk of AAA rupture is relatively low, so there are opportunity costs to consider. It is important to establish how often aneurysms should be monitored to keep the risk of rupture as low as possible while making the best use of NHS
