Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

increases (see why NICE made the recommendations on repairing unruptured aneurysms). The medium-term survival data from the IMPROVE trial give some indication that a similar long-term pattern may develop in trials of ruptured AAA, with the survival curves converging as follow-up gets longer. Therefore, it is possible that longer-term data would show EVAR to be worse than open surgical repair for people with ruptured AAA as well. Secondly, there was evidence that the balance of benefits and costs for EVAR varies between different groups of people with ruptured AAAs. In particular, most women have better short-term survival after EVAR, whereas the evidence favours open surgical repair for younger men. Therefore, the committee recommended that either EVAR or open surgical repair can be considered, and provided detail on the groups for which each approach is likely to be best. Complex EVAR is only recommended within the context of an RCT because there is currently no evidence to support it as an option for people with ruptured complex AAA. Open surgical repair of these aneurysms is recommended as the only approach that should be used in people for whom emergency repair is suitable until the safety and effectiveness of complex EVAR has
