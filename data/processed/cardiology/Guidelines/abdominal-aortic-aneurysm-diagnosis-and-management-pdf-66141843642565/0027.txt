Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

rupture. 4 Metformin for slowing aneurysm growth and reducing the risk of rupture What are the benefits and harms of metformin for reducing AAA growth rates and the risk of rupture? Why this is important Observational study data suggest an association between diabetes and slower AAA growth, and it has been proposed that this may be due to the use of metformin. A randomised controlled trial is needed to determine whether metformin reduces the rate of AAA growth and the risk of rupture. 5 Tranexamic acid for preventing and treating excessive blood loss during EVAR or open surgical repair Does tranexamic acid reduce blood loss and so improve survival in people who are having repair (EVAR or open surgical repair) of a ruptured AAA? Why this is important Tranexamic acid is used to reduce blood loss in major trauma, postpartum bleeding and surgery. By slowing down blood loss from a ruptured AAA, the use of tranexamic acid may improve survival from ruptured AAA. A randomised controlled trial is needed to determine whether tranexamic acid improves survival in people having EVAR or open surgical repair of a ruptured AAA. 6 Prehabilitation (including preoperative exercise programmes) for improving the outcome of aneurysm
