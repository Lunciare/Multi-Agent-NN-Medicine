Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

AAA screening programme means that AAAs are more likely to be diagnosed earlier than in the past, so people can have repair when they are younger and healthier. For these reasons, open surgical repair of unruptured AAAs can be provided with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality. • The risk that vascular units will have trouble meeting an increased demand for open surgical repair: All vascular surgeons should be competent to perform open surgical repair of AAAs, and the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme's Vascular surgery curriculum puts more emphasis on open surgical repair than on EVAR. This means that future surgeons should be well prepared to provide open surgical repair with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality. • Potential shortage of beds in the NHS: As people who have open surgical repair spend more time in hospital immediately after the procedure, there may be a small, short-term increase in waiting times for AAA repair. However, an analysis comparing waiting times showed that open surgical repair would still provide greater benefit than EVAR for a lower cost even with a substantial increase in waiting times for open surgical repair. • The possibility that reducing the number of EVAR procedures
