5.5 cm, asymptomatic and not growing rapidly. Based on this evidence, we highlighted factors that would help healthcare professionals decide when to repair aneurysms. Given the risks and other disadvantages of AAA repair, conservative management is sometimes a better option. Because of this, healthcare professionals need to explain the balance of benefits and risks to people with AAAs, so they can make an informed decision. Open surgical repair, standard endovascular aneurysm repair or conservative management The evidence showed that, compared with open surgical repair for people with an unruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, elective EVAR has medium- and long- term harms that outweigh its short-term benefits. EVAR is associated with fewer perioperative deaths, and less time in hospital in general (and critical care in particular). But it also has worse long-term survival than open surgical repair, and more long-term complications, leading to further procedures. Even when taking the short-term benefits of EVAR into account, all plausible cost- effectiveness estimates show that EVAR either: • has higher net costs and lower net benefits than open surgical repair or • is substantially above the range NICE normally considers to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. There is a small group of
