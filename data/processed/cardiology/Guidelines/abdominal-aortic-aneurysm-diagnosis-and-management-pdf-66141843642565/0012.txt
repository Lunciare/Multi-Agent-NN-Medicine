routine preoperative tests for elective surgery. 1.4.3 Do not use the following risk assessment tools to determine whether or not repair is suitable for a person with an asymptomatic unruptured AAA: • British Aneurysm Repair score • Carlisle Calculator • Comorbidity Severity Score • Glasgow Aneurysm Scale • Medicare risk prediction tool • Modified Leiden score • Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enUmeration of Mortality (POSSUM) • Vascular-POSSUM • Vascular Biochemical and Haematological Outcome Model (VBHOM) • Vascular Governance North West (VGNW) risk model. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on predicting surgical outcomes in unruptured aneurysms. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G: tests for predicting outcomes after repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and evidence review H: risk assessment tools for predicting surgical outcomes of patients who undergo elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Predicting surgical outcomes for ruptured aneurysms 1.4.4 Do not use any single symptom, sign or patient-related risk factor to determine whether aneurysm repair is suitable for a person with a ruptured AAA. 1.4.5 Do not use patient risk assessment tools
