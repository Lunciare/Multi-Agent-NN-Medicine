patient prognosis and long-term quality of life, and further interventions are frequently needed to repair them. In the absence of evidence, the committee made recommendations based on their experience because: • it is good practice to repair type I and III endoleaks and some type II endoleaks • healthcare professionals are not all aware that type II endoleaks without sac expansion can be managed conservatively • there are circumstances when sac expansion occurs without imaging evidence of a leak site (called type V endoleak), and these situations need further investigation. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations will have minimal impact on current practice because it is common practice to intervene for type I and type III endoleaks, and type II endoleaks if there is evidence of aneurysm sac expansion. Return to recommendations Context Abdominal aortic aneurysms develop when the wall of the aorta in the abdomen weakens, causing it to bulge and form a balloon-like expansion. When the abdominal aorta reaches a diameter at least 1.5 times the normal size, or greater than 3 cm in total, it is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The increased stress on the aortic wall may eventually cause the AAA to
