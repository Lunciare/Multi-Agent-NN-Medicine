of this. Aortic ultrasound is recommended because it is the standard technique used in clinical practice and in the screening programme. It has high diagnostic accuracy, and is associated with lower costs and fewer side effects than CT. People with an AAA diameter of 5.5 cm or larger (inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter on ultrasound) need to be seen by a regional vascular service within 2 weeks because their aneurysm is at higher risk of rupture. The committee recommended that people with aneurysms less than 5.5 cm in diameter are seen within 12 weeks of diagnosis because this is the timeframe set by the NHS AAA screening programme. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations outlining key risk factors will increase the number of people being screened and improve AAA diagnosis. The recommendations should also promote equal access to healthcare, because they provide guidance on when a potential AAA should be investigated in women, who are currently not covered by the NHS AAA screening programme. Using aortic ultrasound to detect AAAs is good practice. The recommendations ensure that the time within which people with newly-identified aneurysms are seen by regional vascular services is proportional to the risk of rupture.
