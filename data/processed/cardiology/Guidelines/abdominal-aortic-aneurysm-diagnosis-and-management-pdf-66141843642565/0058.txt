Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

of these aneurysms is recommended as the only approach that should be used in people for whom emergency repair is suitable until the safety and effectiveness of complex EVAR has been established in this setting. Tranexamic acid No evidence on the use of tranexamic acid in people with a ruptured AAA was identified. The committee was aware that tranexamic acid is included in some major haemorrhage protocols and some patients, without major trauma, may receive it before undergoing surgery. In the committee's experience, tranexamic acid is not routinely used in people with a ruptured AAA, so it agreed to recommend research on tranexamic acid for preventing and treating excessive blood loss during EVAR or open surgical repair. Goal-directed therapy There was no evidence on goal-directed therapy for people having repair of a ruptured aneurysm. Goal-directed therapy covers a broad range of different haemodynamic monitoring and management practices; some of which are routinely performed during major surgery. The committee recognised that it was not possible to specify which practices should or should not be performed and agreed that drafting recommendations would be too prescriptive. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations will have little impact on current practice, as both
