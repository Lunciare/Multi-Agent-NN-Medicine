Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

produce no long-term benefit over open surgical repair in people with an unruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, it is less clear whether this is the same in people with who would need complex EVAR to repair their AAA. The committee's view was that, because current practice is subject to strong prior beliefs about the relative benefits and harms of EVAR and open surgical repair for complex AAA, randomisation is critical to provide an unbiased estimate of comparative effectiveness. 3 Macrolides for slowing aneurysm growth and reducing the risk of rupture What are the benefits and harms of macrolides (such as azithromycin) for reducing AAA growth rates and the risk of rupture? Why this is important Small AAAs are currently managed by monitoring, until the aneurysm reaches a diameter at which surgical repair is considered. There are currently no non-surgical interventions available to prevent AAAs from growing, and subsequently rupturing. A randomised controlled trial would be useful to determine whether macrolides reduce the rate of AAA growth and the risk of rupture. 4 Metformin for slowing aneurysm growth and reducing the risk of rupture What are the benefits and harms of metformin for reducing AAA growth rates and the risk of
