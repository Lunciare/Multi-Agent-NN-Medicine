reduce the risk of problems from cardiovascular disease is already current practice. In addition, beta blockers and routine ischaemic preconditioning are not currently in routine use before AAA repair, so these recommendations should have a minimal impact on practice. Return to recommendations Repairing unruptured aneurysms Why NICE made the recommendations Recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.7 When to consider repair A number of factors should be considered before treating asymptomatic aneurysms, one of which is size. It is standard practice to repair large aneurysms (over 5.5 cm in diameter on ultrasound, measured using an anterior-posterior diameter inner-to-inner), and to monitor smaller aneurysms (less than 4 cm in diameter) until they become larger. Repair is sometimes offered for aneurysms below 5.5 cm if they are growing rapidly, or if they are symptomatic. However, data from the NHS screening programme show that, for aneurysms below 5.5 cm, the risk of rupture remains very low (0.4% per year). It is clear from the evidence that there is no benefit to repairing aneurysms that are below 5.5 cm, asymptomatic and not growing rapidly. Based on this evidence, we highlighted factors that would help healthcare professionals decide when to repair aneurysms. Given the risks and other disadvantages
