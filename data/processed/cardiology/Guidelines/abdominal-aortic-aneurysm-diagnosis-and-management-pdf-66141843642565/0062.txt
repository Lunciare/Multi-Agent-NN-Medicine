Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

affect practice The recommendations will ensure that clinicians are aware of abdominal compartment syndrome in people who have undergone repair of ruptured AAA. This may result in better postoperative assessment and management. Return to recommendations Monitoring for complications after endovascular aneurysm repair Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.5 Imaging surveillance is needed after EVAR, because there is a risk that people will develop complications from the procedure or need another operation. These risks are lower after open surgical repair, so surveillance is not standard practice and in this case the committee did not recommend it. The committee noted that the frequency of EVAR surveillance is highly variable in practice. In the absence of evidence on how often imaging should be done, the committee agreed a recommendation to tailor surveillance to the perceived risk of complications. This should focus attention and resources on the people at greatest risk, and help to identify complications earlier. In practice, identifying complications after EVAR usually involves sequential imaging, with ultrasound frequently used as the first-line test and other imaging modalities used to detect specific complications. Imaging modalities may be complimentary, and the clinical significance of some imaging findings remains unclear, which
