1.8.1 Consider open, endovascular or percutaneous intervention for type 1 and type 3 endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). 1.8.2 Consider intervention for type 2 endoleaks in people who have abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion following EVAR. 1.8.3 Consider further investigation of type 5 endoleaks following EVAR. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on managing endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review X: managing complications after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Terms used in this guideline This section defines terms that have been used in a specific way for this guideline. For general definitions, please see the NICE glossary. Standard and complex EVAR Standard EVAR is defined as any EVAR procedure: • using a standard infrarenal device (an unmodified off-the-shelf stent graft) and • following the manufacturer's 'instructions for use' for the device used and • without any adjunctive procedures (planned use of endo-anchors and planned permanent instrumentation of aortic branch vessels, such as 'chimney' or 'snorkel' procedures).
