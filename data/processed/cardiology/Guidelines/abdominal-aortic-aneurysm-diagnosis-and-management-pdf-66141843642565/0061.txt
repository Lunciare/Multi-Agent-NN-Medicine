practice for open surgical repair, so did not make a recommendation on this. The committee made a recommendation on the use of local infiltrative anaesthesia alone in people having EVAR for ruptured AAA because it was considered that increased awareness of this option was needed. How the recommendation might affect practice The committee agreed that the potential impact of this recommendation on practice is unclear, because it is difficult to predict the proportion of people for whom EVAR under local infiltrative anaesthesia might be an option. The main aim of this recommendation is to raise awareness of this option. Return to recommendation Abdominal compartment syndrome Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 There was no evidence relating to preventing or managing abdominal compartment syndrome in people who are having AAA repair. The committee agreed it was important to raise awareness of this potentially life-threatening condition, and made recommendations to highlight that it can occur after both endovascular aneurysm repair and open surgical repair. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations will ensure that clinicians are aware of abdominal compartment syndrome in people who have undergone repair of ruptured AAA. This may result in better postoperative assessment
