Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

practice The recommendation will reduce the likelihood of inappropriate fluid administration during transfer of people with ruptured AAA. This, in turn, will improve the outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair and open surgical repair procedures. The recommendation is in line with NICE recommendations on fluid administration for other major trauma, and the committee agreed that this was appropriate for ruptured AAA. Return to recommendation Predicting surgical outcomes in unruptured aneurysms Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.4.1 and 1.4.3 There was limited evidence that cardiopulmonary exercise testing can help predict outcomes following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair. While the evidence was limited, the committee agreed that cardiopulmonary exercise testing could have a useful role in shared decision-making between healthcare professionals and patients when the benefits and harms of surgery are uncertain. There are other tests for assessing people before surgery, but there was no evidence available for them. One study found that higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with improved outcomes after elective EVAR, but it did not give clear eGFR thresholds that could be used in decision-making. In the absence of evidence, the committee referred to the NICE guideline on routine preoperative tests for
