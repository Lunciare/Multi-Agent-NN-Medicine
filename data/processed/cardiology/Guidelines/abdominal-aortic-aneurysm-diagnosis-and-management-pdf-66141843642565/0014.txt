people having AAA repair. 1.4.8 Do not offer remote ischaemic preconditioning to people having AAA repair. 1.4.9 For guidance on preventing and treating surgical site infections and on preventing venous thromboembolism, see the NICE guidelines on surgical site infections and reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on improving surgical outcomes. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review J: pre- and postoperative interventions to optimise outcomes after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. 1.5 Repairing unruptured aneurysms When to consider repair 1.5.1 Consider aneurysm repair for people with an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), if it is: • symptomatic • asymptomatic, larger than 4.0 cm and has grown by more than 1 cm in 1 year (measured inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter on ultrasound) • asymptomatic and 5.5 cm or larger (measured inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter on ultrasound). Discussing the benefits and risks of repair or conservative management 1.5.2 When discussing aneurysm repair with people who have an unruptured AAA, explain the overall balance of benefits and risks with repair and with conservative
