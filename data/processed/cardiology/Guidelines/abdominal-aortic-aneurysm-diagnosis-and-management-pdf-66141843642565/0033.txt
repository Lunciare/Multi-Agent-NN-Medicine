Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

ultrasound, and the committee agreed this would be the most appropriate measurement on which to base practice across the whole NHS. The committee recommended thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography for imaging in people being evaluated for elective repair, because it is widely recognised as the gold standard technique for assessing aneurysm anatomy before repair. For suspected ruptured AAAs, CT angiography should also be considered. However, the committee recognised that some people will need immediate transfer for repair without waiting for a CT scan. No evidence was found demonstrating whether or not post-processing techniques affected postoperative outcomes for people having elective or emergency AAA repair. As post-processing techniques are an established part of clinical practice, the committee agreed not to make recommendations in this area. How the recommendations might affect practice Implementing a consistent measurement method to be used across the NHS (and that matches the method used in the NHS AAA screening programme) will improve the reproducibility of results, improving surveillance for individuals with AAA and the ability to analyse data at the population level. Thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography is widely used for imaging in people being evaluated for AAA repair, so this recommendation is unlikely to make a
