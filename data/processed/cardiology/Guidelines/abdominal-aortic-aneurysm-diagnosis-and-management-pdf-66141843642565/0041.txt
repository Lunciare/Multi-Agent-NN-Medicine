it did not give clear eGFR thresholds that could be used in decision-making. In the absence of evidence, the committee referred to the NICE guideline on routine preoperative tests for elective surgery. Some of the studies reviewed for that guideline focused on people having elective AAA repair. The evidence highlighted that none of the risk assessment tools had a high enough predictive accuracy at predicting postoperative outcomes. The specific tools listed are the ones for which evidence was available. This evidence led the committee to conclude that these tools would not improve decision-making and could potentially lead to inappropriate decisions about patient management. They agreed that this could lead to harm, and therefore advised that risk assessment tools should not be used. How the recommendations might affect practice The use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing will have limited impact on practice as it is only recommended in situations where it will help in shared decision-making. Risk assessment tools are not widely used outside the context of research on AAA. Therefore, the recommendations will have little impact on practice.
