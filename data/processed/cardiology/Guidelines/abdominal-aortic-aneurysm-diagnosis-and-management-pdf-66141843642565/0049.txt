repair is attempted has to be balanced against: • the perioperative risks and long-term complications of complex EVAR • the uncertainty around whether they will benefit from complex EVAR • the large costs of complex EVAR. With all this in mind, it is clear that conservative management is a better option than complex EVAR for many people. However, NICE also acknowledged stakeholder comments highlighting the importance of individualised care. For some people, complex EVAR may be appropriate. Clinicians should discuss the risks of complex EVAR and conservative management with people with AAAs, taking into account the uncertainty that complex EVAR will provide a benefit. As with standard EVAR, NICE acknowledged that in the face of the evidence reviewed, practice needs to be rebalanced towards open surgical repair in this scenario as well. But, because of the limited evidence for complex EVAR and the importance of individualised care, NICE concluded that it is important for clinicians and people with AAA to discuss the uncertainties and weigh up the risks and benefits of repair, in order to make an informed decision. More evidence on this procedure would be helpful, and NICE has made a recommendation for research comparing complex EVAR with open
