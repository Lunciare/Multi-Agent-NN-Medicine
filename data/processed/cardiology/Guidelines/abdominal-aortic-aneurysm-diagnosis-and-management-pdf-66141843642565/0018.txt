made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on repairing unruptured aneurysms. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in: • evidence review F: thresholds for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair • evidence review K: effectiveness of endovascular aneurysm repair, open surgical repair and non-surgical management of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms • evidence review K2: observational evidence on the effectiveness of endovascular aneurysm repair compared with open surgical repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Anaesthesia and analgesia 1.5.8 Consider epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia for people having open surgical repair of an unruptured AAA. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on anaesthesia and analgesia during unruptured aneurysm repair. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review L: anaesthesia and analgesia for people having surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 1.6 Repairing ruptured aneurysms 1.6.1 Consider endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair for people with a ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Be aware that: • EVAR provides more benefit than open surgical repair for
