Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

to consider. It is important to establish how often aneurysms should be monitored to keep the risk of rupture as low as possible while making the best use of NHS resources. The optimal threshold for repair of an AAA is not clear. There is good evidence that in most cases people do not need repair for aneurysms measuring smaller than 5.5 cm (inner-to- inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter) on ultrasound. However, for some people a threshold above 5.5 cm may be more appropriate. 2 Effectiveness of endovascular aneurysm repair and open surgical repair of complex unruptured and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms What is the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of complex endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) versus open surgical repair in people for whom open surgical repair is suitable for: • elective repair of an unruptured AAA or • emergency repair of a ruptured AAA? Why this is important EVAR is a widely performed non-invasive alternative to open surgical repair. However, it is more expensive. Although standard EVAR has been shown to produce no long-term benefit over open surgical repair in people with an unruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, it is less clear whether this is the same in people with who
