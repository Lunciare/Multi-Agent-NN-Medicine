Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

symptomatic unruptured aneurysms before arrival at the hospital, and in non-specialist hospital settings. Imaging technique 1.1.10 When measuring aortic size with ultrasound, report the inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter, in accordance with the NHS AAA screening programme. Clearly document any additional measurements taken. 1.1.11 Offer thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography to people who are being evaluated for elective AAA repair. 1.1.12 Consider thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography for people with a suspected ruptured AAA who are being evaluated for AAA repair. For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on imaging technique. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: imaging techniques to diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. Providing information to people with a diagnosed AAA 1.1.13 Give people with AAA of any size information explaining: • what an AAA is • that most AAAs do not cause any problems • that AAAs can rupture, and what this means • that AAAs are likely to get larger over time, and that larger AAAs are more likely to rupture • that AAA may run in families, so they should tell close
