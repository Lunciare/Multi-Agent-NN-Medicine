repair or conservative management 1.5.3 Offer open surgical repair for people with unruptured AAAs meeting the criteria in recommendation 1.5.1, unless it is contraindicated because of their abdominal copathology, anaesthetic risks, and/or medical comorbidities. 1.5.4 Consider endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for people with unruptured AAAs who meet the criteria in recommendation 1.5.1 and who have abdominal copathology, such as a hostile abdomen, horseshoe kidney or a stoma, or other considerations, specific to and discussed with the person, that may make EVAR the preferred option. 1.5.5 Consider EVAR or conservative management for people with unruptured AAAs meeting the criteria in recommendation 1.5.1 who have anaesthetic risks and/or medical comorbidities that would contraindicate open surgical repair. Complex endovascular aneurysm repair 1.5.6 If open surgical repair and complex EVAR are both suitable options, only consider complex EVAR if: • the following has been discussed with the person: － the risks of complex EVAR compared with the risks of open surgical repair － the uncertainties around whether complex EVAR improves perioperative survival or long-term outcomes, when compared with open surgical repair • it will be performed with special arrangements for consent and for audit and research that will determine the clinical and cost effectiveness
