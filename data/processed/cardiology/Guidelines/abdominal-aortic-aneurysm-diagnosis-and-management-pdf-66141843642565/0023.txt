Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

endo-anchors and planned permanent instrumentation of aortic branch vessels, such as 'chimney' or 'snorkel' procedures). Any EVAR procedure that does not fit into the definition above is classed as 'complex EVAR'. Complex EVAR also covers fenestrated, branched, customised or internal iliac branch devices, and physician-modified stent grafts. Endoleak The persistence of blood flow outside an endovascular stent–graft but within the aneurysm sac in which the graft is placed. There are 5 types of endoleak: • Type 1 – blood flowing into the aneurysm because of an incomplete or ineffective seal at either end of a stent–graft • Type 2 – blood flowing into an AAA from side branches of the aorta • Type 3 – blood flowing into an AAA through defects in the endograft • Type 4 – blood flowing through the stent–graft fabric into an AAA • Type 5 – continued AAA expansion without radiographic evidence of a leak site. Hostile abdomen An abdomen that is difficult to perform open surgery within, because of adverse anatomical features. For AAA repair, these features can include large abdominal wall defects or intra-abdominal adhesions. A hostile abdomen is most common in people who have had multiple previous episodes of intra-abdominal open
