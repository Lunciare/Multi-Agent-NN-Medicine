There is a small group of people who have abdominal copathology or other considerations that mean open surgical repair is unsuitable. Examples of copathologies include people who have internal scar-tissue from previous abdominal surgery (a so-called hostile abdomen), people who have a single, fused kidney that is wrapped around the aorta ('horseshoe kidney'), and people who have a stoma. Although there was no evidence on this population, EVAR is a potential option for these people, as the risks of open surgical repair may be much higher for them. This recommendation should not be used to extend EVAR to people who could reasonably have open surgical repair. Open surgical repair is contraindicated for some people with an unruptured AAA because of anaesthetic risks and/or medical comorbidities. For these people, the risk of their AAA rupturing if no repair is attempted has to be balanced against: • the perioperative risks and long-term complications of EVAR • the uncertainty around whether they will benefit from EVAR • the large costs of EVAR. With all this in mind, it is
