discussion are in evidence review O: signs, symptoms and risk factors indicating suitability for transfer to a regional vascular service and evidence review P: time period for transfer to regional vascular services. Supporting people during transfer 1.3.6 Consider a restrictive approach to volume resuscitation (permissive hypotension) for people with a suspected ruptured or symptomatic AAA during emergency transfer to a regional vascular service. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on supporting people during transfer. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review Q: permissive hypotension during transfer of people with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm to regional vascular services. 1.4 Predicting and improving surgical outcomes Predicting surgical outcomes for unruptured aneurysms 1.4.1 Consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing when assessing people for elective repair of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), if it will assist in shared decision making. 1.4.2 For guidance on other preoperative tests, see the NICE guideline on routine preoperative tests for elective surgery. 1.4.3 Do not use the following risk assessment tools to determine whether or not repair is suitable for a person with an asymptomatic unruptured
