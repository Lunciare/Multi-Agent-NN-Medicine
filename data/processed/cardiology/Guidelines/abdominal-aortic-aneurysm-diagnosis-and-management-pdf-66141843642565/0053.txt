greater benefit than EVAR for a lower cost even with a substantial increase in waiting times for open surgical repair. • The possibility that reducing the number of EVAR procedures performed for unruptured aneurysms will make it difficult to provide EVAR for ruptured aneurysms: There are a number of ways this implementation issue might be addressed: － vascular services could be centralised further (for example by establishing aortic units) － in line with the recommendations, EVAR can be offered in certain situations. Goal-directed therapy The evidence did not show any benefit from goal-directed therapy for people having repair of an unruptured AAA. Goal-directed therapy covers a broad range of different haemodynamic monitoring and management practices, some of which are routinely performed during major surgery. The committee recognised that it was not possible to specify which practices should or should not be performed and agreed that drafting recommendations would be too prescriptive. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendation on when to repair unruptured aneurysms is unlikely to impact on current clinical practice because it reflects what is already being done within the NHS. Data from the NHS AAA screening programme indicate that the risk of rupture for AAAs that
