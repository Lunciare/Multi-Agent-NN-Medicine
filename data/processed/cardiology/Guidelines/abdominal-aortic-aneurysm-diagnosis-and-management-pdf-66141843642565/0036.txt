Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

As a result, the committee referred to the NICE guidelines on these topics. The committee agreed that there was not enough high-quality evidence to make clinical recommendations on non-surgical interventions for slowing aneurysm growth and reducing the risk of rupture. In light of this, they made recommendations for research on 2 drug interventions that might reduce aneurysm growth and rupture risk. How the recommendations might affect practice The NICE guidelines on hypertension and stop smoking services cover current practice, so organisations are unlikely to need to change practice. Non-surgical interventions for small AAAs are not usually used outside of clinical trials, so a lack of recommendations will have little impact on practice. Return to recommendations Monitoring the risk of rupture Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 The committee recommended ultrasound surveillance because ultrasound is current practice and no evidence was found for other imaging techniques. They recommended that monitoring frequency should be in line with the NHS AAA screening programme to ensure consistency across the whole NHS. The screening programme surveillance intervals are based on evidence on
