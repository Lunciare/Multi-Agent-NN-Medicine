used as the first-line test and other imaging modalities used to detect specific complications. Imaging modalities may be complimentary, and the clinical significance of some imaging findings remains unclear, which makes identifying a true reference standard difficult. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography was widely used as a gold standard in the evidence that was reviewed. However, this has led to some abnormalities that are detected on other imaging modalities, but not on CT, being defined as false positives (for that modality, rather than as false negatives for CT). This may have introduced bias, and makes it difficult to rely on CT as a reference standard. The evidence showed that colour duplex ultrasound was highly accurate at identifying changes in sac size when compared with contrast-enhanced CT angiography. Increases in sac size are often believed to indicate an endoleak even if no leak can be seen on the ultrasound. There was little evidence on graft kinking, but the committee agreed based on their experience that colour duplex ultrasound and CT angiography were equally as effective at detecting this type of complication. In the evidence reviewed, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was the only imaging technique that had acceptable accuracy for directly identifying endoleaks when compared with
