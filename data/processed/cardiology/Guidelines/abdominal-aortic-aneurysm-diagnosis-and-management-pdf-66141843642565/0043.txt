recommendation on cardiovascular disease because it is common in people with AAA and it is best practice to reduce the risk of problems in people who have it. The other NICE guidelines that are referenced include recommendations to help reduce this risk. The evidence showed that giving beta blockers just before surgery is not beneficial, and may be harmful by lowering low blood pressure and heart rate. The committee noted that some people with AAA may need to take beta blockers for other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation). As a result, they recommended against routine use before AAA repair, rather than recommending against beta blockers altogether. Remote ischaemic preconditioning was not recommended because there was evidence that it does not improve outcomes and that it can cause problems such as an irregular heartbeat. The committee recommended further research because there was not enough evidence to make recommendations on prehabilitation (including exercise programmes before surgery), or on any interventions after AAA repair. How the recommendations might affect practice Providing support to reduce the risk of problems from cardiovascular disease is already current practice. In addition, beta blockers and routine ischaemic preconditioning are not currently in routine use before AAA repair, so
