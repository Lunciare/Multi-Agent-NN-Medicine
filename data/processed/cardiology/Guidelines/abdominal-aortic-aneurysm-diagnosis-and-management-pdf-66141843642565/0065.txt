on the operator, so its accuracy may be variable in practice. This variability in diagnostic accuracy, and resultant potential for harm if an endoleak is missed, led the committee to recommend that colour duplex ultrasound alone should not be used to confirm or exclude the presence of endoleaks. How the recommendations might affect practice There is variation in which imaging techniques are used for surveillance. Some centres use ultrasound only, and some use contrast-enhanced CT angiography and ultrasound. Colour duplex ultrasound is widely used, but contrast-enhanced ultrasound is not. These recommendations are not likely to alter surveillance regimens substantially because many centres use imaging tests in a complementary fashion, often relying on sac size as a trigger for further investigation if necessary. Sonographers will need training in administering contrast agents if contrast-enhanced ultrasound is to be more widely adopted. Return to recommendations Managing endoleaks after endovascular aneurysm repair Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.3 Endoleaks following EVAR are common. They can have a negative impact on patient prognosis and long-term quality of life, and further interventions are frequently needed to repair them. In the absence of evidence, the committee made recommendations based on their experience because:
