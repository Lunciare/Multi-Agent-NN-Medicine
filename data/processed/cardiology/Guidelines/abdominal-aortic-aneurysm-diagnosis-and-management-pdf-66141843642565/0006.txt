For example: • Small AAAs only have a very low chance of rupture and there are risks to aneurysm repair, so in this case people do not benefit from repair. • AAA growth is unpredictable, so until their AAA meets the criteria in recommendation 1.5.1 it is not possible to know whether repair will be suitable for a particular person. • On
