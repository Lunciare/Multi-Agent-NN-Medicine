of repair, in order to make an informed decision. More evidence on this procedure would be helpful, and NICE has made a recommendation for research comparing complex EVAR with open surgical repair. EVAR and complex EVAR for specific subgroups of people For each of the recommendations, NICE considered whether there were any specific groups that would benefit from standard or complex EVAR for unruptured AAAs. We explored groups defined by age, sex, AAA diameter and life expectancy, but it was not possible with the current evidence to identify any specific groups in which the benefits would outweigh the harm and costs. Other evidence sources The key randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this area are relatively old. NICE looked at more recent observational evidence, to see if changes in surgical and endovascular techniques and technology have led to different outcomes. The observational studies are at high risk of bias, but their findings are broadly in line with the RCTs. They show that, while outcomes from EVAR have improved over the last 15 years, outcomes from open surgical repair have also improved by roughly the same amount. This means the difference in outcomes between the two has remained fairly constant. Registries like
