Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

overall impact of the recommendation is likely to be small, although it may reduce existing variation. Return to recommendation Repairing ruptured aneurysms Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.3 Which technique to use The evidence showed that, compared with open surgical repair, a strategy that uses EVAR (where anatomically possible) to repair ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm provides a reasonable balance of benefits and costs. As the average cost-effectiveness results for EVAR were favourable, the committee discussed whether they should recommend EVAR whenever it is possible. They decided not to, for 2 reasons. Firstly, there is uncertainty in the evidence for EVAR from the IMPROVE trial. People who had EVAR for a ruptured AAA in this trial were followed up for at most 7 years. People who had EVAR for an unruptured AAA in the EVAR-1 trial were followed up for 15 years, and the committee noted that these data indicate that EVAR leads to increasingly worse survival when compared with open surgical repair, because follow-up duration increases (see why NICE made the recommendations on repairing unruptured aneurysms). The medium-term survival data from the IMPROVE trial give some indication that a similar long-term pattern may develop in
