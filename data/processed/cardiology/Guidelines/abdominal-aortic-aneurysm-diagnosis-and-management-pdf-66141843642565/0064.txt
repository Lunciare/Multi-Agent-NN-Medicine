as effective at detecting this type of complication. In the evidence reviewed, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was the only imaging technique that had acceptable accuracy for directly identifying endoleaks when compared with contrast-enhanced CT angiography. Importantly, other imaging techniques had unacceptably high rates of false-negative results. For this reason, the committee agreed that in situations where the definitive exclusion (or identification) of endoleak is important (for example where endoleak is suspected) either contrast-enhanced CT angiography or contrast-enhanced ultrasound should be used. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was not recommended for assessing other complications because the evidence for its use only covered endoleaks. The committee agreed that it is particularly important not to falsely exclude an endoleak, so the sensitivity of a diagnostic test is more important than its specificity. While colour duplex ultrasound is highly accurate at identifying changes in sac size (which may indicate an endoleak), the available evidence shows that it has suboptimal sensitivity for directly detecting type I and III endoleaks. In addition, the accuracy of ultrasound was shown to be dependent on the operator, so its accuracy may be variable in practice. This variability in diagnostic accuracy, and resultant potential for harm if an endoleak is missed, led the committee to
