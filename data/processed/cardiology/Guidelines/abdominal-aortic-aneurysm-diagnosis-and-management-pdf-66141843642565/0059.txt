Abdominal aortic aneurysm: diagnosis and management

should not be performed and agreed that drafting recommendations would be too prescriptive. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations will have little impact on current practice, as both standard EVAR and open surgical repair are currently offered to people with ruptured infrarenal AAAs. In relation to complex EVAR, the recommendation not to use it outside of RCTs will limit the use of a technically complex and expensive procedure in people for whom open surgery is a safe and suitable option. Because the guideline recommends that fewer EVAR procedures should be performed for unruptured aneurysms (see the section on repairing unruptured aneurysms), surgical teams may have less opportunity to develop the skills they need to provide EVAR in emergency cases. The committee were mindful of this issue, but were convinced by the evidence showing that, overall, people with AAAs would be worse off if EVAR procedures were performed for unruptured aneurysms just to maintain EVAR expertise. Elective EVAR will still be available in certain circumstances and centralisation of aortic services may maintain expertise. However, neither training nor service models were in the scope of this guideline, so the committee did not review any evidence and were unable to make
