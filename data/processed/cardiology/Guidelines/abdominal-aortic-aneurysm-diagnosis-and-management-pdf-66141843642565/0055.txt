Recommendation 1.5.8 The committee noted that there was some evidence that adding an epidural to general anaesthesia reduced the need for further analgesia for people having open surgical repair of an unruptured AAA. This was consistent with their own clinical experience of better pain control and reduced postoperative respiratory complications with an epidural. Adding an epidural is fairly widespread in current practice, and the committee agreed that it should be recommended as an option. No evidence was found on anaesthesia and analgesia for people undergoing EVAR for unruptured AAA. The committee agreed that no recommendations were needed in this area because they had recommended that EVAR should not be used to treat unruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, except in clinical trials or for people for whom open surgical repair is unsuitable because of abdominal copathology. How the recommendations might affect practice The use of an epidural in addition to general anaesthesia for people having open surgical repair of an unruptured AAA is already fairly widespread in current practice. Therefore the overall impact of the recommendation is likely to be small, although it may reduce existing variation.
