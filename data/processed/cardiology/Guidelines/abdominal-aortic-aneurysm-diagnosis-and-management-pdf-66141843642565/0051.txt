15 years, outcomes from open surgical repair have also improved by roughly the same amount. This means the difference in outcomes between the two has remained fairly constant. Registries like the National Vascular Registry can provide a useful snapshot of current practice, and the analyses that informed NICE's decision-making made use of data from them. However, they are not designed to evaluate the comparative benefits and harms of different surgical approaches, such as EVAR and open surgical repair. Therefore, they cannot be considered a reasonable alternative to RCT data. In addition, an analysis using the registry data showed that EVAR still did not provide greater long-term benefits than open surgical repair, and that it still has higher net costs. Implementation challenges NICE acknowledged the need to rebalance practice towards open repair and identified the possible implementation challenges. • Possible increased perioperative mortality with open surgical repair: Improvements in practice since the RCTs were published have led to better standards for open surgical repair and EVAR alike. In addition, the NHS AAA screening programme means that AAAs are more likely to be diagnosed earlier than in the past, so people can have repair when they are younger and healthier. For these
