detect AAAs is good practice. The recommendations ensure that the time within which people with newly-identified aneurysms are seen by regional vascular services is proportional to the risk of rupture. These timings match the timeframe the NHS AAA screening programme uses for people they assess. Return to recommendations Identifying symptomatic or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.1.7 to 1.1.9 Based on their own experience, the committee highlighted the most important signs and symptoms of ruptured AAAs, because: • non-specialists commonly fail to diagnose them • improved diagnosis should increase the chance of survival • urgent discussion of a suspected ruptured AAA with a regional vascular service will improve the chances of appropriate treatment and survival. Aortic ultrasound is the standard technique for detecting the presence of AAA in a person with a suspected ruptured aneurysm. A ruptured AAA is a surgical emergency, and bedside ultrasound is the quickest reliable method to confirm the presence of an AAA. An immediate discussion with the regional vascular unit ensures appropriate management is started as soon as possible. The committee recognised that the sensitivity of aortic ultrasound is not 100% and several factors can make it difficult to
