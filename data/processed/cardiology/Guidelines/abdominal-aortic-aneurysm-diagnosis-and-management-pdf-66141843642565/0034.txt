The recommended timings reflect current standards within the NHS AAA screening programme. As post-processing techniques are established in practice, a lack of recommendations on these will not have an impact. Return to recommendations Providing information to people with a diagnosed AAA Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.1.13 to 1.1.15 The committee agreed some consensus recommendations on what information should be provided to people who have been diagnosed with an AAA. In particular, the recommendations cover information for people who are not being considered for repair, either because their AAA is too small (data from the NHS screening programme show that the risk of rupture for an AAA below 5.5 cm is only 0.4% per year) or because their medical comorbidities mean the risks of repair outweigh the benefits. It is important to avoid making people anxious about not being offered repair, but also to avoid giving the impression that AAA repair is always beneficial if the aneurysm meets the criteria for treatment (see
