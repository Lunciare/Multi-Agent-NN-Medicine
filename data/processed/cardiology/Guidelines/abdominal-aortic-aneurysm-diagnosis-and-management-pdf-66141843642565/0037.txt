This means that people with larger aneurysms are monitored more frequently, offering the best balance between benefits and costs. The committee are aware that the NHS AAA screening programme may change the surveillance intervals it uses in the future. If this happens, the committee agreed that regional vascular services should change to match the new intervals, to ensure that they continue to provide care based on best practice. How the recommendations might affect practice Changing monitoring intervals to reflect those used in the NHS AAA screening programme will maintain a consistent standard across the NHS, and ensure that the most effective imaging intervals are used. Return to recommendations Emergency transfer to regional vascular services Why the committee made the recommendations Recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.5 There was no evidence on symptoms, signs or risk assessment tools for deciding whether people with ruptured aneurysms are likely to survive transfer to a regional vascular service. Based on their own experience, the committee highlighted
