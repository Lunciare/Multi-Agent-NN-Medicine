HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

no clinical follow-up. The primary outcome was the per-segment correlation between FFR and invasive FFR values, expressed as translesional CT delta (the difference between the proximal and distal FFR measurement of all sequential lesions). Values of translesional delta for FFR and FFR were 0.10 plus CT or minus 0.09 and 0.09 plus or minus 0.10 in distal segments, and 0.17 plus or minus 0.10 and 0.22 plus or minus 0.13 in proximal segments respectively. The coefficient of correlation between translesional delta FFR and FFR in each CT segment was 0.92 (p<0.001). The authors concluded that translesional delta FFR is highly correlated with FFR . CT 3.16 Thompson et al. (2015) investigated the diagnostic performance of FFR in CT relation to patients' sex and age, using invasive FFR measurements as the reference standard for a subgroup of the DeFACTO study. Previous evidence from DeFACTO was not considered eligible because it included patients with a high pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (Min et al. 2012). Thompson et al. (2015) was included because it reports results based on subgroup analyses for age and sex. The baseline pre-test likelihood did not differ in statistical significance within these subgroups, so it is not expected
