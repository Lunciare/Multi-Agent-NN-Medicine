HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

50% by core laboratory quantitative analysis or invasive FFR less than 0.80) was found at ICA within 90 days. Secondary end points included a composite measure of major adverse cardiac events consisting of death, myocardial infarction and unplanned revascularisation, all of which were independently and blindly assessed. Among patients with intended ICA (CCTA/FFR =193; functional CT imaging=187), no obstructive coronary artery disease was found with ICA in 24 patients (12%) in the CCTA/FFR arm and 137 patients (73%) in the functional CT imaging arm (risk difference 61%, 95% CI 53 to 69, p<0.0001). Among patients intended for non-invasive testing, the rates of finding no obstructive coronary artery disease with ICA were 13% in the CCTA/FFR arm and 6% in the functional CT imaging arm (p=0.95). ICA was cancelled in 61% of patients after reviewing the CCTA/FFR results. There were low numbers of MACE and vascular CT complications in all groups. 3.19 Douglas et al. (2016) report outcomes from the same study at 1 year. The clinical end points measured were MACE and MACE plus vascular events within 14 days of procedure. Quality of life and resource use outcomes were also collected. There were 2 MACE events in each arm of
