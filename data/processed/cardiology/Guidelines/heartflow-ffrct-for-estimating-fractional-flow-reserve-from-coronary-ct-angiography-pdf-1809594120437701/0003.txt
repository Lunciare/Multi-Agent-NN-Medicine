HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

adoption presented by CT the company were as follows: • Analysis is done using standard CCTA scans, without the need for additional imaging, radiation or medication. • It provides the same accuracy in excluding coronary artery disease as CCTA, and characterises the coronary arteries from both functional and anatomical perspectives, differentiating between ischaemic and non-ischaemic vessels in a way that CCTA cannot. • It allows physicians to evaluate anatomical coronary artery disease and accurately determine which coronary lesions are responsible for myocardial ischaemia, avoiding unnecessary invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and related complications. • It reduces the need for revascularisation in patients after identifying anatomical stenosis by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) alone, by more accurately identifying if those stenoses are ischaemic. • It improves the diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease compared with CCTA alone against the gold standard of invasive FFR, and provides both functional and anatomical assessment of coronary arteries. • It has better diagnostic performance than CCTA alone, or other non-invasive or invasive tests (such as nuclear myocardial perfusion, magnetic resonance perfusion, stress echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, invasive angiography or intravascular ultrasound) for detecting and excluding coronary artery lesions that cause ischaemia. • It reduces costs arising
