the company conducted a meta- analysis; for example, 3 studies were included in the meta-analysis for HeartFlow FFR (Koo et al. 2011, Min et al. 2012 and Nørgaard et al. 2014). CT The methodology and results of the meta-analyses are reported as academic in confidence. 3.3 The external assessment centre (EAC) reviewed the company's selection of studies and considered that although they addressed the scope in terms of the comparators, reference test and outcomes, most included a mixture of patients with both high (over 90%) and intermediate (10% to 90%) pre-test likelihoods of disease. It also disagreed with the company's decision only to include studies that provided FFR measurements in more than 75% of blood vessels. The EAC considered this criterion not to be reflective of clinical practice, where visual assessment is sometimes used before proceeding with FFR measurements. The EAC also noted that this criterion did not reflect the company's proposed changes to the clinical pathway, where CCTA would be used to decide if HeartFlow FFR should be used. CT 3.4 To address these concerns, the EAC conducted a diagnostic literature search using extra keywords related to comparators and outcomes. It included only studies in which most patients had
