on the 1-year economic outcomes of FFR in CT the PLATFORM study. Costs were calculated in the same manner as the 90-day results in Hlatky et al. (2015). In the planned invasive arm, the mean per-patient cost was $8,127 in FFR patients and $12,145 for usual care patients (p<0.0001). CT The cost savings at 1 year increased by 1.5% from the cost savings at 90 days. In the non-invasive arm, mean costs were not significantly different (p=0.82) between the FFR patients ($3,049) and the usual care patients ($2,579). CT Economic model 5.6 The company presented a decision-tree model based on integrating HeartFlow FFR into the existing diagnostic pathway at the time of its CT submission. A theoretical population of 1,000 patients with suspected coronary artery disease was allocated to either the current treatment pathway (based on the previous NICE guideline on chest pain) or the company's revised pathway, which included HeartFlow FFR . The cost consequences of the treatment CT pathways were compared based on the mix of diagnostic technologies used in each. The model had a 1-year time horizon, included the impact of different testing strategies, and relevant clinical outcomes. 5.7 The proportion of patients eligible for CCTA as
