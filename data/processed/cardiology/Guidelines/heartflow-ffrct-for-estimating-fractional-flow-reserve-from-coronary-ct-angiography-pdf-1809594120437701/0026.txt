HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

evidence from the PLATFORM supports the company's claim that MACE outcomes are equivalent between the current pathway and one that uses FFR , whereas the PROMISE study showed that CT MACE outcomes at 1 year were equivalent between CCTA alone and functional testing. The EAC also considered that the evidence from the PLATFORM study showed higher 1-year radiation exposure in the HeartFlow FFR group in patients CT intended for non-invasive evaluation. However, this is to be expected because many patients in the non-invasive evaluation had a non-invasive test which did not need the use of radiation. The EAC concluded that the submitted evidence on clinical outcomes supports the value proposition of an FFR -guided strategy CT compared with standard of care, mainly in patients with planned invasive investigation, with equivalent results between FFR and functional imaging in the CT non-invasive group. Committee considerations 3.23 The committee considered that the evidence showed high diagnostic accuracy and increased specificity with HeartFlow FFR compared with CCTA alone. It CT also noted promising results from the PLATFORM study, in a population which closely matches that in the scope. The evidence was sufficient to conclude that HeartFlow FFR has a high diagnostic accuracy for coronary
