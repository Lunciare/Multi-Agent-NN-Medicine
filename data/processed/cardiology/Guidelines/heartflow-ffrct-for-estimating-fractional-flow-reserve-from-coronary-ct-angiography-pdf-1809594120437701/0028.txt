HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

potential to reduce the number of tests that are done, CT the other non-invasive functional imaging tests that are part of the current patient pathway offer different functionality and in some cases provide additional information. Overall, the committee concluded that HeartFlow FFR should be CT considered for use as a non-invasive investigation for diagnosing angina in patients with stable, recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, and that it provides the clinician with additional functional information to determine which coronary lesions are responsible for myocardial ischaemia. The committee considered that further clinical studies would be helpful to clarify the wider applicability of HeartFlow FFR in routine clinical practice. CT 3.26 The committee considered the evidence from the PLATFORM study to be most relevant to the decision problem. It considered that the results demonstrate the potential of FFR to avoid ICA and improve quality of life. CT 3.27 The committee discussed the relative importance of a per-patient or a per-vessel diagnosis. It heard from experts that per-patient diagnostic accuracy was more important for initial diagnosis, and that a per-vessel assessment provides additional information to inform patient management. The committee concluded that per-patient level figures were the most reliable and relevant to
