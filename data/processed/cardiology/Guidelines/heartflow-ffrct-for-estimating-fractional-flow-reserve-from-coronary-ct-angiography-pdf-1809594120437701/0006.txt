HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

likelihood ratios, area-under curve) using invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard • rates of diagnostic coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass surgery • adverse events (test-related, major adverse cardiac events, radiation exposure and so on) • quality of life • mortality. Summary of diagnostic accuracy evidence 3.2 The company conducted a literature search on the diagnostic accuracy of FFR CT and the existing tests in the current treatment pathway for patients with a 10% to 90% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease, against a reference standard of invasive FFR testing. This review identified 5 relevant meta-analysis studies and 23 individual studies, 1 of which was unpublished. Based on the 22 published studies, and using FFR as the reference standard, the company presented diagnostic accuracy per-patient results for HeartFlow FFR compared with: CT • invasive coronary angiography (ICA) • single-photon emission CT (SPECT) • stress echocardiogram (ECHO) • magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) • coronary CT angiography (CCTA). If there were multiple studies for a test, the company conducted a meta- analysis; for example, 3 studies were included in the meta-analysis for HeartFlow FFR (Koo et al. 2011, Min et al. 2012 and Nørgaard et al.
