measured over 90 days for each patient by multiplying a standardised cost weight for each medical resource by the number of resources used by the patient. Medicare reimbursement rates (the national average of technical and professional fees in the US) from 2015 were applied because cost weights and online pharmacy costs were used for drugs. Patients were prospectively assigned to either functional imaging (usual care, n=287) or coronary CT angiography (CCTA)/HeartFlow FFR (n=297). In the planed CT invasive group, mean costs were $7,343 among the CCTA/FFR patients and CT $10,734 among functional imaging patients (p<0.0001). In the planned non- invasive group, mean costs were not significantly different (p=0.26) between the CCTA/FFR patients ($2,679) and the functional imaging patients ($2,137). CT Overall, each quality-of-life (EQ-5D) score improved at 90 days compared with baseline in the study population (p<0.0001), and scores improved more in CCTA/ FFR patients than in functional imaging patients. In the invasive group, quality- CT of-life improvements were similar in both arms. 5.5 Douglas et al. (2016) published data on the 1-year economic outcomes of FFR in CT the PLATFORM study. Costs were calculated in the same manner as the 90-day results in Hlatky et al. (2015). In the
