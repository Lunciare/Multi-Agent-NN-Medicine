for additional information on compliance with data protection legislation, and the reproducibility of HeartFlow FFR analysis, especially in the face of an increasing workload which CT might be expected to arise from adoption of the technology in the NHS. The external assessment centre (EAC) produced a technical report that concluded: • The company has a quality assurance process in place that fulfils data quality needs. This includes checks by different team members, and the separation of tasks to ensure that no single analyst is fully responsible for a diagnosis. After the procedure, a more experienced analyst reviews the process, focusing mainly on areas of stenosis. Expert clinician advice is also available should it be needed. • Although the analytical process is largely automated, any part of it can be manually changed by the analyst. This may affect the fractional flow reserve CT (FFR ) estimate. Manual editing is part of the quality assurance process, CT negating the risk of spurious results generated from the automated analysis. Gaur et al. (2014) suggest that reproducibility is within acceptable 95% confidence interval limits of agreement. FFR reproducibility was found to be CT equivalent to invasive FFR reproducibility. • The reproducibility of outlining the
