CT 3.4 To address these concerns, the EAC conducted a diagnostic literature search using extra keywords related to comparators and outcomes. It included only studies in which most patients had an intermediate pre-test likelihood of disease. The EAC identified 7 diagnostic studies, including 3 presented by the company (Bernhardt et al. 2012, Nørgaard et al. 2014 and Stuijfzand et al. 2014) and 3 that the company had identified but excluded (Danad et al. 2013, Kajander et al. 2010 and Ponte et al. 2014). Only 1 of these, Nørgaard et al. 2014, involved HeartFlow FFR . CT 3.5 Nørgaard et al. (2014) reported on a multicentre study (the NXT trial) involving 2 UK centres, which compared HeartFlow FFR (v1.4) with CCTA for diagnosing CT myocardial ischaemia in 254 patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease scheduled to have ICA. Most patients in the study (87%) were considered to have an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Invasive FFR was measured in all vessels (n=484). The study reported the diagnostic performance of HeartFlow FFR and CCTA for diagnosing ischaemia compared with FFR CT measured during ICA as the reference standard. The diagnostic accuracy of each test was presented on a per-patient and
