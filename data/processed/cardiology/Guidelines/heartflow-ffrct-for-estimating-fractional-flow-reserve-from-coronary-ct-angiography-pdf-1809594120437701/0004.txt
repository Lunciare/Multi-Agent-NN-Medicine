HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

myocardial perfusion, magnetic resonance perfusion, stress echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, invasive angiography or intravascular ultrasound) for detecting and excluding coronary artery lesions that cause ischaemia. • It reduces costs arising from inconclusive or inaccurate diagnostic tests. • It avoids staff and procedure costs for unnecessary ICAs. • It avoids staff and procedure costs for unnecessary interventions (such as angioplasty). • It provides a more effective use of high-cost invasive procedure suites, providing the opportunity to reduce waiting times for these facilities and increase patient turnaround. Current management 2.7 The NICE guideline on chest pain recommends diagnostic testing for people in whom stable angina cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone. 2.8 The guideline recommends offering 64-slice (or above) CCTA as the first-line diagnosis test when clinical assessment indicates typical or atypical angina; or non-anginal chest pain but 12-lead resting ECG has been done and indicates ST-T changes or Q waves. 2.9 Subsequent diagnostic tests can be requested dependent on the CCTA results. The guideline recommends offering non-invasive functional imaging for myocardial ischaemia if 64-slice (or above) CCTA has shown coronary artery disease of uncertain functional significance, or is non-diagnostic. Non-invasive functional imaging includes: • myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single-photon emission
