HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

with 10.1 mSv; p<0.001). 3.13 The EAC identified 9 published studies containing information on clinical outcomes in comparator diagnostic technologies. Further information about these studies can be found in the assessment report. Chest pain guideline update: second literature search 3.14 During the assessment of HeartFlow FFR for this guidance, NICE updated its CT guideline on chest pain. Because this included new recommendations for investigating chest pain, it became necessary to update the evidence and cost modelling for the HeartFlow FFR assessment. The EAC repeated the evidence CT searches up to February 2016 and asked the company to identify any recent and ongoing studies. In total, the EAC assessed 7 new studies, 6 of which included HeartFlow FFR . CT 3.15 Tanaka et al. (2016) is a technical study on a subgroup of the NXT study investigating the association between FFR and invasive FFR in coronary arteries CT with serial lesions. The authors investigated patients (n=18 patients and 18 vessels) with stable angina and clinically suspected coronary artery disease. There was no clinical follow-up. The primary outcome was the per-segment correlation between FFR and invasive FFR values, expressed as translesional CT delta (the difference between the proximal and distal FFR measurement
