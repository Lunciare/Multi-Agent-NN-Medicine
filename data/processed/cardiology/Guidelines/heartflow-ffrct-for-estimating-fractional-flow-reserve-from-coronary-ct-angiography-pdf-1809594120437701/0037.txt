HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

used in each. The model had a 1-year time horizon, included the impact of different testing strategies, and relevant clinical outcomes. 5.7 The proportion of patients eligible for CCTA as a first-line test and their probability of having coronary artery disease were taken from Rajani et al. (2015). In the model, 10% of patients were assumed to be ineligible for invasive coronary angiography (ICA), have an inconclusive CCTA result and have an uncertain single-photon emission CT (SPECT) result. 5.8 The diagnostic accuracy of HeartFlow FFR and its comparators in the CT company's model were based on per-patient level results reported in selected papers, as follows: • HeartFlow FFR : sensitivity 86%, specificity 79% (Nørgaard et al. 2014) CT • SPECT: sensitivity 76%, specificity 38% (Melikian et al. 2010) • CCTA: sensitivity 94%, specificity 48% (Meijboom et al. 2008) • ICA: sensitivity 69%, specificity 67% (Meijboom et al. 2008). The cost of HeartFlow FFR (£888) was based on the company's original list CT price. Costs for comparator tests were based on 2014/15 hospital resource group (HRG) tariffs, as follows: • SPECT: £220 (HRG code RA37Z, nuclear medicine category 3) • CCTA: £136 (HRG code RA14Z, CT scan, more than 3 areas)
