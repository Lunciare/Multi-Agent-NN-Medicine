HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

£33 based on BNF (2015) prescription costs for aspirin and clopidogrel, and used a cost of £2,865 (PCI tariff with drug costs) in its revised model. 5.15 The EAC included a cost for optimal medical therapy. It obtained expert advice that optimal medical therapy usually consists of aspirin, statins, nitrates and beta blockers. Based on this information it estimated an annual cost of £84 (aspirin, simvastatin, glyceryl trinitrate and propranolol hydrochloride) from the BNF (2015) and used it in the revised model. 5.16 Using these updated assumptions, the EAC found a base-case cost saving of £214 per patient for HeartFlow FFR compared with the current treatment CT pathway for all functional imaging tests (SPECT, MRI and ECHO). 5.17 The EAC ran a number of sensitivity analyses, varying: the price of HeartFlow FFR ; the diagnostic accuracy of the functional imaging tests, CT HeartFlow FFR , ICA and CCTA; and the proportion of uncertain CCTA and CT functional imaging tests. It also used estimates of diagnostic accuracy for CCTA and ICA from the updated NICE guideline on chest pain. In all instances, HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving.
