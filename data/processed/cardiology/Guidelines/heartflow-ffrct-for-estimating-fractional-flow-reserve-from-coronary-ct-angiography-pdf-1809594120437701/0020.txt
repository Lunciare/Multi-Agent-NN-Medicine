HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

because it reports results based on subgroup analyses for age and sex. The baseline pre-test likelihood did not differ in statistical significance within these subgroups, so it is not expected to bias the results. The authors investigated 252 patients (407 vessels) with stable angina, clinically suspected coronary artery disease and at least 1 coronary stenosis of 30% to 90%. For their analysis, the authors used a clinical rule that included all vessels of diameter more than or equal to 2 mm and assigned an FFR value of 0.90 for vessels with stenoses less than 30% and an FFR value of 0.50 for vessels with stenoses more than 90%. There was no clinical follow-up. The primary outcome was per-patient and vessel diagnostic performance of FFR . Using this clinical CT rule, diagnostic performance improved in both sexes with no statistically significant differences between them. There were no differences in the discrimination of FFR after application of the clinical use rule when stratified by CT age 65 and over or less than 65 years. The authors concluded that FFR had CT similar diagnostic accuracy and discriminatory power to FFR for ischaemia detection in men and women irrespective of age using a cut-off
