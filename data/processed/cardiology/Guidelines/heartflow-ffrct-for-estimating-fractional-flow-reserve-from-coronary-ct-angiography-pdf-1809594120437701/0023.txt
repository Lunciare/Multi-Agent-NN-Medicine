MACE and MACE plus vascular events within 14 days of procedure. Quality of life and resource use outcomes were also collected. There were 2 MACE events in each arm of the planned invasive group (risk difference -0.03 [CI -8.6 to 8.5]) and 1 in the planned non-invasive group (risk difference -1.00 [CI -12.7 to 10.7]). Cumulative 1-year radiation exposure in patients in the intended invasive evaluation cohort was similar between the usual care strategy (mean: 10.4 plus or minus 6.7 mSv) and CCTA/FFR -guided CT strategy (mean: 10.7 plus or minus 9.6 mSv; p=0.21), whereas in the non-invasive testing cohort it was higher in patients with a CCTA/FFR -guided strategy than CT usual care strategy (mean: 9.6 plus or minus 10.6 mSv compared with 6.4 plus or minus 7.6 mSv, p<0.001). Functional status and quality of life improved from baseline to 1-year follow-up in the planned non-invasive group (p<0.001 for all measures), with greater improvements on the EQ-5D in patients having CCTA/ FFR compared with patients having functional imaging (mean change: 0.12 for CT CCTA/FFR compared with 0.07 for functional imaging, p=0.02). CT 3.20 Lu et al. (2015) used a subgroup analysis of the PROMISE trial (n=181) to investigate the
