HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

It judged that the Nørgaard (2014) study had a low risk of bias for flow and timing, index and reference test. It noted that there was a risk of patient selection bias because an inclusion criterion was that patients had to have been referred for ICA, but it noted no other risks of bias or applicability concerns. Although it acknowledged that there were no studies directly comparing all the tests, it concluded that HeartFlow FFR has: CT • similar sensitivity but higher specificity compared with CCTA • higher sensitivity but lower specificity compared with ECHO • similar sensitivity but lower specificity compared with MRI • higher sensitivity and specificity compared with SPECT.
