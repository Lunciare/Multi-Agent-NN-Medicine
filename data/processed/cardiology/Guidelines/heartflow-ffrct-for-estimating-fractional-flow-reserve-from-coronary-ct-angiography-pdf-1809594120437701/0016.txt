HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

radiation dose and the secondary outcome was death or myocardial infarction estimates at 1 year after the test. Of the 4 diagnostic pathways studied, ECHO had the lowest radiation dose (5.3 mSv) but had a higher clinical event rate related to both false-positive and false-negative findings. The FFR pathway had CT lower cumulative radiation exposure (9.4 mSv) than SPECT (26.4 mSv) or CCTA (13.9 mSv) and also had the lowest clinical adverse event rate for low and intermediate-risk patients. For high-risk patients, the lowest clinical event rate was with ICA. 3.12 The PROMISE study (Douglas et al. 2015) is a US-based multicentre randomised controlled trial involving over 10,000 patients, with a median follow-up of 25 months. Although the study did not include FFR , the EAC considered it CT relevant to the decision problem because it provides further evidence on a diagnostic pathway based on CCTA. Patients with a mean pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease of 53.3% plus or minus 21.4% were randomly assigned to either CCTA or functional imaging as a first-line diagnostic test. The composite primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable angina, or major procedural complication. Secondary end points included invasive cardiac catheterisation
