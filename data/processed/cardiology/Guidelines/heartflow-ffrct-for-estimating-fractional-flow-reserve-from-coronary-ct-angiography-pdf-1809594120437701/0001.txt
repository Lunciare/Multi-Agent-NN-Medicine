Description of the technology 2.1 HeartFlow FFR (developed by HeartFlow) is coronary physiology simulation CT software used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of previously acquired computerised tomography DICOM data. The software provides a non-invasive method of estimating fractional flow reserve (FFR) using standard coronary CT angiography (CCTA) image data. FFR is the ratio between the maximum blood flow in a narrowed artery and the maximum blood flow in a normal artery. FFR is currently measured invasively using a pressure wire placed across a narrowed artery. 2.2 After a clinician decides to request a HeartFlow test, anonymised data from a CCTA scan (of at least 64 slices) are sent from the local imaging system, by secure data transfer to HeartFlow's central processing centre in the US. A case analyst employed by the company then uses the image data to create 3D computer models of the coronary arteries, incorporating coronary flow characteristics. The results are presented in a report which is sent, by secure data transfer, to the referring clinician within 48 hours. The report includes both 3D images of the coronary anatomy and calculated functional information, including the estimated FFR values (known as FFR values). Clinicians can then CT use
