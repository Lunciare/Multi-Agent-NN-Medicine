HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

risk assessment metric which estimates the 10-year risk of developing a coronary event). Ponte et al. (2014) compared the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and MRI for detecting functionally significant coronary artery disease in patients referred with suspected coronary artery disease, using ICA with FFR as the reference standard. The study included 95 patients with a 15% to 85% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. Stuijfzand et al. (2014) evaluated CCTA and transluminal attenuation gradient compared with CCTA alone for diagnosing functionally significant lesions, using invasive FFR as the reference standard. The study included 85 patients (253 vessels) with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Neglia et al. (2015) assessed the accuracy of several imaging techniques – CCTA, SPECT and ECHO – in 475 patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Danad et al. (2013) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA in 120 patients with suspected coronary artery disease who had cardiac positron emission topography (PET), CCTA and ICA. CCTA was done using a hybrid PET/CT scanner. Kajander et al. (2010) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET and CCTA in 107 patients with a history of stable chest pain and a 30% to 70% pre-test likelihood of coronary
