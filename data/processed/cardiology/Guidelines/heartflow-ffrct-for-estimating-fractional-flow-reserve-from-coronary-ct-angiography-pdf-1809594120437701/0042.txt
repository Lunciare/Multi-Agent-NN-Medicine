HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

from the updated NICE guideline on chest pain. In all instances, HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving. CT Committee considerations 5.18 The committee considered the cost modelling done by the EAC to be both appropriate and plausible. The committee heard from experts that percutaneous or surgical revascularisation is only offered to patients following ICA, and sometimes a confirmatory invasive FFR. The availability of data from HeartFlow FFR may help to plan treatment in individual vessels and patients. CT 5.19 For the guidance review, the EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs. There were no changes to the cost of the technology. The main parameter change was the cost of comparator tests. Further details of the 2021 revised model are in the cost update in the review decision. 5.20 Based on the 2021 guidance review updated cost model, the EAC found a base- case cost saving of £391 per patient for HeartFlow FFR compared with the CT current treatment pathway for all functional imaging tests (SPECT, MRI and ECHO). This cost saving will increase if the cost of HeartFlow FFR is reduced. CT 6 Conclusions 6.1 The committee concluded that the evidence suggests that HeartFlow FFR is CT safe, has high
