HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

65 years. The authors concluded that FFR had CT similar diagnostic accuracy and discriminatory power to FFR for ischaemia detection in men and women irrespective of age using a cut-off point of 65 years. 3.17 The other 4 studies on HeartFlow FFR looked at clinical outcomes. The CT PLATFORM study (Douglas et al. 2015b and 2016) was presented to the committee as academic in confidence in June 2015 (Douglas et al. 2015a). The study included 584 patients recruited at 11 international centres. They were prospectively assigned to have either functional imaging (n=287) or CCTA/FFR CT (n=297). Each cohort was subdivided into 2 groups based on the evaluation plan decided before enrolment in the study: non-invasive testing (any form of stress testing or CCTA without FFR ) or ICA (invasive testing). CT 3.18 Douglas et al. (2015b) report the study results at 3-month follow-up. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with planned ICA in whom no significant obstructive coronary artery disease (no stenosis more than or equal to 50% by core laboratory quantitative analysis or invasive FFR less than 0.80) was found at ICA within 90 days. Secondary end points included a composite measure of major adverse cardiac
