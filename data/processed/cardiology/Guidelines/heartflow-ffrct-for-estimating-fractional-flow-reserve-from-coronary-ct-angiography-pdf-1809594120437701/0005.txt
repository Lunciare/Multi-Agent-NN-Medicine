myocardial ischaemia if 64-slice (or above) CCTA has shown coronary artery disease of uncertain functional significance, or is non-diagnostic. Non-invasive functional imaging includes: • myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single-photon emission CT (MPS with SPECT) • stress echocardiography • first-pass contrast-enhanced MR perfusion • MR imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. ICA should be offered as a second-line investigation when the results of non- invasive functional imaging are inconclusive. 2.10 When ICA is used to determine the presence and severity of coronary stenosis, it may be combined with the invasive measurement of FFR using a pressure wire. Although the NICE guideline on chest pain does not consider FFR, other guidelines (such as those of the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology) state that lesions with an FFR of 0.80 or less are functionally significant and revascularisation may be considered. 3 Clinical evidence 3.1 The key clinical outcomes for HeartFlow FFR presented in the decision problem CT were: • measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, area-under curve) using invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard • rates of diagnostic coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass surgery • adverse
