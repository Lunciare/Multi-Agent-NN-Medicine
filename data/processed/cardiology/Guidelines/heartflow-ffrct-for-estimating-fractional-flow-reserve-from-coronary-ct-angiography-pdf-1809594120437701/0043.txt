saving will increase if the cost of HeartFlow FFR is reduced. CT 6 Conclusions 6.1 The committee concluded that the evidence suggests that HeartFlow FFR is CT safe, has high diagnostic accuracy, and that its use may avoid the need for invasive investigations. 6.2 The committee concluded that cost savings of £214 per patient are plausible and likely to be realised in practice, providing that sites adopting HeartFlow FFR CT have access to 64-slice (or above) coronary CT angiography.
