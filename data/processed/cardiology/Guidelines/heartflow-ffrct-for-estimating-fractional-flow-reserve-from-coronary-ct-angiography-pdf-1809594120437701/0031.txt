suggest that reproducibility is within acceptable 95% confidence interval limits of agreement. FFR reproducibility was found to be CT equivalent to invasive FFR reproducibility. • The reproducibility of outlining the coronary artery lumen, part of the FFR CT computation analysis, decreases in the distal portion of the vessel (Gage repeatability and reproducibility=29.4%). This could be a result of different factors including lower CT quality, lower CT resolution, smaller vessel diameter at the distal end and higher disease burden. • The company monitors FFR reproducibility by re-processing 5% of its case CT volume on a weekly basis. The company has confirmed that this has shown a reproducibility rate consistent with the literature (Gaur et al. 2014). • The company fulfils regulatory approval standards for data confidentiality and integrity protection for remote processing. It offers NHS customers the option to upload fully anonymised DICOM data to comply with UK data protection law. Committee considerations 4.5 The committee was satisfied with the EAC's conclusions on reproducibility (see section 4.4). It accepted that the company has protocols in place to manage an increased demand for HeartFlow FFR .
