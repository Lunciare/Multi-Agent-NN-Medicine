HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

change: 0.12 for CT CCTA/FFR compared with 0.07 for functional imaging, p=0.02). CT 3.20 Lu et al. (2015) used a subgroup analysis of the PROMISE trial (n=181) to investigate the added value of FFR compared with CCTA in improving efficiency CT of referral to ICA. End points for the subgroup analysis were rate of revascularisation and ICA that did not show obstructive coronary artery disease and MACE. Over a median follow-up of 25 months, the addition of FFR CT increased the rate of ICA with revascularisation from 49% to 61%. The rate of angiography without obstructive disease decreased from 27% to 11%. No patient with FFR more than 0.80 had an adverse event which ICA would have CT prevented. 3.21 Nørgaard (2016) reports on the real-world experience of using CCTA with FFR CT as gatekeeper to ICA in patients with stable coronary artery disease and intermediate-range coronary lesions (n=189). Patients were followed up for a median of 12 months. The primary end point was the impact of FFR on further CT downstream diagnostic testing. Other end points were the agreement between FFR and invasive FFR, and the short-term clinical outcome after FFR testing CT CT defined as the occurrence of
