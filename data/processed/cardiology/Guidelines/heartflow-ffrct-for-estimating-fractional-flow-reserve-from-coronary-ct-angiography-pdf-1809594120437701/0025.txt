HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

CT downstream diagnostic testing. Other end points were the agreement between FFR and invasive FFR, and the short-term clinical outcome after FFR testing CT CT defined as the occurrence of MACE (death and acute myocardial infarction) or an angina episode leading to hospital admission or visit in the outpatient clinic. The authors concluded that FFR testing is feasible in real-world scenarios involving CT patients with intermediate-range coronary stenosis determined by CCTA. They also concluded that implementing FFR for clinical decision-making may CT influence the downstream diagnostic workflow, and patients with an FFR more CT than 0.80 who are not referred for ICA have a favourable short-term prognosis. The authors highlight that in patients with FFR ranging between 0.76 and 0.80, CT a non-negligible number of false-positive results may be expected. 3.22 The EAC considered that the 1-year follow-up data from the PLATFORM study supported the company's claims about resource use, rates of ICA and percutaneous coronary intervention, and quality of life with HeartFlow FFR . CT Additionally, the 1-year follow-up evidence from the PLATFORM supports the company's claim that MACE outcomes are equivalent between the current pathway and one that uses FFR , whereas the PROMISE study showed that CT
