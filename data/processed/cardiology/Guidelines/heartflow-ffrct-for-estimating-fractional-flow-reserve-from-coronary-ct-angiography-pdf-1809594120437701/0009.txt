HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

HeartFlow FFR and CCTA for diagnosing ischaemia compared with FFR CT measured during ICA as the reference standard. The diagnostic accuracy of each test was presented on a per-patient and a per-vessel basis compared with the reference standard, an FFR value of ≤0.80. Per-vessel FFR was correlated to CT FFR (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.82, p>0.001), with a slight underestimation of FFR compared with FFR. The authors concluded that CT HeartFlow FFR can identify functionally significant coronary artery disease with CT high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, adding FFR measurements to CT CCTA led to a marked increase in specificity. 3.6 The EAC identified 6 studies which both used the comparator tests and included patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Bernhardt et al. (2012) compared the diagnostic performance of 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanners using FFR as a reference standard in 34 patients with stable angina and suspected or known coronary artery disease. The authors studied an intermediate-risk population with a mean PROCAM score of 42.7 (a risk assessment metric which estimates the 10-year risk of developing a coronary event). Ponte et al. (2014) compared the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and MRI for detecting functionally significant coronary
