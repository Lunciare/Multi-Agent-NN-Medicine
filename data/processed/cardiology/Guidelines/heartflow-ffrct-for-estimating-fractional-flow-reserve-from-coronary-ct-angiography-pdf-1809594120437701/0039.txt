changes in the sensitivity and specificity, HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving for nearly all the values CT tested when considered in the context of the entire patient population. Revisions by the external assessment centre 5.11 The EAC incorporated the changes to the updated NICE guideline on chest pain in the company economic model. In this context, the EAC assumed that HeartFlow FFR would be used following an initial CCTA, and that non-invasive CT functional imaging tests would subsequently be used only if the CCTA result were uncertain or non-diagnostic. The EAC reviewed the parameters and costs used in the company's model. It revised the company's sensitivity and specificity parameters for the comparator diagnostic tests, based on its own analyses of diagnostic accuracy (see table 1). 5.12 The EAC used the company's revised list price of £700 for HeartFlow FFR , CT instead of £888 as used in the company's model. 5.13 The EAC used the updated NICE guideline on chest pain to determine the costs of all comparator tests except MRI, to ensure that they were consistent with 2014/15 reference costs. The cost of MRI was taken from the Payment by Results tariff, because the chest pain guideline committee determined
