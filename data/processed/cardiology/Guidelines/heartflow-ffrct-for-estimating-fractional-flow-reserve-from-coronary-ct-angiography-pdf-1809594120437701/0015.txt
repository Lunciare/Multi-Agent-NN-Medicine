(see CT section 3.18) and Radiation FFR ; the company provided both in the form of CT interim results for the former and an abstract for the latter. Two studies (Real World Usage FFR and FFR RIPCORD) included HeartFlow FFR but were CT CT CT excluded because they did not provide information on patients' pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. 3.11 Radiation FFR is a single-centre modelling study, based in Canada, investigating CT the potential effect of HeartFlow FFR on radiation dose exposure and CT downstream clinical event rate. In the modelling, a clinical pathway in which CCTA plus FFR was the initial diagnostic test was compared with 3 clinical pathways CT instead utilising SPECT, ECHO or CCTA as initial diagnostic tests. The model included 100 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 34% of whom had intermediate disease. Patients were stratified into 3 categories of likelihood of disease: 50% low, 40% moderate and 10% high. No clinical outcomes were measured in this modelled population. The primary outcome was the estimated radiation dose and the secondary outcome was death or myocardial infarction estimates at 1 year after the test. Of the 4 diagnostic pathways studied, ECHO had the lowest radiation dose
