HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

et al. (2010) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET and CCTA in 107 patients with a history of stable chest pain and a 30% to 70% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. All patients had ICA independently of the non-invasive imaging results, and treatment decisions were based on both ICA and FFR. 3.7 Table 1 summarises the EAC's analysis of diagnostic accuracy for HeartFlow FFR and its comparators at both per-vessel and per-patient levels, CT as shown in table 1. When there was more than 1 diagnostic accuracy study available, the EAC conducted a meta-analysis.
