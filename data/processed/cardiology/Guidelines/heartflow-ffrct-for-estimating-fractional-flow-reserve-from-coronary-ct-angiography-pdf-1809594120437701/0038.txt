2014/15 hospital resource group (HRG) tariffs, as follows: • SPECT: £220 (HRG code RA37Z, nuclear medicine category 3) • CCTA: £136 (HRG code RA14Z, CT scan, more than 3 areas) • Calcium scoring: £77 (HRG code RA08Z, CT scan, 1 area, no contrast) • ICA: £1,241 (HRG code EA36A, catheter 19 years and over) • Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): £2,832 (weighted average of 2 tariffs, assuming that 25% of patients needing PCI will need more than 2 stents. HRG codes EA31Z [£2,704] and EA49Z [£3,216]). 5.9 The company's base-case results reported an average per-patient cost of £2,239 using the current pathway and £2,080 using the adapted pathway with HeartFlow FFR , representing an average saving of £159 per patient. CT 5.10 The company conducted 1-way sensitivity analyses on the sensitivity and specificity of HeartFlow FFR and the comparator tests, as well as the costs of CT HeartFlow FFR . The analyses showed that HeartFlow FFR continued to be CT CT cost saving until its price reached £1,126. With regard to changes in the sensitivity and specificity, HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving for nearly all the values CT tested when considered in the context of the entire patient population.
