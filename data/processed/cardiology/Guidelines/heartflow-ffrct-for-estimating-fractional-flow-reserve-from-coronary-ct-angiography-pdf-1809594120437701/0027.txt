HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

from the PLATFORM study, in a population which closely matches that in the scope. The evidence was sufficient to conclude that HeartFlow FFR has a high diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease, and CT that its use has the potential to reduce the need for invasive coronary investigations. 3.24 The committee considered the technology to be innovative and understood that its adoption may serve to simplify a complex patient pathway. The committee heard from clinical experts that they had confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of HeartFlow FFR , and that it could provide an effective early rule-out test for CT coronary artery disease. This would reduce the need for ICA and invasive FFR measurement, and potentially reduce radiation exposure. 3.25 The committee understood that there are differences in the local implementation of the patient pathway for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It was advised by clinical experts that the choice of functional imaging test depends on local access, available expertise and clinician preference. It heard that although HeartFlow FFR has the potential to reduce the number of tests that are done, CT the other non-invasive functional imaging tests that are part of the current patient pathway offer different functionality and in
