HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

compared with ECHO • similar sensitivity but lower specificity compared with MRI • higher sensitivity and specificity compared with SPECT. Summary of clinical-effectiveness evidence 3.9 The company conducted a literature search for evidence on the clinical outcomes specified in the decision problem for HeartFlow FFR , and the existing CT treatments, against any comparator. It identified 16 studies of which 5 included HeartFlow FFR , 1 published (Guar et al. 2014) and 4 unpublished (PLATFORM, CT Radiation FFR , Real World Usage FFR and FFR RIPCORD). CT CT CT 3.10 The EAC included extra intervention and comparator keywords and identified 11 studies, 4 of which had already been identified by the company: 2 published studies (Hachamovitch et al. 2012 and Douglas et al. 2015) and 2 unpublished studies. The EAC noted that only the 2 unpublished studies fully matched the population, intervention, comparators and outcomes defined in the scope; the other 9 included various comparators but not HeartFlow FFR . The CT 2 unpublished studies including HeartFlow FFR were PLATFORM (see CT section 3.18) and Radiation FFR ; the company provided both in the form of CT interim results for the former and an abstract for the latter.
