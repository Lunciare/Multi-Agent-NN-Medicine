HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

cost analysis of 410 patients referred to a rapid-access chest pain clinic in Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London, from April 2012 to March 2013. Patients were grouped into pre-test likelihood categories and diagnostic imaging was done based on standardised protocols as recommended in the previous NICE guideline on chest pain. A standardised unit cost for each test and procedure was taken from the NHS National Tariff 2013/14. A decision-tree economic model was used to evaluate the cost of 1,000 patients passing through the current treatment pathway compared with the same 1,000 patients after incorporating HeartFlow FFR . The authors CT found that introducing HeartFlow FFR to the pathway resulted in cost savings of CT £200 per patient. The EAC noted that although the derivation of costs in the study is explicit, details of the decision model structure are unclear. 5.4 Hlatky et al. (2015) investigated the quality-of-life and economic outcomes of fractional flow reserve CT (FFR ) in the PLATFORM study (see section 3.17). CT Cumulative medical costs were measured over 90 days for each patient by multiplying a standardised cost weight for each medical resource by the number of resources used by the patient. Medicare reimbursement rates (the
