HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography

MRI, to ensure that they were consistent with 2014/15 reference costs. The cost of MRI was taken from the Payment by Results tariff, because the chest pain guideline committee determined this to be more representative of the true cost. These costs were as follows: • SPECT: £367 (RN21Z, myocardial perfusion scan, stress only ) • CCTA: £122 (RD28Z, complex CT scan) • ECHO: £271 (EY50Z, complex echocardiogram) • ICA: £1,685 (EY43A to EY43F, standard cardiac catheterisation) • MRI: £515 (RA67Z, cardiac MRI scan, pre and post contrast) • PCI: £2,865 (weighted average of 2 tariffs, assuming that 25% of patients needing PCI will need more than 2 stents. HRG codes EA31Z [£2,704] and EA49Z [£3,216]). Includes an estimated annual cost of £33 for medication following a PCI [aspirin and clopidogrel, BNF (2015)]. 5.14 The EAC noted that the company's model did not include costs of drug therapy for patients having PCI. It consulted the NICE guideline on stable angina and estimated an annual drug treatment cost for these patients of £33 based on BNF (2015) prescription costs for aspirin and clopidogrel, and used a cost of £2,865 (PCI tariff with drug costs) in its revised model. 5.15 The EAC included
