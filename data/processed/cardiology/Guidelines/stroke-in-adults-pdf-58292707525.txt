Stroke in adults (QS2)
Quality statement 1: Prompt admission to
specialist acute stroke units
Quality statement
Adults presenting at an accident and emergency (A&E) department with suspected stroke
are admitted to a specialist acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival. [2010, updated
2016]
Rationale
Specialist acute stroke units are associated with improved patient safety due to better
outcomes, such as reduced disability and mortality, because of the range of specialist
treatments they provide. Admission to these units should be within 4 hours of arrival at
A&E, so that treatment can begin as quickly as possible, and to help prevent
complications. Some adults with acute stroke may need treatment in higher-level units,
such as high dependency or intensive care units.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults
presenting at an A&E department with suspected stroke are admitted to a specialist acute
stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
provider organisations, for example, from clinical or service protocols.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Process
Proportion of A&E department presentations of suspected stroke in adults in which the
person is admitted to a specialist acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.
Numerator – the number in the denominator in which the person is admitted to a specialist
acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.
Denominator – the number of A&E department presentations of suspected stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records. The Sentinel
Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) clinical audit and the NHS Digital Clinical
Commissioning Group (CCG) Outcomes Indicator Set indicator 3.5 include the percentage
of patients directly admitted to a stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival at hospital.
Outcome
a) Mortality rates of adults who have a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected locally using the SSNAP clinical audit and the NHS
Digital CCG Outcomes Indicator Set indicator 1.5 to report mortality within 30 days of
hospital admission for stroke.
b) Change in Modified Rankin Score at 6 months after a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records. The SSNAP
clinical audit includes the Modified Rankin Score at 6 months after a stroke.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as secondary care providers) ensure that systems are in place for
adults presenting at an A&E department with suspected stroke to be admitted to a
specialist acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Healthcare professionals admit adults presenting at an A&E department with suspected
stroke to a specialist acute stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that can demonstrate that adults
presenting at A&E departments with suspected stroke are admitted to a specialist acute
stroke unit within 4 hours of arrival.
Adults with suspected stroke who go to A&E are admitted to an acute stroke unit within
4 hours of arriving at A&E. An acute stroke unit has special equipment and a team of
doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals who provide
specialist treatment as quickly as possible and help to prevent further problems.

NICE guideline NG128 (2019, updated 2022), recommendation 1.3.1
• The 4-hour timeframe is based on the SSNAP target
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Admission to a specialist acute stroke unit
Admission should be within 4 hours of arrival at the A&E department for adults with
suspected stroke, following an initial assessment (unless their care needs should be
provided elsewhere, such as an intensive care unit). [Adapted from NICE's guideline on
stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s, recommendation 1.3.1, and SSNAP]
Specialist acute stroke unit
A discrete area in the hospital designated for people with stroke. It is staffed by a
specialist stroke multidisciplinary team, who have access to equipment for monitoring and
rehabilitation. The Stroke Unit Trialists' Collaboration provides 5 key characteristics of
markers of a good specialist acute stroke unit:
• a consultant physician with responsibility for stroke

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Quality statement 2: Intensity of stroke
rehabilitation
Quality statement
Adults having stroke rehabilitation in hospital or in the community are offered at least
3 hours of rehabilitation covering a range of multidisciplinary therapy for a minimum of
5 days a week. [2010, updated 2016]
Rationale
Higher-intensity stroke rehabilitation therapies can improve the quality of life for adults
who have had a stroke. The improvements that an adult with stroke should expect to
achieve will depend on their health and abilities before and after the stroke, the severity of
the stroke and the intensity of the rehabilitation therapy. The intensity of stroke
rehabilitation should be suitable for the person, so that they are able to participate and
make progress towards their functional goals.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as secondary care providers and community care providers)
ensure that adults having stroke rehabilitation are offered at least 3 hours of rehabilitation
covering a range of multidisciplinary therapy for a minimum of 5 days a week.
Health and social care practitioners offer adults having stroke rehabilitation at least
3 hours of rehabilitation covering a range of multidisciplinary therapy for a minimum of
5 days a week.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which adults having stroke
rehabilitation are offered at least 3 hours of rehabilitation covering a range of
multidisciplinary therapy for a minimum of 5 days a week.
Adults having rehabilitation therapy after a stroke are offered at least 3 hours of
rehabilitation therapy that they need on at least 5 days a week. Rehabilitation therapy is
long-term support to help people regain their independence and cope with any remaining
disabilities after a stroke. It may involve many different specialists, such as
physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. They can
help people who have problems with their memory and concentration; speaking, reading
and writing; emotions and feelings; sight; swallowing and eating; strength, balance and
movement; and shoulder pain. They also include help to encourage physical activity and
independent living.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Rehabilitation covering a range of multidisciplinary therapy
A range of multidisciplinary therapy includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and
speech and language therapy. Adults who have had a stroke should be offered all
rehabilitation therapies that are suitable for their needs, as long as they have the ability to

participate and make progress towards their functional goals. Adults with stroke should be
able to access rehabilitation at any stage of the stroke care pathway when needed.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on stroke rehabilitation in adults, recommendation 1.2.16,
and expert opinion]
Equality and diversity considerations
Some adults who have had a stroke may not have the mental or physical ability to
participate in at least 3 hours of rehabilitation covering a range of multidisciplinary therapy
each day. Where it is agreed with the person that they are unable, or do not wish, to
participate in rehabilitation therapy for at least 3 hours a day, service providers should
ensure that therapy is still offered 5 days a week but for a shorter amount of time. It
should be given at an intensity that allows the person to actively participate and at a level
that enables them to make progress.

Quality statement 3: Access to a clinical
psychologist
Quality statement
Adults who have had a stroke have access to a clinical psychologist or a clinical
neuropsychologist with expertise in stroke rehabilitation who is part of the core
multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team. [new 2016]
Rationale
Many adults who have had a stroke experience psychological difficulties, including low
mood and anxiety, as well as difficulties with cognition such as problems with memory and
information processing. Psychological therapies may help people and their families or
carers with these difficulties. Having a clinical psychologist or a clinical neuropsychologist
as part of the core multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team can help to ensure that
people have access to psychological therapy tailored to their needs.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and protocols to ensure that services providing stroke
care have a core multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team that includes a clinical
psychologist or a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in stroke rehabilitation.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
provider organisations, for example, from service protocols. The Sentinel Stroke National
Audit Programme (SSNAP) organisational audit collects information on the number of
clinical psychologists for stroke unit beds.

Outcome
Quality of life for adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information collected locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient surveys.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as secondary care providers) ensure that the core
multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team includes a clinical psychologist or a clinical
neuropsychologist with expertise in stroke rehabilitation.
Health and social care practitioners are aware of the need for a clinical psychologist or a
clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in stroke rehabilitation to be part of the core
multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that have a clinical psychologist or
a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in stroke rehabilitation as part of their core
multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation team.
Adults who have had a stroke who need help with psychological problems can see a
clinical psychologist or a clinical neuropsychologist who specialises in stroke rehabilitation.

Quality statement 4: Early supported
discharge
Quality statement
Adults who have had a stroke are offered early supported discharge if the core
multidisciplinary stroke team assess that it is suitable for them. [new 2016]
Rationale
Early supported discharge is an intervention for adults after a stroke that allows their care
to be transferred from an inpatient environment to a community setting. It enables people
to continue their rehabilitation therapy at home, with the same intensity and expertise that
they would receive in hospital. This may not be suitable for all adults with stroke or in all
circumstances. The decision to offer early supported discharge is made by the core
multidisciplinary stroke team after discussion with the person and their family or carer if
applicable.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults who
have had a stroke are offered early supported discharge if the core multidisciplinary stroke

for early supported discharge by the core multidisciplinary stroke team.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records.
b) Proportion of adults who have had stroke who are treated by an early supported
discharge team.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who are treated by an early supported
discharge team.
Denominator – the number of adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: National data is collected using the Sentinel Stroke National Audit
Programme (SSNAP) clinical audit, which reports the percentage of patients treated by a
stroke-skilled early supported discharge team.
Outcome
a) Length of hospital stay for adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records. NHS
England's Hospital Admitted Patient Care Activity includes average length of stay by

Stroke in adults (QS2)
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as secondary care providers) ensure that systems are in place to
offer early supported discharge to adults who have had a stroke if it is assessed to be
suitable for them by the core multidisciplinary stroke team.
Health and social care practitioners in the core multidisciplinary stroke team are aware of
discharge pathways and offer early supported discharge to adults who have had a stroke
if it is suitable for them.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that can provide early supported
discharge services for adults who have had a stroke if it is assessed to be suitable for
them by the core multidisciplinary stroke team.
Adults who have had a stroke are offered 'early supported discharge' if their stroke team
decides that it is suitable for them. This means that they are supported to go home from
hospital as early as possible and have the same rehabilitation care at home. This is only
offered if the person is well enough and it can be done safely.

suitable for adults who have had a stroke. The assessment takes into account the person's
functional, cognitive and social circumstances. This may include, for example, the person's
ability to move from bed to chair independently or with assistance, and whether a safe and
secure environment can be provided at home. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on stroke
rehabilitation in adults, recommendation 1.1.9, and expert consensus]
The core multidisciplinary stroke team
The team should comprise the following professionals with expertise in stroke
rehabilitation:
• consultant physicians specialising in stroke, or rehabilitation medicine
• nurses
• physiotherapists
• occupational therapists
• speech and language therapists
• dietitians
• clinical psychologists or clinical neuropsychologists
• orthoptists
• rehabilitation assistants
• social workers.
[NICE's guideline on stroke rehabilitation in adults, recommendation 1.1.3]
Equality and diversity considerations
Early supported discharge is only suitable in a safe and secure environment. Therefore, it
may not be suitable for some people because of their living arrangements, for example, if
they are homeless, recent refugees, asylum seekers or migrant workers. It may not be
suitable for people with significant cognitive and functional impairments.

Quality statement 5: Return to work
Quality statement
Adults who have had a stroke are offered active management to return to work if they wish
to do so. [new 2016]
Rationale
After a stroke, adults may have significant disabilities that prevent them from returning to
work. Work can contribute to a person's identity and perceived status, has financial
benefits, and can improve their quality of life and reduce ill health. Being able to return to
work is also a sign that rehabilitation has been successful.

The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

Stroke rehabilitation in adults. NICE guideline NG236 (2023), recommendation 1.16.4
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Active management to return to work
Active management to return to work should include:
• identifying the physical, cognitive, communication and psychological demands of the
job (such as multi-tasking by answering emails and telephone calls in a busy office)
• identifying any problems that affect work performance (for example, physical
limitations, anxiety, fatigue preventing attendance for a full day at work, cognitive
impairments preventing multi-tasking, and communication problems)
• tailoring interventions (for example, teaching strategies to support multi-tasking or
memory difficulties, teaching the use of voice-activated software for people with
difficulty typing, and delivery of work simulations)
• educating about the Equality Act 2010 and support available (for example, an access-
to-work scheme)
• workplace visits and liaison with employers to make reasonable adjustments, such as
provision of equipment and graded return to work.
[NICE's guideline on stroke rehabilitation in adults, recommendation 1.16.4]
Equality and diversity considerations
Services should make reasonable adjustments to help adults with significant cognitive
impairment and stroke to stay in work or education or find new employment, volunteering
and educational opportunities.
Some adults may be unable to work, so other occupational or education activities should
be considered, including prevocational training.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Quality statement 6: Regular review of
rehabilitation goals
Quality statement
Adults who have had a stroke have their rehabilitation goals reviewed at regular intervals.
[2010, updated 2016]
Rationale
Regularly reviewing the goals of an adult who has had a stroke helps to identify their
values, beliefs and preferences, which may affect the kind of rehabilitation that would be
suitable for them. It may also help to encourage and motivate the person, and improve the
outcomes of rehabilitation. Goals should be set within 5 days of arrival at an accident and
emergency (A&E) department to ensure they are established from the start of the
rehabilitation process. They should then be reviewed at regular intervals to ensure that the
goals are still relevant to the person who has had a stroke.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults who
have had a stroke have their rehabilitation goals reviewed at regular intervals.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
provider organisations, for example, from clinical or service protocols.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Process
a) Proportion of adults who have had a stroke who have their rehabilitation goals agreed
within 5 days of arrival at A&E.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their rehabilitation goals agreed
within 5 days of arrival at A&E.
Denominator – the number of adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: Data is collected using the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme
(SSNAP) core dataset question 4.7 and reported in the results of the clinical audit.
b) Proportion of adults who have had a stroke who have their rehabilitation goals reviewed
at regular intervals.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their rehabilitation goals reviewed
at regular intervals.
Denominator – the number of adults who have had a stroke with agreed rehabilitation
goals.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records.
Outcome
a) Quality of life for adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information collected locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient surveys. The SSNAP
clinical audit includes a quality-of-life measure (EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L) at the 6-month post-
stroke follow up.
b) Readmission rates of adults who have had a stroke.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example, from patient records.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as primary, secondary and community care providers) ensure that
systems are in place for adults who have had a stroke to have their rehabilitation goals
reviewed at regular intervals.
Healthcare professionals review regularly the rehabilitation goals of adults who have had
a stroke.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which adults who have had a
stroke have their rehabilitation goals reviewed at regular intervals.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Rehabilitation goals
Goals for rehabilitation for people after a stroke should:
• be meaningful and relevant to them
• focus on activity and participation
• be challenging but achievable
• include both short- and long-term elements.

Stroke in adults (QS2)
Reviewing goals at regular intervals
Goals should be set within 5 days of arrival at A&E. Reviewing goals should take place at
intervals suitable to the ability of the individual and nature of the goal, such as at 6 weeks,
3 months, 6 months and annually thereafter. Reviews should take place in goal-setting
meetings that are timetabled and held regularly, involve the person after stroke and, where
appropriate, their family members and carers, in discussions. [NICE's guideline on stroke
rehabilitation in adults, recommendations 1.2.8 and 1.2.11, and expert consensus]
Equality and diversity considerations
When setting goals for rehabilitation, healthcare professionals should be aware that adults
with stroke may have cognitive or physical impairments, and at the acute stage
participation for some adults may be limited until the person feels ready and more
confident.
Discussion about goals should take into account any additional needs, such as physical,
sensory or learning disabilities, and the needs of people who do not speak or read English.
People should have access to an interpreter or advocate if needed.

Quality statement 7: Regular review of
health and social care needs
Quality statement
Adults who have had a stroke have a structured health and social care review at 6 months
and 1 year after the stroke, and then annually. [new 2016]
Rationale
Reviewing the health and social care needs of adults who have had a stroke enables
health and social care practitioners to identify any problems or difficulties the person who
had the stroke and their family or carers may be experiencing. This can help adults who
have had a stroke and their family or carers to make changes to their care according to
their needs.

Structured health and social care review
These reviews should address the person's ability to participate in daily activities and their
role in their community, as well as secondary prevention and continuing rehabilitation. An
agreed local structured health and social care review tool can be used, for example, the
Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool (GM-SAT). [NICE's guideline on stroke

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details about our standing
committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is
available from the webpage for this quality standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.
Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the

quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
