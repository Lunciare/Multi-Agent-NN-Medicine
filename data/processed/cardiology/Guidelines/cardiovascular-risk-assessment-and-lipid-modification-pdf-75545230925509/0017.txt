Cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification

modification, recommendations 1.5.2 and 1.6.9 and expert opinion] Quality statement 4: Assessing response to lipid-lowering treatment Quality statement Adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment have a full lipid profile and their liver transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months. [2015, updated 2025] Rationale Repeating lipid profiles and measuring liver transaminases after starting or changing lipid- lowering treatment (and after a baseline blood sample has been taken), is important for patient safety and to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. A repeat lipid profile can be used to determine whether the expected lipid levels have been met and can indicate the need for escalation of treatment. Measurement of liver transaminase is important to detect any increased levels of these enzymes, which may indicate problems with liver function. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Process Proportion of adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment who had a full lipid profile and their liver transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months. Numerator – the number in the denominator who had a full
