for example, by disaggregating data by socioeconomic status, ethnic family background, sex or presence of a learning disability. Measures could also focus on adults with modifiable risk factors or coexisting conditions that increase CVD risk. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (primary care providers) ensure that they use a systematic strategy to identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD. The strategy could use general practice records or systematic searches in pre-identified areas or with specific populations. Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses and pharmacists) identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD using risk factors already in patient records. They review estimates of CVD risk on an ongoing basis for adults aged over 40. Commissioners ensure that they commission services that use systematic strategies to identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD using CVD risk factors already recorded. Adults who are likely to have a high risk of CVD are identified by their healthcare provider so that their risk factors can be managed in the most effective way.
