following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Process Proportion of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more who are prescribed a lipid- lowering treatment. Numerator – the number in the denominator who are prescribed a lipid-lowering treatment. Denominator – the number of adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more. Data source:CVDPREVENT indicator CVDP006CHOL reports the proportion of patients with no GP recorded CVD and a GP-recorded QRISK score of 10% or more, who are currently treated with lipid-lowering therapy. The indicator also reports data for inequality markers including sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation level and presence of a learning disability. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (primary care services) ensure that systems are in place for adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more to be offered a high-intensity statin or other lipid- lowering treatment, if required, to achieve their individual lipid target of a greater than 40% reduction in non-high density (HDL) cholesterol.
