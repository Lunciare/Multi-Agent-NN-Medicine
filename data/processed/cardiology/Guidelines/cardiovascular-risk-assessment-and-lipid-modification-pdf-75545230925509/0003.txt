using a CVD risk assessment tool, and those at high risk should be invited for full formal risk assessment. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure a) Evidence that general practices use a systematic strategy to identify adults who are likely to be at high risk of CVD. Data source: Data can be collected from local implementation plans. b) Evidence that general practices use the QRISK3 tool to estimate CVD risk, or QRISK2 if QRISK3 is not currently embedded in electronic clinical systems. Data source: Data can be collected from local implementation plans. Process The systematic strategies used by different localities will focus on different groups of people depending on the individual GP practice and so example process measures have not been provided. Some localities may want to focus on known local health inequalities or NHS England's Core20PLUS5, for example, by disaggregating data by socioeconomic status, ethnic family background, sex or presence of a learning disability. Measures could also focus on adults with modifiable risk factors or coexisting
