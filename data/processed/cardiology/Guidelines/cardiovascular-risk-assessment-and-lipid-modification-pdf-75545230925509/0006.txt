on risk factors for CVD and expert opinion] Adults likely to be at high risk of CVD Adults with an estimated 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more. [NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, section 1.1 and recommendation 1.1.4] Equality and diversity considerations CVD risk can be estimated based on factors routinely recorded in general practice. However, the accuracy of estimated risk scores will be adversely affected if relevant data is not accurately recorded in GP records, which is especially likely for vulnerable and underserved populations. To mitigate perpetuating or exacerbating existing health inequalities, 'batch coding' without clinical judgement should be avoided. Additionally, resultant data should be disaggregated by deprivation, ethnicity, age and gender to help reduce the risk of widening health inequalities. Clinical judgement should inform interpretation of results from CVD risk tools because tools may underestimate the risk for certain groups of people, including, but not limited to: • people treated for HIV • people already taking medicines to treat CVD risk factors • people who have recently stopped smoking • people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia, such as immunosuppressant drugs • people with severe mental illness • people with
