Cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification

2.0 mmol per litre or less, or a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level of 2.6 mmol per litre or less. [new 2025] Rationale Management of LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol is important to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events in adults with existing cardiovascular disease. High-intensity statins are the most clinically effective treatment option for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by reduction of lipid levels. Atorvastatin 80 mg is recommended as the preferred high-intensity statin, but other lipid-lowering treatments could be used if atorvastatin 80 mg is contraindicated, not tolerated or the target cholesterol level is not achieved. A non-HDL cholesterol target can be used if an LDL cholesterol level has not been requested or calculated. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Outcome Proportion of adults with CVD in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL cholesterol level (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for LDL cholesterol, or 2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol.
