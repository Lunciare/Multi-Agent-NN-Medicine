autoimmune disorders, and other systemic inflammatory disorders. When using a QRISK3 risk score to inform treatment decisions in these populations, particularly if it is near the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that may predispose the person to premature CVD that may not be included in calculated risk scores. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, recommendation 1.1.10] A person's sex will affect their CVD risk assessment score, and this should be considered when estimating risk for trans people. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, rationale and impact section on full formal risk assessment]. For adults aged 85 and older, treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg should be considered with awareness of factors that may make treatment inappropriate, such as the person's preference, presence of comorbidities, whether they are on multiple medications, whether they are frail, their cognitive status, and their life expectancy.
