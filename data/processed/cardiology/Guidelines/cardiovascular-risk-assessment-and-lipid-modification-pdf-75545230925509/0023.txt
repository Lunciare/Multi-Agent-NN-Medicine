with the patient at the same time. Treatment and any changes to treatment should be made after an informed discussion between the healthcare professional and the adult with CVD. They are aware of strategies to address adverse effects of high-intensity statins if reported by the adult on a high-intensity statin and could use NHS England's statin intolerance pathway to address statin intolerance. They repeat measurement of LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol in adults with CVD after 2 to 3 months of treatment and consider escalation of treatment with alternative lipid-lowering treatment if the target is not achieved. Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which adults with CVD have treatment to achieve their target lipid level. Adults with CVD are aware of their target cholesterol level and receive treatment, and advice on lifestyle changes, that lower their bad cholesterol (non-high-density lipoprotein [non-HDL], which is mainly composed of low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) to a level that reduces their chances of having a heart attack or stroke in the future after discussion with their healthcare professional.
