Cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification

cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.11] Equality and diversity considerations Clinical judgement should inform interpretation of results from CVD risk tools because tools may underestimate the risk in certain groups of people, including, but not limited to: • people treated for HIV • people already taking medicines to treat CVD risk factors • people who have recently stopped smoking • people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia, such as immunosuppressant drugs • people with severe mental illness • people with autoimmune disorders, and other systemic inflammatory disorders. When using a QRISK3 risk score to inform treatment decisions in these populations, particularly if it is near the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that may predispose the person to premature CVD that may not be included in calculated risk scores. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, recommendation 1.1.10] A person's sex will affect their CVD risk assessment score, and this should be considered when estimating risk for trans people.
