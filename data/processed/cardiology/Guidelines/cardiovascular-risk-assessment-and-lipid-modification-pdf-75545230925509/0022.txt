QOF indicator CHOL004 reports the percentage of patients on the QOF CHD, PAD or stroke/TIA register with the most recent cholesterol measurement in the preceding 12 months, showing as 2.0 mmol per litre or less if it was an LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol reading or 2.6 mmol per litre or less if it was a non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol reading. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (for example primary care services and secondary care services) ensure that systems are in place for adults with CVD to achieve their lipid target, for example ensuring that LDL cholesterol or non-HDL cholesterol can be measured, and that lipid- lowering treatment can be offered. Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses, doctors, and specialist nurses) are aware of treatment targets for secondary prevention of CVD and offer adults with CVD treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, or other lipid-lowering treatment if required, to achieve the target. They could use NHS England's summary of national guidance for lipid management. They discuss lifestyle change with the patient at the same time. Treatment and any changes to treatment should be made after an informed discussion between the healthcare professional and the adult with CVD. They
