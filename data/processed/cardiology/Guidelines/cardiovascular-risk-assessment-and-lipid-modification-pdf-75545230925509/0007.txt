Cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification

risk factors • people who have recently stopped smoking • people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia, such as immunosuppressant drugs • people with severe mental illness • people with autoimmune disorders, and other systemic inflammatory disorders. When using a QRISK3 risk score to inform treatment decisions in these populations, particularly if it is near the threshold for treatment, take into account other factors that may predispose the person to premature CVD that may not be included in calculated risk scores. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, recommendation 1.1.10] Quality statement 2: Diet and lifestyle advice for primary prevention Quality statement Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more receive tailored advice on diet and lifestyle changes within 3 months of their cardiovascular disease risk assessment score being recorded. [2015, updated 2025] Rationale Making improvements to diet, stopping smoking, increasing physical activity, managing weight and reducing alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Healthcare professionals should offer advice to adults with a 10-year CVD risk score of 10% or more after a full formal risk assessment, based on their individual needs, preferences and circumstances.
