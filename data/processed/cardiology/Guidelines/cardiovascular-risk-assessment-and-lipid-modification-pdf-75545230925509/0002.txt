[new 2025] Rationale Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in the UK, and is a major cause of illness, disability and poor quality of life. To improve primary prevention, adults at increased risk of CVD need to be identified using a systematic strategy so that their risk factors can be managed in the most effective way. This should not prevent people being identified opportunistically but may help to ensure that those with the highest risk of CVD are reviewed in an effective and efficient way. Factors routinely recorded in electronic patient records can be used to estimate CVD risk using a CVD risk assessment tool, and those at high risk should be invited for full formal risk assessment. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the
