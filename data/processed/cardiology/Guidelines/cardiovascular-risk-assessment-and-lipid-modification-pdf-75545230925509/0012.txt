estimating risk for trans people. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification, rationale and impact section on full formal risk assessment]. Quality statement 3: Lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention Quality statement Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more are prescribed a high- intensity statin or other lipid-lowering treatment if a high-intensity statin is contraindicated or not tolerated. [2015, updated 2025] Rationale High-intensity statins are the most clinically effective treatment option for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). After a full formal risk assessment that estimates an adult without CVD has a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more and following a discussion with a healthcare professional about the risks and benefits of starting statin treatment, an adult may choose statin treatment to reduce their risk of CVD. Atorvastatin 20 mg is recommended as the preferred high-intensity statin, but other lipid-lowering treatment could be used if atorvastatin 20 mg is contraindicated or not tolerated. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can
