non-HDL cholesterol level (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for LDL cholesterol, or 2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol. Numerator – the number in the denominator in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL cholesterol level (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for LDL cholesterol, or 2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol. Denominator – the number of adults with CVD. Data source:CVDPREVENT indicator CVDP012CHOL reports the proportion of patients with GP-recorded CVD (narrow definition which includes coronary heart disease [CHD], non-haemorrhagic stroke and stroke cause not specified, transient ischaemic attack [TIA] and peripheral arterial disease), whose most recent blood cholesterol level is LDL cholesterol less than or equal to 2.0 mmol per litre or, non-HDL cholesterol less than or equal to 2.6 mmol per litre in the preceding 12 months. The indicator also reports data for inequality markers including sex, age, ethnicity, deprivation level and presence of a learning disability. QOF indicator CHOL004 reports the percentage of patients on the QOF CHD, PAD or stroke/TIA register with the most recent cholesterol measurement in the preceding 12 months, showing as 2.0
