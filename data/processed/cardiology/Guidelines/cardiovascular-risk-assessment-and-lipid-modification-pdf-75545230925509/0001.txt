Quality statements Statement 1 General practices use a systematic strategy to identify adults likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease. [new 2025] Statement 2 Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more receive tailored advice on diet and lifestyle changes within 3 months of their cardiovascular disease risk assessment score being recorded. [2015, updated 2025] Statement 3 Adults with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10% or more are prescribed a high-intensity statin or other lipid-lowering treatment if a high-intensity statin is contraindicated or not tolerated. [2015, updated 2025] Statement 4 Adults starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment have a full lipid profile and their liver transaminases measured at 2 to 3 months. [2015, updated 2025] Statement 5 Adults with cardiovascular disease have a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 2.0 mmol per litre or less, or a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol level of 2.6 mmol per litre or less. [new 2025] In 2025 this quality standard was updated and statements prioritised in 2015 were updated (2015, updated 2025) or replaced (new 2025). For more information, see update information.
