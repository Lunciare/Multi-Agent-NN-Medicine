Cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modification

high-intensity statin or other lipid- lowering treatment, if required, to achieve their individual lipid target of a greater than 40% reduction in non-high density (HDL) cholesterol. Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, nurses and pharmacists) offer a high-intensity statin to adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more, or other lipid-lowering treatment if required, to achieve their individual lipid target of a greater than 40% reduction in non- high density (HDL) cholesterol. They are aware of strategies to address adverse effects of high-intensity statins when reported by an adult on a high-intensity statin. They could use the NHS England statin intolerance pathway to address statin intolerance. Commissioners ensure that lipid-lowering treatment is available for adults with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10% or more. Adults with a 1 in 10 chance or more of developing CVD in the next 10 years (a 10-year risk of 10% or more) are offered medicine to lower their cholesterol. They can use the NICE patient decision aid on should I take a statin? to talk about options with their doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
