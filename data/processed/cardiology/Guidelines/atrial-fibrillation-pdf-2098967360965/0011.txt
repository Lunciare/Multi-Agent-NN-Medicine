each visit can ensure that a person's risks of stroke and of having a major bleed are as low as possible. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist have their anticoagulation reassessed if their anticoagulation control is poor. Data source: Local data collection. Process a) Proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist who have their time in therapeutic range (TTR) recorded at each visit for INR assessment. Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their TTR recorded at each visit for INR assessment. Denominator – the number of adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist. Data source: Local data collection. b) Proportion of adults with poor anticoagulation control who have it reassessed. Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their anticoagulation reassessed. Denominator – the number of adults with poor anticoagulation control. Data source: Local data collection. Outcome
