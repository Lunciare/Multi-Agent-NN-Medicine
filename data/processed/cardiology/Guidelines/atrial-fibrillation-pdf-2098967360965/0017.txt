[Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendation 1.5.1] Specialised management Specialised management can be provided by an 'atrial fibrillation specialist' such as a cardiologist or nurse with an interest in arrhythmia. Specialised management should be provided through a package of care that covers key elements of service provision, tailored to the person with atrial fibrillation. Formally documenting key elements of the service can help to ensure that it has been delivered. [NICE's 2014 full guideline on atrial fibrillation] Quality statement 6 (developmental): Self-monitoring of anticoagulation Developmental quality statements set out an emergent area of cutting-edge service delivery or technology currently found in a minority of providers and indicating outstanding performance. They will need specific, significant changes to be put in place, such as redesign of services or new equipment. Developmental quality statement Adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy are supported to self-manage with a coagulometer. Rationale Enabling adults with atrial fibrillation to self-manage their coagulation using a coagulometer can help to optimise their anticoagulation treatment. As well as reducing the frequency of hospital or clinic visits, it can improve health outcomes such as risk of stroke and bleeding. Quality measures The following
