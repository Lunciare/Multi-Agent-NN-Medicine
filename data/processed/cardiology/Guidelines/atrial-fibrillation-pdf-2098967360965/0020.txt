Source guidance Atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease: self-monitoring coagulation status using point-of- care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS system). NICE HealthTech guidance 353 (2025), recommendation 1.1 Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Coagulometer Coagulometers monitor blood clotting in adults taking anticoagulants. The CoaguChek XS system is recommended for self-monitoring coagulation status in adults on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation if: • the person prefers this form of testing and • the person or their carer is both physically and cognitively able to self-monitor effectively. [Adapted from NICE's HealthTech guidance on atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease: self-monitoring coagulation status using point-of-care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS system), recommendation 1.1] Support Patients and carers should be trained in the effective use of the CoaguChek XS system and clinicians involved in their care should regularly review their ability to self-monitor. Equipment for self-monitoring should be regularly checked using reliable quality-control procedures, and by testing patients' equipment against a healthcare professional's coagulometer which is checked in line with an external quality assurance scheme. Ensure accurate patient records are kept and shared appropriately. [NICE's HealthTech guidance on atrial fibrillation and
