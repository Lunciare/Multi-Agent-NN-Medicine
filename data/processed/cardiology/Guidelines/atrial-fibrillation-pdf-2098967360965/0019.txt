Data source: Local data collection. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (secondary care services) make coagulometers for self-monitoring available to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, and ensure that support is available for their use. Healthcare professionals offer coagulometers to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy so that they can self-monitor their coagulation status, provided that they are willing and able to do so. Healthcare professionals also provide support for people using the coagulometers. Commissioners ensure that secondary care providers have coagulometers for self-monitoring available and offer them to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, and provide support for their use. Adults with atrial fibrillation who are taking a vitamin K antagonist over a long time are (if appropriate) offered a monitor they can use to help check how well the treatment is working, if they want to use the monitor and can do so. They are also given support by healthcare professionals to use the monitor.
