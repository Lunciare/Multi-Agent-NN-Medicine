Secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction (QS99)
Quality statement 1: Assessment of left
ventricular function
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with a myocardial infarction (MI) have an assessment of left
ventricular function before discharge.
Rationale
After an MI, some people have heart failure because of damage to heart muscle and
impaired contraction of the left ventricle. This is known as left ventricular systolic
dysfunction (LVSD). The effectiveness of drug treatment with angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists and
beta-blockers depends on left ventricular function. The assessment of left ventricular
function after an MI informs the type, titration and duration of drug treatment and the type
of cardiac rehabilitation that is appropriate. To improve the clinical effectiveness of
treatment and to ensure patient safety, this assessment should be done before discharge
from hospital.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults admitted to hospital with an MI have
an assessment of left ventricular function before discharge.
Data source: Local data collection.

Secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction (QS99)
Process
Proportion of discharges from hospital after an MI where the patient had an assessment of
left ventricular function while in hospital.
Numerator – the number in the denominator where the patient had an assessment of left
ventricular function while in hospital.
Denominator – the number of discharges from hospital after an MI.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary and tertiary care services) ensure that adults admitted to
hospital with an MI have an assessment of left ventricular function before discharge.
Healthcare professionals assess the left ventricular function of adults admitted to hospital
with an MI before discharge.
Commissioners commission services that have the capacity and expertise to assess left
ventricular function before discharge in adults admitted to hospital with an MI.
Adults who are admitted to hospital with a heart attack have a scan to see how well the
blood is being pumped through their heart. This helps with decisions about the type and
dose of drug treatment and the recovery programme that is appropriate for them. The
scan should be done before a person leaves hospital.

Assessment of left ventricular function
Left ventricular function can be assessed using a variety of methods, including
echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and nuclear
imaging. [Expert opinion]

Quality statement 2: Referral for cardiac
rehabilitation
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with a myocardial infarction (MI) are referred for cardiac
rehabilitation before discharge.
Rationale
Cardiac rehabilitation aims to address the underlying causes of cardiovascular disease and
improve physical and mental health after a heart attack. Cardiac rehabilitation encourages
a healthy lifestyle which slows the progression of heart disease. It also reduces the risk of
dying prematurely, especially as a result of a heart attack or stroke. People who are
referred to rehabilitation programmes before they are discharged from hospital have better
rates of uptake and adherence and improved clinical outcomes.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
Uptake rates of cardiac rehabilitation programmes.
Data source: Local data collection. National data on the uptake of cardiac rehabilitation
are available from the British Heart Foundation National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation
(NACR).
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary and tertiary care services) ensure that adults admitted to
hospital with an MI are referred for cardiac rehabilitation while they are in hospital.
Healthcare professionals refer adults admitted to hospital with an MI for cardiac
rehabilitation while they are in hospital.
Commissioners commission services that have the capacity and expertise to refer adults
admitted to hospital with an MI for cardiac rehabilitation while they are in hospital.
Adults who are admitted to hospital with a heart attack are referred to a cardiac
rehabilitation programme while they are in hospital. A cardiac rehabilitation programme
includes exercise sessions, information about health and lifestyle changes and how to
cope with stress. This helps to slow down or stop heart disease and to reduce the risk of a
heart attack or stroke in the future.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Cardiac rehabilitation
Cardiac rehabilitation is a coordinated and structured programme designed to remove or
reduce the underlying causes of cardiovascular disease. It provides the best possible
physical, mental and social conditions so that people can, by their own efforts, continue to
play a full part in their community. A healthier lifestyle and slowed or reversed progression
of cardiovascular disease can also be achieved. [NICE's full guideline on acute coronary
syndromes]
Cardiac rehabilitation programmes should include a range of interventions with health
education, lifestyle advice, stress management and physical exercise components. [NICE's
guideline on acute coronary syndromes, recommendations 1.8.1 and 1.8.19]

Secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction (QS99)
Quality statement 3: Communication with
primary care
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with a myocardial infarction (MI) have the results of
investigations and a plan for future treatment and monitoring shared with their GP.
Rationale
People with an MI have cardiac investigations in hospital – clear communication of these
results to primary care in a discharge summary ensures that people receive the right
treatment after they leave hospital. Other key information to be shared with the GP
includes future treatment, including incomplete drug titrations, plans for further
revascularisation procedures and plans for antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment. A
clear plan for monitoring blood pressure and renal function ensures that people are on the
correct drug dose after they leave hospital. Finally, it is also important for GPs to know that
people have been referred for cardiac rehabilitation to encourage them to attend.
Ensuring that this information is included in a discharge summary will improve clinical
outcomes, patient experience and continuity of care between primary and secondary or
tertiary care services. This is especially important for people who have had hospital
treatment for an MI outside of their local area.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary and tertiary care services) ensure that adults discharged
from hospital after an MI have the results of investigations and a plan for future treatment
and monitoring shared with their GP.
Healthcare professionals include the results of investigations and a plan for future
treatment and monitoring in the GP discharge summary for adults discharged from hospital
after an MI.
Commissioners commission services that provide GP discharge summaries for adults
discharged from hospital after an MI. The GP discharge summaries should include the
results of investigations and a plan for future treatment and monitoring.
Adults who are admitted to hospital with a heart attack have a letter sent to their GP,
which includes the results of any tests and a plan for treatment and monitoring in the
future. This helps to make sure that people get the right treatment after they leave hospital
and start a programme to improve their long-term health (cardiac rehabilitation) as soon as
possible.

Results of investigations
People admitted to hospital with an MI may have several investigations of cardiac function
while in hospital. These may include coronary angiography and should include assessment
of left ventricular function. [Expert opinion]

Secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction (QS99)
Plan for future treatment and monitoring
A plan for future treatment and monitoring after an MI should include details of:
• any further revascularisation procedures
• any drug titrations that need to be completed by the GP
• duration of antiplatelet treatment
• duration of any anticoagulant treatment
• blood pressure and renal function monitoring
• referral for cardiac rehabilitation.

Quality statement 4: Cardiac
rehabilitation – assessment appointment
Quality statement
Adults referred to a cardiac rehabilitation programme after a myocardial infarction (MI)
have an assessment appointment within 10 days of discharge from hospital.
Rationale
Starting cardiac rehabilitation as soon as possible after a heart attack significantly
improves ongoing attendance at cardiac rehabilitation programmes. Cardiac rehabilitation
improves clinical outcomes and is cost saving through a reduction in unplanned
re-admissions for cardiac problems. An assessment appointment within 10 days of
discharge ensures that people have contact with a member of the cardiac rehabilitation
team as soon as possible. Because some people may not be able to drive or may not be
ready for physical assessment within 10 days of discharge, this appointment can be an
outpatient appointment, a home visit or a telephone interview.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

Quality statement 5 (developmental):
Options for cardiac rehabilitation
Developmental quality statements set out an emergent area of cutting-edge service
delivery or technology currently found in a minority of providers and indicating outstanding
performance. They will need specific, significant changes to be put in place, such as
redesign of services or new equipment.
Quality statement
Adults referred to a cardiac rehabilitation programme after a myocardial infarction (MI) are
offered sessions during and outside working hours and the choice of undertaking the
programme at home, in the community or in a hospital setting.
Rationale
Cardiac rehabilitation programmes improve clinical outcomes for people who have had an
MI. Offering cardiac rehabilitation programmes at different times of day and at different
venues is likely to increase both uptake and adherence and to improve patient experience.
It is important that programmes are provided outside normal working hours, so that they
are accessible to people who work and to those with other commitments during the day.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details about our standing
committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is
available from the webpage for this quality standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.
Resource impact
NICE quality standards should be achievable by local services. The potential resource
impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource

Secondary prevention after a myocardial infarction (QS99)
impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource
impact products for NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes to help estimate local
costs.
Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the
quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
