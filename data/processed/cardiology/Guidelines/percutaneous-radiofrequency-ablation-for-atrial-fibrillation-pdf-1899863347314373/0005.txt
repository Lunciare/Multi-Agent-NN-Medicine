with those receiving medication (p < 0.001). 2.3.3 A large survey reported that 76% (6644/8745) of treated patients had resolution of symptoms of atrial fibrillation after a median follow-up of 12 months (this proportion ranged from 22% to 91% among different centres). For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence. 2.3.4 The Specialist Advisors noted the lack of long-term data. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 A complication rate of 6% (524/8745) was reported in the survey of 8745 patients who had undergone percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation. The most significant complications reported in this study were four early deaths (< 1%), 20 strokes (< 1%), 47 transient ischaemic attacks (1%), 117 cases of pulmonary vein stenosis (1%), 107 episodes of cardiac tamponade (1%) and 37 cases of arteriovenous fistula (< 1%). 2.4.2 In two comparative studies of 1171 and 30 patients, complications specific to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation included cardiac tamponade in less than 1% (4/589) of patients, stroke in 7% (1/14) and groin haematoma in 7% (1/14). 2.4.3 Two of the studies also reported that 2% and 4% of patients (12/589 and 340/8745, respectively) developed atypical atrial flutter of new onset after undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.
