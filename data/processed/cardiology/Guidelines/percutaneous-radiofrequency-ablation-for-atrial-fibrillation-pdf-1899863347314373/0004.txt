Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation

not refer to the procedure of atrioventricular node ablation and pacing. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In a randomised controlled trial of 70 patients, recurrence of atrial fibrillation at 1 year follow-up was 13% (4/32) after radiofrequency ablation compared with 63% (22/35) after anti-arrhythmic medication (p < 0.001). There were also significantly fewer episodes of hospitalisation in the radiofrequency ablation group: 9% (3/32) and 54% (19/35) of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). Quality-of-life measurements at 6 months favoured the radiofrequency ablation treatment. In a smaller randomised controlled trial, frequency of symptoms decreased from a mean of 42.8 attacks per month at baseline to 0.9 attacks per month at 1 year in 14 patients after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (p < 0.001). 2.3.2 In a non-randomised comparative study of 1171 patients, 78% of patients treated with radiofrequency ablation were estimated to be free of atrial fibrillation at 3 years, compared with 37% of patients treated with medication (p < 0.001). Patients receiving percutaneous radiofrequency ablation had a 54% reduction in risk of death compared with those receiving medication (p < 0.001). 2.3.3 A large survey reported that 76% (6644/8745) of treated patients had resolution of symptoms of atrial fibrillation after a median follow-up of
