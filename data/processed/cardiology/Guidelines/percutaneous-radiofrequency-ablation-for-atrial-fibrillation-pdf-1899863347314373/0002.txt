of the upper two chambers of the heart (the atria). It may be classified as paroxysmal, persistent or permanent. Patients with atrial fibrillation may be asymptomatic or they may have symptoms including palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness and fatigue. They have an increased risk of stroke as a result of blood clots forming in the left atrium and then embolising to the brain. 2.1.2 Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. 2.1.3 Conservative treatments include medication to control the heart rhythm and rate, electrical cardioversion and anticoagulation to prevent blood clots forming. Surgery for atrial fibrillation is usually performed at the same time as open heart surgery for another indication, such as for the correction of mitral valve disease. The conventional surgical approach, known as the Cox maze procedure, involves making multiple, strategically placed incisions in both atria to isolate and stop the abnormal electrical impulses. Alternative methods of creating lesions in the atria by ablation have been developed using energy sources such as radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy and ultrasound. 2.1.4 Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a treatment option for symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation refractory to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or where medical therapy is contraindicated because of co- morbidity
