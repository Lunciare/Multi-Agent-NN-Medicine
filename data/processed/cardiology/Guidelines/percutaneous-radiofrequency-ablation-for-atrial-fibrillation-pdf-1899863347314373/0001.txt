1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation appears adequate to support the use of this procedure in appropriately selected patients (see section 2.1.4) provided that normal arrangements are in place for audit and clinical governance. 1.2 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the potential complications, the likelihood of success and the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation associated with this procedure. In addition, use of NICE's information for the public is recommended. 1.3 This procedure should only be performed in specialist units and with arrangements for cardiac surgical support in the event of complications. 1.4 This procedure should only be performed by cardiologists with extensive experience of other types of ablation procedures. 1.5 The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research runs the National Congenital Heart Disease Audit database and clinicians are encouraged to enter all patients undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation onto this database. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Atrial fibrillation is the irregular and rapid beating of the upper two chambers of the heart (the atria). It may be classified as paroxysmal, persistent or permanent. Patients with atrial fibrillation may be asymptomatic or they may have
