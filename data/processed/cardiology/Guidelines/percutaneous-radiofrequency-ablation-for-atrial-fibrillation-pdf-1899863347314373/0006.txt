the studies also reported that 2% and 4% of patients (12/589 and 340/8745, respectively) developed atypical atrial flutter of new onset after undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. In a case series of 632 procedures a cardiac perforation rate of 2% (15 procedures) was reported, each case requiring pericardiocentesis: all the patients affected survived. For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence. 2.4.4 The Specialist Advisors listed the potential adverse events as stroke, cardiac tamponade, atrio-oesophageal fistula and pulmonary vein stenosis. 3 Further information 3.1 NICE has issued guidance on radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and cryoablation for atrial fibrillation in association with other cardiac surgery. 3.2 NICE has also developed interventional procedures guidance on high- intensity focused ultrasound ablation for atrial fibrillation as an associated procedure with other cardiac surgery and a guideline on the management of atrial fibrillation. Sources of evidence The evidence considered by the Interventional Procedures Advisory Committee is described in the interventional procedure overview of percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Information for patients NICE has produced information for patients and carers on this procedure. It explains the nature of the procedure and the guidance issued by NICE, and has been written with patient consent in
