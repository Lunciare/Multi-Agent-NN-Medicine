ultrasound. 2.1.4 Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a treatment option for symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation refractory to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or where medical therapy is contraindicated because of co- morbidity or intolerance. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that is usually carried out under sedation. A catheter is inserted into the femoral vein and advanced into the heart, using X-ray fluoroscopic guidance to ensure correct positioning. An attachment at the tip of the catheter sends out radiofrequency energy, producing heat that damages the targeted area of the conduction pathway. Electrophysiological testing is undertaken before the procedure to identify and map the source of the abnormal electrical signals. Advanced imaging and mapping techniques that do not require fluoroscopy have also been developed for use in this procedure. 2.2.2 Several different strategies may be used, including linear ablation in the left or right atrium and focal pulmonary vein to isolate triggers of atrial fibrillation that arise from within the pulmonary vein. This guidance does not refer to the procedure of atrioventricular node ablation and pacing. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In a randomised controlled trial of 70 patients, recurrence of atrial fibrillation at 1 year follow-up
