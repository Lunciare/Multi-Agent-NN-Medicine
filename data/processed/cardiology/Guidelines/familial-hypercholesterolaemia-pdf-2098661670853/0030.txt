may be needed to achieve the recommended LDL-C concentration • giving advice on contraception and pregnancy (to women and girls only) • monitoring growth and pubertal development (in children and young people only). Update information November 2017: Changes were made to definitions and source guidance sections throughout to ensure alignment with the updated NICE guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management. About this quality standard NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are designed to support the measurement of improvement. Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done). However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should be defined locally.
