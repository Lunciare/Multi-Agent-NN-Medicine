Familial hypercholesterolaemia

considered during breastfeeding. Quality statement 7: Drug treatment in children Quality statement Children with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are assessed for lipid-modifying drug treatment by a specialist with expertise in FH in a child-focused setting by the age of 10 years. Rationale Children with FH begin to develop cardiovascular disease before clinical signs appear, with thickening of the carotid artery wall identifiable by the age of 10 years. Once a child is diagnosed as having FH, it is important they should be assessed for lipid-modifying drug treatment as soon as possible. The assessment should include a discussion of the harms and benefits of different treatments. This allows children to start treatment as soon as it is appropriate and before significant atherosclerosis has developed. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly.
