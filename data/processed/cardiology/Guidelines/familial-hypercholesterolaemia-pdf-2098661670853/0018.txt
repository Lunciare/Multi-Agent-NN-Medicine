Familial hypercholesterolaemia

autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of elevated LDL-C levels is seen in the extended family of the proband (for example, on average 50% of first-degree relatives have elevated levels). In relatives, the age- and gender-specific diagnostic cut-offs in NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia should be used because the Simon Broome diagnostic cut-offs are not appropriate for relatives. The diagnosis of monogenic FH can also be given when the index case carries a documented FH-causing mutation in the LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 genes. Confirmed diagnosis of monogenic FH This requires evidence from DNA testing of an FH-causing mutation in the LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 genes. Before cascade testing is initiated in relatives, a diagnosis of monogenic FH in the index person should be confirmed by a specialist with expertise in FH. Cascade testing A mechanism for identifying people at risk of a genetic condition by a process of family tracing. For FH, the test employed is a DNA test where a disease-causing mutation has been identified in the index individual/proband. Quality statement 6: Drug treatment in adults Quality statement Adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) receive lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline.
