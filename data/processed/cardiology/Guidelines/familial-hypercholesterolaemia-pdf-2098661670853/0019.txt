Familial hypercholesterolaemia

statement 6: Drug treatment in adults Quality statement Adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) receive lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline. Rationale Lipid-modifying drug treatment reduces LDL-C levels and prevents the development of cardiovascular disease. Studies indicate that treatment that lowers LDL-C levels by more than 50% from baseline offers greater benefit for plaque stabilisation than treatment that is less effective at reducing LDL-C. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with FH receive lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline. Data source: Local data collection. Process Proportion of adults with FH who receive appropriate lipid-modifying drug treatment. Numerator – The number of people in the denominator receiving appropriate lipid-modifying drug treatment. Denominator – The number of adults with FH. Data source: Local data collection. Outcome Number of adults with FH whose LDL-C concentration is reduced by more than 50% from baseline within 1 year. Data source: Local
