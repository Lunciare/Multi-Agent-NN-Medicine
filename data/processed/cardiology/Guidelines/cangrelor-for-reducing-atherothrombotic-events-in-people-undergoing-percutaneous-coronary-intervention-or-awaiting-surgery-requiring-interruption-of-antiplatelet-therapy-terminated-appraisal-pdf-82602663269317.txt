Coronary heart disease - cangrelor (TA351)
Advice
NICE is unable to make a recommendation about the use in the NHS of cangrelor for
reducing atherothrombotic events in people undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention or awaiting surgery requiring interruption of anti-platelet therapy. This is
because The Medicines Company did not provide an evidence submission. They consider
that there is not enough evidence to provide an evidence submission for this appraisal.
Information
If NHS organisations wish to consider cangrelor for this indication, they should follow the
advice on rational local decision making in the NHS Constitution for England and the NHS
Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing
Rules) Regulations 2012. This outlines the approach that should be taken when there is no
NICE guidance.
NICE will review the position if the company decides that it wants to make an evidence
submission.
