Stent-graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm
KEYWORDS: stent, graft, stent graft, patients, placement, graft placement, repair, following, open, aneurysm, procedure, group, open repair, evar, trial

the EVAR 1 trial reported no significant difference between the all-cause mortality rate in the group that had had stent–graft placement and the group that had had open repair. 2.4.3 The most common adverse event following stent–graft placement was endoleak originating from retrograde collateral flow into the aneurysm sac via aortic branches (type II). This occurred in 19% of patients at 1 year. Recent developments have led to a lower incidence of procedural and post-procedural complications. The incidence of pulmonary complications and haemorrhagic events was significantly lower in the stent–graft placement group than in the open repair group. 2.4.4 Technical complications included stent migration, which happened in 1% of patients within the first year, and stent wire fracture, which happened in 3% of patients within the first year. For more details, refer to the sources of evidence. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 It was noted that these procedures are rapidly evolving. 2.5.2 The follow-up phase of the EVAR trials continues, and long-term results are expected to be published in 2010
