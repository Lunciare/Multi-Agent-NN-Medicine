Stent-graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm

patients required secondary intervention following stent–graft placement, compared with 7% (36 of 519) of patients following open repair. From the non-randomised controlled studies, secondary intervention rates were 20% following stent–graft placement and 6% following open repair. 2.3.4 The EVAR 2 trial reported that at 4 years, 26% of the group who had had stent–graft placement had required at least 1 additional intervention compared with 4% of the group who had received standard medical care. However, if crossovers are considered a secondary intervention, then the secondary intervention rate in the group that received standard medical care became comparable (approximately 30%).

In patients considered unfit for surgery, the 30-day mortality following stent–graft placement was 9% (13 of 150 patients). 2.4.2 During more prolonged follow-up to 4 years, the EVAR 1 trial reported no significant difference between the all-cause mortality rate in the group that had had stent–graft placement and the group that had had open repair. 2.4.3
