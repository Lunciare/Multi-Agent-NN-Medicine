1 Guidance This guidance replaces the previous interventional procedures guidance on stent- graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm (IPG10). The interventional procedures advisory committee reconsidered the procedure based on the results of a systematic review commissioned by NICE, following publication of the results of the EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) trials. 1.1 Current evidence on the efficacy and short-term safety of stent–graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 1.2 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the long-term uncertainties and the potential complications associated with this procedure. In particular, patients should understand: the risks of endovascular leaks; the possibility of secondary intervention; and the need for lifelong follow-up. Patients should be provided with clear written information.
