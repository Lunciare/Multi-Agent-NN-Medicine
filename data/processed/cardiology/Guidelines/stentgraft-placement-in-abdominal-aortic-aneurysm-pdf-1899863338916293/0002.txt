Stent-graft placement in abdominal aortic aneurysm

long-term data would be useful. It is recommended that all patients who have the procedure are entered onto one of the existing registries. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Stent–graft placement is used to treat aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. Weakening of the wall of the aorta can lead to widening of the vessel, or aneurysm. Aneurysms may rupture causing internal bleeding which, if untreated, is usually fatal. 2.1.2 The standard treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm is open surgical repair. The aneurysm is opened and a graft is then sewn in above and below the weakened area to allow normal blood flow. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Stent–graft placement is a minimally invasive alternative to open repair. The graft is mounted on a stent, which is inserted into the aorta via catheters in the femoral arteries. The stent–graft is deployed under X-ray guidance and positioned across the aneurysm. Additional endovascular or surgical interventions may be necessary to complete the procedure, such as insertion of stents into the iliac arteries, occlusion of selected arteries and femoro-femoral bypass grafts. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 A systematic review of the published evidence on this procedure was commissioned by the Institute and completed in June
