occlusion of selected arteries and femoro-femoral bypass grafts. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 A systematic review of the published evidence on this procedure was commissioned by the Institute and completed in June 2005. A total of 77 studies were identified for inclusion. This comprised: four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including the EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) 1 trial comparing stent–graft placement and open surgical repair, and the EVAR 2 trial comparing stent–graft placement in patients considered unfit for surgical repair with standard medical care; 17 non-randomised controlled trials; 22 comparative observational studies; 28 case series and 6 registry publications. 2.3.2 Data from the EVAR 1 trial at a median follow-up of 35 months reported an aneurysm rupture rate of 0.9% (5 of 543) following endovascular repair, compared with 0.2% (1 of 539) following open repair. Early aneurysm rupture rates of 0.2% (1 of 534) and 0.3% (13 of 3,859) were reported in 1 non- randomised controlled trial and 7 case series, respectively. 2.3.3 In the EVAR 1 trial, 16% (85 of 529) of patients required secondary intervention following stent–graft placement, compared with 7% (36 of 519) of patients following open repair. From the non-randomised controlled studies, secondary intervention rates were 20% following stent–graft
