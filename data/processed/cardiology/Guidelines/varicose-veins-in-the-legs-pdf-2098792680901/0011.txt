(key priority for implementation) Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Suitable treatment order Endothermal ablation, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy or surgery may be offered in that order, according to suitability. It recommends compression hosiery only if those 3 interventions are unsuitable for the person. The suitability of each option will depend on the person's clinical circumstances and their preferences. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on varicose veins] Truncal reflux Truncal reflux is the failure of competence of valves in 1 or more of the 3 truncal veins – the great saphenous vein, the small saphenous vein and the anterior accessory saphenous definition of reflux] Endothermal ablation There are 2 types of endothermal ablation in common use: radiofrequency ablation and laser ablation (see NICE's interventional procedures guidance on radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins and endovenous laser treatment of the long saphenous vein). Radiofrequency ablation uses radio wave electromagnetic energy to cause venous ablation and closure by raising the temperature of the inner lumen of the vein. Laser ablation uses laser energy to cause venous ablation and closure by raising the temperature of the inner lumen of the vein.
