varicose veins. Healthcare professionals ensure that they follow the local treatment pathway to offer people a treatment that is consistent with the evidence-based treatment order in NICE's guideline on varicose veins. Commissioners ensure that the full range of treatments for varicose veins is commissioned in accordance with NICE's guideline on varicose veins. People with varicose veins caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg are offered treatment with: • endothermal ablation (in which the veins are closed off using heat) • or, if endothermal ablation is unsuitable, a treatment called ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (in which the veins are closed off using a chemical foam) • or, if both endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy are unsuitable, surgery to remove the varicose veins. They should only be offered compression hosiery (stockings designed to improve blood flow by squeezing the legs) as a permanent treatment if none of the other treatments are suitable for them.
