to cause venous ablation and closure by raising the temperature of the inner lumen of the vein. [Adapted from NICE's full guideline on varicose veins, glossary definitions of radiofrequency ablation and laser ablation] Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy The injection of a sclerosing agent into a vein for chemical ablation guided by real-time ultrasound imaging (see NICE's interventional procedure guidance on ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins). [NICE's full guideline on varicose veins, glossary definition of ultrasound guided foam sclerotherapy] Surgery A surgical technique of truncal or tributary vein removal, in which the vein is physically stripped from surrounding tissues and removed. [NICE's full guideline on varicose veins, glossary definition of stripping] Compression hosiery Graduated elastic stockings work by compressing the varicose veins, so emptying them of blood and by increasing the venous return, both of which reduce venous pressure. They can be bought 'off the shelf' in different sizes or they can be made to measure and are available in different pressures. [Adapted from NICE's full guideline on varicose veins, glossary definition of compression hosiery] Reflux Reflux is the backflow of blood through a venous valve.
