atrial fibrillation in the UK, and that the analysis was based on all efficacy point estimates from the ROCKET- AF trial. The ERG also agreed that it was reasonable to use a discontinuation rate of 5 and a 90-day case fatality rate in the model. However, the ERG noted that the Committee's request to evaluate the effect of low time in therapeutic range was addressed as an amendment to the base case rather than the subgroup analysis requested. The ERG noted that varying the risk of stroke and systemic embolism according to level of INR control resulted in an increase in the ICER of £3,742 per QALY gained. 3.28 In the ERG's view, the manufacturer's inclusion of a disutility for warfarin in the model was not appropriate. The ERG noted that the manufacturer had not provided any justification for the assumption that no disutility is associated with rivaroxaban, aspirin or dabigatran etexilate. The ERG pointed out that there is evidence of disutility associated with other oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran etexilate and therefore it is unreasonable to assume there is no disutility associated with rivaroxaban. The ERG found that removing the disutility for warfarin has a substantial impact on the
