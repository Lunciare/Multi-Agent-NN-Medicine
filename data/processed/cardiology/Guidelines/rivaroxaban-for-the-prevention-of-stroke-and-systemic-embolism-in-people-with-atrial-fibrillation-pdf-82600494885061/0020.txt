gained to £27,281 per QALY gained. In addition, the ERG's scenario analysis using the alternative anticoagulation monitoring costs of £242 per person (discussed by the Committee in the ongoing appraisal of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation) increased the ICER to £62,568 per QALY gained. 3.21 The ERG was concerned that the trials included in the network meta-analysis presented by the manufacturer to compare rivaroxaban with aspirin and dabigatran etexilate were heterogeneous. The high levels of heterogeneity were not shown when the ERG conducted its own network meta-analysis restricting the network to the comparators specified in the final scope. When the ERG applied the treatment effects estimated by its network meta-analysis to the manufacturer's model, and a full incremental analysis of rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate, warfarin and aspirin was conducted, an ICER of £34,680 per QALY gained was obtained for dabigatran etexilate compared with rivaroxaban, whereas rivaroxaban had dominated dabigatran etexilate in the manufacturer's analysis. The ERG applied further adjustments to account for the following limitations: • the absence of a post-systemic embolism health state • not adjusting bleeding risk by age • not adjusting utility by age • out of date source of
