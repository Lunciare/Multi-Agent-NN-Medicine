Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

not appear to be an interaction between treatment effect and baseline CHADS risk. The Committee heard from the manufacturer that rivaroxaban would 2 be indicated for atrial fibrillation in people with 1 or more risk factors for stroke, which equates to a CHADS score of 1 or more. The Committee noted that the 2 European Medicines Agency had stated in the 'European public assessment report' for rivaroxaban that efficacy results were essentially consistent in important subgroups, such as different CHADS scores (CHADS scores 2 to 2 2 6).The Committee accepted that, given the broad spectrum of risk covered by the licensed indication for rivaroxaban, there was no plausible reason to expect that the results of ROCKET-AF would not translate to people with a lower CHADS 2 score. However, the Committee was mindful of the very small number of patients recruited to the ROCKET-AF trial with a baseline CHADS score of less than 2, but 2 concluded that the results of the ROCKET-AF trial were generalisable to UK clinical practice. 4.6 The Committee discussed the safety data from the ROCKET-AF trial. It noted that analysis of the primary safety end point of all major and non-major clinically significant bleeding events showed
