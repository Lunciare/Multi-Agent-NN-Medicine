Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

in the study comparing dabigatran etexilate with warfarin (RE-LY) had a lower risk of stroke (mean CHADS score 2.1) than the 2 population in the ROCKET-AF trial (mean CHADS score of 3.47). The Committee 2 noted that the manufacturer's interpretation of its network meta-analysis was that there was no significant difference between rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate for any outcome. The Committee noted the ERG's concerns about the validity of the manufacturer's network meta-analysis because of the clinical heterogeneity of the included trials, and the different levels of time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arms of the rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate trials. The Committee also noted that both the manufacturer's and ERG's network meta- analyses contained wide confidence intervals, and therefore the resulting efficacy point estimates were subject to considerable uncertainty. The Committee noted the comments received during consultation suggesting that the Committee should reconsider the value of the network meta-analysis. The Committee also noted the additional indirect comparison submitted by the manufacturer during consultation comparing rivaroxaban with aspirin. The Committee reconsidered the data from the manufacturer's and ERG's network meta-analyses and considered the manufacturer's additional indirect comparison comparing rivaroxaban with aspirin. The Committee concluded that it would not consider
