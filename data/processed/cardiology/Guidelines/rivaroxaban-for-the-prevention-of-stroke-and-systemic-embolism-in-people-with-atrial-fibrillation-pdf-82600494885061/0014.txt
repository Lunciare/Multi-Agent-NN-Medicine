Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

risk of each event was adjusted according to the treatment regimen the patient was receiving. Patients may stop their primary therapy and switch to a pre-specified secondary therapy at any time, although the risk adjustment applied for the remainder of that cycle is that of the primary therapy. The probabilities of treatment discontinuation for warfarin and rivaroxaban were based on data from the ROCKET-AF trial. The manufacturer assumed that treatment-discontinuation rates for aspirin, dabigatran etexilate and placebo were equivalent to that for rivaroxaban, given the similarity of administration between these interventions. 3.15 The health-state utility values and treatment-related utility values in atrial fibrillation were obtained from published sources identified by a systematic literature search. The ROCKET-AF trial did not include a generic measure of health-related quality of life (such as the EQ-5D) that could be used to estimate utilities in the model. The estimates of resources and costs were obtained from NHS reference costs for 2009 to 2010 and systematic literature searching. The manufacturer's model categorised monitoring costs into the following distinct phases: initiation, maintenance, and re-initiation. The manufacturer's model calculated the quarterly cost of initiation, maintenance and re-initiation by taking a weighted average of each cost; the costs of
