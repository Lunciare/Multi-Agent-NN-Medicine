The Committee recognised the potential benefits of alternatives such as rivaroxaban for people with atrial fibrillation, including the positive effect on quality of life of removing the restrictions and difficulties associated with taking warfarin. 4.3 The Committee considered the clinical-effectiveness data from the ROCKET-AF trial comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin. It noted that this study was the basis of the clinical-effectiveness evidence in the manufacturer's submission.
