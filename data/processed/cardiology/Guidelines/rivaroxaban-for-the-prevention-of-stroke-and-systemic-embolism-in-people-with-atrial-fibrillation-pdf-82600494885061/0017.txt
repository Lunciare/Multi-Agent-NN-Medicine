QALY gained. 3.17 In the ERG's view, a Markov model was an appropriate choice for modelling the chronic condition of atrial fibrillation. The ERG noted that the manufacturer chose a cycle length of 3 months and that only 1 event per 3-month cycle was possible because of the nature of the model. The manufacturer acknowledged that, in reality, people may experience more than 1 event in 3 months, but clinical opinion was that the probability of this would be low. The ERG agreed that assuming 1 event per model cycle was necessary and reasonable. However, the ERG noted that the manufacturer's model also suspends the risk of further events in the subsequent model cycle. The ERG considered that this additional suspension of risk was likely to bias the analysis against the more effective treatment because the overall event rate would be lower, and the potential to demonstrate clinical and economic benefits would also be lower. 3.18 The ERG identified the following limitations to the model's structural assumptions and parameter sources: • not separating out the number of hospital visits needed by people who were within and outside recommended INR control • not adjusting risk of bleeding by age; not adjusting
