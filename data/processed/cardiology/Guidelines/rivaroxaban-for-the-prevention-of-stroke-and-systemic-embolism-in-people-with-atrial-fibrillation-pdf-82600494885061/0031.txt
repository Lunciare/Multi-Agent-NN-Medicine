manufacturer had presented data from the safety-on-treatment population for its primary analyses. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that using a trial intention-to-treat population was considered to be the gold standard for estimating clinical effectiveness in a superiority trial, but the primary objective of ROCKET-AF was to establish non-inferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin so the primary analysis was different. The Committee noted the comments received during consultation that suggested that it would be more appropriate to consider the intention-to-treat population rather than the safety-on-treatment population. The Committee reconsidered which of the 2 study populations was the most appropriate. The Committee noted that the intention-to-treat population included people who had either had no treatment or switched treatment during the trial, and agreed that the estimates derived from the safety-on-treatment population of the ROCKET-AF trial provided an adequate basis for evaluating clinical effectiveness. 4.4 The Committee noted that a key uncertainty highlighted by the ERG was the generalisability of the results of ROCKET-AF to people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in the NHS. The Committee noted that the mean time in therapeutic range for the INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 for warfarin was 55% for the safety-on- treatment population in
