2 treatment arms (rivaroxaban n=7,131, warfarin n=7,133). Treatment continued until approximately 405 adjudicated primary efficacy end point events had occurred in the per-protocol population on treatment. As a result, the time on treatment varied from patient to patient depending on when they enrolled in the trial. The median duration of treatment was 590 days. 3.2 The primary efficacy end point in ROCKET-AF was a composite of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke) and non-central nervous system systemic embolism. The primary safety end point was defined as a composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. To show non-inferiority in preventing stroke and non-central nervous system embolism, the upper boundary of the confidence interval of the hazard ratio (HR) for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin had to be less than 1.46. Once non-inferiority was demonstrated for the primary outcome, further analyses investigated superiority of rivaroxaban over warfarin. 3.3 More than 50% of people in the trial received treatment for at least 18 months. The median age of study participants was 73 years and 60.3% were men. The majority of the trial population (62.4%) had previously received warfarin therapy and 36.5% had previously received aspirin. Risk of stroke at baseline was classified according
