Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

following limitations: • the absence of a post-systemic embolism health state • not adjusting bleeding risk by age • not adjusting utility by age • out of date source of post-myocardial infarction mortality risk • assuming equivalent discontinuation rates. This reduced the ICER to £12,701 per QALY gained for dabigatran etexilate compared with rivaroxaban. Exploratory analysis assuming an equivalent ability of rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate to prevent myocardial infarction further decreased the ICER to £3,578 per QALY gained for dabigatran etexilate compared with rivaroxaban. 3.22 The ERG noted the presence of potential biases in the model, with limitations of risk suspension and the absence of transient ischaemic attack and dyspepsia as adverse reactions. Removing risk suspension is likely to favour dabigatran etexilate whereas including transient ischaemic attack and dyspepsia is likely to reduce the ICER for rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran etexilate. Furthermore, the ERG noted that there is a large amount of uncertainty in the model and that the model is highly sensitive to even small changes to the discontinuation rates. Therefore, the ERG concluded that the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis should be taken into account when considering its alternative ICER for dabigatran etexilate compared with rivaroxaban.
