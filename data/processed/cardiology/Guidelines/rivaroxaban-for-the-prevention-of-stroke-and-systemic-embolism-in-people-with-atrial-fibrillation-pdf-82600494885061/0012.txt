intracranial bleed (on or off therapy) • post intracranial bleed (on or off therapy) • systemic embolism (on or off therapy) • myocardial infarction (on or off therapy) • post myocardial infarction (on or off therapy) • death. The ROCKET-AF trial results for the safety-on-treatment population were used to inform the efficacy estimates for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in people whose atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled on warfarin, and the vitamin K antagonist-naive model populations. The characteristics of the population for the analyses of rivaroxaban compared with aspirin, dabigatran etexilate and no treatment were based on the patient characteristics of a UK GP practice-based survey (Gallagher et al. 2008). Efficacy estimates for rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran etexilate and aspirin were obtained from the manufacturer's network meta-analysis. 3.12 The manufacturer classified all model events as either transient or permanent depending on associated long-term costs and consequences: • Systemic embolism, minor extracranial bleeds and major extracranial bleeds were assumed to have no lasting clinical or economic consequences and as such were considered transient events in the model. • Minor stroke, major stroke, intracranial bleeding and myocardial infarction were considered by the manufacturer to be permanent events, in the
