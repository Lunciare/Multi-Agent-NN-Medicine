Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

discontinuation rates from the ROCKET-AF trial. • Treatment-related disutility applied to warfarin of 0.05. This was obtained from a study evaluating how patients with atrial fibrillation (attending GP- and hospital-led clinics) value different health outcomes. The disutility figures for warfarin were weighted by the UK distribution of primary and secondary care anticoagulation management. • Updated results for rivaroxaban compared with aspirin based on an additional indirect comparison. This comparison used only trials comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin and warfarin with aspirin, to reduce the network heterogeneity. 3.25 The manufacturer presented the following cost-effectiveness results when all the amendments in sections 3.23 and 3.24 were applied, with an annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £580 (that is, excluding the Appraisal Committee's request to incorporate a fixed annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £242 per person): • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the licensed population (the population with 1 or more risk factors for stroke), an incremental cost of £705, an incremental QALY of 0.2459 resulting in an ICER of £2,869 per QALY gained • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the population whose INR is poorly controlled on warfarin, rivaroxaban dominated warfarin • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the population for whom warfarin
