• not separating out the number of hospital visits needed by people who were within and outside recommended INR control • not adjusting risk of bleeding by age; not adjusting utility by age • the source of myocardial infarction risk for people treated with aspirin • out of date source of post-myocardial infarction mortality risk • double counting of re-initiation costs of warfarin monitoring • suspending the risk of further events for the subsequent model cycle after an event • excluding transient ischaemic attack as a potential event. 3.19 The ERG presented an exploratory analysis in which, if possible, adjustments were made to account for the limitations identified (see section 3.18). The analysis for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin produced an incremental cost of £1,134 and a QALY gain of 0.034, resulting in an ICER of £33,758 per QALY gained. Similarly, for warfarin-naive people, after incorporating the ERG's model adjustments, the ICER for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin increased from £15,494 to £29,894 per QALY gained. However, rivaroxaban remained dominant in people whose INR was poorly controlled on warfarin after the ERG's model adjustments were incorporated. The structure of the manufacturer's model meant it wasn't possible to remove risk suspension or add
