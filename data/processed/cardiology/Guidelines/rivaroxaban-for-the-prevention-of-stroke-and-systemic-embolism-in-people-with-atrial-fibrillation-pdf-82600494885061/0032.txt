The clinical specialists confirmed this could be considered to be around the lower end of the level of control that would be expected in UK clinical practice, but there is considerable variation between different centres and also between different settings, depending on the patient group. The Committee noted that the ROCKET-AF trial had been undertaken in a number of countries, which did not all achieve similar levels of time in therapeutic range. The majority (66.5%) of the participants were recruited from centres in eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia, and in these centres the proportion of time in therapeutic range was lower than in the centres in North America and western Europe. The Committee was concerned that the effectiveness of warfarin could be underestimated if the proportion of time in therapeutic range was low, and that the UK context might be better reflected by results from centres where the time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arm more closely matched the usual levels in the UK.
