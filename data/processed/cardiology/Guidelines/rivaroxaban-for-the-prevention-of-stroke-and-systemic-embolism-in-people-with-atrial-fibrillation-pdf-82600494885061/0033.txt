Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

UK context might be better reflected by results from centres where the time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arm more closely matched the usual levels in the UK. The Committee concluded that the trial results were broadly applicable to a UK setting, but for those already taking warfarin the current level of INR control should be taken into account in any decision to switch to rivaroxaban. 4.5 The Committee also noted that patients in the ROCKET-AF trial had a mean CHADS score of 3.47, and that an inclusion criterion of the trial was a baseline 2 CHADS score of 2 or more. The scope specified that the appraisal population 2 would be people with a medium to high risk of stroke. The clinical specialists confirmed that people with a CHADS score of 3 or more would be at high risk of 2 stroke and that this population was typical of people seen in secondary care. However, this did not necessarily represent people with atrial fibrillation treated in primary care, who tended to have a lower risk of stroke. The Committee heard that people with atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin in primary care often have a CHADS score of less
