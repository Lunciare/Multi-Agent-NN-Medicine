for the ongoing appraisal of dabigatran etexilate for the same indication. However, the Committee noted the comments received during consultation, which suggested that significant numbers of people have difficulties managing their INR control and could therefore visit a clinic for monitoring up to once a week, making 30 visits a year not implausible. The Committee also noted the manufacturer's comments highlighting its concerns about the plausibility of a cost of £242 per person. The Committee therefore agreed that £242 per person was likely to be a conservative estimate of annual anticoagulant monitoring for warfarin if fixed costs were fully included, and that there was uncertainty about the cost of warfarin INR monitoring in clinical practice. 4.11 The Committee considered what the most plausible ICER would be for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin. It noted the ICERs of £2,870 per QALY gained presented by the manufacturer (which included disutility associated with warfarin, and warfarin monitoring costs of £580) and £29,500 per QALY gained (which excluded disutility associated with warfarin, and used warfarin monitoring costs of £242) presented by the ERG. The Committee agreed that because there could be some degree of utility decrement associated with treatment, and the estimate of annual anticoagulation
