Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

The Committee discussed the safety data from the ROCKET-AF trial. It noted that analysis of the primary safety end point of all major and non-major clinically significant bleeding events showed no significant differences between rivaroxaban and warfarin. There was a significant reduction in the rate of fatal bleeds and intracranial haemorrhage with rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, but a higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeds. The Committee heard from the patient experts that intracranial bleeds were considered to be a more serious complication than gastrointestinal bleeds in clinical practice, because they were more difficult to treat and often result in permanent disability. The Committee noted that the possible uncertainty in these results related to the relatively low proportion of time in therapeutic range of 55% in the warfarin arm of the trial, but concluded that the primary safety end point showed no statistically significant difference between rivaroxaban and warfarin. 4.7 The Committee then discussed the indirect clinical-effectiveness evidence for rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran etexilate and aspirin. The Committee noted that the population in the study comparing dabigatran etexilate with warfarin (RE-LY) had a lower risk of stroke (mean CHADS score 2.1) than the 2 population in the ROCKET-AF trial (mean CHADS score
