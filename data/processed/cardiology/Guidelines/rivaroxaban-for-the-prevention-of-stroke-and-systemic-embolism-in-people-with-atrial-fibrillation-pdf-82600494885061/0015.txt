Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

following distinct phases: initiation, maintenance, and re-initiation. The manufacturer's model calculated the quarterly cost of initiation, maintenance and re-initiation by taking a weighted average of each cost; the costs of the individual phases were weighted by the proportion of people treated in primary and secondary care, as indicated by the manufacturer's survey. The resulting annual cost estimates for warfarin monitoring were £663 (£448 in primary care and £215 in secondary care) for the first year and £525 (£359 in primary care and £166 in secondary care) for subsequent years. 3.16 The manufacturer's base-case analysis of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin used only statistically significant data from the ROCKET-AF safety-on-treatment population. The analysis produced an incremental cost of £740 and a QALY gain of 0.039 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £18,883 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The manufacturer also presented the results of 4 subgroup analyses: • For rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in people whose INR is poorly controlled on warfarin, rivaroxaban dominated (was more effective and cost less) warfarin. • For rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in people who had not previously received warfarin, the ICER was £15,494 per QALY gained. • For rivaroxaban compared with aspirin, the
