whose INR was poorly controlled on warfarin after the ERG's model adjustments were incorporated. The structure of the manufacturer's model meant it wasn't possible to remove risk suspension or add transient ischaemic attack as a potential event. Consequently, the ERG was unable to fully quantify the impact of these limitations on the ICERs. However, the ERG considered that suspending risk and excluding transient ischaemic attack as an event would favour rivaroxaban (that is, the removal of these limitations would decrease the ICER for rivaroxaban compared with warfarin), because warfarin is generally less effective than rivaroxaban (based on the safety-on-treatment population of ROCKET-AF). 3.20 In the ERG's view, the manufacturer's base-case model is driven by the cost of anticoagulation monitoring rather than the differential effectiveness of rivaroxaban and warfarin. The ROCKET-AF trial showed that, for most outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference between rivaroxaban and warfarin. The ERG highlighted that when the cost of anticoagulation monitoring was separated out by INR range the ICER substantially increased from £18,883 per QALY gained to £27,281 per QALY gained. In addition, the ERG's scenario analysis using the alternative anticoagulation monitoring costs of £242 per person (discussed by the Committee in the ongoing appraisal
