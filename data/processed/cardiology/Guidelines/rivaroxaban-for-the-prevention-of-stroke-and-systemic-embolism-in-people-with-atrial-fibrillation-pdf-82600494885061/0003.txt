Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). 3.1 The main clinical effectiveness evidence came from 1 multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trial. The ROCKET-AF trial ('Rivaroxaban once daily oral direct factor Xa inhibitor compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and embolism trial in atrial fibrillation') compared rivaroxaban with dose- adjusted warfarin. The manufacturer also compared rivaroxaban with aspirin and dabigatran etexilate (110 mg or 150 mg twice a day) using a network meta- analysis in people for whom anticoagulation therapy was considered suitable. The ROCKET-AF trial was designed as double-blind, double dummy trial comparing rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg once a day) with warfarin (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) for the prevention of stroke and thromboembolic events in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at risk of future thromboembolic events. People were randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment groups with equal probability (1:1 allocation ratio). The study took place in 45 countries, including the UK, and a total of 14,264 people were enrolled across the 2 treatment arms (rivaroxaban n=7,131, warfarin n=7,133). Treatment continued until approximately 405 adjudicated primary efficacy end point events had occurred in the per-protocol population on treatment. As a result, the
