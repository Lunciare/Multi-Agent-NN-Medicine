of 80 years. A fixed-effect model was used because of the high degree of homogeneity between the included trials. The efficacy estimates from this network meta-analysis were used in the ERG's cost-effectiveness analyses. 3.10 The manufacturer developed a Markov model that compares rivaroxaban (20 mg once a day) with warfarin (adjusted dose warfarin at 4.5 mg once a day, target INR 2.5, range 2.0 to 3.0), aspirin (150 mg once a day), dabigatran etexilate (110 mg to 150 mg twice a day) and no treatment. The population in the model is the same as the ROCKET-AF safety-on-treatment population. The model has a lifetime time horizon and a UK NHS perspective. 3.11 The model included the following health states: • anticoagulant initiation • stable atrial fibrillation (on or off therapy) • minor stroke (on or off therapy) • major stroke (on or off therapy) • post minor stroke (on therapy) • post major stroke (on therapy) • minor bleed (on or off therapy) • major bleed (on or off therapy) • intracranial bleed (on or off therapy) • post intracranial bleed (on or off therapy) • systemic embolism (on or off therapy) • myocardial infarction (on or off therapy) • post
