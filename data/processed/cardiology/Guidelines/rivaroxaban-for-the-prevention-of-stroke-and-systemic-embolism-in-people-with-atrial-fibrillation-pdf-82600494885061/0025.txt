gained • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the population whose INR is poorly controlled on warfarin, rivaroxaban dominated warfarin • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the population for whom warfarin is considered unsuitable, the ICER was £9,170 per QALY gained. 3.26 The manufacturer presented the following cost-effectiveness results when all the amendments detailed in sections 3.23 and 3.24 were applied, with an annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £242 per person (that is, including all of the Appraisal Committee's requests): • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the licensed population (the population with 1 or more risk factors for stroke), an incremental cost of £2,220, a QALY gain of 0.2459 resulting in an ICER of £9,031 per QALY gained • for rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the population whose INR is poorly controlled on warfarin, the ICER was £4,350 per QALY gained. 3.27 The ERG provided a critique and exploratory analysis of the manufacturer's additional analyses. The ERG agreed that the manufacturer had adequately provided a model cohort representative of people with atrial fibrillation in the UK, and that the analysis was based on all efficacy point estimates from the ROCKET- AF trial. The ERG also agreed that it was reasonable to
