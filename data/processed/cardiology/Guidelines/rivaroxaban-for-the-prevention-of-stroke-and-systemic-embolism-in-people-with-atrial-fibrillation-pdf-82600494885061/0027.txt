Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

etexilate and therefore it is unreasonable to assume there is no disutility associated with rivaroxaban. The ERG found that removing the disutility for warfarin has a substantial impact on the ICER, increasing it from £2,869 to £10,764 per QALY gained. 3.29 The ERG re-ran the manufacturer's updated cost-effectiveness analysis. The ERG noted that in both the original and updated models the manufacturer had categorised systemic embolism as a temporary event. The ERG judged that in order to adequately approximate a post-systemic embolism health state (which would account for the increased risk of stroke following a systemic embolism) it was appropriate to amend the model so that after a systemic embolism patients move into the post-minor stroke health state. The ERG also noted that the manufacturer's updated model continues to use the out-of-date source of post- myocardial infarction mortality risk. The ERG judged that it was more appropriate to use an updated mortality risk post myocardial infarction that took account of current use of statins. The ERG's analysis included a fixed annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £242 per person as requested by the Appraisal Committee (see section 3.23) but did not include any disutility associated with warfarin or any other
