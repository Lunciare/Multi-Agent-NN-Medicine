The Committee concluded that the disutility value used in the economic model for warfarin may have resulted in a bias in the manufacturer's economic analysis in favour of rivaroxaban. 4.10 The Committee discussed the costs associated with warfarin INR monitoring. The Committee noted that the manufacturer' model assumed an average annual anticoagulant monitoring cost of £580 per person in the year that treatment is first initiated and £535 once the person is stabilised on warfarin. The clinical specialists agreed that the annual cost of anticoagulant monitoring for each person treated with warfarin was likely to be lower than the manufacturer's estimate in clinical practice, but a precise estimate could not be given because costs varied considerably between people (for example, they are higher in those with poor INR control) and between centres. The Committee was aware of the uncertainty, but in the interests of consistency had requested that the manufacturer use £242 in its economic model, in line with what it had accepted for the ongoing appraisal of dabigatran etexilate for the same indication. However, the Committee noted the comments received during consultation, which suggested that significant numbers of people have difficulties managing
