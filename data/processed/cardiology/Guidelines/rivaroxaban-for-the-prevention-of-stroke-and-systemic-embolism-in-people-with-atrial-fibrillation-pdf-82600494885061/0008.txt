Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

rivaroxaban and warfarin, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Bleeding sites for the primary safety end point differed between treatment groups. Rivaroxaban was more often associated with bleeding at sites throughout the gastrointestinal tract (3.15% compared with 2.16%, p<0.001) but intracranial haemorrhage rates were significantly lower with rivaroxaban than with warfarin (0.5% compared with 0.7%, p=0.02). Following a request from the ERG the manufacturer provided subgroup analyses for the safety-on-treatment and intention-to-treat populations in people who had previously used vitamin K antagonists, people who had not previously used vitamin K antagonists, people with a time in therapeutic range below 60%, and those with a time in therapeutic range above 60%. In the safety-on-treatment population, superiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin was demonstrated for the primary outcome (composite of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism) in people who had not previously used vitamin K antagonists (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.97) but not in people who had previously used vitamin K antagonists (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.08). 3.8 The manufacturer undertook a Bayesian network meta-analysis comparison of rivaroxaban with warfarin, aspirin, no treatment and dabigatran etexilate.
