The ERG undertook an exploratory network meta-analysis comparing rivaroxaban with dabigatran etexilate, aspirin, placebo, and adjusted standard dose warfarin. It included data from 8 of the 18 studies from the manufacturer's network meta- analysis: • 1 comparing dabigatran etexilate with warfarin • 1 comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin • 3 comparing aspirin with warfarin • 3 comparing warfarin with placebo. The ERG judged that including only these 8 trials would reduce the amount of heterogeneity in the network. Only dosing strategies that the ERG considered to be comparable were included (that is, rivaroxaban 20 mg per day, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice a day, aspirin 300 mg per day, and adjusted dose warfarin aiming at a target INR range between 2 and 3). Dabigatran etexilate at a dose of 110 mg twice daily was not included in the analysis because the economic model could not accommodate a dosing regimen in which the dose is reduced from 150 mg twice daily to 110 mg twice daily when the patient reaches the age of 80 years. A fixed-effect model was used because of the high degree of homogeneity between the included trials. The efficacy estimates from this network meta-analysis were used in the
