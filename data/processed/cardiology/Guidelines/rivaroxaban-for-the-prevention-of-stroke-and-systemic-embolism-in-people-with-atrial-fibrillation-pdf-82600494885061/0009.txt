vitamin K antagonists (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.08). 3.8 The manufacturer undertook a Bayesian network meta-analysis comparison of rivaroxaban with warfarin, aspirin, no treatment and dabigatran etexilate. The clinical evidence for the rivaroxaban with warfarin comparison was taken from the ROCKET-AF trial. Evidence for the other comparators was obtained from studies found by a systematic literature search. The manufacturer identified 18 studies for inclusion in the network meta-analysis: • 1 comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin • 7 comparing aspirin with placebo or control • 8 comparing warfarin with aspirin • 1 comparing a vitamin K antagonist with clopidogrel plus aspirin • 1 comparing dabigatran etexilate with warfarin (the RE-LY study). The manufacturer reported network meta-analysis results for the outcomes using the ROCKET-AF safety-on-treatment population data set. At the request of the ERG, the manufacturer also provided the results for the outcomes using the ROCKET-AF intention-to-treat population dataset. The efficacy estimates from this network meta-analysis using the ROCKET-AF safety-on-treatment population data set were used in the manufacturer's cost-effectiveness analyses. 3.9 The ERG undertook an exploratory network meta-analysis comparing rivaroxaban with dabigatran etexilate, aspirin, placebo, and adjusted standard dose warfarin. It included data from 8 of the 18 studies from the
