control, followed by western Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and eastern Europe. 3.4 Three analyses were defined in the manufacturer's submission for the efficacy analysis: the intention-to-treat set (all patients randomised), the safety-on- treatment set (all intention-to-treat patients who had taken at least 1 dose of the study drug and were followed for events) and the per-protocol set (all intention- to-treat patients excluding those who had major pre-defined protocol deviations). The primary non-inferiority analysis of the ROCKET-AF trial was conducted on the per-protocol and the safety-on-treatment population data sets. The superiority analyses were conducted on the safety-on-treatment population data sets. In addition to these analyses, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess non- inferiority and superiority in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety analysis was conducted on the safety-on-treatment population data. 3.5 Pre-planned subgroup analyses were conducted. These were by region, prior use of vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin), and history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, and non-central nervous system systemic embolism. Other subgroups included prior chronic aspirin use, sex, age, family origin, renal function, body mass index, weight, CHADS score, congestive heart failure, 2 hypertension, diabetes, type of atrial fibrillation, proton pump inhibitor use at baseline, and prior myocardial
