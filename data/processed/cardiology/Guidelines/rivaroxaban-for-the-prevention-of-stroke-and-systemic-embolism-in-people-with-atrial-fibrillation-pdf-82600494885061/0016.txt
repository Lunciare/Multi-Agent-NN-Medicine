less) warfarin. • For rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in people who had not previously received warfarin, the ICER was £15,494 per QALY gained. • For rivaroxaban compared with aspirin, the ICER was £2,083 per QALY gained. • For rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban dominated dabigatran etexilate. The manufacturer carried out univariate sensitivity analysis on the base case, scenario analyses and subgroup analyses. The main drivers of the model results were consistent across analyses, with the cost of warfarin monitoring in primary care having a major impact on all ROCKET-AF-based analyses. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that, using the base case, rivaroxaban had a 75% probability of being cost effective at a maximum acceptable ICER of £20,000 per QALY gained and an 88% probability at £30,000 per QALY gained. The manufacturer's scenario analysis of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin used all point estimates from the ROCKET-AF safety-on-treatment population regardless of their statistical significance (that is, both statistically significant and non-statistically significant point estimates were used). The resulting ICER was £8,732 per QALY gained. 3.17 In the ERG's view, a Markov model was an appropriate choice for modelling the chronic condition of atrial fibrillation. The ERG noted that the manufacturer chose a
