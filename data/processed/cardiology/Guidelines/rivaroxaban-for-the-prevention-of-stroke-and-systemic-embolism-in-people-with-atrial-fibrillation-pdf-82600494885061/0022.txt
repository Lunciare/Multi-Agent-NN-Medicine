rates. Therefore, the ERG concluded that the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis should be taken into account when considering its alternative ICER for dabigatran etexilate compared with rivaroxaban. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that dabigatran etexilate was dominant in 45% of the 1,000 runs and dominated in 35% of runs. Manufacturer's additional analyses 3.23 The manufacturer provided additional analyses in response to the Appraisal Committee's request for further clarification on the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban presented in the appraisal consultation document. The manufacturer provided a revised cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating the following amendments requested by the Appraisal Committee: • data from the General Practice Research Database to provide event rates according to baseline level of stroke risk and the distribution of patients with different CHADS scores from the study of Gallagher et al. (2008) 2 • all the efficacy point estimates from the safety-on-treatment population of the ROCKET-AF trial • revised event rate in the warfarin arm to reflect the time in therapeutic range achieved in trial centres in western Europe (60.62%) • fixed annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £242 per person in the sensitivity analysis only. 3.24 In addition to the amendments requested by the Appraisal Committee, the
