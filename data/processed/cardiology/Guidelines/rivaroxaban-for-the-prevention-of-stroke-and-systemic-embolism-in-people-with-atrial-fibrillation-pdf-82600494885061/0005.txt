and 60.3% were men. The majority of the trial population (62.4%) had previously received warfarin therapy and 36.5% had previously received aspirin. Risk of stroke at baseline was classified according to CHADS score, which is used to predict the risk of stroke 2 in people with atrial fibrillation. The trial entry criteria included a history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack or systemic embolism, or a CHADS score of 2 or 2 more. The mean CHADS score was 3.48 for the rivaroxaban group and 3.46 for 2 the warfarin group; 99.98% of the trial population had a baseline CHADS score of 2 2 or more and 86.95% a baseline CHADS score of 3 or more. Three participants 2 (0.02% of the trial population) had a baseline CHADS score of 1. In the warfarin 2 group the mean time in therapeutic range for the INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 was 55% (58% median). Some variability was observed in time in therapeutic range by region: north America had the highest overall INR control, followed by western Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and eastern Europe. 3.4 Three analyses were defined in the manufacturer's submission for the efficacy analysis: the intention-to-treat set (all patients
