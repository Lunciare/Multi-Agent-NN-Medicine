age, family origin, renal function, body mass index, weight, CHADS score, congestive heart failure, 2 hypertension, diabetes, type of atrial fibrillation, proton pump inhibitor use at baseline, and prior myocardial infarction. Results were summarised by subgroup based on data from the safety-on-treatment and intention-to-treat populations. 3.6 The non-inferiority of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin was demonstrated for the primary outcome (composite of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism) in both the per-protocol and safety-on-treatment populations. The results for the per-protocol population were HR 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.96) and HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.95) for the safety-on treatment population. Superiority of rivaroxaban over warfarin was also demonstrated in the safety-on-treatment population, but was not demonstrated for this outcome in the sensitivity analysis using the intention-to-treat population data set (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.03). 3.7 For the primary safety end point of major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding, the results from the safety-on-treatment population data for ROCKET- AF suggest a comparable safety profile for rivaroxaban and warfarin, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Bleeding sites for the primary safety end point differed between treatment
