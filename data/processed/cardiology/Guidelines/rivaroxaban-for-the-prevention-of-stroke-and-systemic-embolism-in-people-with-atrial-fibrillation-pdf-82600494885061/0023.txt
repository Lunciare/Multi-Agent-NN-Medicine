Europe (60.62%) • fixed annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £242 per person in the sensitivity analysis only. 3.24 In addition to the amendments requested by the Appraisal Committee, the manufacturer also amended the model to include the following: • Revised annual warfarin INR monitoring cost of £580. The manufacturer used the same unit costs as the original model; however, the number of visits needed for the re-initiation was reduced from 7 to 5 per 3-month cycle. The costs associated with warfarin monitoring in primary care in the updated model were £175.50 for initiation of warfarin (calculated as a weighted average of patients who had, and had not received previous warfarin), £135 for maintenance on warfarin and £135 for re-initiation of warfarin. • Case fatality rates of 90 days instead of the 30-day rates in the original model. • Updated 'real world' discontinuation rates. For warfarin these came from the General Practice Research Database. For rivaroxaban they were calculated by applying relative risks from the General Practice Research Database to discontinuation rates from the ROCKET-AF trial. • Treatment-related disutility applied to warfarin of 0.05. This was obtained from a study evaluating how patients with atrial fibrillation (attending GP- and hospital-led
