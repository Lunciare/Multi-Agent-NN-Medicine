Rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial

as such were considered transient events in the model. • Minor stroke, major stroke, intracranial bleeding and myocardial infarction were considered by the manufacturer to be permanent events, in the sense that they have lasting clinical and economic consequences. Consequently, the manufacturer developed post-event health states to account for the different risks, costs and utilities associated with surviving a permanent event. 3.13 The manufacturer highlighted that increasing age was an important risk factor for ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism, and adjusted the baseline risk of these events to account for patients aging as they move through the model. Risks were calculated using the Framingham risk equations. In the model, a weighted average relative risk (weighted by the proportion of patients in each risk group at initiation) is calculated for each age group and applied to the baseline risk as patients enter that age group. The risks of extracranial bleeding, intracranial bleeding and myocardial infarction were assumed to be independent of time and, therefore, were not adjusted for. 3.14 The baseline risk of each event was adjusted according to the treatment regimen the patient was receiving. Patients may stop their primary therapy and switch to a pre-specified secondary therapy at any
