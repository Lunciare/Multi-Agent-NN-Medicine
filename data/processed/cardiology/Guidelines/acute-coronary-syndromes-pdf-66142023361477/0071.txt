In practice, the anticoagulant will often be suspended for a short period (perhaps using heparin cover). The evidence available showed that continuing dual antiplatelet therapy plus an anticoagulant after the acute PCI phase increases the risk of bleeding complications, and so a recommendation raising awareness of this issue was included. The committee therefore agreed that either aspirin or the second antiplatelet agent should be stopped, but unfortunately there was no evidence to show at what point this should happen. In the absence of any conclusive data, recommendations for treatment after the initial phase were based on the knowledge and experience of the committee. For people who have had PCI and stent insertion, they agreed that it would be safest to combine an anticoagulant with a potent antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel), whereas for those who have had medical management or had angioplasty without stenting, the anticoagulant should
