people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who have a high risk of bleeding associated with any of the following: • advancing age • known bleeding complications • renal impairment • low body weight. [2010] 1.2.6 Do not offer dual antiplatelet therapy to people with chest pain before a diagnosis of unstable angina or NSTEMI is made. [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on dual antiplatelet therapy for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: antiplatelet therapy. Risk assessment 1.2.7 As soon as the diagnosis of unstable angina or NSTEMI is made, and aspirin and antithrombin therapy have been offered, formally assess individual risk of future adverse cardiovascular events using an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality (for example, Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events [GRACE]). [2010] 1.2.8 Include in the formal risk assessment: Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) • a full clinical history (including age, previous myocardial infarction [MI] and previous PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) • a physical examination (including measurement of blood pressure
