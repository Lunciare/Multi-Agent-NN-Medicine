non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), antithrombin therapy before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), complete revascularisation versus culprit vessel only PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), drug-eluting stents, combination antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment for people with a separate indication for anticoagulation, and duration of beta- blocker treatment for people with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after MI. We have made new recommendations. These recommendations are marked [2020]. We have also made some changes without an evidence review: • We have aligned terminology with the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure in adults. • We have clarified advice on drug therapy for secondary prevention to indicate that dual antiplatelet therapy may not be suitable for people with a separate indication for anticoagulation. • We have indicated when to offer a cardiology assessment to someone who has had a previous MI. These recommendations are marked [2007, amended 2020]. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) Minor changes since publication December 2024: We added links to relevant technology appraisal guidance in the sections on dual antiplatelet therapy, coronary angiography with follow-on PCI, drug therapy for secondary prevention and people with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. December 2021: Following a surveillance review we have updated recommendation 1.3.7 to
