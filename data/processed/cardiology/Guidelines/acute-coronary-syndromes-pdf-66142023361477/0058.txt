Acute coronary syndromes

primary PCI or later during the same admission. They were concerned that the clinical benefits may be lower and costs may be higher when people are discharged and readmitted, and noted that delaying treatment of the non-culprit lesions is worrying for patients. However, they agreed that the optimal timing within the index admission will depend on a number of variables and is best left to the discretion of the clinical team. People with cardiogenic shock were excluded from these studies of multivessel PCI and the committee agreed that, in view of the results from the separate CULPRIT-SHOCK trial, it was not appropriate to recommend multivessel PCI for this group during the index admission. How the recommendations might affect practice Current practice is variable across centres and also within centres. Some offer multivessel Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) PCI during the first procedure for acute STEMI but others may postpone this (either to later within the index admission or to a later readmission). Some operate on the culprit vessel only. The recommendations are therefore likely to result in a change in practice, but not for all centres or all professionals performing PCI. Because the recommendations allow for multivessel PCI to be either
