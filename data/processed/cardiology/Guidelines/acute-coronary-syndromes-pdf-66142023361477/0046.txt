undertaken with caution after a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation by the prescribing physician indicates that benefits in terms of prevention of ischaemic events outweigh the risk of serious bleedings'. There were not enough data available for this guideline to determine whether prasugrel is less effective, or even harmful, in people aged 75 and over. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dual antiplatelet therapy for this group of older people. 2 Primary PCI and fibrinolysis in people with acute STEMI who have a long anticipated transfer time for primary PCI In people with acute STEMI who present more than 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, is a primary PCI-related delay of 120 to 180 minutes associated with outcomes similar to, better or worse than pre-hospital administered fibrinolysis? [2013] Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) Why this is important Primary PCI is the preferred coronary reperfusion therapy provided it can be delivered 'in a timely fashion'. It is suggested that primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy for primary PCI-related delays of at least up to 2 hours. However, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether primary PCI is still preferable at primary PCI-related time delays of more than 2 hours.
