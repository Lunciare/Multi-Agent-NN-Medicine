how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on antithrombin therapy for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: antithrombin for unstable angina and NSTEMI. 1.2.17 For people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who are having coronary angiography, offer: • prasugrel or ticagrelor, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, if they have no separate indication for ongoing oral anticoagulation (if using prasugrel, only give it once coronary anatomy has been defined and PCI is intended; for people aged 75 and over, think about whether the person's risk of bleeding with prasugrel outweighs its effectiveness) • clopidogrel, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, if they have a separate indication for ongoing oral anticoagulation. [2020] Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for some people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who are having coronary angiography. For full details, see the guidance on: • prasugrel (TA317, 2014) • ticagrelor (TA236, 2011). For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on dual antiplatelet
