of at least up to 2 hours. However, there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether primary PCI is still preferable at primary PCI-related time delays of more than 2 hours. No specifically designed randomised controlled trial (RCT) or observational study has addressed the issue of the extent to which primary PCI-related time delay (and other factors such as presentation delay and a person's risk profile) diminishes the advantages of primary PCI over fibrinolysis. For example, in more geographically remote areas, a short presentation delay together with an anticipated long primary PCI-related delay could favour a strategy of pre-hospital fibrinolysis. To answer this question, an RCT of pre-hospital fibrinolysis versus primary PCI in people with acute STEMI who have a primary PCI-related time delay of 2 hours or more is needed. Primary endpoints would include cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and other major adverse cardiovascular events. 3 Ischaemia testing What is the role of ischaemia testing in people after an acute coronary syndrome and what is the comparative efficacy and cost effectiveness of the different non-invasive tests (for example, stress electrocardiogram [ECG], echocardiography, radionuclide scanning and MRI)? [2010] Why this is important An increasing number of non-invasive tests are now available for
