Acute coronary syndromes

of the different non-invasive tests (for example, stress electrocardiogram [ECG], echocardiography, radionuclide scanning and MRI)? [2010] Why this is important An increasing number of non-invasive tests are now available for the investigation of suspected myocardial ischaemia. These tests need different equipment, different clinical expertise, come at different costs and may differ in their ability to detect and quantify myocardial ischaemia. Their place in the routine investigation of patients admitted with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (particularly those who have not undergone angiography), as opposed to their selective use, is not clear. Management of unstable angina and NSTEMI would be enhanced if the relative place of these investigations were better understood and an assessment of their cost effectiveness made. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) 4 Relationship between volume of procedures and clinical outcomes What is the relationship between hospital volume of primary PCI procedures and optimal outcomes in people with acute STEMI? [2013] Why this is important There is a suggestion that outcomes may be better in larger-volume primary PCI units, and some retrospective registries have reported data to support this. However, the quality of the data is poor and still leaves the question open. In the UK, primary
