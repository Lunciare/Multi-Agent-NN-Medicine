may be used to treat hypertension and/or angina. For people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, use amlodipine, and avoid verapamil, diltiazem and short-acting dihydropyridine agents in line with the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure in adults.

[2007] Aldosterone antagonists in people with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction 1.4.38 For people who have had an acute MI and who have symptoms and/or signs of heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, initiate treatment with an aldosterone antagonist licensed for post-MI treatment within 3 to 14 days of the MI, preferably after ACE inhibitor therapy. [2007] 1.4.39 People who have recently had an acute MI and have clinical heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, but who are already being treated with an aldosterone antagonist for a concomitant condition (for example, chronic heart failure), should continue with the aldosterone antagonist or an alternative, Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) licensed for early post-MI treatment. [2007] 1.4.40 For people who have had a proven MI in the past and heart failure due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, treatment
