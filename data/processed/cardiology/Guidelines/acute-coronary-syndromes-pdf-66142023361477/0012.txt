Acute coronary syndromes

(NG185) • a full clinical history (including age, previous myocardial infarction [MI] and previous PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) • a physical examination (including measurement of blood pressure and heart rate) • a resting 12-lead ECG, looking particularly for dynamic or unstable patterns that indicate myocardial ischaemia • blood tests (such as troponin I or T, creatinine, glucose and haemoglobin). [2010] 1.2.9 Record the results of the risk assessment in the person's care record. [2010] 1.2.10 Use risk assessment to guide clinical management, and balance the benefit of a treatment against any risk of related adverse events in the light of this assessment. [2010] 1.2.11 Use predicted 6-month mortality to categorise the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events as shown in table 1. [2010] Table 1 Categorising risk of future adverse cardiovascular events Predicted 6-month mortality Risk of future adverse cardiovascular events 1.5% or below Lowest >1.5% to 3.0% Low >3.0% to 6.0% Intermediate >6.0% to 9.0% High over 9.0% Highest Categories of risk are derived from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) database.
