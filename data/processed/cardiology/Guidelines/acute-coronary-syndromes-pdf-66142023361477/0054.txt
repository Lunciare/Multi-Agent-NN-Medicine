and 1 year. Prasugrel and ticagrelor were more effective than clopidogrel at both time-points. In a network meta-analysis of the 30-day data, prasugrel was more effective than ticagrelor, although with some uncertainty around this conclusion. Prasugrel was more effective than ticagrelor at 1 year with noteworthy differences in all-cause mortality and re-infarction. A detailed cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed incorporating data at both time-points with either prasugrel or ticagrelor being most cost effective in different scenarios using different clinical data. The results favouring prasugrel were driven by the ISAR-REACT 5 trial that directly compared ticagrelor and prasugrel and these were considered the most relevant. The committee agreed that clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness results are directly applicable to the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the NHS, and recommended prasugrel for people with STEMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The final wording of the recommendation reflects the wording of the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel. If there is particular concern about bleeding risk from prasugrel in a person aged 75 or over, either ticagrelor or clopidogrel might be used instead; although ticagrelor is the more cost effective of the two, it also carries a higher bleeding risk.
