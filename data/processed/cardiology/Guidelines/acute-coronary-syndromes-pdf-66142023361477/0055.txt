Acute coronary syndromes

aged 75 or over, either ticagrelor or clopidogrel might be used instead; although ticagrelor is the more cost effective of the two, it also carries a higher bleeding risk. An exception was added for people needing anticoagulation for a separate reason (for example, ongoing atrial fibrillation). For these people, clopidogrel is preferred because of Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) the high bleeding risk of full anticoagulation plus prasugrel. How the recommendation might affect practice In the UK, prasugrel is currently used less than ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The recommendation will therefore require a change in prescribing for most centres, but should be easily achievable. Prasugrel costs less than ticagrelor, but considerably more than clopidogrel, and although some areas will see a cost saving from switching to prasugrel from ticagrelor, the overall effect of this recommendation will be an increase in cost to the NHS. Return to recommendations Antithrombin therapy during primary PCI for acute STEMI Recommendations 1.1.12 and 1.1.13 Why the committee made the recommendations When considering the evidence on the effectiveness of bivalirudin for people with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, the committee gave more weight to studies that were closest to current UK practice. These included studies that used bailout
