Acute coronary syndromes

is currently achieved in the UK for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. This could cause practical difficulty in using prasugrel because its licence effectively prevents its use before angiography, and this could leave people with unstable angina or NSTEMI without dual antiplatelet therapy for several days. The committee therefore recommended either prasugrel or ticagrelor for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI intended for PCI, depending on individual circumstances. The final wording of the recommendation reflects the wording of the summary of product characteristics for prasugrel. Unstable angina and NSTEMI – management when PCI is not indicated Although many people with unstable angina or NSTEMI proceed to PCI, for some medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery are better options. Prasugrel is not licensed in these circumstances. The evidence available for medical management shows better outcomes with ticagrelor than clopidogrel. This is consistent with results from the larger datasets for people having PCI. The committee therefore recommended ticagrelor for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI having either medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery. However, the committee also noted that clopidogrel may be the safer agent for people who are at high risk of bleeding but
