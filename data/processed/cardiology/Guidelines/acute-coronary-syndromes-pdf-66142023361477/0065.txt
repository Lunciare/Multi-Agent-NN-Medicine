assessment of baseline risk of adverse events. The committee agreed that this should influence the choice between early invasive intervention (coronary angiography, with PCI if indicated) and conservative management (initial medical management, proceeding to coronary angiography and PCI if there is evidence of recurrent ischaemia). Studies comparing these options show a short-term harm with an invasive strategy, but this is offset by the clinical benefits in the months following the procedure. A cost-effectiveness analysis found that routine early invasive intervention was cost effective in people at higher risk of adverse events, but conservative management was the most cost-effective option for people at lower risk. This was because overall health gains were greater in those at higher baseline risk. Most of the evidence was already available at the time of the 2010 guideline, and the committee recognised that the data may be less applicable to modern practice than had been the case in 2010. Nonetheless, they agreed that early angiography should be the default recommendation for most people at intermediate or higher baseline risk of adverse outcomes. They accepted the previous committee's interpretation of the appropriate risk cut-offs based on their detailed work mapping of the evidence to real-world UK risk
