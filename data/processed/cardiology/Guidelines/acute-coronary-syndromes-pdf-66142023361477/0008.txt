Acute coronary syndromes

electrocardiogram (ECG) to people with acute STEMI treated with fibrinolysis, 60 to 90 minutes after administration. For those who have residual Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) ST-segment elevation suggesting failed coronary reperfusion: • offer immediate coronary angiography, with follow-on PCI if indicated • do not repeat fibrinolytic therapy. [2013] 1.1.22 If a person with acute STEMI has recurrent myocardial ischaemia after fibrinolysis, seek immediate specialist cardiological advice and, if appropriate, offer coronary angiography, with follow-on PCI if indicated. [2013] 1.1.23 Consider coronary angiography during the same hospital admission for people with acute STEMI who are clinically stable after successful fibrinolysis. [2013] Management for people with STEMI not treated with PCI 1.1.24 Offer ticagrelor, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, to people with acute STEMI not treated with PCI, unless they have a high bleeding risk. [2020] 1.1.25 Consider clopidogrel, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, or aspirin alone, for people with acute STEMI not treated with PCI, if they have a high bleeding risk. [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on dual antiplatelet therapy for people with STEMI
