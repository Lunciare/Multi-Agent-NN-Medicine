with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. [2013] 1.4.32 Offer all people who have had an MI more than 12 months ago, who have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a beta-blocker whether or not they have symptoms. For people with heart failure plus reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, manage the condition in line with the NICE guideline on chronic heart failure in adults. [2013] 1.4.33 Do not offer people without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or heart Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) failure, who have had an MI more than 12 months ago, treatment with a beta- blocker unless there is an additional clinical indication for a beta-blocker. [2013] Calcium channel blockers 1.4.34 Do not routinely offer calcium channel blockers to reduce cardiovascular risk after an MI. [2007] 1.4.35 If beta-blockers are contraindicated or need to be discontinued, diltiazem or verapamil may be considered for secondary prevention in people without pulmonary congestion or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. [2007] 1.4.36 For people whose condition is stable after an MI, calcium channel blockers may be used to treat hypertension and/or angina. For people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, use amlodipine, and avoid verapamil, diltiazem and short-acting dihydropyridine agents in line with
