Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: antithrombin therapy in adults with STEMI intended for primary PCI. Thrombus extraction during primary PCI 1.1.14 Consider thrombus aspiration during primary PCI for people with acute STEMI. [2013] 1.1.15 Do not routinely use mechanical thrombus extraction during primary PCI for people with acute STEMI. [2013] Complete or culprit vessel only revascularisation with PCI in people with acute STEMI treated by primary PCI 1.1.16 Offer complete revascularisation with PCI for people with acute STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease without cardiogenic shock. Consider doing this during the index hospital admission. [2020] 1.1.17 Consider culprit vessel only revascularisation with PCI rather than complete revascularisation during the index procedure for people with acute STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease with cardiogenic shock. [2020] Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on complete revascularisation with PCI or culprit vessel only PCI.
