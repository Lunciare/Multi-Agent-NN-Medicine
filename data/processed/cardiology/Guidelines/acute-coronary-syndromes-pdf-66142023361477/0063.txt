unstable angina and NSTEMI Recommendations 1.2.3 and 1.2.16 Why the committee made the recommendations The 2010 NICE guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI recommended fondaparinux rather than low molecular weight heparin for initial management. The recommendation was based mainly on evidence from a single large study (the OASIS-5 study). This study showed a small risk of catheter thrombosis when fondaparinux was the only antithrombin used before angiography, and therefore the 2010 guideline recommended not to use fondaparinux when angiography is planned within 24 hours. The thrombosis risk was noted by the OASIS-5 investigators before the study ended, and in the later phase of the study, people were given intravenous unfractionated heparin with fondaparinux during angiography; this appeared to remove the excess risk of catheter thrombosis. Two further small studies published after 2010 have confirmed that giving unfractionated heparin during angiography to people already receiving fondaparinux removed the excess risk of catheter thrombosis. The committee considered that unfractionated heparin is already used in this way in many centres, agreed with the 2010 guideline that fondaparinux is the most cost-effective option, and were able to remove the caveat about avoiding fondaparinux if catheterisation is planned within 24 hours. They recommended that fondaparinux
