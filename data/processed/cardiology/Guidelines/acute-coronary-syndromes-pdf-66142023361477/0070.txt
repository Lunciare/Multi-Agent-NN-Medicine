management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery. However, the committee also noted that clopidogrel may be the safer agent for people who are at high risk of bleeding but still need dual antiplatelet therapy, although this is based on evidence of higher bleeding risk with ticagrelor in people with an acute coronary syndrome generally rather than specific evidence from those at higher risk. They therefore made a recommendation to consider using clopidogrel in this situation. How the recommendations might affect practice In the UK, prasugrel is currently used less than ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The recommendations may therefore involve a change in practice for some centres. Prasugrel Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) costs less than ticagrelor, but considerably more than clopidogrel, and although some areas will see a cost saving from switching to prasugrel from ticagrelor, others will see an increase where either prasugrel or ticagrelor is used instead of clopidogrel. The overall effect of these recommendations will be an increase in cost to the NHS.
