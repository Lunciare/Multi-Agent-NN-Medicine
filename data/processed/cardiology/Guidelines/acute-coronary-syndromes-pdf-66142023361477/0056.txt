of bivalirudin for people with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI, the committee gave more weight to studies that were closest to current UK practice. These included studies that used bailout or selective, rather than routine, glycoprotein inhibitors (GPIs) and radial artery rather than femoral artery access. The committee concluded that there was no convincing difference between bivalirudin and the main alternative, heparin, in terms of mortality, and that bivalirudin is inferior to heparin in reducing the need for subsequent unplanned revascularisation. The committee discussed data on bleeding risk and agreed that there is no clinically significant difference between bivalirudin and heparin when radial access is used, but bivalirudin probably lowers the bleeding risk when access via the femoral artery is needed. The committee noted that heparin is cheaper than bivalirudin and easier to administer. How the recommendations might affect practice The committee agreed that the recommendations generally reflect current practice and are not expected to result in a substantial resource impact to the NHS in England.
