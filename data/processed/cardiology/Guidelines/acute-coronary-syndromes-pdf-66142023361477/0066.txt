higher baseline risk of adverse outcomes. They accepted the previous committee's interpretation of the appropriate risk cut-offs based on their detailed work mapping of the evidence to real-world UK risk data. However, the committee also recognised that the risk prediction models might be less applicable to the youngest people with unstable angina and NSTEMI who are relatively under-represented in the dataset, and therefore added a cautionary recommendation to this effect. The committee noted that the 2010 guideline had recommended that angiography should Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) be done within 96 hours of admission for those who are likely to benefit from an early invasive strategy. However, they considered this a conservative target and knew that angiography within 72 hours is now common practice. This allows time for a correct diagnosis, immediate stabilisation and treatment of symptoms, and transfer to a centre with PCI facilities if necessary. The available evidence does not permit a definitive statement about the optimal timing, but a recommendation to consider angiography within 72 hours was agreed. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations largely reflect current NHS practice. Although the timeframe for early invasive management has been reduced from 96 hours, 72 hours has been
