Acute coronary syndromes

How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations largely reflect current NHS practice. Although the timeframe for early invasive management has been reduced from 96 hours, 72 hours has been specified in the NICE quality standard for a number of years and a best practice tariff on the same basis was introduced in 2017. Audit data are only currently available from the same year as the introduction of the tariff and report that, of people who are admitted to a hospital that can perform angiography, 56% received angiography within 72 hours and 69% within 96 hours. The proportion receiving angiography within 72 hours is likely to be higher since the introduction of the best practice tariff. Performing angiography earlier is likely to result in a shorter hospital stay. The recommendations are unlikely to result in a substantial resource impact for the NHS.
