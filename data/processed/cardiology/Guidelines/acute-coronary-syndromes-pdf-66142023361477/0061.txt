Acute coronary syndromes

show that 91% of PCIs for acute coronary syndromes used stents and 97% of these used drug-eluting stents. The recommendation will therefore involve little change from current practice and will not have a substantial resource impact for the NHS in England. Return to recommendations Antiplatelet therapy for STEMI not treated with PCI Recommendations 1.1.24 and 1.1.25 Why the committee made the recommendations The UK licence for prasugrel is for people with acute coronary syndrome who are proceeding to coronary angiography with a view to PCI. Although this is usual practice for most people with STEMI, for some people, either medical management without coronary revascularisation or coronary artery surgery are better options. Direct evidence in these patient groups was lacking; the evidence comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel and ticagrelor was largely for people receiving PCI. This showed convincing superiority of ticagrelor in reducing mortality (cardiac and all-cause) and in preventing re-infarction and the need for future revascularisation procedures, although there was some evidence of an increased risk of bleeding complications. The committee agreed to recommend ticagrelor for people with STEMI having medical management unless they are at high risk of bleeding when clopidogrel or no second antiplatelet may be the
