are therefore likely to result in a change in practice, but not for all centres or all professionals performing PCI. Because the recommendations allow for multivessel PCI to be either at the time of primary PCI or later within the index admission, they offer flexibility to accommodate situations in which there are a number of other people waiting for primary PCI. Healthcare professionals can move on to treat the next person after completing revascularisation of the culprit vessel, minimising the overall impact on primary PCI services. There will be a resource impact for centres not currently undertaking multivessel PCI, because multivessel PCI has higher costs than culprit vessel only PCI. Audit data reported by MINAP (the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project) between April 2016 and March 2017 show there were 33,797 cases of STEMI reported in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. It is estimated that around 30% will present with multivessel disease, which would be around 10,000 people. However, it is unclear for how many of these people multivessel PCI would be suitable. The change from current practice is likely to be cost saving overall because of the reduction in later revascularisation procedures. Return to recommendations
