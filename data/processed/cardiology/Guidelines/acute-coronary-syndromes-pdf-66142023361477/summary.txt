Overview This guideline covers the early and longer-term (rehabilitation) management of acute coronary syndromes. These include ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina. The guideline aims to improve survival and quality of life for people who have a heart attack or unstable angina. See the visual summaries on STEMI, unstable angina NSTEMI, and secondary prevention. This guideline does not cover management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection. The recommendations were developed before the COVID-19 pandemic.
