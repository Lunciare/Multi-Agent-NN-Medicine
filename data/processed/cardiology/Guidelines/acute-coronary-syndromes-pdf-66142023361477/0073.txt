do not have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The 2013 guideline recommended beta-blocker treatment for at least 12 months. In the absence of any conclusive evidence, the committee agreed that they could not recommend a definite time for stopping treatment. However, they agreed that healthcare professionals should discuss the absence of clear evidence for benefit of continuing beyond 12 months with people taking beta-blockers after an MI who have normal left ventricular function. This should prompt a personalised approach to stopping or continuing beta-blockers based on the person's attitude to risk and experience of side effects. How the recommendations might affect practice Beta-blockers are currently offered for at least 12 months after an MI to people without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Audit data show that around 97% of people with MI are discharged on beta-blockers. A discussion of the absence of clear evidence for benefit of continuing treatment beyond 12 months is likely to lead to more people deciding to stop treatment at this point. Any reduction in prescriptions for beta-blockers will be cost saving.
