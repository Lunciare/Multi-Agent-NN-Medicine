Beta-blockers 1.4.27 Offer people a beta-blocker as soon as possible after an MI, when the person is haemodynamically stable. [2013] 1.4.28 Communicate plans for titrating beta-blockers up to the maximum tolerated or target dose – for example, in the discharge summary. [2013] 1.4.29 Consider continuing a beta-blocker for 12 months after an MI for people without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. [2020] 1.4.30 Discuss the potential benefits and risks of stopping or continuing beta-blockers beyond 12 months after an MI for people without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Include in the discussion: • the lack of evidence on the relative benefits and harms of continuing beyond 12 months • the person's experience of adverse effects. [2020] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on duration of beta-blocker treatment after an MI. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: beta-blockers. 1.4.31 Continue a beta-blocker indefinitely in people with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. [2013] 1.4.32 Offer all people who have had an MI more than 12 months ago, who have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a beta-blocker
