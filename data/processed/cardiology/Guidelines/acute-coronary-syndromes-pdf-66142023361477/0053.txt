However, there is also some suggestion that there are risks associated with withdrawal of beta- blockers in this population. The balance of risks and benefits of long-term beta blockade has not been clearly determined, particularly in the context of modern acute treatment of MI. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Dual antiplatelet therapy for acute STEMI intended for primary PCI Recommendation 1.1.11 Why the committee made the recommendation Evidence was reviewed comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, each in combination with aspirin, at time-points of 30 days and 1 year. Prasugrel and ticagrelor were more effective than clopidogrel at both time-points. In a network meta-analysis of the 30-day data, prasugrel was more effective than ticagrelor, although with
