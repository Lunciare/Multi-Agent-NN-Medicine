Return to recommendations Complete revascularisation with PCI or culprit vessel only PCI for acute STEMI Recommendations 1.1.16 and 1.1.17 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence showed that complete revascularisation with multivessel PCI reduced cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and repeat revascularisation at 1 year, compared with culprit vessel only PCI for people with acute STEMI without cardiogenic shock. It was also associated with lower overall costs. Although the evidence clearly favoured complete revascularisation, there was less certainty about the timing of the non-culprit procedure. There are a number of different possible approaches to multivessel PCI: undertaking multivessel revascularisation at the time of primary PCI; treating the culprit vessel during the primary procedure and then bringing the person back to the catheter laboratory for revascularisation of other vessels later in the index admission; or treating the culprit vessel during primary PCI, discharging the person and then electively readmitting them for further revascularisation. The committee agreed that multivessel PCI during the index admission should be considered, either at the time of primary PCI or later during the same admission. They were concerned that the clinical benefits may be lower and costs may be higher when people are discharged and readmitted, and
