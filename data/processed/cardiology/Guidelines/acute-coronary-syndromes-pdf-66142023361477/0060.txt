these people multivessel PCI would be suitable. The change from current practice is likely to be cost saving overall because of the reduction in later revascularisation procedures. Return to recommendations Drug-eluting stents Recommendations 1.1.18 and 1.2.18 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence from angiography studies showed that drug-eluting stents are less likely to fail than bare metal stents in terms of both recurrence of obstruction to the target vessel and the need for further revascularisation. The evidence also shows that drug-eluting stents may be beneficial in reducing deaths (all-cause and cardiac) and there is a reduced incidence of MI in the 3 years after revascularisation when drug-eluting stents are used. Costs of drug-eluting stents are higher than bare metal stents, but analyses using current cost and benefit data suggest that they are a cost-effective use of resources. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) How the recommendations might affect practice The use of drug-eluting stents has been slowly increasing over recent years in the UK and the most recent national audit data show that 91% of PCIs for acute coronary syndromes used stents and 97% of these used drug-eluting stents. The recommendation will therefore involve little change from current practice and will
