Acute coronary syndromes

Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) database. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) Coronary angiography with follow-on PCI 1.2.12 Offer immediate coronary angiography to people with unstable angina or NSTEMI if their clinical condition is unstable. [2020] 1.2.13 Consider coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) within 72 hours of first admission for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who have an intermediate or higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events (predicted 6-month mortality above 3.0%) and no contraindications to angiography (such as active bleeding or comorbidity). See table 2 for information on the benefits and risks of early invasive treatment compared with conservative management. [2020] 1.2.14 Consider coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who are initially assessed to be at low risk of adverse cardiovascular events (predicted 6-month mortality 3.0% or less) if ischaemia is subsequently experienced or is demonstrated by ischaemia testing. See table 2 for information on the benefits and risks of early invasive treatment compared with conservative management. [2020] 1.2.15 Be aware that some younger people with low risk scores for mortality at 6 months may still be at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events and may benefit from early angiography.
