who have diagnosed or previously undiagnosed diabetes? [2011] Why this is important Existing studies on the optimal management of hyperglycaemia in people who have acute coronary syndrome and diagnosed or previously undiagnosed diabetes are generally of poor quality. It is recommended that a large RCT is conducted for people with acute coronary syndrome and hyperglycaemia (blood glucose 11 mmol/litre and over) stratified by NSTEMI and STEMI and by known diabetes and without a previous diagnosis of diabetes. The interventions for the trial should be intravenous insulin or subcutaneous insulin Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) administered within 4 hours of presentation to hospital. The aim is to achieve blood glucose between 6 and 11 mmol/litre for at least 24 hours. The comparator should be standard care. 8 Beta-blockers Does continuing beta-blocker treatment beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction (MI) improve outcomes for people with normal left ventricular systolic function? [2013] Why this is important Recent cohort studies have suggested that continuing treatment with a beta-blocker beyond a year after an acute MI may not confer any benefit to the person in terms of reduced morbidity or mortality. This is particularly relevant given recent changes in acute management strategies. While beta-blockers are
