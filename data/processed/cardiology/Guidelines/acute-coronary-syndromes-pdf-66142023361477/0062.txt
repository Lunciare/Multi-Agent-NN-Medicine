Acute coronary syndromes

The committee agreed to recommend ticagrelor for people with STEMI having medical management unless they are at high risk of bleeding when clopidogrel or no second antiplatelet may be the safer option. However, the committee were aware that some of the excess bleeding risk comes from complications of a PCI procedure, which is not relevant to this particular group of people with acute coronary syndrome. They therefore made a recommendation to offer ticagrelor in most cases but to consider clopidogrel as an alternative when the bleeding risk is high. How the recommendations might affect practice In the UK, both ticagrelor and clopidogrel are currently used for STEMI that is managed Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) without PCI. The recommendations require a change in practice for most, but not all, people who would otherwise receive clopidogrel. Ticagrelor costs considerably more than clopidogrel, and although the recommendations apply to a minority of people with STEMI, the effect will be an increase in cost to the NHS.
