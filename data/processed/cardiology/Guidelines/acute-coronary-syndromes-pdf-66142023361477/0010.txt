For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2020 recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on initial antithrombin therapy for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: antithrombin for unstable angina and NSTEMI. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) 1.2.4 Consider unfractionated heparin, with dose adjustment guided by monitoring of clotting function, as an alternative to fondaparinux for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI and significant renal impairment (creatinine above 265 micromoles per litre). [2010] 1.2.5 Carefully consider the choice and dose of antithrombin for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI who have a high risk of bleeding associated with any of the following: • advancing age • known bleeding complications • renal impairment •
