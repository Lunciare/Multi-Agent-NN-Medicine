The committee agreed that dual antiplatelet therapy should not be offered to people with chest pain before a diagnosis of unstable angina or NSTEMI is made. In their experience, dual antiplatelet therapy had caused harm (bleeding) in some people presenting with chest pain not caused by an acute coronary syndrome. Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) Unstable angina and NSTEMI intended for PCI Evidence was reviewed comparing the clinical effectiveness of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, each in combination with aspirin, at time-points of 30 days and 1 year. A detailed cost-effectiveness analysis for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI undergoing PCI was performed incorporating these data. Although the overall conclusion was that prasugrel is a more effective agent than ticagrelor, which in turn is more effective than clopidogrel, there was considerable uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results, with either prasugrel or ticagrelor being most cost effective in different scenarios using different clinical data. The results favouring prasugrel were driven by the ISAR-REACT 5 trial, in which time to angiography was much shorter than is currently achieved in the UK for people with unstable angina or NSTEMI. This could cause practical difficulty in using prasugrel because its licence effectively prevents its use before angiography,
