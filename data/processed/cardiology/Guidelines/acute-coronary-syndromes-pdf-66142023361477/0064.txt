Acute coronary syndromes

2010 guideline that fondaparinux is the most cost-effective option, and were able to remove the caveat about avoiding fondaparinux if catheterisation is planned within 24 hours. They recommended that fondaparinux should be given to people who are not at high risk of bleeding unless they are having immediate angiography. People receiving fondaparinux should be given additional systemic unfractionated heparin in the catheter laboratory. How the recommendations might affect practice Fondaparinux is already used before angiography in many centres in the UK, with additional unfractionated heparin given during the procedure. The recommendations will Acute coronary syndromes (NG185) affect those centres currently withholding fondaparinux from people having angiography in the next 24 hours. Fondaparinux is a cheaper option than low molecular weight heparin so the recommendation could be cost saving in these centres. Return to recommendations Early invasive versus conservative management for unstable angina and NSTEMI Recommendations 1.2.12 to 1.2.15 and 1.2.20 Why the committee made the recommendations The 2010 guideline on unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) recommended a comprehensive assessment of baseline risk of adverse events. The committee agreed that this should influence the choice between early invasive intervention (coronary angiography, with PCI if indicated) and conservative management (initial
