the UK NHS in line with the NICE reference case. Costs and utility values were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. 4.2.3 Each patient population was modelled in the same way, with the exception that the baseline risks of vascular events differed by cohort (ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease and multivascular disease). Event rates were different for years 1, 2 and 3 of the model. Event rates in year 3 were used to inform the model from year 3 onwards. Relative treatment effects for clopidogrel, modified-release dipyridamole and modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin were based on either direct evidence or indirect evidence, using a network meta-analysis. The non-treatment costs used in the model were based on information from published burden of illness studies. Treatment costs were sourced from MIMS. All costs were inflated to 2007 to 2008 prices, if necessary. The model included the branded price of clopidogrel. Utility values were derived from the published literature and were between 0.61 and 0.87. A disutility associated with adverse events of between −0.3 and −0.001 was also applied in the model. 4.2.4 In people who have had an ischaemic stroke, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was associated with an additional cost of
