Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

plus aspirin, modified-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin using data from the 4 RCTs. Comparisons were made in a population of people with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 4.1.13 The Assessment Group reported that the results from the mixed treatment comparison showed no statistical difference between the pairs of drug interventions, except for the outcomes of 'any recurrent stroke' and major bleeding. Compared with people assigned to treatment with aspirin, there was evidence of a risk reduction for 'any recurrent stroke' in people taking either clopidogrel (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93) or modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92). People treated with modified-release dipyridamole alone were at statistically significant higher risk of 'any recurrent stroke' than people treated with either clopidogrel or modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin. The direct and indirect evidence was consistent. 4.2 Cost effectiveness Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis model (clopidogrel) 4.2.1 The Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis model estimated the cost effectiveness of 4 treatments for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular events. These treatments were aspirin, clopidogrel, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin and modified-release dipyridamole alone. In line with the licensed indications for the products, all 4 treatments were compared
