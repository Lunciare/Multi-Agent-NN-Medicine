because of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. Atherosclerotic plaques form in artery walls because of damage to the vascular endothelium. Damage is caused by a number of factors working together over a long period, such as elevated low-density lipoproteins, smoking, high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus. If an atherosclerotic plaque is suddenly disrupted, platelet activation and thrombus (clot) formation follows, leading to atherothrombosis. The thrombus can block an artery, either at the original site of the plaque formation or further down the artery. People who have had an occlusive vascular event are at increased risk of another. 2.2 Peripheral arterial disease is a condition in which the arteries that carry blood to the arms or legs become narrowed or clogged, slowing or stopping the flow of blood. It occurs most often because of atherosclerosis. People who have peripheral arterial disease are at high risk of having an occlusive vascular event. People with cardiovascular disease who have disease in more than 1 vascular site are said to have multivascular disease. These people are at increased risk of death, myocardial infarction or stroke, compared with people with disease in a single vascular bed. 2.3 Each year in the UK an estimated 98,000 people have
