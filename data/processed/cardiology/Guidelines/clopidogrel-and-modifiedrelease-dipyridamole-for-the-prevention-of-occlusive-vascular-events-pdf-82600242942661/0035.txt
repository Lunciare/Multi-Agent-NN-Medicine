aware of the limitations of post-hoc analyses but noted that the subgroups were based on large numbers of people. On balance, it considered multivascular disease to be appropriate to consider in the cost-effectiveness analysis. 4.3.6 The Committee recognised that after the publication of NICE technology appraisal guidance 90, clopidogrel became available in a number of generic preparations. The Assessment Group's analyses used both the branded and generic prices. The Committee was aware that after the assessment report was written the price of clopidogrel was reduced further from approximately £10 to approximately £5 per month. It noted that this would affect the cost- effectiveness results, because treatment with generic clopidogrel would cost less than previously stated. The Committee considered that it was appropriate to take account of the generic price of clopidogrel in its considerations and that any treatment with clopidogrel should use the least costly licensed preparation. 4.3.7 The Committee discussed the cost-effectiveness results from the 2 manufacturers' models. The Committee considered the Boehringer Ingelheim model, which reported that in people who have had an ischaemic stroke or a transient ischaemic attack, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was cost effective compared with aspirin, with ICERs of around £5,400 and
