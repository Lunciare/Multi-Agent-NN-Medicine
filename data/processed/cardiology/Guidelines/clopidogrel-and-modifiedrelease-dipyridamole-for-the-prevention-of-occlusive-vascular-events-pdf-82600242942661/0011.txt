Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin had a reduced risk of stroke (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93) compared with the aspirin group. The other primary outcomes in this study did not report statistically significant results for stroke and/or all-cause death (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00) and all-cause death (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.23). For the secondary outcomes, statistically significant results favouring the group receiving modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin were reported for stroke or transient ischaemic attack (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.92), other vascular events (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94), ischaemic events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.92) and vascular events (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91). For other outcomes, no statistically significant differences were reported between the treatments. 4.1.7 The ESPRIT trial reported a statistically significant result for the primary outcome (that is, first occurrence of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, major bleeding complication or death from all vascular causes), favouring people receiving modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95%CI 0.66 to 0.98). For the secondary outcomes, statistically significant results were reported for death from all vascular causes and non-fatal stroke (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97)
