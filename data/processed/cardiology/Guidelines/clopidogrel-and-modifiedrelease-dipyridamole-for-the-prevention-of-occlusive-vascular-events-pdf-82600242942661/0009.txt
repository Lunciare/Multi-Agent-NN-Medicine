Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

these were included in the previous NICE technology appraisal guidance 90 (CAPRIE and ESPS-2) and 2 were published later (ESPRIT and PRoFESS). The RCTs were considered by the Assessment Group to be of good quality. Three of the trials were double blind and 1 was an open-label study (ESPRIT). 4.1.2 CAPRIE (n=19,185) compared clopidogrel with aspirin and ESPRIT (n=2,736) compared modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin with aspirin. ESPS-2 (n=6,602) had 4 groups and compared modified-release dipyridamole with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin, and with aspirin and with placebo. PRoFESS (n=20,332) made a head-to-head comparison of clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin. A wide range of dosages of aspirin were used in the trials. 4.1.3 All the trials included people who had experienced an ischaemic stroke and 2 trials included people who had experienced a transient ischaemic attack (ESPS-2 and ESPRIT). CAPRIE was the only trial to include people who had a prior myocardial infarction or who had peripheral arterial disease. The mean length of follow-up in the trials was between 1.91 and 3.5 years. The CAPRIE and ESPRIT trials each used composite endpoints of first occurrence of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (CAPRIE); and first occurrence of death from all
