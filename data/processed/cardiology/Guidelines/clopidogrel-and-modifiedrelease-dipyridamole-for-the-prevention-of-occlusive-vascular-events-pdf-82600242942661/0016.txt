occlusive vascular events. These treatments were aspirin, clopidogrel, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin and modified-release dipyridamole alone. In line with the licensed indications for the products, all 4 treatments were compared for use in people with a prior ischaemic stroke. In people with a history of myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or multivascular disease, clopidogrel was compared with aspirin. 4.2.2 The manufacturers submitted a Markov model that comprised 6 health states: no event in model, history of stroke, history of myocardial infarction, TA80 state (an intermediate state reflecting the previous NICE technology appraisal guidance 80 [now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes], which recommended clopidogrel plus aspirin for up to 12 months after an NSTEMI event), history of stroke and myocardial infarction, and death (split into vascular and non-vascular death). People entering the model could remain stable, have a myocardial infarction or stroke, or die. The modelled patient population was aged 65 years. The model was run with 3-month cycles for 35 years. The perspective adopted was that of the UK NHS in line with the NICE reference case. Costs and utility values were discounted at a rate of 3.5%. 4.2.3 Each patient population was modelled in the same
