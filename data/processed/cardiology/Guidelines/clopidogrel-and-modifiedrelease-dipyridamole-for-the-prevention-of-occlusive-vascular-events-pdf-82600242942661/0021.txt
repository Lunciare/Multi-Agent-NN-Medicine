Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

Costs. Drug acquisition costs were based on branded drug costs for modified-release dipyridamole and aspirin, and clopidogrel, and on the generic price for aspirin (2009 prices). Utility data from the PRoFESS trial at 1 year were used, which was provided as commercial in confidence. A short-term disutility associated with different events was also included in the model. Costs and utility values were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per year. 4.2.10 In people who have had an ischaemic stroke, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was associated with an additional cost of £704, and 0.131 additional QALYs per person with a corresponding ICER of £5,377 per QALY gained, compared with aspirin. Treatment with clopidogrel compared with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was associated with additional costs of £1,808 and 0.015 additional QALYs per person with an ICER of £114,628 per QALY gained. The results were similar in people who have had a transient ischaemic attack. In this population, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with aspirin was associated with an additional cost of £732 and 0.121 additional QALYs per person with an ICER of £6,053 per QALY gained. The manufacturer reported that its model suggested that at a cost-effectiveness threshold
