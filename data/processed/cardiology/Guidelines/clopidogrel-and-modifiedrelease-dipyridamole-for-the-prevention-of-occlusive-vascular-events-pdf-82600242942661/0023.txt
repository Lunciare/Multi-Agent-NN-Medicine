potential treatment strategies for this appraisal were considered as follow-on treatment. 4.2.12 The Assessment Group presented different treatment strategies, depending on the population and intolerances. The Assessment Group considered that this approach reflected the real world, because people may switch between different treatments. For each person in the model, age, sex and disability status was set. According to these variables, estimates of time to first event were applied. These events determined the event history of the person and included a fatal or new non-fatal ischaemic stroke event, a fatal or new non-fatal non-ischaemic stroke event, a fatal or new non-fatal myocardial infarction, death from other vascular causes, death from non-vascular causes and person discontinues current preventive medication for any reason. Only 1 event could occur at any 1 time. If the event was non-fatal then the person continued in the model, with an updated age, sex and disability status and updated risks, with the potential to incur additional events over time, moving through the model over a lifetime. Each person was modelled in the same way. Data provided by the manufacturers from the CAPRIE and PRoFESS trials were used to develop risk models for the economic model and to work
