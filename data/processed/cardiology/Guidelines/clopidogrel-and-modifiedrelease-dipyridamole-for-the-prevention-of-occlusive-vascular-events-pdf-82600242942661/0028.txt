Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

0.591 additional QALYs. 4.2.20 From the Assessment Group's analysis of the ischaemic stroke data, the ICERs could be calculated for people with intolerance to clopidogrel or for whom treatment with clopidogrel is not licensed, such as people who have had a transient ischaemic attack. Treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin followed by aspirin had an ICER of £9,145 per QALY gained, compared with treatment with aspirin followed by modified-release dipyridamole. This strategy was associated with an additional cost of £567 and 0.062 additional QALYs. People who have had a myocardial infarction 4.2.21 The Assessment Group reported that for people who have had a myocardial infarction the optimal treatment strategies were the same regardless of the price of clopidogrel. Aspirin followed by clopidogrel, compared with aspirin alone, was the optimal strategy for this population, with an ICER of £1,964 per QALY gained (using the price of generic clopidogrel) and a difference in costs of £185 and QALYs of 0.094. For people with intolerance to aspirin, treatment with clopidogrel was likely to be the optimal treatment, compared with no preventive therapy, with an ICER of £2,020 per QALY gained (using the price of generic clopidogrel) and a difference in cost of £468
