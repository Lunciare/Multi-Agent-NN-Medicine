treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of around £2,600 per QALY gained, compared with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel was a cost-saving strategy, costing less and producing more benefits than no preventive therapy. The Committee considered that for people with multivascular disease clopidogrel was a cost-effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.10 The Committee discussed the results of the Assessment Group's model for the subgroup of people who have had a myocardial infarction. It recognised that the model had incorporated NICE's previous guidelines on the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin for treating STEMI and NSTEMI (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes), and modelled the use of clopidogrel monotherapy after its use as a combination therapy for acute coronary syndromes. The treatment strategy of aspirin followed by clopidogrel had an ICER of £2,000 per QALY gained, compared with aspirin alone. A treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin was associated with greater costs and fewer QALYs than starting with aspirin. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel had an ICER of £2,000 per QALY gained compared with no preventive therapy. The Committee discussed the re-analysis provided by the Assessment Group after
