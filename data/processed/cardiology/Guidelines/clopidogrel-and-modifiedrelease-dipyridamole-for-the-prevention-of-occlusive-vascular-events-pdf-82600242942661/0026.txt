per QALY gained and incremental costs of £354 and 0.021 QALYs compared with treatment with the next best strategy of modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin, followed by aspirin. 4.2.17 When the generic price for clopidogrel was used, the optimal treatment strategy changed so that it began with clopidogrel, followed by modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin and finally aspirin. This produced an ICER of £13,558 per QALY gained, compared with the next best strategy of clopidogrel, followed by aspirin, followed by modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin. This strategy was associated with an additional cost of £334 and 0.024 additional QALYs. 4.2.18 For people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel followed by modified-release dipyridamole was the optimal treatment strategy with an ICER of £7,142 per QALY gained compared with treatment with clopidogrel alone. This strategy was associated with an additional cost of £616 and 0.086 additional QALYs. It could be calculated from the data that for people with intolerance to aspirin and clopidogrel or for whom clopidogrel was not licensed, the optimal treatment strategy was modified-release dipyridamole alone with an ICER of £314 per QALY gained compared with no preventive treatment. This strategy was associated with an additional cost of £167 and 0.531 additional QALYs. 4.2.19
