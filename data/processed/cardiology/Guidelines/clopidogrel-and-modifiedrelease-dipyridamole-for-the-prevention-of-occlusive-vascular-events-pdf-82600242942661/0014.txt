Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

infarction and symptomatic peripheral arterial disease). The analysis suggested that clopidogrel (compared with aspirin) reduced the risk of a first occurrence of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death (14.9% relative risk reduction; 95% CI 0.3 to 27.3, p=0.045). Modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel 4.1.11 The PRoFESS trial investigated the non-inferiority of modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel. The trial reported no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of recurrent stroke of any type (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11). For the secondary outcomes, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of events in the modified-release dipyridamole group compared with the clopidogrel group for new or worsening congestive heart failure (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96) and a statistically significant increase in the risk of events in the modified-release dipyridamole group compared with the clopidogrel group for intracranial haemorrhage (HR 1.42; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.83). Indirect comparisons 4.1.12 The Assessment Group completed an indirect comparison that compared clopidogrel, modified- release dipyridamole plus aspirin, modified-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin using data from the 4 RCTs. Comparisons were made in a population of people with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic
