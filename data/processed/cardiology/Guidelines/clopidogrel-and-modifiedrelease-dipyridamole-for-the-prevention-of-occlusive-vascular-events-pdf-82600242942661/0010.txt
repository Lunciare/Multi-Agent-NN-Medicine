3.5 years. The CAPRIE and ESPRIT trials each used composite endpoints of first occurrence of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (CAPRIE); and first occurrence of death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or major bleeding complication (ESPRIT). In the ESPS-2 trial, 3 discrete primary endpoints were reported: stroke, all-cause death, and stroke and/or all-cause death. The PRoFESS trial had a single primary endpoint of recurrent stroke. Modified-release dipyridamole compared with aspirin 4.1.4 The ESPS-2 trial compared modified-release dipyridamole with aspirin. The study reported no statistically significant differences in risk reduction for the primary outcomes of stroke (relative risk [RR] 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 1.22), stroke and/or all-cause death (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11), and all-cause death (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25). Additionally, no statistically significant differences were reported for secondary outcomes. Modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with aspirin 4.1.5 Two trials (ESPS-2 and ESPRIT) compared modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin with aspirin. 4.1.6 In the ESPS-2 trial, people receiving modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin had a reduced risk of stroke (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93) compared with the aspirin group. The other primary outcomes in this study did
