Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

0.80; 95%CI 0.66 to 0.98). For the secondary outcomes, statistically significant results were reported for death from all vascular causes and non-fatal stroke (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97) and all vascular events (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). For other outcomes, no statistically significant differences were reported between the treatments. Modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with modified-release dipyridamole 4.1.8 In the ESPS-2 trial, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin compared with modified-release dipyridamole alone reduced the risk of stroke (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91). The other primary outcomes in this study did not report statistically significant results. These were stroke and/or all-cause death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.03) and all-cause death (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19). For the secondary outcomes, statistically significant results were reported for transient ischaemic attack (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97), ischaemic events (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.90) and vascular events (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89). For other outcomes, no statistically significant differences were reported between the treatments. Clopidogrel compared with aspirin 4.1.9 The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel with aspirin. For the primary outcome, the trial reported that clopidogrel compared with aspirin reduced the
