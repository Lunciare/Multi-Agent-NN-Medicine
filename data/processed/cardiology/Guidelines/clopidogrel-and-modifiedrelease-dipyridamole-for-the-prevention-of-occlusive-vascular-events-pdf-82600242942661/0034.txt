The clinical specialists discussed evidence from the ESPRIT trial that showed that Kaplan-Meier curves by treatment group continued to diverge over time. While the clinical specialists recognised that the study and its results have limitations, they considered that this provided evidence of a continued treatment effect beyond the 2 years used in NICE technology appraisal guidance 90. The Committee was persuaded that it was appropriate to examine the Assessment Group's analyses of cost effectiveness without specifying a limit on the duration of treatment. 4.3.5 The Committee considered the subgroup of people with multivascular disease. It noted that there is a range of definitions of multivascular disease, but heard from the clinical specialists that identifying the subgroup of people with multivascular disease was important and clinically meaningful. The Committee discussed the post-hoc analyses from the CAPRIE trial that suggested that this group is at high risk of occlusive vascular events and may need more intensive treatment. The Committee was aware of the limitations of post-hoc analyses but noted that the subgroups were based on large numbers of people. On balance, it considered multivascular disease to be appropriate to consider
