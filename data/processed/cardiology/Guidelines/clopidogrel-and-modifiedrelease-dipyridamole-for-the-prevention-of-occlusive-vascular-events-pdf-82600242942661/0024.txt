Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

was modelled in the same way. Data provided by the manufacturers from the CAPRIE and PRoFESS trials were used to develop risk models for the economic model and to work out event fatality. An exponential survival function was used to model medication continuance over time. Adverse events were incorporated into the model. 4.2.13 Resource use was measured in terms of clinical events and time spent in chronic states, and differed by disability status. Drug costs were taken from the BNF58 and from the NHS Drug Tariff (January 2010) for generic clopidogrel, which at that point reported that the price of 30 tablets was £10.90. Unit costs were drawn from various sources, including the manufacturers' submissions, and inflated if necessary to 2009. The costs were £6,410 for non-fatal ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke if the person was not disabled and £13,647 if they were disabled, £8,768 for fatal ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, £5,762 for non-fatal myocardial infarction, £2,218 for fatal myocardial infarction and £2,225 for other vascular or non-vascular death. 4.2.14 Utility values were also drawn from a variety of sources, including the manufacturers' submissions and additional analyses requested from the manufacturer. Mean utility values were assigned to each chronic health state
