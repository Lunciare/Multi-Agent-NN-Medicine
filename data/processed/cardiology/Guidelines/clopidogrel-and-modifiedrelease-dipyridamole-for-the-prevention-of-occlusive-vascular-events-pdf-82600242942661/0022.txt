Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

additional cost of £732 and 0.121 additional QALYs per person with an ICER of £6,053 per QALY gained. The manufacturer reported that its model suggested that at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained, modified- release dipyridamole plus aspirin would no longer be cost effective compared with clopidogrel if the price of generic clopidogrel reduced to approximately 50% of that of branded clopidogrel. Assessment Group model 4.2.11 The Assessment Group developed an individual patient sampling model, in which a series of individual profiles were generated whose combined characteristics were representative of the specified population. Analyses were split by population: ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease and multivascular disease. The ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack populations were assumed to be equivalent in risk and outcomes and so were modelled together. Within the myocardial infarction group, treatment strategies as described in NICE's previous guidelines on STEMI and NSTEMI (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) were modelled initially. Once initial treatment was completed according to the guidelines, potential treatment strategies for this appraisal were considered as follow-on treatment. 4.2.12 The Assessment Group presented different treatment strategies, depending on the population and intolerances. The Assessment Group considered that
