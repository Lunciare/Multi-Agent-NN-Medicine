Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

values were also drawn from a variety of sources, including the manufacturers' submissions and additional analyses requested from the manufacturer. Mean utility values were assigned to each chronic health state and a specific utility decrement effect was applied for each modelled event. Utility values for the myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial disease groups were 0.87 and 0.80 respectively. Utility values for the ischaemic stroke group and all utility decrements were taken from the Boehringer Ingelheim submission. Discounting at 3.5% was applied to costs and benefits after the first year. A lifetime horizon was used. 4.2.15 Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainty on the cost-effectiveness estimates. People who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack 4.2.16 For people who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, when the branded price for clopidogrel was used, the Assessment Group reported that the optimal treatment strategy was modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin, followed by aspirin and finally clopidogrel. This produced an ICER of £16,894 per QALY gained and incremental costs of £354 and 0.021 QALYs compared with treatment with the next best strategy of modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin, followed by aspirin. 4.2.17 When the
