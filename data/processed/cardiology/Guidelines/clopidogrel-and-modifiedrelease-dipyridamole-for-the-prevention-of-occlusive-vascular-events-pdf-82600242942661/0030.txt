Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

followed by treatment with clopidogrel. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel alone was the optimal treatment strategy. Compared with no preventive therapy, clopidogrel gave an additional 0.773 QALYs at a cost of £557, with an ICER of £721 per QALY gained. People with multivascular disease 4.2.24 The Assessment Group reported that for people with multivascular disease the optimal treatment strategies were the same regardless of the price of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel followed by aspirin was the optimal strategy for this group, compared with aspirin followed by clopidogrel. For the optimal strategy, treatment was associated with an ICER of £2,604 per QALY gained, and incremental costs of £595 and incremental QALYs of 0.228. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel alone was the optimal treatment strategy and was associated with lower total costs of -£548 compared with no preventive therapy, 0.723 additional QALYS and a corresponding ICER of -£758 per QALY gained. 4.3 Consideration of the evidence 4.3.1 The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole, having considered evidence on the nature of occlusive vascular events and peripheral arterial disease and the value placed on the benefits of clopidogrel and modified-
