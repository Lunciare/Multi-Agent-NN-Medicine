cost- effective use of NHS resources. Modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was a cost-effective use of NHS resources only when it was used for people who had a contraindication or intolerance to clopidogrel. Modified-release dipyridamole alone was a cost-effective use of NHS resources only when it was used in people who had a contraindication or intolerance to aspirin and clopidogrel. 4.3.12 The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that people who have had a transient ischaemic attack are sometimes treated with clopidogrel. However, the Committee recognised that recommendations could not be made for the use of clopidogrel for people who have had a transient ischaemic attack because clopidogrel is not licensed for this indication. For people who have had a transient ischaemic attack, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin followed by aspirin had an ICER of £9,100 per QALY gained compared with treatment with aspirin alone. For people who had intolerance to aspirin, treatment with modified-release dipyridamole alone had an ICER of £314 per QALY gained in comparison with no preventive treatment. The Committee considered that for people who have had a transient ischaemic attack, treatment with modified- release dipyridamole plus aspirin could be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources.
