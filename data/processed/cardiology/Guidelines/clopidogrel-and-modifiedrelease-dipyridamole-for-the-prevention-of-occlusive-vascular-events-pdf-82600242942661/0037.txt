aspirin would no longer be cost effective compared with clopidogrel. Furthermore, the Committee was aware of comments in response to consultation on the Assessment Report from the manufacturer of clopidogrel that for people who have had an ischaemic stroke, using a price of £10.90 for clopidogrel produced an ICER of under £500 per QALY gained for clopidogrel in comparison with modified-release dipyridamole. 4.3.8 The Committee discussed the results of the Assessment Group's model for the subgroup of people with peripheral arterial disease. It noted that a treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of around £2,800 per QALY gained, compared with aspirin alone. For people with intolerance to aspirin, treatment with clopidogrel had an ICER of around £720 per QALY gained compared with no preventive therapy. The Committee considered that for people with peripheral arterial disease clopidogrel was a cost-effective use of NHS resources. 4.3.9 The Committee discussed the results of the Assessment Group's model for the subgroup of people with multivascular disease. It noted that a treatment strategy of clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of around £2,600 per QALY gained, compared with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel was a cost-saving
