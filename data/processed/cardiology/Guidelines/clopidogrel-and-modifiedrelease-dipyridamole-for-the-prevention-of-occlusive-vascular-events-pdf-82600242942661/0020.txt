any of the other 4 states, or remain in the current state. After each cycle, transitions could occur to the other states. 4.2.8 The baseline age in the model was 66 years, with a time horizon of 50 years. The perspective adopted was that of the NHS and personal social services. Transition probabilities between the states in the model for the first 4 years were taken from the PRoFESS, ESPRIT and ESPS-2 trials. Different transition probabilities were calculated for each 6-month period over the 4 years. Transition probabilities in subsequent years for the stroke states were based on the final 6-month period of the 4 years. Transition probabilities to death were estimated based on a factor of 1.5 applied to Office for National Statistics death rate data for the general population. 4.2.9 Costs of stroke events were calculated from the literature and varied according to disabled or non-disabled status. Costs of hospital stay following congestive heart failure and other haemorrhagic events were sourced from the 2006 to 2007 National Reference Costs. Drug acquisition costs were based on branded drug costs for modified-release dipyridamole and aspirin, and clopidogrel, and on the generic price for aspirin (2009 prices). Utility data from the
