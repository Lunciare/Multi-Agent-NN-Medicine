Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

events: • for people who have had a transient ischaemic attack or • for people who have had an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated. 1.3 Modified-release dipyridamole alone is recommended as an option to prevent occlusive vascular events: • for people who have had an ischaemic stroke only if aspirin and clopidogrel are contraindicated or not tolerated or • for people who have had a transient ischaemic attack only if aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated. 1.4 Treatment with clopidogrel to prevent occlusive vascular events should be started with the least costly licensed preparation. 1.5 People currently receiving clopidogrel or modified-release dipyridamole either with or without aspirin outside the criteria in sections 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to stop. 2 Clinical need and practice 2.1 Occlusive vascular events include ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack and myocardial infarction. They occur when blood flow is impeded because an artery is blocked or restricted because of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. Atherosclerotic plaques form in artery walls because of damage to the vascular endothelium. Damage is caused by a number of factors working together over a
