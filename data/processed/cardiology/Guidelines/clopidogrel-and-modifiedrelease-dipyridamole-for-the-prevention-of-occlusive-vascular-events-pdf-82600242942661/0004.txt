at increased risk of death, myocardial infarction or stroke, compared with people with disease in a single vascular bed. 2.3 Each year in the UK an estimated 98,000 people have a first ischaemic stroke, between 46,000 and 65,000 people have a transient ischaemic attack, and 146,000 have a myocardial infarction. Approximately 2% of the population of England and Wales have had a stroke and about 70% of all strokes are ischaemic. In the UK, in total around 510,000 people have had a transient ischaemic attack and over 1.4 million have had a myocardial infarction. About 20% of the UK population aged 55 to 75 years have evidence of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease, equating to a prevalence of 850,000 people, of whom 5% have symptoms. An estimated 16% of people with cardiovascular disease have multivascular disease. 2.4 Ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction are associated with high mortality rates. Approximately 23% of people die within 30 days of having a stroke, and of the people who survive, 60% to 70% die within 3 years. Thirty per cent of people die from their first myocardial infarction. In terms of morbidity, an occlusive vascular event can lead to a stay in hospital, reduced
