The Committee concluded that for people who have had a myocardial infarction, when treatment with combined clopidogrel and aspirin therapy is no longer appropriate, clopidogrel was a cost- effective use of NHS resources only for people who have a contraindication to aspirin or intolerance to it. 4.3.11 The Committee discussed the results of the Assessment Group's model for people who have had an ischaemic stroke.
