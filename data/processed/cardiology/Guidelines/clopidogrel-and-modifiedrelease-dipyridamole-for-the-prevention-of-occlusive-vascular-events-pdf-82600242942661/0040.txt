Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

and then aspirin alone had an ICER of £13,600 per QALY gained, compared with clopidogrel followed by aspirin, followed by modified- release dipyridamole plus aspirin. In people with intolerance to modified-release dipyridamole, clopidogrel followed by aspirin had an ICER of £4,000 per QALY gained compared with aspirin alone. In people with intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel followed by modified-release dipyridamole alone had an ICER of £7,100 per QALY gained, compared with treatment with clopidogrel alone. For people who had intolerance to clopidogrel and aspirin, treatment with modified- release dipyridamole alone had an ICER of £314 per QALY gained in comparison with no preventive treatment. The Committee recognised that the differences in the total costs and QALYs for the different treatment strategies each including clopidogrel, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin and aspirin were small. However, it noted that these were consistent in all analyses, and with a further reduction in the price of clopidogrel the differences in costs would be larger. The Committee concluded that using clopidogrel at the generic price was a cost- effective use of NHS resources. Modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was a cost-effective use of NHS resources only when it was used for people who had a contraindication or intolerance
