within 3 years. Thirty per cent of people die from their first myocardial infarction. In terms of morbidity, an occlusive vascular event can lead to a stay in hospital, reduced health-related quality of life and long-term disability, with a resulting impact on caregivers. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the UK and it is thought that more than 900,000 people in England are living with the effects of stroke, with about half dependent on others for support with everyday activities. 2.5 The aim of treatment is to prevent occlusive vascular events, and their recurrence. This can include pharmacological therapy with 1 or more antiplatelet agents. Antiplatelet agents include aspirin, clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole. 2.6 For people who have had a non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), NICE's previous guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) recommended that aspirin should be started and continued indefinitely, unless contraindicated. In people with predicted 6-month mortality greater than 1.5%, clopidogrel should be considered in addition to aspirin, unless contraindicated, and continued for 12 months. For people who have had an ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), NICE's previous guideline on MI: secondary prevention (now replaced by NICE's guideline
