reported between the treatments. Clopidogrel compared with aspirin 4.1.9 The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel with aspirin. For the primary outcome, the trial reported that clopidogrel compared with aspirin reduced the risk of a first occurrence of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death in 2 groups. These were the 'all patients' group (8.7% relative risk reduction; 95% CI 0.3 to 16.5) and a subgroup of people with peripheral arterial disease (23.8% relative risk reduction; 95% CI 8.9 to 36.2). No risk reduction was seen between treatments in subgroups defined by prior stroke (7.3% relative risk reduction; 95% CI -5.7 to 18.7) or by prior experience of a myocardial infarction (-3.7% relative risk reduction; 95% CI -22.1 to 12). For other outcomes, no statistically significant differences were reported between the treatments. 4.1.10 Data from the CAPRIE trial also allowed for a post-hoc subgroup analysis of data for people with multivascular disease (defined by the Assessment Group as people with experience of at least 2 of the following conditions: ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and symptomatic peripheral arterial disease). The analysis suggested that clopidogrel (compared with aspirin) reduced the risk of a first occurrence of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death (14.9%
