Clopidogrel and modified-release dipyridamole for the prevention of occlusive vascular

between −0.3 and −0.001 was also applied in the model. 4.2.4 In people who have had an ischaemic stroke, modified-release dipyridamole plus aspirin was associated with an additional cost of £107 and an additional quality- adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.45, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £237 per QALY gained compared with aspirin. Clopidogrel was associated with an additional cost of £2,324 and an additional QALY of 0.07, producing an ICER of £31,204 per QALY gained compared with aspirin. Clopidogrel was associated with greater costs and fewer QALYs than modified- release dipyridamole plus aspirin. 4.2.5 In people who have had a myocardial infarction, clopidogrel was associated with an additional cost of £2,643 and an additional QALY of 0.13, producing an ICER of £20,662 per QALY gained compared with aspirin. For people with peripheral arterial disease, clopidogrel was associated with an additional cost of £2,470 and an additional QALY of 0.13, producing an ICER of £18,854 per QALY gained compared with aspirin. For people with multivascular disease, clopidogrel was associated with an additional cost of £1,805 and an additional QALY of 0.12, producing an ICER of £15,524 per QALY gained compared with aspirin.
