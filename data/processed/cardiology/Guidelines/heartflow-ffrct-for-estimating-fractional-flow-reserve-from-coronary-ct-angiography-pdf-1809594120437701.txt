Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
This guidance replaces MTG32.
1 Recommendations
1.1 The case for adopting HeartFlow FFR for estimating fractional flow reserve from
CT
coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is supported by the evidence. The technology
is non-invasive and safe, and has a high level of diagnostic accuracy.
1.2 HeartFlow FFR should be considered as an option for patients with stable,
CT
recent-onset chest pain who are offered CCTA in line with the NICE guideline on
chest pain. Using HeartFlow FFR may avoid the need for invasive coronary
CT
angiography and revascularisation. For correct use, HeartFlow FFR requires
CT
access to 64-slice (or above) CCTA facilities.
1.3 Based on the current evidence and assuming there is access to appropriate
CCTA facilities, using HeartFlow FFR may lead to cost savings of £391 per
CT
patient [2021]. By adopting this technology, the NHS in England may save a
minimum of £9.4 million by 2022 through avoiding invasive investigation and
treatment [2021].

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
2 The technology
Description of the technology
2.1 HeartFlow FFR (developed by HeartFlow) is coronary physiology simulation
CT
software used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of previously acquired
computerised tomography DICOM data. The software provides a non-invasive
method of estimating fractional flow reserve (FFR) using standard coronary CT
angiography (CCTA) image data. FFR is the ratio between the maximum blood
flow in a narrowed artery and the maximum blood flow in a normal artery. FFR is
currently measured invasively using a pressure wire placed across a narrowed
artery.
2.2 After a clinician decides to request a HeartFlow test, anonymised data from a
CCTA scan (of at least 64 slices) are sent from the local imaging system, by
secure data transfer to HeartFlow's central processing centre in the US. A case
analyst employed by the company then uses the image data to create 3D
computer models of the coronary arteries, incorporating coronary flow
characteristics. The results are presented in a report which is sent, by secure
data transfer, to the referring clinician within 48 hours. The report includes both
3D images of the coronary anatomy and calculated functional information,
including the estimated FFR values (known as FFR values). Clinicians can then
CT
use the report to help guide the management of suspected coronary artery
disease.
2.3 HeartFlow FFR is intended for use in patients with stable, recent-onset chest
CT
pain and suspected angina. Because the safety and effectiveness of FFR
CT
analysis has not been evaluated in other patient subgroups, HeartFlow FFR is
CT
not recommended in patients who have an acute coronary syndrome or have had
a coronary stent, coronary bypass surgery or myocardial infarction in the past
month.
2.4 The company first received a CE mark in July 2011, covering all 1.X versions of the
technology, including the current version, 1.7.

(HTG429)
2.5 HeartFlow FFR costs £700 per test. A higher price of £888 is used in the
CT
company submission and assessment report. The cost was reduced in May 2015.
2.6 The claimed benefits of HeartFlow FFR in the case for adoption presented by
CT
the company were as follows:
• Analysis is done using standard CCTA scans, without the need for additional
imaging, radiation or medication.
• It provides the same accuracy in excluding coronary artery disease as CCTA,
and characterises the coronary arteries from both functional and anatomical
perspectives, differentiating between ischaemic and non-ischaemic vessels
in a way that CCTA cannot.
• It allows physicians to evaluate anatomical coronary artery disease and
accurately determine which coronary lesions are responsible for myocardial
ischaemia, avoiding unnecessary invasive diagnostic or therapeutic
procedures and related complications.
• It reduces the need for revascularisation in patients after identifying
anatomical stenosis by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) alone, by more
accurately identifying if those stenoses are ischaemic.
• It improves the diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease compared
with CCTA alone against the gold standard of invasive FFR, and provides
both functional and anatomical assessment of coronary arteries.
• It has better diagnostic performance than CCTA alone, or other non-invasive
or invasive tests (such as nuclear myocardial perfusion, magnetic resonance
perfusion, stress echocardiography, exercise treadmill testing, invasive
angiography or intravascular ultrasound) for detecting and excluding
coronary artery lesions that cause ischaemia.
• It reduces costs arising from inconclusive or inaccurate diagnostic tests.
• It avoids staff and procedure costs for unnecessary ICAs.
• It avoids staff and procedure costs for unnecessary interventions (such as
angioplasty).
• It provides a more effective use of high-cost invasive procedure suites,

providing the opportunity to reduce waiting times for these facilities and
increase patient turnaround.
Current management
2.7 The NICE guideline on chest pain recommends diagnostic testing for people in
whom stable angina cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone.
2.8 The guideline recommends offering 64-slice (or above) CCTA as the first-line
diagnosis test when clinical assessment indicates typical or atypical angina; or
non-anginal chest pain but 12-lead resting ECG has been done and indicates
ST-T changes or Q waves.
2.9 Subsequent diagnostic tests can be requested dependent on the CCTA results.
The guideline recommends offering non-invasive functional imaging for
myocardial ischaemia if 64-slice (or above) CCTA has shown coronary artery
disease of uncertain functional significance, or is non-diagnostic. Non-invasive
functional imaging includes:
• myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single-photon emission CT (MPS with
SPECT)
• stress echocardiography
• first-pass contrast-enhanced MR perfusion
• MR imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.
ICA should be offered as a second-line investigation when the results of non-
invasive functional imaging are inconclusive.
2.10 When ICA is used to determine the presence and severity of coronary stenosis, it
may be combined with the invasive measurement of FFR using a pressure wire.
Although the NICE guideline on chest pain does not consider FFR, other
guidelines (such as those of the European Society of Cardiology and American
College of Cardiology) state that lesions with an FFR of 0.80 or less are
functionally significant and revascularisation may be considered.

3 Clinical evidence
3.1 The key clinical outcomes for HeartFlow FFR presented in the decision problem
CT
were:
• measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity, positive and
negative likelihood ratios, area-under curve) using invasive fractional flow
reserve (FFR) as the reference standard
• rates of diagnostic coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary
intervention and coronary artery bypass surgery
• adverse events (test-related, major adverse cardiac events, radiation
exposure and so on)
• quality of life
• mortality.
Summary of diagnostic accuracy evidence
3.2 The company conducted a literature search on the diagnostic accuracy of FFR
CT
and the existing tests in the current treatment pathway for patients with a 10% to
90% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease, against a reference standard
of invasive FFR testing. This review identified 5 relevant meta-analysis studies
and 23 individual studies, 1 of which was unpublished. Based on the 22 published
studies, and using FFR as the reference standard, the company presented
diagnostic accuracy per-patient results for HeartFlow FFR compared with:
CT
• invasive coronary angiography (ICA)
• single-photon emission CT (SPECT)
• stress echocardiogram (ECHO)
• magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
• coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
If there were multiple studies for a test, the company conducted a meta-
analysis; for example, 3 studies were included in the meta-analysis for
HeartFlow FFR (Koo et al. 2011, Min et al. 2012 and Nørgaard et al. 2014).
CT
The methodology and results of the meta-analyses are reported as academic
in confidence.
3.3 The external assessment centre (EAC) reviewed the company's selection of
studies and considered that although they addressed the scope in terms of the
comparators, reference test and outcomes, most included a mixture of patients
with both high (over 90%) and intermediate (10% to 90%) pre-test likelihoods of
disease. It also disagreed with the company's decision only to include studies
that provided FFR measurements in more than 75% of blood vessels. The EAC
considered this criterion not to be reflective of clinical practice, where visual
assessment is sometimes used before proceeding with FFR measurements. The
EAC also noted that this criterion did not reflect the company's proposed
changes to the clinical pathway, where CCTA would be used to decide if
HeartFlow FFR should be used.
CT
3.4 To address these concerns, the EAC conducted a diagnostic literature search
using extra keywords related to comparators and outcomes. It included only
studies in which most patients had an intermediate pre-test likelihood of disease.
The EAC identified 7 diagnostic studies, including 3 presented by the company
(Bernhardt et al. 2012, Nørgaard et al. 2014 and Stuijfzand et al. 2014) and 3 that
the company had identified but excluded (Danad et al. 2013, Kajander et al. 2010
and Ponte et al. 2014). Only 1 of these, Nørgaard et al. 2014, involved
HeartFlow FFR .
CT
3.5 Nørgaard et al. (2014) reported on a multicentre study (the NXT trial) involving
2 UK centres, which compared HeartFlow FFR (v1.4) with CCTA for diagnosing
CT
myocardial ischaemia in 254 patients with suspected stable coronary artery
disease scheduled to have ICA. Most patients in the study (87%) were considered
to have an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Invasive FFR was
measured in all vessels (n=484). The study reported the diagnostic performance
of HeartFlow FFR and CCTA for diagnosing ischaemia compared with FFR
CT
measured during ICA as the reference standard. The diagnostic accuracy of each

test was presented on a per-patient and a per-vessel basis compared with the
reference standard, an FFR value of ≤0.80. Per-vessel FFR was correlated to
CT
FFR (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.82, p>0.001), with a slight
underestimation of FFR compared with FFR. The authors concluded that
CT
HeartFlow FFR can identify functionally significant coronary artery disease with
CT
high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, adding FFR measurements to
CT
CCTA led to a marked increase in specificity.
3.6 The EAC identified 6 studies which both used the comparator tests and included
patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Bernhardt et
al. (2012) compared the diagnostic performance of 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanners
using FFR as a reference standard in 34 patients with stable angina and
suspected or known coronary artery disease. The authors studied an
intermediate-risk population with a mean PROCAM score of 42.7 (a risk
assessment metric which estimates the 10-year risk of developing a coronary
event). Ponte et al. (2014) compared the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and MRI
for detecting functionally significant coronary artery disease in patients referred
with suspected coronary artery disease, using ICA with FFR as the reference
standard. The study included 95 patients with a 15% to 85% pre-test likelihood of
coronary artery disease. Stuijfzand et al. (2014) evaluated CCTA and transluminal
attenuation gradient compared with CCTA alone for diagnosing functionally
significant lesions, using invasive FFR as the reference standard. The study
included 85 patients (253 vessels) with an intermediate likelihood of coronary
artery disease. Neglia et al. (2015) assessed the accuracy of several imaging
techniques – CCTA, SPECT and ECHO – in 475 patients with an intermediate
likelihood of coronary artery disease. Danad et al. (2013) evaluated the
diagnostic accuracy of CCTA in 120 patients with suspected coronary artery
disease who had cardiac positron emission topography (PET), CCTA and ICA.
CCTA was done using a hybrid PET/CT scanner. Kajander et al. (2010) evaluated
the diagnostic accuracy of PET and CCTA in 107 patients with a history of stable
chest pain and a 30% to 70% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. All
patients had ICA independently of the non-invasive imaging results, and
treatment decisions were based on both ICA and FFR.
3.7 Table 1 summarises the EAC's analysis of diagnostic accuracy for
HeartFlow FFR and its comparators at both per-vessel and per-patient levels,
CT
as shown in table 1. When there was more than 1 diagnostic accuracy study

3.8 The EAC considered that despite the limitations associated with patients having a
different reference test in some studies, all contributed to the decision problem
and provided data for synthesis. It judged that the Nørgaard (2014) study had a
low risk of bias for flow and timing, index and reference test. It noted that there
was a risk of patient selection bias because an inclusion criterion was that
patients had to have been referred for ICA, but it noted no other risks of bias or
applicability concerns. Although it acknowledged that there were no studies
directly comparing all the tests, it concluded that HeartFlow FFR has:
CT
• similar sensitivity but higher specificity compared with CCTA
• higher sensitivity but lower specificity compared with ECHO
• similar sensitivity but lower specificity compared with MRI
• higher sensitivity and specificity compared with SPECT.
Summary of clinical-effectiveness evidence
3.9 The company conducted a literature search for evidence on the clinical outcomes
specified in the decision problem for HeartFlow FFR , and the existing
CT
treatments, against any comparator. It identified 16 studies of which 5 included
HeartFlow FFR , 1 published (Guar et al. 2014) and 4 unpublished (PLATFORM,
CT
Radiation FFR , Real World Usage FFR and FFR RIPCORD).

3.10 The EAC included extra intervention and comparator keywords and identified
11 studies, 4 of which had already been identified by the company: 2 published
studies (Hachamovitch et al. 2012 and Douglas et al. 2015) and 2 unpublished
studies. The EAC noted that only the 2 unpublished studies fully matched the
population, intervention, comparators and outcomes defined in the scope; the
other 9 included various comparators but not HeartFlow FFR . The
CT
2 unpublished studies including HeartFlow FFR were PLATFORM (see
CT
section 3.18) and Radiation FFR ; the company provided both in the form of
CT
interim results for the former and an abstract for the latter. Two studies (Real
World Usage FFR and FFR RIPCORD) included HeartFlow FFR but were
CT CT CT
excluded because they did not provide information on patients' pre-test likelihood
of coronary artery disease.
3.11 Radiation FFR is a single-centre modelling study, based in Canada, investigating
CT
the potential effect of HeartFlow FFR on radiation dose exposure and
CT
downstream clinical event rate. In the modelling, a clinical pathway in which CCTA
plus FFR was the initial diagnostic test was compared with 3 clinical pathways
CT
instead utilising SPECT, ECHO or CCTA as initial diagnostic tests. The model
included 100 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, 34% of whom had
intermediate disease. Patients were stratified into 3 categories of likelihood of
disease: 50% low, 40% moderate and 10% high. No clinical outcomes were
measured in this modelled population. The primary outcome was the estimated
radiation dose and the secondary outcome was death or myocardial infarction
estimates at 1 year after the test. Of the 4 diagnostic pathways studied, ECHO
had the lowest radiation dose (5.3 mSv) but had a higher clinical event rate
related to both false-positive and false-negative findings. The FFR pathway had
CT
lower cumulative radiation exposure (9.4 mSv) than SPECT (26.4 mSv) or CCTA
(13.9 mSv) and also had the lowest clinical adverse event rate for low and
intermediate-risk patients. For high-risk patients, the lowest clinical event rate
was with ICA.
3.12 The PROMISE study (Douglas et al. 2015) is a US-based multicentre randomised
controlled trial involving over 10,000 patients, with a median follow-up of
25 months. Although the study did not include FFR , the EAC considered it
CT
relevant to the decision problem because it provides further evidence on a
diagnostic pathway based on CCTA. Patients with a mean pre-test likelihood of
coronary artery disease of 53.3% plus or minus 21.4% were randomly assigned to

either CCTA or functional imaging as a first-line diagnostic test. The composite
primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for unstable
angina, or major procedural complication. Secondary end points included invasive
cardiac catheterisation that did not show obstructive coronary artery disease and
radiation exposure. Results showed that 164 of 4,996 (3.3%) patients in the CCTA
group and in 151 of 5,007 (3.0%) in the functional testing group (adjusted hazard
ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.29; p=0.75) achieved the primary
end point. CCTA was associated with fewer catheterisations showing no
obstructive coronary artery disease than functional imaging (3.4% compared with
4.3%, p=0.02), although more patients in the CCTA group had catheterisation
within 90 days of randomisation (12.2% compared with 8.1%). The median
cumulative radiation exposure per patient was lower in the CCTA group than in
the functional testing group (10.0 mSv compared with 11.3 mSv), but 32.6% of the
patients in the functional testing group had no exposure. As such, overall
exposure was higher in the CCTA group (mean 12.0 mSv compared with 10.1 mSv;
p<0.001).
3.13 The EAC identified 9 published studies containing information on clinical
outcomes in comparator diagnostic technologies. Further information about these
studies can be found in the assessment report.
Chest pain guideline update: second literature search
3.14 During the assessment of HeartFlow FFR for this guidance, NICE updated its
CT
guideline on chest pain. Because this included new recommendations for
investigating chest pain, it became necessary to update the evidence and cost
modelling for the HeartFlow FFR assessment. The EAC repeated the evidence
CT
searches up to February 2016 and asked the company to identify any recent and
ongoing studies. In total, the EAC assessed 7 new studies, 6 of which included
HeartFlow FFR .

correlation between FFR and invasive FFR values, expressed as translesional
CT
delta (the difference between the proximal and distal FFR measurement of all
sequential lesions). Values of translesional delta for FFR and FFR were 0.10 plus
CT
or minus 0.09 and 0.09 plus or minus 0.10 in distal segments, and 0.17 plus or
minus 0.10 and 0.22 plus or minus 0.13 in proximal segments respectively. The
coefficient of correlation between translesional delta FFR and FFR in each
CT
segment was 0.92 (p<0.001). The authors concluded that translesional delta FFR
is highly correlated with FFR .

3.16 Thompson et al. (2015) investigated the diagnostic performance of FFR in
CT
relation to patients' sex and age, using invasive FFR measurements as the
reference standard for a subgroup of the DeFACTO study. Previous evidence from
DeFACTO was not considered eligible because it included patients with a high
pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (Min et al. 2012). Thompson et al.
(2015) was included because it reports results based on subgroup analyses for
age and sex. The baseline pre-test likelihood did not differ in statistical
significance within these subgroups, so it is not expected to bias the results. The
authors investigated 252 patients (407 vessels) with stable angina, clinically
suspected coronary artery disease and at least 1 coronary stenosis of 30% to
90%. For their analysis, the authors used a clinical rule that included all vessels of
diameter more than or equal to 2 mm and assigned an FFR value of 0.90 for
vessels with stenoses less than 30% and an FFR value of 0.50 for vessels with
stenoses more than 90%. There was no clinical follow-up. The primary outcome
was per-patient and vessel diagnostic performance of FFR . Using this clinical
CT
rule, diagnostic performance improved in both sexes with no statistically
significant differences between them. There were no differences in the
discrimination of FFR after application of the clinical use rule when stratified by
CT
age 65 and over or less than 65 years. The authors concluded that FFR had
CT
similar diagnostic accuracy and discriminatory power to FFR for ischaemia
detection in men and women irrespective of age using a cut-off point of 65 years.
3.17 The other 4 studies on HeartFlow FFR looked at clinical outcomes. The
CT
PLATFORM study (Douglas et al. 2015b and 2016) was presented to the
committee as academic in confidence in June 2015 (Douglas et al. 2015a). The
study included 584 patients recruited at 11 international centres. They were
prospectively assigned to have either functional imaging (n=287) or CCTA/FFR
CT
(n=297). Each cohort was subdivided into 2 groups based on the evaluation plan

decided before enrolment in the study: non-invasive testing (any form of stress
testing or CCTA without FFR ) or ICA (invasive testing).
CT
3.18 Douglas et al. (2015b) report the study results at 3-month follow-up. The primary
end point was the percentage of patients with planned ICA in whom no
significant obstructive coronary artery disease (no stenosis more than or equal to
50% by core laboratory quantitative analysis or invasive FFR less than 0.80) was
found at ICA within 90 days. Secondary end points included a composite
measure of major adverse cardiac events consisting of death, myocardial
infarction and unplanned revascularisation, all of which were independently and
blindly assessed. Among patients with intended ICA (CCTA/FFR =193; functional
CT
imaging=187), no obstructive coronary artery disease was found with ICA in
24 patients (12%) in the CCTA/FFR arm and 137 patients (73%) in the functional
CT
imaging arm (risk difference 61%, 95% CI 53 to 69, p<0.0001). Among patients
intended for non-invasive testing, the rates of finding no obstructive coronary
artery disease with ICA were 13% in the CCTA/FFR arm and 6% in the functional
CT
imaging arm (p=0.95). ICA was cancelled in 61% of patients after reviewing the
CCTA/FFR results. There were low numbers of MACE and vascular
CT
complications in all groups.
3.19 Douglas et al. (2016) report outcomes from the same study at 1 year. The clinical
end points measured were MACE and MACE plus vascular events within 14 days
of procedure. Quality of life and resource use outcomes were also collected.
There were 2 MACE events in each arm of the planned invasive group (risk
difference -0.03 [CI -8.6 to 8.5]) and 1 in the planned non-invasive group (risk
difference -1.00 [CI -12.7 to 10.7]). Cumulative 1-year radiation exposure in
patients in the intended invasive evaluation cohort was similar between the usual
care strategy (mean: 10.4 plus or minus 6.7 mSv) and CCTA/FFR -guided
CT
strategy (mean: 10.7 plus or minus 9.6 mSv; p=0.21), whereas in the non-invasive
testing cohort it was higher in patients with a CCTA/FFR -guided strategy than
CT
usual care strategy (mean: 9.6 plus or minus 10.6 mSv compared with 6.4 plus or
minus 7.6 mSv, p<0.001). Functional status and quality of life improved from
baseline to 1-year follow-up in the planned non-invasive group (p<0.001 for all
measures), with greater improvements on the EQ-5D in patients having CCTA/
FFR compared with patients having functional imaging (mean change: 0.12 for
CT
CCTA/FFR compared with 0.07 for functional imaging, p=0.02).

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
3.20 Lu et al. (2015) used a subgroup analysis of the PROMISE trial (n=181) to
investigate the added value of FFR compared with CCTA in improving efficiency
CT
of referral to ICA. End points for the subgroup analysis were rate of
revascularisation and ICA that did not show obstructive coronary artery disease
and MACE. Over a median follow-up of 25 months, the addition of FFR
CT
increased the rate of ICA with revascularisation from 49% to 61%. The rate of
angiography without obstructive disease decreased from 27% to 11%. No patient
with FFR more than 0.80 had an adverse event which ICA would have
CT
prevented.
3.21 Nørgaard (2016) reports on the real-world experience of using CCTA with FFR
CT
as gatekeeper to ICA in patients with stable coronary artery disease and
intermediate-range coronary lesions (n=189). Patients were followed up for a
median of 12 months. The primary end point was the impact of FFR on further
CT
downstream diagnostic testing. Other end points were the agreement between
FFR and invasive FFR, and the short-term clinical outcome after FFR testing
CT CT
defined as the occurrence of MACE (death and acute myocardial infarction) or an
angina episode leading to hospital admission or visit in the outpatient clinic. The
authors concluded that FFR testing is feasible in real-world scenarios involving
CT
patients with intermediate-range coronary stenosis determined by CCTA. They
also concluded that implementing FFR for clinical decision-making may
CT
influence the downstream diagnostic workflow, and patients with an FFR more
CT
than 0.80 who are not referred for ICA have a favourable short-term prognosis.
The authors highlight that in patients with FFR ranging between 0.76 and 0.80,
CT
a non-negligible number of false-positive results may be expected.
3.22 The EAC considered that the 1-year follow-up data from the PLATFORM study
supported the company's claims about resource use, rates of ICA and
percutaneous coronary intervention, and quality of life with HeartFlow FFR .
CT
Additionally, the 1-year follow-up evidence from the PLATFORM supports the
company's claim that MACE outcomes are equivalent between the current
pathway and one that uses FFR , whereas the PROMISE study showed that
CT
MACE outcomes at 1 year were equivalent between CCTA alone and functional
testing. The EAC also considered that the evidence from the PLATFORM study
showed higher 1-year radiation exposure in the HeartFlow FFR group in patients
CT
intended for non-invasive evaluation. However, this is to be expected because
many patients in the non-invasive evaluation had a non-invasive test which did

(HTG429)
not need the use of radiation. The EAC concluded that the submitted evidence on
clinical outcomes supports the value proposition of an FFR -guided strategy
CT
compared with standard of care, mainly in patients with planned invasive
investigation, with equivalent results between FFR and functional imaging in the
CT
non-invasive group.
Committee considerations
3.23 The committee considered that the evidence showed high diagnostic accuracy
and increased specificity with HeartFlow FFR compared with CCTA alone. It
CT
also noted promising results from the PLATFORM study, in a population which
closely matches that in the scope. The evidence was sufficient to conclude that
HeartFlow FFR has a high diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease, and
CT
that its use has the potential to reduce the need for invasive coronary
investigations.
3.24 The committee considered the technology to be innovative and understood that
its adoption may serve to simplify a complex patient pathway. The committee
heard from clinical experts that they had confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of
HeartFlow FFR , and that it could provide an effective early rule-out test for
CT
coronary artery disease. This would reduce the need for ICA and invasive FFR
measurement, and potentially reduce radiation exposure.
3.25 The committee understood that there are differences in the local implementation
of the patient pathway for diagnosing coronary artery disease. It was advised by
clinical experts that the choice of functional imaging test depends on local
access, available expertise and clinician preference. It heard that although
HeartFlow FFR has the potential to reduce the number of tests that are done,
CT
the other non-invasive functional imaging tests that are part of the current
patient pathway offer different functionality and in some cases provide additional
information. Overall, the committee concluded that HeartFlow FFR should be
CT
considered for use as a non-invasive investigation for diagnosing angina in
patients with stable, recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, and
that it provides the clinician with additional functional information to determine
which coronary lesions are responsible for myocardial ischaemia. The committee
considered that further clinical studies would be helpful to clarify the wider

applicability of HeartFlow FFR in routine clinical practice.
CT
3.26 The committee considered the evidence from the PLATFORM study to be most
relevant to the decision problem. It considered that the results demonstrate the
potential of FFR to avoid ICA and improve quality of life.
CT
3.27 The committee discussed the relative importance of a per-patient or a per-vessel
diagnosis. It heard from experts that per-patient diagnostic accuracy was more
important for initial diagnosis, and that a per-vessel assessment provides
additional information to inform patient management. The committee concluded
that per-patient level figures were the most reliable and relevant to the diagnosis
of coronary artery disease.

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
4 NHS considerations
System impact
4.1 The company's claimed system benefits included reduced costs from fewer
inconclusive or inaccurate diagnostic tests and avoidance of unnecessary staff
and procedure costs. It claimed that this would lead to more effective use of
invasive procedure suites.
4.2 The company confirmed that, with specific reference to the updated NICE
guideline on chest pain, the proposed place in the diagnostic pathway for
HeartFlow FFR (to inform management following a positive coronary CT
CT
angiography [CCTA] result) was unchanged.
4.3 Conservative estimates by the NICE resource impact assessment team suggest
that by 2021/22, when fully implemented, HeartFlow FFR will potentially be
CT
used in around 40,000 patients a year. This would equate to national savings of at
least £9.1 million a year.
4.4 During selection and routing, the committee asked for additional information on
compliance with data protection legislation, and the reproducibility of
HeartFlow FFR analysis, especially in the face of an increasing workload which
CT
might be expected to arise from adoption of the technology in the NHS. The
external assessment centre (EAC) produced a technical report that concluded:
• The company has a quality assurance process in place that fulfils data quality
needs. This includes checks by different team members, and the separation
of tasks to ensure that no single analyst is fully responsible for a diagnosis.
After the procedure, a more experienced analyst reviews the process,
focusing mainly on areas of stenosis. Expert clinician advice is also available
should it be needed.
• Although the analytical process is largely automated, any part of it can be
manually changed by the analyst. This may affect the fractional flow reserve
CT (FFR ) estimate. Manual editing is part of the quality assurance process,

HeartFlow FFRCT for estimating fractional flow reserve from coronary CT angiography
(HTG429)
negating the risk of spurious results generated from the automated analysis.
Gaur et al. (2014) suggest that reproducibility is within acceptable 95%
confidence interval limits of agreement. FFR reproducibility was found to be
CT
equivalent to invasive FFR reproducibility.
• The reproducibility of outlining the coronary artery lumen, part of the FFR
CT
computation analysis, decreases in the distal portion of the vessel (Gage
repeatability and reproducibility=29.4%). This could be a result of different
factors including lower CT quality, lower CT resolution, smaller vessel
diameter at the distal end and higher disease burden.
• The company monitors FFR reproducibility by re-processing 5% of its case
CT
volume on a weekly basis. The company has confirmed that this has shown a
reproducibility rate consistent with the literature (Gaur et al. 2014).
• The company fulfils regulatory approval standards for data confidentiality and
integrity protection for remote processing. It offers NHS customers the option
to upload fully anonymised DICOM data to comply with UK data protection
law.
Committee considerations
4.5 The committee was satisfied with the EAC's conclusions on reproducibility (see
section 4.4). It accepted that the company has protocols in place to manage an
increased demand for HeartFlow FFR .
CT
4.6 The committee considered the protection and oversight of data transferred
during the administration of HeartFlow FFR to be an important factor in the
CT
device's adoption. The committee was satisfied, on the basis of the information
available, that the company's data transfer protocols meet regulatory
requirements. The committee noted that patients should be informed when
sending personal data outside the European Economic Area with
HeartFlow FFR , and that it may be necessary to obtain written consent.
CT
4.7 The committee considered the availability of CCTA facilities. It understood that
the cost model assumed access to CCTA facilities, but heard from experts that
access to CCTA varies across the NHS despite recommendations in NICE's

previous guideline on chest pain. Furthermore, because CT scanners are used for
many purposes, a constraint currently exists with regard to both the availability of
scanners and scanning time. The committee heard from experts that a sizable
investment would be needed for the wider implementation of HeartFlow FFR ,
CT
but acknowledged that this consideration was beyond the scope of the current
assessment. It understood that adopting 64-slice CCTA was ongoing in the NHS,
in line with the recommendations in the previous NICE guideline on chest pain.

5 Cost considerations
Cost evidence
5.1 The company conducted a search of the health economics literature on
HeartFlow FFR and the comparators specified in the decision problem. They
CT
identified a total of 174 studies, 24 of which it considered relevant to the decision
problem.
5.2 The external assessment centre (EAC) reviewed this search, and considered that
most of the studies included neither an appropriate patient population nor a
treatment pathway. Only 1 published study, Rajani et al. (2015), was considered
by the EAC to be relevant to the decision problem. It conducted a further review
of the literature up to February 2016 and identified an additional relevant
published study, Hlatky et al. (2015).
5.3 Rajani et al. (2015) was a single-centre retrospective cost analysis of 410 patients
referred to a rapid-access chest pain clinic in Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital,
London, from April 2012 to March 2013. Patients were grouped into pre-test
likelihood categories and diagnostic imaging was done based on standardised
protocols as recommended in the previous NICE guideline on chest pain. A
standardised unit cost for each test and procedure was taken from the NHS
National Tariff 2013/14. A decision-tree economic model was used to evaluate the
cost of 1,000 patients passing through the current treatment pathway compared
with the same 1,000 patients after incorporating HeartFlow FFR . The authors
CT
found that introducing HeartFlow FFR to the pathway resulted in cost savings of
CT
£200 per patient. The EAC noted that although the derivation of costs in the
study is explicit, details of the decision model structure are unclear.
5.4 Hlatky et al. (2015) investigated the quality-of-life and economic outcomes of
fractional flow reserve CT (FFR ) in the PLATFORM study (see section 3.17).
CT
Cumulative medical costs were measured over 90 days for each patient by
multiplying a standardised cost weight for each medical resource by the number
of resources used by the patient. Medicare reimbursement rates (the national
average of technical and professional fees in the US) from 2015 were applied

(HTG429)
because cost weights and online pharmacy costs were used for drugs. Patients
were prospectively assigned to either functional imaging (usual care, n=287) or
coronary CT angiography (CCTA)/HeartFlow FFR (n=297). In the planed
CT
invasive group, mean costs were $7,343 among the CCTA/FFR patients and
CT
$10,734 among functional imaging patients (p<0.0001). In the planned non-
invasive group, mean costs were not significantly different (p=0.26) between the
CCTA/FFR patients ($2,679) and the functional imaging patients ($2,137).
CT
Overall, each quality-of-life (EQ-5D) score improved at 90 days compared with
baseline in the study population (p<0.0001), and scores improved more in CCTA/
FFR patients than in functional imaging patients. In the invasive group, quality-
CT
of-life improvements were similar in both arms.
5.5 Douglas et al. (2016) published data on the 1-year economic outcomes of FFR in
CT
the PLATFORM study. Costs were calculated in the same manner as the 90-day
results in Hlatky et al. (2015). In the planned invasive arm, the mean per-patient
cost was $8,127 in FFR patients and $12,145 for usual care patients (p<0.0001).
CT
The cost savings at 1 year increased by 1.5% from the cost savings at 90 days. In
the non-invasive arm, mean costs were not significantly different (p=0.82)
between the FFR patients ($3,049) and the usual care patients ($2,579).
CT
Economic model
5.6 The company presented a decision-tree model based on integrating
HeartFlow FFR into the existing diagnostic pathway at the time of its
CT
submission. A theoretical population of 1,000 patients with suspected coronary
artery disease was allocated to either the current treatment pathway (based on
the previous NICE guideline on chest pain) or the company's revised pathway,
which included HeartFlow FFR . The cost consequences of the treatment
CT
pathways were compared based on the mix of diagnostic technologies used in
each. The model had a 1-year time horizon, included the impact of different
testing strategies, and relevant clinical outcomes.
5.7 The proportion of patients eligible for CCTA as a first-line test and their
probability of having coronary artery disease were taken from Rajani et al. (2015).
In the model, 10% of patients were assumed to be ineligible for invasive coronary
angiography (ICA), have an inconclusive CCTA result and have an uncertain

single-photon emission CT (SPECT) result.
5.8 The diagnostic accuracy of HeartFlow FFR and its comparators in the
CT
company's model were based on per-patient level results reported in selected
papers, as follows:
• HeartFlow FFR : sensitivity 86%, specificity 79% (Nørgaard et al. 2014)
CT
• SPECT: sensitivity 76%, specificity 38% (Melikian et al. 2010)
• CCTA: sensitivity 94%, specificity 48% (Meijboom et al. 2008)
• ICA: sensitivity 69%, specificity 67% (Meijboom et al. 2008).
The cost of HeartFlow FFR (£888) was based on the company's original list
CT
price. Costs for comparator tests were based on 2014/15 hospital resource
group (HRG) tariffs, as follows:
• SPECT: £220 (HRG code RA37Z, nuclear medicine category 3)
• CCTA: £136 (HRG code RA14Z, CT scan, more than 3 areas)
• Calcium scoring: £77 (HRG code RA08Z, CT scan, 1 area, no contrast)
• ICA: £1,241 (HRG code EA36A, catheter 19 years and over)
• Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): £2,832 (weighted average of
2 tariffs, assuming that 25% of patients needing PCI will need more than
2 stents. HRG codes EA31Z [£2,704] and EA49Z [£3,216]).
5.9 The company's base-case results reported an average per-patient cost of £2,239
using the current pathway and £2,080 using the adapted pathway with
HeartFlow FFR , representing an average saving of £159 per patient.
CT
5.10 The company conducted 1-way sensitivity analyses on the sensitivity and
specificity of HeartFlow FFR and the comparator tests, as well as the costs of
CT
HeartFlow FFR . The analyses showed that HeartFlow FFR continued to be
CT CT
cost saving until its price reached £1,126. With regard to changes in the sensitivity
and specificity, HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving for nearly all the values
CT
tested when considered in the context of the entire patient population.

(HTG429)
Revisions by the external assessment centre
5.11 The EAC incorporated the changes to the updated NICE guideline on chest pain
in the company economic model. In this context, the EAC assumed that
HeartFlow FFR would be used following an initial CCTA, and that non-invasive
CT
functional imaging tests would subsequently be used only if the CCTA result were
uncertain or non-diagnostic. The EAC reviewed the parameters and costs used in
the company's model. It revised the company's sensitivity and specificity
parameters for the comparator diagnostic tests, based on its own analyses of
diagnostic accuracy (see table 1).
5.12 The EAC used the company's revised list price of £700 for HeartFlow FFR ,
CT
instead of £888 as used in the company's model.
5.13 The EAC used the updated NICE guideline on chest pain to determine the costs
of all comparator tests except MRI, to ensure that they were consistent with
2014/15 reference costs. The cost of MRI was taken from the Payment by Results
tariff, because the chest pain guideline committee determined this to be more
representative of the true cost. These costs were as follows:
• SPECT: £367 (RN21Z, myocardial perfusion scan, stress only )
• CCTA: £122 (RD28Z, complex CT scan)
• ECHO: £271 (EY50Z, complex echocardiogram)
• ICA: £1,685 (EY43A to EY43F, standard cardiac catheterisation)
• MRI: £515 (RA67Z, cardiac MRI scan, pre and post contrast)
• PCI: £2,865 (weighted average of 2 tariffs, assuming that 25% of patients
needing PCI will need more than 2 stents. HRG codes EA31Z [£2,704] and
EA49Z [£3,216]). Includes an estimated annual cost of £33 for medication
following a PCI [aspirin and clopidogrel, BNF (2015)].
5.14 The EAC noted that the company's model did not include costs of drug therapy
for patients having PCI. It consulted the NICE guideline on stable angina and
estimated an annual drug treatment cost for these patients of £33 based on BNF
(2015) prescription costs for aspirin and clopidogrel, and used a cost of £2,865

(HTG429)
(PCI tariff with drug costs) in its revised model.
5.15 The EAC included a cost for optimal medical therapy. It obtained expert advice
that optimal medical therapy usually consists of aspirin, statins, nitrates and beta
blockers. Based on this information it estimated an annual cost of £84 (aspirin,
simvastatin, glyceryl trinitrate and propranolol hydrochloride) from the BNF (2015)
and used it in the revised model.
5.16 Using these updated assumptions, the EAC found a base-case cost saving of
£214 per patient for HeartFlow FFR compared with the current treatment
CT
pathway for all functional imaging tests (SPECT, MRI and ECHO).
5.17 The EAC ran a number of sensitivity analyses, varying: the price of
HeartFlow FFR ; the diagnostic accuracy of the functional imaging tests,
CT
HeartFlow FFR , ICA and CCTA; and the proportion of uncertain CCTA and
CT
functional imaging tests. It also used estimates of diagnostic accuracy for CCTA
and ICA from the updated NICE guideline on chest pain. In all instances,
HeartFlow FFR remained cost saving.
CT
Committee considerations
5.18 The committee considered the cost modelling done by the EAC to be both
appropriate and plausible. The committee heard from experts that percutaneous
or surgical revascularisation is only offered to patients following ICA, and
sometimes a confirmatory invasive FFR. The availability of data from
HeartFlow FFR may help to plan treatment in individual vessels and patients.
CT
5.19 For the guidance review, the EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs. There
were no changes to the cost of the technology. The main parameter change was
the cost of comparator tests. Further details of the 2021 revised model are in the
cost update in the review decision.
5.20 Based on the 2021 guidance review updated cost model, the EAC found a base-
case cost saving of £391 per patient for HeartFlow FFR compared with the
CT
current treatment pathway for all functional imaging tests (SPECT, MRI and
ECHO). This cost saving will increase if the cost of HeartFlow FFR is reduced.
