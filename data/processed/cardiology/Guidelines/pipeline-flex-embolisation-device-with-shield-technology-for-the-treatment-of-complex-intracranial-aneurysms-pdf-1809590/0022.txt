hours) and therefore the use of additional endovascular equipment were different for stent-assisted coiling and insertion of Pipeline. The expert advisers stated that the procedures are likely to take the same amount of time in clinical practice. The external assessment centre noted that the time taken for stent-assisted coiling was derived from 1 non-comparative study and the time for inserting Pipeline from another. However the external assessment centre was not able to judge which study was the best source for duration of procedure and no systematic review was carried out. The external assessment centre stated that because both studies were appropriately and accurately used in the model no changes were justified with regard to procedure time for stent-assisted coiling or Pipeline. The external assessment centre also noted that the sponsor included the use of additional endovascular equipment in the model based on the duration of procedure, but provided no justification for why it was included only for stent- assisted coiling and not for Pipeline or the other comparators. Furthermore, there was no justification for why the cost of additional equipment was only included in calculating the retreatment cost but not the cost of the initial procedure. The exploratory analyses demonstrated
