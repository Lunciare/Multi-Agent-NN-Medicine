to estimate accurately the number of coils which will be required to treat an aneurysm during stent-assisted coiling, but it was advised by experts that the number can usually be predicted with an accuracy of plus or minus 6 coils. 5.21 The committee discussed a number of parameters in the sponsor's economic model based on comments received during public consultation. As described in sections 5.12 to 5.17, these included: the cost of microcatheters used for stent- assisted coiling; balloon use in UK practice during stent-assisted coiling; drug costs for patients having Pipeline and those having stent-assisted coiling; the duration of the procedure and the use of additional endovascular equipment in stent-assisted coiling. These parameters were examined in additional analyses by the external assessment centre. 5.22 The committee considered that the costs for microcatheters used for stent- assisted coiling in the sponsor's base-case analysis were overestimated. It agreed with the views of the expert advisers that it was reasonable to use the average cost of the microcatheters most commonly used in UK clinical practice. This reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £37,451 to £36,137. 5.23 Based on expert advice, the committee accepted that the inclusion of balloon use
