Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology to the UK Neurointerventional Radiology Group audit database, to increase the evidence base and guide future use of this technology. 2 The technology Description of the technology 2.1 The Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology ('Pipeline'; Medtronic) is a self-expanding blood flow diverter that is placed across the neck of an intracranial aneurysm. While blood flow through the parent vessel is maintained via the device, flow within the aneurysm sac is disrupted, leading to stagnation and eventual thrombosis formation. Pipeline provides a scaffold for endothelial growth leading to the formation of a biological seal and exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. [2019] 2.2 Pipeline is a braided, cobalt chromium and platinum stent-like device which is loaded into and delivered via a microcatheter. It is manufactured in lengths of 10 mm to 35 mm and is available in different diameters from 2.5 mm to 5 mm (in 0.25 mm increments). Multiple devices can be used within each other and/or in sequence to increase the overall length of the construct or to increase the metal surface coverage within an aneurysm. 2.3 Pipeline is indicated for use in patients with unruptured, complex intracranial aneurysms,
