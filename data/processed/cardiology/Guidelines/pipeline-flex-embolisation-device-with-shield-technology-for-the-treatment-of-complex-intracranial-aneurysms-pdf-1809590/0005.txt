Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

Pipeline presented in the decision problem are: • successful device deployment • successful occlusion of the aneurysm, with or without preservation of flow through the parent vessel • size of the aneurysm and its contained thrombus mass • resolution of symptoms (including headache, diplopia, nystagmus or other neurological dysfunction), relief of pain and quality of life outcomes • resource use outcomes (for example, re-admission rates, repeat interventions and duration of hospital stay) • stroke related to device insertion (any cause, but particularly due to vessel occlusion or bleeding) • delayed parent vessel occlusion • subarachnoid haemorrhage and/or other major bleeding events needing admission to hospital • neurovascular death • device-related adverse events. 3.3 The sponsor identified 13 studies relevant to the scope, but because it judged the quality of many of these to be poor and because of duplication in patient reporting, the sponsor's submission presented detailed findings on a total of 139 patients from 2 studies, with a maximum follow-up of 2 years. The studies were Pipeline for Intracranial Treatment of Aneurysms (PITA) and Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed aneurysms (PUFS). 3.4 Nelson et al. (2011) reported outcomes up to 2 years for the PITA study: a prospective, multicentre
