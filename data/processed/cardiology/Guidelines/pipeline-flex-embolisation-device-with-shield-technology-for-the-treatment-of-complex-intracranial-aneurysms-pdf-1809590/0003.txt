increase the overall length of the construct or to increase the metal surface coverage within an aneurysm. 2.3 Pipeline is indicated for use in patients with unruptured, complex intracranial aneurysms, specifically large and giant, wide-necked and fusiform aneurysms. This is the group of patients covered by this guidance. Pipeline may also be used in patients whose aneurysms are unsuitable for standard coiling and/or stenting and for neurosurgical treatment; and in patients for whom previous coiling/ clipping procedures have failed. 2.4 The cost of Pipeline stated in the sponsor's submission is £10,171. These costs have been updated in the latest revision of the cost model to £10,450. [2019] 2.5 The claimed benefits of Pipeline in the case for adoption presented by the sponsor are: • A higher rate of complete, permanent occlusion of large/giant intracranial aneurysms compared with coiling and stent-assisted coiling, leading to reduced rates of retreatment and a decreased risk of haemorrhage. • Increased access to treatment for patients with complex intracranial aneurysms. Pipeline offers a new option for treating patients with complex intracranial aneurysms which are not suitable for stent-assisted coiling or surgery, and patients for whom previous interventions have failed. • Patients may experience a resolution of
