treatment, based on a mortality rate for the procedure, into 1 of 3 occlusion categories (complete occlusion, residual neck and residual aneurysm). For each occlusion category, patients were tracked through 5 possible health states: 'no complications', 'new non-fatal rupture', 'post rupture', 'fatal rupture' and 'dead (all cause)'. It was assumed that transition probabilities for the health states would be constant over time. The time horizon of the base-case analysis was 10 years. 5.4 An NHS and personal social services perspective was used. The cost analysis included the costs associated with the duration of the procedure, staff time (surgeon, radiologist, nurse, anaesthetist), hospital costs (neurology operating or neurosurgical operating room, and recovery ward), imaging (angiography, fluoroscopy or MRI), consumables, drugs; and for conservative management only, long-term monitoring with annual MRI. The cost associated with stroke was assumed to be representative of the cost of rupture. Costs applied to each type of retreatment were assumed to be the same as the full cost if that treatment had been used initially. 5.5 The costs and consequences associated with adverse events were not included in the base-case analysis because the sponsor considered there to be insufficient reliable data for each treatment group. However, the
