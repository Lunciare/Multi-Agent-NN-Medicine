the PUFS study, the primary effectiveness end point was complete occlusion of the aneurysm and absence of parent vessel stenosis greater than 50% at 180 days. The probability of exceeding the pre-determined 'success threshold' of 50% was statistically significant (p<0.0001; FDA, 2011). 3.9 Major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death, as judged by the Clinical Events Committee, was reported in 6% (6 of 107) of patients at 180 days in the PUFS study (FDA 2011). Ipsilateral stroke was reported in 7% (2 of 31) of patients within 30 days in the PITA study (Nelson et al. 2011). Five other studies including a total of 58 patients (68 complex intracranial aneurysms) reported a stroke rate of 0% at follow-up ranging from 10 weeks to more than 52 weeks (Fiorella et al. 2009a, 2009b; Lylyk et al. 2009a; Klisch et al. 2011; Sararols et al. 2011). 3.10 In the PUFS study, 3 of the 6 patients who had a major ipsilateral stroke died (timing of events not reported). Nelson et al. (2011) reported no deaths in the PITA study. 3.11 Nelson et al. (2011) reported complete occlusion of the target aneurysm in 93% (28 of 30) of patients at 180 days (95% confidence
