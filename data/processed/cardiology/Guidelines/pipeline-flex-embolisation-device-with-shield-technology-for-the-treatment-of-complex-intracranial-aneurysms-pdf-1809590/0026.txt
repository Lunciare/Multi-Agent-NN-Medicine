UK clinical practice. This reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £37,451 to £36,137. 5.23 Based on expert advice, the committee accepted that the inclusion of balloon use during stent-assisted coiling in the sponsor's base-case analysis was inappropriate and that it was reasonable to adjust this cost to zero. This reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £36,137 to £35,725, while the total procedure cost for Pipeline remained at £30,354. 5.24 The committee considered the drug costs presented in the sponsor's base-case analysis. It noted the external assessment centre's view that few published data are available on clinical use and that the low cost of these drugs and the difference in drug use would not be likely to have any significant impact on the overall procedure costs for either stent-assisted coiling or Pipeline. The committee agreed that the drug cost in the sponsor's base-case analysis was appropriate 5.25 The committee considered the average duration of the procedure presented in the sponsor's base-case analysis. It noted the external assessment centre's view that both studies were appropriately and accurately used in the model and that therefore no changes were justified for the average duration of the procedure for
