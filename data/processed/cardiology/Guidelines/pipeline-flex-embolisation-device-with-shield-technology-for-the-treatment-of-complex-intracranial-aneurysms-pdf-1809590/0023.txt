was no justification for why the cost of additional equipment was only included in calculating the retreatment cost but not the cost of the initial procedure. The exploratory analyses demonstrated that removing the costs of additional endovascular equipment from the model reduced the total procedure cost of stent-assisted coiling from £35,724 to £35,693 while the total procedure cost for Pipeline remained at £30,346. Committee considerations 5.18 The committee considered the cost consequences of using Pipeline against 5 comparators – stent-assisted coiling, neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion and conservative management. 5.19 The committee noted that in UK clinical practice, patients who might currently be considered for Pipeline would be those for whom surgery would not be possible and for whom stent-assisted coiling would be the only other potential intervention. It therefore considered that comparison of costs with those for stent-assisted coiling was of particular relevance. The committee noted that for this cost comparison, the main drivers of cost were the numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices used and the numbers of coils used during stent-assisted coiling. The committee was given advice from the experts about whether 1 or 2 Pipeline embolisation devices should be used as the
