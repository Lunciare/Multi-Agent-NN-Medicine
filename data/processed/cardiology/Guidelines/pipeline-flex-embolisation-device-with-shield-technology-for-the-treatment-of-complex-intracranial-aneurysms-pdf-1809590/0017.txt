Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

against which Pipeline was shown to be cost saving was stent- assisted coiling, with a cost saving of £13,110 per patient. 5.8 Two scenario analyses were presented. One included costs associated with the adverse events of subarachnoid haemorrhage related to the aneurysm, thromboembolic stroke and intracranial haemorrhagic stroke remote from the aneurysm using data from the PUFS study and data from Darsault et al. (2001) for the comparators. The other scenario analysis restricted the time horizon to 6 months (short-term). Conservative management was excluded from the short- term scenario because it does not have a 'peri-procedural' mortality rate. 5.9 In both scenario analyses Pipeline was shown to be cost saving only when compared with stent-assisted coiling. When costs associated with adverse events were included in the model, Pipeline remained a cost-saving intervention compared with stent-assisted coiling, with an associated saving of £13,327. When outcomes were restricted to the short term (6 months), Pipeline remained cost saving compared with stent-assisted coiling (£10,316). 5.10 Sensitivity analyses carried out by the sponsor showed that the main factors influencing the cost analysis were the number and cost of consumables, in particular the numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices and endovascular coils.
