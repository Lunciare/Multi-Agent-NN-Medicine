Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

offers the only possible means of treatment (an estimated 60 patients per year in the UK). For these patients the potential benefits offered by Pipeline are important, because they are at high risk of aneurysm rupture and because their intracranial aneurysms are unsuitable for other treatments. 5 Cost considerations Cost evidence 5.1 The sponsor submitted a de novo cost analysis for Pipeline for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. Full details of all cost evidence and modelling considered by the committee are available in the assessment report overview. 5.2 The sponsor presented a decision tree (for the peri-procedural period) followed by a Markov model (for long-term outcomes) to estimate the costs and consequences associated with Pipeline against 5 comparator interventions: stent-assisted coiling, neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion and conservative management. The patient population included those with unruptured large or giant intracranial aneurysms as outlined in the scope, but did not include fusiform or wide-necked aneurysms. 5.3 The decision-tree structure separated patients who had survived initial treatment, based on a mortality rate for the procedure, into 1 of 3 occlusion categories (complete occlusion, residual neck and residual aneurysm). For each occlusion category, patients were tracked through
