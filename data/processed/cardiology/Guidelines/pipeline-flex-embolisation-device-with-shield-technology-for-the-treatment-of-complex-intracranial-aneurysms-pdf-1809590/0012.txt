stent- assisted coiling or surgical treatment and for whom parent vessel occlusion would result in stroke or death. 3.17 The committee considered that data from the studies described above provided evidence for the efficacy of Pipeline in most patients. In the context of the high risks posed to patients by untreated complex large or giant aneurysms the safety profile was judged to be acceptable. 3.18 The committee noted that the effect of the device on symptoms or on the risk of bleeding is subject to some delay. 3.19 The committee recognised that patient selection for treatment either by Pipeline or by comparator interventions is complex, and needs to be carried out by an experienced multidisciplinary team. 3.20 The committee noted that most of the clinical evidence came from the United States, where patient selection for different types of endovascular interventions may differ from the UK, in terms of the treatments selected for intracranial aneurysms based on their size and shape. 3.21 The committee noted that the clinical evidence comparing the efficacy of Pipeline with other interventions was very limited. This made evaluation difficult. The committee recognised the difficulties in conducting comparative studies, particularly randomised controlled trials, for large and giant
