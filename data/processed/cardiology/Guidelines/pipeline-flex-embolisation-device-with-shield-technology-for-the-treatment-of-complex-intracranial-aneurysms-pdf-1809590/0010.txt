(2009a), Szikora et al. (2010a) and O'Kelly et al. (2011) respectively (absolute figures not reported). 3.13 Nelson et al. (2011) reported that 10% (3 of 31) of patients, 1 of whom had previously had a stroke, showed improvement in intracranial aneurysm-related symptoms at 30 days. There was no deterioration in neurological status at 30 days in the 28 patients free of stroke. The FDA report (2011) described Rankin scoring (a general measure of neurological function) for 104 patients. The scores improved from baseline in 20% (21 of 104) of patients, remained unchanged in 67% (70 of 104) and deteriorated in 10% (10 of 104) at 180 days follow-up. There was an improvement in visual field sensitivity (not otherwise described) from baseline in 21% (19 of 89) of patients, no change in 73% (65 of 89) of patients and deterioration in eye function in 6% (5 of 89) of patients at follow-up of 180 days (FDA 2011). Three case reports described complete resolution of symptoms at follow-up ranging from 10 to 26 weeks (Fiorella et al. 2009a, 2009b; Sararols et al. 2011). Szikora et al. (2010b) reported resolution of symptoms in 61% of patients at a mean follow-up of 26 weeks.
