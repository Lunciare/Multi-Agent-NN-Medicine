showing the costs of Pipeline and of stent-assisted coiling using different numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices and coils. This indicated that the total cost of treatment using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices is greater than that of stent-assisted coiling (using 1 stent) if 31 coils or fewer are used, but Pipeline is less costly if 32 or more coils are needed. The cost saving associated with Pipeline compared with stent-assisted coiling with 32 coils was estimated to be £492 (total costs of £30,346 and £30,838 respectively). 5.28 The committee noted that using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices would incur a higher total treatment cost than neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion or conservative management for patients in whom those other options were feasible. 5.29 For the guidance review, the external assessment centre revised the model to reflect updated costs. The main parameter changes were costs associated with staff, hospital imaging equipment, drugs, rupture and adverse event costs. Further details of the revised model are in the revised model summary. [2019] 6 Conclusions 6.1 The committee concluded that current evidence supports the case for adoption of Pipeline when it is used in highly selected patients with complex giant or
