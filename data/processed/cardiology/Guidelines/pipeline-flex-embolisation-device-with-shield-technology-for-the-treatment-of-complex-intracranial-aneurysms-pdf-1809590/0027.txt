external assessment centre's view that both studies were appropriately and accurately used in the model and that therefore no changes were justified for the average duration of the procedure for stent-assisted coiling or inserting Pipeline. The committee agreed that the average duration of the procedure presented in the sponsor's base-case analysis was appropriate. 5.26 The committee was advised by the experts that it was not appropriate to include the cost for additional endovascular equipment for stent-assisted coiling only. This was because the cost of endovascular equipment was likely to be the same for Pipeline compared with stent-assisted coiling. The committee accepted the views of the expert advisers that removing this cost from the model for stent- assisted coiling was appropriate. This reduced the total procedure cost for stent- assisted coiling from £35,724 (this cost takes account of the drug cost calculation errors referred to in section 5.16) to £35,693 while the total procedure cost for Pipeline remained at £30,346. 5.27 With these issues in mind, the committee considered a graph showing the costs of Pipeline and of stent-assisted coiling using different numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices and coils. This indicated that the total cost of treatment using 2 Pipeline embolisation
