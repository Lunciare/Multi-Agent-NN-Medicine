to be equal. The external assessment centre noted that in the sponsor's economic model drug use was calculated from 2 non-comparative studies, but that few published data are available on clinical use. The external assessment centre stated that the low cost of these drugs means that relatively small differences in drug use are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall procedure costs for stent-assisted coiling and Pipeline. In the absence of a systematic review the external assessment centre stated that the drug costs used in the model were appropriate. 5.16 In its exploratory analysis the external assessment centre identified 2 calculation errors in the sponsor's economic model, both relating to the number of days of drug therapy. The external assessment centre stated that correcting these calculation errors made only a very small difference in the total procedure costs for both Pipeline and stent-assisted coiling, reducing them from £30,354 to £30,346 and £35,725 to £35,724 respectively. 5.17 In the sponsor's economic model, the average duration of the procedure (in hours) and therefore the use of additional endovascular equipment were different for stent-assisted coiling and insertion of Pipeline. The expert advisers stated that the procedures are likely to take the
