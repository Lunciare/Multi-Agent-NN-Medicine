Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

that the main factors influencing the cost analysis were the number and cost of consumables, in particular the numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices and endovascular coils. The sponsor carried out sensitivity analysis for the use of 1 to 3 Pipeline embolisation devices and separately for 5 to 100 coils. 5.11 The number of Pipeline embolisation devices used in the base case was 1.46 per patient. On receipt of more data from UK hospitals, the sponsor submitted a revised number of 1.658 in October 2011. The external assessment centre reviewed the data and concluded that when 1.658 Pipeline embolisation devices were used, Pipeline was more costly compared with stent-assisted coiling if 22 coils were used (an estimated cost increase of £19), but cost saving when 23 coils were used. The cost saving when using 1.658 Pipeline embolisation devices compared with stent-assisted coiling with 23 coils was estimated to be £588 (total procedure costs of £26,546 and £27,134 respectively). When 2 Pipeline embolisation devices were used, Pipeline was more costly by an estimated £185 than stent-assisted coiling using 28 coils, but was less costly than stent-assisted coiling when 29 coils were used. The cost saving when using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices compared
