Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

and the numbers of coils used during stent-assisted coiling. The committee was given advice from the experts about whether 1 or 2 Pipeline embolisation devices should be used as the most typical number on which to base its judgements about cost. It therefore considered the cost modelling for a range of scenarios – with different numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices. During its discussions the committee was informed both by expert advisers and by data from the sponsor that 2 Pipeline embolisation devices were likely to be needed for most patients treated in the UK for complex giant or large aneurysms. 5.20 There was considerable uncertainty about the number of coils likely to be used during stent-assisted coiling. The committee was advised that 40 coils was probably an overestimate of the number needed for most complex aneurysms and there were suggestions that about 25 to 30 coils might be more typical of the number needed for aneurysms being considered for treatment using Pipeline. The committee recognised that it is not possible to estimate accurately the number of coils which will be required to treat an aneurysm during stent-assisted coiling, but it was advised by experts that the number can usually be
