Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

its literature search, the external assessment centre found 3 case reports and 1 conference abstract of 96 patients in addition to the 13 studies identified by the sponsor. It excluded 1 of the studies identified by the sponsor (Matouk et al. 2010) because it was outside the scope. The external assessment centre therefore included a total of 16 studies with 380 patients in its assessment report. 3.7 Across 13 studies with a total of 237 patients (239 complex intracranial aneurysms), successful device placement was reported in 50% to 100% of patients. In 8 of the 13 studies, successful device placement was reported in all patients (25 in total; Fiorella et al. 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Hartmann et al. 2010; Kilsch et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2010; Sararols et al. 2011). 3.8 Nelson et al. (2011) reported clinical procedure success (defined as successful placement of the device without death or ipsilateral stroke) in 94% (29 of 31) of patients: the 2 failures were because of peri-procedural stroke. For patients in the PUFS study, the primary effectiveness end point was complete occlusion of the aneurysm and absence of parent vessel stenosis greater than 50% at 180 days. The probability of exceeding
