Treatment of Aneurysms (PITA) and Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed aneurysms (PUFS). 3.4 Nelson et al. (2011) reported outcomes up to 2 years for the PITA study: a prospective, multicentre single-arm feasibility study of 31 patients with 31 intracranial aneurysms that were small (under 10 mm [20 patients]), large (10 mm to 25 mm [9 patients]) or giant (over 25 mm [2 patients]). An aneurysm neck width of 4 mm or more was recorded in 22 patients (71%). In 12 patients (39%), other interventions for the target aneurysm had failed. 3.5 A report to the FDA by the sponsor (FDA 2011) described the clinical evidence at 1 year from the PUFS study: an ongoing prospective, multicentre, single-arm study of 108 patients with 110 intracranial aneurysms that were small (under 10 mm [1 patient]), large (10 mm to 25 mm [85 patients]) or giant (over 25 mm [22 patients]). The mean aneurysm neck width was 8.8 mm. In 8 patients (7%), other interventions for the target aneurysm had failed. 3.6 In its literature search, the external assessment centre found 3 case reports and 1 conference abstract of 96 patients in addition to the 13 studies identified by the sponsor.
