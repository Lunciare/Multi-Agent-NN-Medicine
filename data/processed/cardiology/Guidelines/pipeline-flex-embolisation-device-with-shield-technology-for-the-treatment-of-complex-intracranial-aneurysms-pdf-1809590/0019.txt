Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

estimated £185 than stent-assisted coiling using 28 coils, but was less costly than stent-assisted coiling when 29 coils were used. The cost saving when using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices compared with stent-assisted coiling with 29 coils was estimated to be £421 (total procedure costs of £30,354 and £30,775 respectively). 5.12 During consultation, expert advisers expressed doubts about 5 parameters in the cost model: the cost of microcatheters; the use of a balloon in stent-assisted coiling; drug costs; the procedure duration; and the cost of additional endovascular equipment. Additional exploratory analyses were carried out by the external assessment centre to examine the impact of changing these parameters, in ways which the expert advisers suggested were more appropriate. 5.13 In the sponsor's economic model, the cost of microcatheters used in stent- assisted coiling was comparable to the cost of a Marksman catheter (£1,030) used to insert Pipeline. However, the expert advisers stated that cheaper microcatheters (average cost £460.50) would be used for stent-assisted coiling than for Pipeline in UK practice. The external assessment centre's exploratory analyses demonstrated that reducing the cost of 2 microcatheters for stent- assisted coiling from £1,030 to £460.50 reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £37,451
