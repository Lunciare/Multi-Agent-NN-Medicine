Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

treating patients with complex intracranial aneurysms which are not suitable for stent-assisted coiling or surgery, and patients for whom previous interventions have failed. • Patients may experience a resolution of neurological symptoms as a result of relieving pressure on surrounding areas of the brain caused by the mass effect of aneurysms. • Increased long-term vessel patency, preserving blood flow to distal tissues supplied by the aneurysmal artery. • The high rate of complete, permanent occlusion of the target aneurysm with the possibility of reduced need for retreatment and an overall decrease in use of NHS resources. Current management 2.6 Current options for managing complex intracranial aneurysms include coiling, often with concomitant use of stent placement (stent-assisted coiling), neurosurgical clipping requiring craniotomy (with or without bypass procedures), parent vessel occlusion (by open neurosurgery or by endovascular means) and conservative management. 3 Clinical evidence Summary of clinical evidence 3.1 Full details of all clinical outcomes considered by the committee are available in the assessment report overview. 3.2 The key clinical outcomes for Pipeline presented in the decision problem are: • successful device deployment • successful occlusion of the aneurysm, with or without preservation of flow through the parent vessel • size of
