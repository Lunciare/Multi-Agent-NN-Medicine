Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex

intracranial aneurysms 1 Recommendations 1.1 The case for adopting the Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology in the NHS is supported by the current evidence when it is used in patients with complex giant or large intracranial aneurysms which are unsuitable for surgery and being considered for stenting, and where large numbers of coils would be needed during stent-assisted coiling. 1.2 The Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology is estimated to be cost saving when compared with stent-assisted coiling, in patients with complex giant or large intracranial aneurysms when the number of Pipeline embolisation devices inserted does not exceed 2, and when treatment would otherwise require the use of 34 or more coils combined with 1 stent for stent-assisted coiling. If 2 Pipeline embolisation devices are used the total procedure cost is estimated as £37,625 compared with £38,320 for the use of 34 coils for stent-assisted coiling (a saving of £695 using Pipeline embolisation device). [2019] 1.3 Clinicians should submit details of all patients being treated with the Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology to the UK Neurointerventional Radiology Group audit database, to increase the evidence base and guide future use of this technology. 2 The technology
