costs and consequences associated with adverse events were not included in the base-case analysis because the sponsor considered there to be insufficient reliable data for each treatment group. However, the sponsor did include costs associated with mortality at 31 days, rupture and retreatment. 5.6 In the base case the number of Pipeline embolisation devices used was 1.46, based on data submitted to the sponsor from use of the device in UK hospitals up to August 2011. The number of coils used in the base case was 40 and was derived from an estimate in an editorial review by Wehman in 2006. It was assumed that 1 stent would be needed for each stent-assisted coiling intervention. 5.7 The base case presented the total procedure costs over the 10-year time horizon associated with Pipeline as £24,341. For the comparators, the total procedure costs were £37,451 for stent-assisted coiling, £11,658 for neurosurgical clipping, £16,893 for endovascular parent vessel occlusion, £11,654 for neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion and £10,352 for conservative management. The only intervention against which Pipeline was shown to be cost saving was stent- assisted coiling, with a cost saving of £13,110 per patient. 5.8 Two scenario analyses were presented. One included costs
