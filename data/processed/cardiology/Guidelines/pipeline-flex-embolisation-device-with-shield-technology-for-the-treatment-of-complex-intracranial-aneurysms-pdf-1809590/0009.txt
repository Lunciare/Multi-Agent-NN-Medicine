no deaths in the PITA study. 3.11 Nelson et al. (2011) reported complete occlusion of the target aneurysm in 93% (28 of 30) of patients at 180 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 77.9 to 99.2); it was not possible to assess occlusion in 1 patient who had Pipeline surgically removed and the parent vessel ligated. All patients who had complete occlusion at 180 days also had complete occlusion at 2 years as assessed by either catheter angiography or MRI. 3.12 Complete occlusion without major stenosis was reported in 74% (78 of 106) of aneurysms at 180 days and 71% (75 of 106) of aneurysms at 1-year angiography (FDA 2011). Eight studies with a total of 131 patients all reported occlusion rates of 100% in patients assessed at follow-up ranging from 3 to 30 months (Fiorella et al. 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Klisch et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2010; Sararols et al. 2011; Szikora et al. 2010b). Occlusion rates of 93%, 89% and 69% were reported by Lylyk et al. (2009a), Szikora et al. (2010a) and O'Kelly et al. (2011) respectively (absolute figures not reported). 3.13 Nelson et al. (2011) reported that 10% (3 of 31) of patients, 1 of
