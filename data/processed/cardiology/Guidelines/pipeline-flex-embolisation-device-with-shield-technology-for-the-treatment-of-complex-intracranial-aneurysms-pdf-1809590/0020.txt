assessment centre's exploratory analyses demonstrated that reducing the cost of 2 microcatheters for stent- assisted coiling from £1,030 to £460.50 reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £37,451 to £36,137. 5.14 The sponsor's economic modelling also assumed that a balloon is used in 50% of stent-assisted coiling procedures and is not used to insert Pipeline. However, the expert advisers stated that use of a balloon is relatively uncommon in the UK for stent-assisted coiling procedures. In the exploratory analyses carried out by the external assessment centre, removing the cost of a balloon reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £36,137 to £35,725, while the total procedure cost for Pipeline (with 2 devices) remained at £30,354. 5.15 The sponsor's economic model assumed different drug use for patients having stent-assisted coiling and those having Pipeline (18,000 mg aspirin and 6,750 mg clopidogrel compared with 25,000 mg aspirin and 13,500 mg clopidogrel respectively). The expert advisers stated that in clinical practice drug use in the 2 groups is likely to be equal. The external assessment centre noted that in the sponsor's economic model drug use was calculated from 2 non-comparative studies, but that few published data are available on
