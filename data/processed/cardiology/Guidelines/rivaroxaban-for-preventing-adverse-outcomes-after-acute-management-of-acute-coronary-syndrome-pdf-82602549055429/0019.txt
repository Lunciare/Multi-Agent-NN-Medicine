Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

and revascularisation rates for the 2 interventions were comparable after rivaroxaban treatment was discontinued for all patients at the end of the second year. 3.18 The population modelled was the subgroup of patients who had acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers and had not experienced a prior stroke or TIA in the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial. The data were not pooled from both rivaroxaban trial arms; the model was based on the subgroup data from patients who had 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily only. Data from both trial strata were used to inform the model. In accordance with ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, it was assumed that in the base case 93% of patients had clopidogrel plus aspirin and 7% of patients had aspirin alone. A scenario analysis was presented considering only those patients who had clopidogrel and aspirin. 3.19 In the base case the transition probabilities for future acute coronary syndrome-related events in the observation period (2 years) were determined by fitting a Weibull distribution to the trial data. This was undertaken for both the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily arm and for the placebo arm. The company stated that because patient numbers diminished over time, particularly visible towards the end
