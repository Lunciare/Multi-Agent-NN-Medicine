the EMA's assessment report concluded that these findings may partly have been due to chance. The ERG therefore considered the hazard ratios from the combined dose to be more plausible than those of the individual doses. 3.32 The ERG considered the validity of the results from the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 study to be questionable as a result of the high discontinuation rates from the trial. The ERG noted that 15.5% of the total randomised population (n=15,526) withdrew from the trial (2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily 15%; 5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily 16.3%; placebo 15.1%). The ERG highlighted that the rates of premature withdrawal in the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial were higher than other similar randomised trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome: APPRAISE-2 (apixaban, 1.8% [131 out of 7392]); TRACER (vorapaxar, 5.9% [761 out of 12,944]); PLATO (ticagrelor, 3.0% [562 out of 18,624]) and TRITON (prasugrel, 5.9% [804 out of 13,619]). 3.33 The ERG commented that because data were missing for people who withdrew from the trial (proportion of patients with unknown vital statistics 3.2% [ITT analysis, 495 out of 15,526]) there was a potential risk that this may have led to informative censoring. That is, patients who drop out
