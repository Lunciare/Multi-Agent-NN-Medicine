Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

as standard care (stratum 1: aspirin only [n=1,053]; stratum 2: aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine [n=14,473]). Patients were then randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, rivaroxaban 5 mg or placebo (all taken twice daily). The dosage of clopidogrel or ticlopidine followed national or local prescribing information. Enrolment was neither capped nor fixed and depended on regional medical practice. The daily maintenance dose was not to exceed 75 mg a day for clopidogrel or 250 mg twice daily for ticlopidine. Approximately 99% of the patients in stratum 2 had clopidogrel. The duration of treatment was not fixed because the trial was event-driven (that is, the time needed to obtain at least 983 primary efficacy end-point events across both strata and at least 728 primary efficacy events in stratum 2). The mean duration of treatment was 13.1 months. 3.3 The company considered the baseline patient characteristics of those enrolled into ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 to be generally similar between the treatment groups. The mean age of the trial population was 61.8 years; 9.0% were aged over 75 years, and 74.7% were men. In the trial population, the index acute coronary syndrome event was 50.9% STEMI, 25.6% NSTEMI and 23.6%
