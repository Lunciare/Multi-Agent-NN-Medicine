Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

2 time points, a 33% improvement in health-related quality of life over 12 months was calculated for patients who had strokes. To calculate the utility values for patients who had a stroke 6 months after a previous stroke, the average of the stroke first 6 months and the stroke (post 12 months) health states was taken. Utility values were assumed to be the same for both rivaroxaban and standard care following any event. For multiple event states, the utility values of two events that had occurred were multiplied together. The company stated that this allowed for worsening health-related quality of life following multiple events to be taken into account. The utility value for the event-free health state was assumed to remain constant over time. The resulting utility estimates were 0.842 for no event, 0.779 for non-fatal MI, 0.821 for after MI, 0.703 for non-fatal stroke, and 0.703 for after stroke. 3.25 For the licensed population, the company reported a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £6,203 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (incremental costs £764, incremental QALYs 0.12) for a life time horizon of 40 years for rivaroxaban compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. 3.26 The company conducted
