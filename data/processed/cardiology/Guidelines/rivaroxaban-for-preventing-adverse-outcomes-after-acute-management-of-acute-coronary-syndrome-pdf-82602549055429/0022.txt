Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

assumption was made that if a patient had multiple acute events in the long term, then the cost of hospitalisation and the follow up of two events were applied. This was the case irrespective of the time between the events. It was assumed that, on average, patients experienced 5, 14 and 28 days rehabilitation after MI, ischaemic stroke and HS/ICH respectively. These rehabilitation costs occurred in the first 3 months after the event. Transient event costs were also included in the model. 3.24 The utility values associated with long-term health states were obtained from the literature, primarily from NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. A study by Ara and Brazier was used to calculate the improvement in health-related quality of life that patients would experience in the stroke health states. The study was used to obtain the utility values of patients with stroke in the UK at baseline and at 12 months after the stroke occurred. Based on the utility values from these 2 time points, a 33% improvement in health-related quality of life over 12 months was calculated for patients who had strokes. To calculate the utility values for patients who had
