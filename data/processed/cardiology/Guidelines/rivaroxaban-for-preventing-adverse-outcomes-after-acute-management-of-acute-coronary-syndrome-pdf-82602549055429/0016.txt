end point was 3.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97, 6.01) for the 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice-daily group, 4.4 (95% CI 2.55 to 7.60) for the rivaroxaban 5 mg twice-daily group and 3.91 (95% CI 2.32 to 6.59) for the rivaroxaban combined-dose group. Cost effectiveness 3.14 The company submitted a de novo Markov cohort model comparing rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with standard care (clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone) in adults who had a recent acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers and who had not had a previous stroke or TIA. The model used a time horizon of 40 years that was divided into 2 periods: an observation period, which was intended to replicate the duration of the trial data, and an extrapolation period. The extrapolation period started after 96 weeks and had a cycle length of 6 months. In the observation period the initial 2 cycles had a cycle length of 4 weeks and 8 weeks respectively and the remaining cycles used a cycle length of 12 weeks. The company based the analysis from an NHS and personal social services perspective, and costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. Half-cycle correction was performed on
