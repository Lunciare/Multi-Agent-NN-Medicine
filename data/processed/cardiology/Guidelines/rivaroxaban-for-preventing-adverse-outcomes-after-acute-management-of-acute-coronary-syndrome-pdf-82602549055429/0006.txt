was 61.8 years; 9.0% were aged over 75 years, and 74.7% were men. In the trial population, the index acute coronary syndrome event was 50.9% STEMI, 25.6% NSTEMI and 23.6% unstable angina. The company stated that baseline patient characteristics were representative of a moderate to high-risk population of patients with acute coronary syndrome, with the majority of all patients randomised having cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension (67.4%), diabetes (32.0%), a history of myocardial infarction (26.9%) or hypercholesterolaemia (48.6%). Of the 60.5% of patients who had a revascularisation procedure for the index event; the vast majority of these were percutaneous coronary intervention. In the trial population 7.1% of patients had impaired renal function with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min. 3.4 The efficacy analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set, which included all randomised patients (except those from 3 excluded sites where trial misconduct was identified) and the end point events that occurred from randomisation up to the earlier date of the global treatment end date, or 30 days after last dose of study drug (for patients who discontinued the study drug prematurely), or 30 days after randomisation (for patients who were randomised but never treated).
