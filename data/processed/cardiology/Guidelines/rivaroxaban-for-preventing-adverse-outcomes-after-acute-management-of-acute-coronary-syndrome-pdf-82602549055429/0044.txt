compared with those of the 5 mg twice-daily dose. The Committee noted the lower bleeding risk associated with the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose compared with the 5 mg twice-daily dose. While it acknowledged that there were numerical inconsistencies in the efficacy results between the 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice-daily arms, it concluded that the efficacy data from the 2.5 mg twice-daily rivaroxaban arm were the most relevant for decision-making because it is the licensed dose of rivaroxaban for this indication. 4.7 The Committee discussed the high discontinuation rates from the trial (see section 3.10). The Committee was aware that 15.5% of the total randomised population prematurely discontinued from the trial and that the discontinuation rate was higher in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 than in other similar randomised trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that high discontinuation rates were common in trials in patients with acute coronary syndrome and that this is replicated in the adherence rates seen in clinical practice, because current treatment protocols mean that people who had acute coronary syndrome are already taking 5 separate medications. The clinical experts highlighted that clinicians are mindful of the effect on patient adherence
