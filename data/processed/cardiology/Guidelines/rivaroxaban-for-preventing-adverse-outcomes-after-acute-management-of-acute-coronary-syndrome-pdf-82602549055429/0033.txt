lowest utility value of the 2 events applied to the patients or, if the model could track the chronicity of events, it could have assumed that the utility of the most recent event applied. 3.40 The ERG expressed concerns about the appropriateness of the methods used to model the costs of rivaroxaban, clopidogrel and aspirin and the efficacy data (shape and scale parameters of the Weibull curve) in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The ERG recalculated the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and found that the results were generally more favourable to rivaroxaban, producing more incremental QALYs at a lower incremental cost. 3.41 The ERG commented that there were a number of key parameters that could not be adjusted within the model, which may have changed the ICER to a greater extent. These included: amendments to the hazard ratio for fatal bleeds; using pooled efficacy data rather than the 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice-daily dose alone; and adjusting for the possibility of informative bias. 3.42 The ERG conducted an exploratory probabilistic sensitivity analysis in which published levels of uncertainty around the utility value estimates and the reference costs, rather than an arbitrary range, were taken into account. The resulting probabilistic ICER was £6,150 per
