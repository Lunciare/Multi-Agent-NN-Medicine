Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

combination with aspirin (for people who have had percutaneous coronary intervention or in whom it is planned), ticagrelor in combination with low-dose aspirin, or clopidogrel in combination with low-dose aspirin. It also understood that people with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are offered treatments depending on their Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) or thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score and that these include a range of options from aspirin alone to percutaneous coronary intervention, depending on the risk of future events. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that ticagrelor and prasugrel have potential advantages over clopidogrel because of their faster antiplatelet action, although they are associated with higher bleeding risk. The Committee also heard from the clinical experts that the use of clopidogrel in clinical practice was generally decreasing as uptake of the newer agents increased, but that there was variation in practice with different centres often having their own local protocols for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that because of its different mechanism of action, rivaroxaban could be a useful additional treatment option for some patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone, although it was not
