which published levels of uncertainty around the utility value estimates and the reference costs, rather than an arbitrary range, were taken into account. The resulting probabilistic ICER was £6,150 per QALY gained for rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel plus aspirin or rivaroxaban plus aspirin, compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The ERG noted that its probabilistic ICER was similar to the company's deterministic ICER. 3.43 The ERG addressed its concerns about informative censoring (see section 3.33) by conducting a 'crude' exploratory sensitivity analysis, to explore the effects on the ICER of increasing the number of patients who experienced a fatal bleeding event with rivaroxaban (assuming that the event occurred immediately on taking rivaroxaban). The ERG considered a range of additional fatal bleeding events ranging from no additional fatal bleeding events (company's base case) to 20 additional bleeding events. Because there were 21 fatal bleeding events in the combined rivaroxaban treatment arms of the total population in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, the ERG considered that 20 additional fatal bleeding events was an unfavourable scenario for the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily dose. The result of the ERG's exploratory analysis showed that even if rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice a day caused an additional 20
