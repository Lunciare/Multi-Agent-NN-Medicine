twice daily 4.7%; rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily 4.3%; placebo 4.3%) and 'other' (rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily 11.5%; rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily 11.3%; placebo 11.8%). 3.10 Of the 15,526 patients randomised to ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, 13,124 (84.5%) patients were alive at the end of the trial follow-up period and 537 patients (3.5%) had died. The remaining 1865 (12.0%) of patients were categorised as having 'incomplete follow-up'. 11,026 (71.0%) of randomised patients completed both the double-blind treatment period and the follow-up period. At the end of the trial, of the 1,294 patients who withdrew consent, vital status was unknown for 1117 (86.3%) patients. During discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concerns were raised about the level of missing data as a result of the incomplete follow up of patients who withdrew from the trial. The company therefore made extensive efforts to obtain vital status information on patients who withdrew consent. This reduced the proportion of patients with unknown vital status to 3.2% (495 patients) in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis set and 1.8% (278 patients) in the mITT analysis set. 3.11 Health-related quality of life was assessed in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D)
