Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

overall decision as to whether rivaroxaban was clinically and cost effective in its licensed indication. 4.6 The Committee discussed the numerical inconsistencies between the 2 dose groups in the trial (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) for the individual components of the composite efficacy end point that had been identified by the ERG (see section 3.31). It was aware that for some individual outcomes the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose appeared to have a greater efficacy than the 5 mg twice-daily dose. The ERG considered that it was unlikely that the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose would be more clinically effective than 5 mg twice daily and suggested that the results from both doses combined were more plausible than those of the individual doses. The Committee heard from the company that the summary of product characteristics for rivaroxaban specified the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose and that the EMA had based its decision for this dose based on the balance of risk and benefits of the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose, compared with those of the 5 mg twice-daily dose. The Committee noted the lower bleeding risk associated with the 2.5 mg twice-daily dose compared with the 5 mg twice-daily dose.
