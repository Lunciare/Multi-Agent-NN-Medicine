Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

unfavourable scenario for the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily dose. The result of the ERG's exploratory analysis showed that even if rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice a day caused an additional 20 fatal bleeding events compared with the event rate observed in the trial, the ICER was not estimated to be greater than £10,000 per QALY gained. 3.44 The ERG also undertook a series of exploratory scenario analyses. When the following changes to the model were implemented, the ERG's preferred deterministic base-case ICER was £5,622 per QALY gained (compared with the company's deterministic base-case ICER of £6,203 per QALY gained): • The transition probabilities were estimated from the trial data rather than using the Weibull curves. • The treatment duration of rivaroxaban was limited to 1 year. • Age-adjusted utility values for the whole population from Ara and Brazier's formula were used to adjust the no-event health state. • Only 1 cost was applied to the multiple event states. Where there were 2 different costs added together in the company's base case, the maximum of the 2 costs was applied. • No improvement over time in the stroke utility was modelled. • The relative risk of having a subsequent event, given that
