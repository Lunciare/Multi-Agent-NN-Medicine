Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

whether rivaroxaban in addition to standard-care antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]). The company also provided supportive evidence from the ATLAS-ACS TIMI 46 trial, which compared rivaroxaban once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing within the same total daily dose range (5 to 20 mg). This study was a safety and efficacy study to determine the most favourable dose and dosing regimen of rivaroxaban for ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51. 3.2 The ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial had 3 phases: a 6-day screening phase; a double-blind treatment phase; and a follow-up phase. Patients were enrolled into the trial within 7 days of being admitted to hospital for acute coronary syndrome. After stabilisation of the acute coronary syndrome (and after completion of any initial management strategies such as revascularisation), patients were stratified on the basis of whether they were to have clopidogrel or ticlopidine in addition to aspirin as standard care (stratum 1: aspirin only [n=1,053]; stratum 2: aspirin plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine [n=14,473]). Patients were then randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, rivaroxaban
