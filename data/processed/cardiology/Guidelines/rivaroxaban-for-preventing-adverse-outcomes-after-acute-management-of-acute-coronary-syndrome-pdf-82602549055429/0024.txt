Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

(QALY) gained (incremental costs £764, incremental QALYs 0.12) for a life time horizon of 40 years for rivaroxaban compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone. 3.26 The company conducted a series of 1-way deterministic sensitivity analyses. Changes to the cost parameters, discount rates, utility values and risk estimates for MI impacted on the base case ICER, but no factor increased the ICER to over £10,000 per QALY gained. The company's probabilistic analysis showed that rivaroxaban had a 99.9% probability of being cost effective compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin or with aspirin alone if the maximum acceptable amount for an additional QALY was £20,000. Evidence Review Group comments 3.27 The ERG stated that the company undertook a comprehensive systematic review of rivaroxaban for the prevention of adverse outcomes in patients after the acute management of acute coronary syndrome. The ERG considered ATLAS-ACS 2 TIMI 51 to be a well-designed, multicentre RCT of reasonable quality. 3.28 The ERG questioned the generalisability of the population enrolled in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 to the population seen in clinical practice in England. The ERG noted that of all patients randomised in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, 74% were men and the mean age was 61.8 years. The
