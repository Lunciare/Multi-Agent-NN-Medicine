Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone, compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin alone in the licensed population (that is, people with elevated cardiac biomarkers and without a history of stroke or TIA). The Committee noted that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone reduced the composite risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death from cardiovascular causes by 20% compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone (see table 2: ALL strata, 2.5 mg twice-daily rivaroxaban dose). The Committee understood that this composite reduction in risk was driven by reductions in cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction. The Committee concluded that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone was more effective than aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin alone for preventing myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes in people with acute coronary syndrome and elevated cardiac biomarkers. 4.10 The Committee discussed the concerns about safety and adverse effects associated with rivaroxaban. The Committee was aware that the results for the licensed population showed that there was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of non-CABG TIMI major bleeds (major bleeding assessed
