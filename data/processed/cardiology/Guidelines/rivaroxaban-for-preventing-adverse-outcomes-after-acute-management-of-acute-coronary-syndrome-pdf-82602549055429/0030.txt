Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

for systematic errors in 3 ways. First, patients who had 2 events in 1 time cycle were not distinguished from those patients who had multiple events in separate time cycles. Second, for patients who had multiple events in separate time cycles any improvement over time that they may have experienced was ignored. Finally, for those patients who transition into the multiple event states from the single event states, the first event was not tracked. The ERG commented that there were 2 solutions to this problem. First, a more complicated state transition cohort model could be developed so that cost and utilities for each multiple event state can be varied by the preceding health state and by the time between the events. Second, a patient-level simulation approach could be taken. 3.35 The ERG stated that the population modelled by the company was the patient subgroup who had elevated cardiac biomarkers and had not experienced a prior stroke or TIA. Therefore, all issues with the generalisability of the results of ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 (see sections 3.3 and 3.28) and informative censoring (see sections 3.10 and 3.33) also apply to the economic model results. 3.36 The ERG stated that the approach used by
