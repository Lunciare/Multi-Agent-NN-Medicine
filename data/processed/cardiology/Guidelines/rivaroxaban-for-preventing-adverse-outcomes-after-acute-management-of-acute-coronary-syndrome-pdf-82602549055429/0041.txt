clinical-effectiveness evidence in the company's submission. The Committee considered that the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial was of good quality but noted that a key issue highlighted by the ERG was the generalisability of the results to people diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome in England. The Committee noted that people with acute coronary syndrome in clinical practice are usually older than those patients who were recruited to ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51. The Committee also noted that patients in the trial could be considered a relatively low-risk population because they had little comorbidity, lower than usual use of percutaneous coronary intervention and included a relatively small proportion of people aged over 75 years or with impaired renal function. The Committee heard from the clinical experts that the average age difference between the trial population and patients seen in clinical practice was not likely to be clinically significant and that patients recruited to ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 were similar in terms of baseline characteristics to those recruited to other trials in acute coronary syndrome. The Committee was persuaded that the issue of generalisability was similar across all trials in this condition, and concluded that the results of ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 were relevant to routine clinical
