As a result, the evidence on efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily beyond this time is limited. The ERG noted that this is reflected in the summary of product characteristics, which recommends that extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an individual patient basis because experience up to 24 months is limited. 3.30 The ERG stated that the test 'elevated cardiac biomarker' is less sensitive than if a patient exhibits a rise or fall in their cardiac biomarkers (preferably troponins), because many patients have persistently elevated biomarkers outside the context of acute coronary syndrome. In current practice, the diagnosis of NSTEMI requires evidence of myocardial ischaemia with a rise or fall in the blood level of a cardiac biomarker (troponin). In addition, the sensitivity of biomarker assays has increased since the trial was conducted. If more sensitive assays had been available during ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, more patients might have been diagnosed with NSTEMI rather than unstable angina and therefore included in the licensed population. 3.31 The ERG noted that there were numerical inconsistencies between the 2 dose groups (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) for the components of the composite efficacy
