rivaroxaban. The Committee was aware that the results for the licensed population showed that there was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of non-CABG TIMI major bleeds (major bleeding assessed using 'Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction' criteria not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting) for rivaroxaban added to antiplatelet therapy compared with antiplatelet therapy alone. It noted that in the 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice-daily arm of the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 study, there was a 3 times greater risk of non-CABG TIMI major bleeding with rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin compared with these antiplatelet therapies alone. The Committee acknowledged that all antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments have an associated risk of bleeding but noted the comments it had heard from the clinical and patient experts that the risk of bleeding was a key consideration when deciding on a particular treatment. The Committee was aware that no data had been presented by the company or other stakeholders comparing the risk of bleeding with rivaroxaban in combination with antiplatelet agents compared with other treatment regimens with antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor and prasugrel, because these were not included in the final scope. The Committee was therefore unable to compare the effectiveness and
