Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

The company based the analysis from an NHS and personal social services perspective, and costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. Half-cycle correction was performed on the Markov trace. 3.15 The company's model consisted of a number of health states corresponding to whether or not the hypothetical patient had another acute coronary syndrome event. The acute coronary syndrome events considered in the model were: MI, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage (HS/ICH); a bleeding event measured on the TIMI scale; and revascularisation. These acute coronary syndrome events fell into 2 broad categories: those with longer term implications for the relative risks of developing further conditions, utility and costs and those deemed to be transient events where the impacts were limited to 1 model cycle. Patients could die at any time in the model and there were multiple causes of death simulated in the model. Patients could die from an MI, ischaemic stroke or HS/ICH or other CV death, which included deaths related to bleeding. Patients could also die from non-CV causes at any time point in the model. 3.16 The long-term acute coronary syndrome events included the MI, ischaemic stroke and HS/ICH conditions. The long-term
