The Committee concluded that treatment with rivaroxaban resulted in more non-CABG-related major bleeding than aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin alone, but also recognised the particular importance of the effects of rivaroxaban in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes. The Committee also concluded that clinicians should undertake a careful assessment of whether the bleeding risk is outweighed by the benefits of rivaroxaban in preventing further ischaemic events for individual patients when deciding whether to start or continue treatment. The Committee noted that the summary of product characteristics states that treatment should be regularly evaluated and, in particular, that careful consideration should be given to whether treatment is continued beyond 12 months because experience of treatment with rivaroxaban up to 24 months is limited.
