Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

3.31 The ERG noted that there were numerical inconsistencies between the 2 dose groups (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) for the components of the composite efficacy end points in the licensed population (see table 2). When the components of the primary efficacy end points were analysed individually, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily significantly reduced the risk of death from CV causes compared with placebo, but did not reduce the risk of MI or stroke. In contrast, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily significantly reduced the risk of MI, but did not reduce the risk of CV death or stroke. The ERG noted that the numerical inconsistencies between the 2 dose groups had been extensively discussed in a US FDA briefing document (albeit in the whole trial population of ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, rather than the licensed population). This briefing document states that 'the proposition that a lower dose of an antithrombotic drug is significantly more effective than a higher dose lacks biological plausibility'. The ERG also noted that the EMA's assessment report concluded that these findings may partly have been due to chance. The ERG therefore considered the hazard ratios from the combined dose to be more plausible
