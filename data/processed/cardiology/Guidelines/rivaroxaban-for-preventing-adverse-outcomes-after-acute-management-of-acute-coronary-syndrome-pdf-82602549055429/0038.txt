Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

that because of its different mechanism of action, rivaroxaban could be a useful additional treatment option for some patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone, although it was not possible to identify a particular subgroup of patients for whom it would be most suitable. However, the clinical experts highlighted that there is some uncertainty as to when and how it would be best incorporated into the treatment pathway. They explained that the mean time to start rivaroxaban in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 was 4.6 days, but the majority of patients in England have been discharged from hospital by then. The clinical experts further explained that if rivaroxaban was started in secondary care this could result in patients staying in hospital longer, which would not happen if it was started in primary care. The Committee heard from its GP members that, after an acute coronary syndrome event, patients would usually be seen by their GP within 1 week of being discharged from hospital. The Committee considered that a discharge summary which is sent to the patient's GP at the time of discharge would give sufficient information for the GP to start treatment with rivaroxaban. The Committee recognised that rivaroxaban may be
