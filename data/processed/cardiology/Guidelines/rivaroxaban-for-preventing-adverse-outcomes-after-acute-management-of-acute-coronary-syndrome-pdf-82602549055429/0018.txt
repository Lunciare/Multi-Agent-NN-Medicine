could also die from non-CV causes at any time point in the model. 3.16 The long-term acute coronary syndrome events included the MI, ischaemic stroke and HS/ICH conditions. The long-term events had 2 subsequent tunnel states to allow for the patient's health-related quality of life to improve over time, and for the cost of treatment and the relative risk of having a subsequent event to fall over time. Patients could have up to 3 acute coronary syndrome events; the specific types of event were recorded when patients had 2 or fewer events. When 3 events happened, it was assumed that there was 1 event of each type (that is an MI, an ischaemic stroke and a HS/ICH). 3.17 The health states corresponding to bleeding and revascularisations were assumed to be transient health states and when a patient entered these states a one-off cost and utility decrement was applied. These transient health states were applied to only the patients in the observation period of the model, implicitly assuming that the bleeding and revascularisation rates for the 2 interventions were comparable after rivaroxaban treatment was discontinued for all patients at the end of the second year. 3.18 The population modelled was the
