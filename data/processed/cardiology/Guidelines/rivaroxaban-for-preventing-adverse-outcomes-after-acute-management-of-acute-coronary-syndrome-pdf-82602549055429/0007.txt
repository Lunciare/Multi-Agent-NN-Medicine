30 days after last dose of study drug (for patients who discontinued the study drug prematurely), or 30 days after randomisation (for patients who were randomised but never treated). The exclusion of the data from the 3 sites was considered to be acceptable by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The company presented the efficacy results for the 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice-daily and 5 mg twice-daily doses separately and combined by strata (stratum 1, stratum 2 and combined [ALL strata]). 3.5 The primary efficacy end point in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes (cardiovascular [CV] death), myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic or stroke of uncertain cause). A range of secondary composite end points were also included. These were: • composite of death from any cause, MI or stroke • net clinical outcome (composite of CV death, MI, ischaemic stroke and non-CABG TIMI major bleeding [major bleeding assessed using 'Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction' criteria not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting]) • composite of CV death, MI, stroke or severe recurrent ischaemia needing revascularisation • composite of CV death, MI, stroke or severe recurrent ischaemia leading to hospitalisation. 3.6 The results for the primary efficacy end
