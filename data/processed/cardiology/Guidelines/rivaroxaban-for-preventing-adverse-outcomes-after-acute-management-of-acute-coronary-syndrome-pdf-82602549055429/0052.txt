Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

accepted that there is uncertainty about the validity of the results based on ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 because of the risk of bias resulting from missing data and informative censoring. However, the Committee considered that the ICERs presented were all within the range that could be considered cost effective and that the results of the ERG's exploratory sensitivity and scenario analyses suggested that the ICER was unlikely to increase to the extent that it would become unacceptable. It concluded that rivaroxaban can be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. 4.13 The Committee was aware that there is an increased risk of bleeding when rivaroxaban is added to aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel and it would be important for clinicians to carefully assess a person's individual bleeding risk and for patients to have an informed discussion with their clinician about the potential risks and benefits before starting treatment with rivaroxaban. The Committee noted that the summary of product characteristics states that after initiation, there should be regular assessment of the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with rivaroxaban and extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an individual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited.
