The proportion of patients selected was to allow an overall continuation rate of 19% after 12 months and that this would decline to 0% at the end of the second year. No treatment effect or cost was applied to those patients who discontinued rivaroxaban treatment. 3.22 In the model patients had clopidogrel 75 mg once a day, aspirin 75 mg once a day and rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily as appropriate. Because rivaroxaban entered the treatment pathway after stabilisation of an acute coronary syndrome event, any further differences in costs between the intervention and the comparator were a result of acute coronary syndrome events and discontinuations related to an acute coronary syndrome event. 3.23 Costs of acute coronary syndrome events were determined by the NHS reference costs (2012 to 2013) of treating the event and the cost of follow up for the patient. An assumption was made that if a patient had multiple acute events in the long term, then the cost of hospitalisation and the follow up of two events were applied. This
