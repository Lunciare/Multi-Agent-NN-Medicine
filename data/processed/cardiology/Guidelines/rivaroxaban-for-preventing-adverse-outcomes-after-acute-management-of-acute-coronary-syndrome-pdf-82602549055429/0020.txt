was undertaken for both the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily arm and for the placebo arm. The company stated that because patient numbers diminished over time, particularly visible towards the end of ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, it was difficult to estimate transition probabilities directly from the data for the later cycles within the observation period. The company commented that by fitting a Weibull distribution to the ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial data, it was able to remove the data fluctuations caused by a decline in the numbers of observations over the trial. 3.20 The company's model assumed that patients could discontinue treatment in the observation period after they had an acute coronary syndrome event. The probability of discontinuation following an event was obtained from ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51. This was calculated by using the total trial population, not the licensed population. 3.21 The UK marking authorisation for rivaroxaban states that 'extension of treatment beyond 12 months should be done on an individual patient basis as experience up to 24 months is limited'. To reflect this, the company adjusted the proportion of patients who continued on rivaroxaban treatment in the second year (that is from 48 to 60 weeks on wards). The proportion of patients
