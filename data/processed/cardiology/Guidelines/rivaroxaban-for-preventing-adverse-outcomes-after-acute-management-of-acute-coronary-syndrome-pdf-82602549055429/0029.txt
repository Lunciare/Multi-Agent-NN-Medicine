Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

with unknown vital statistics 3.2% [ITT analysis, 495 out of 15,526]) there was a potential risk that this may have led to informative censoring. That is, patients who drop out (and therefore are censored) are more or less likely to experience the primary outcome of interest compared with those remaining in the study, and this happens in a non-random manner. This may be compounded if the reason for, or frequency of, discontinuation differs between treatment groups. The ERG highlighted that no detailed discussion was provided in the EMA's assessment report regarding this issue. The ERG considered that the efficacy analyses were at risk of bias because prognoses may differ in those patients who withdrew from the trial. The ERG highlighted that the likely bias introduced by informative censoring in the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness analyses was unknown. 3.34 The ERG stated that the structure of the company's model led to the potential for systematic errors to occur, because the time between multiple events is not tracked. This causes the potential for systematic errors in 3 ways. First, patients who had 2 events in 1 time cycle were not distinguished from those patients who had multiple events in separate time cycles.
