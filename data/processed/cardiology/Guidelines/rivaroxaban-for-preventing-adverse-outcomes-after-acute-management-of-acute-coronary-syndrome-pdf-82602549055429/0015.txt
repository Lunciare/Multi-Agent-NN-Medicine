Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

and for the benefit–risk analysis. 3.13 The company presented results on the primary safety end point and other bleeding-related end points based on the whole trial population and for the licensed population (that is, adult patients after an acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers without a history of stroke or TIA). The total number of patients included in the safety analysis from ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 in the licensed population was 12,325 (ALL strata n=4,096; rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily n=4,072; rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily n=4,157; placebo). The results for the licensed population showed a dose-dependent increase in the rate of non-CABG TIMI major bleeding events for rivaroxaban added to antiplatelet therapy compared with antiplatelet therapy alone. In 'ALL strata' in the treatment-emergent safety analysis set, the primary safety end point occurred in 1.3% of patients in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice-daily group, 1.6% of patients in the rivaroxaban 5 mg twice-daily group and 0.4% of patients in the placebo group. The hazard ratio (HR) for the primary safety end point was 3.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97, 6.01) for the 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice-daily group, 4.4 (95% CI 2.55 to 7.60) for the rivaroxaban 5 mg twice-daily group
