Cost effectiveness 4.11 The Committee considered the company's economic model and the review and exploratory sensitivity analyses performed by the ERG. The Committee noted that the ICERs presented by the company in its base-case analysis and in the ERG's exploratory sensitivity analyses were all lower than £10,000 per QALY gained. The Committee was aware of the ERG's concerns about the structure of the company's economic model and, in particular, that the model is relatively inflexible. This meant that the ERG could not carry out all the exploratory analyses that it deemed potentially relevant. These included amendments to the hazard ratio for fatal bleeds and adjusting for the possibility of informative censoring. The Committee noted that, to explore its concerns about informative censoring, the ERG had undertaken a 'crude' exploratory analysis to explore the effects on the ICER of increasing the number of patients who experienced a fatal bleed with rivaroxaban. The Committee was aware that the analysis showed that even if rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily caused as many as 20 more fatal bleeds
