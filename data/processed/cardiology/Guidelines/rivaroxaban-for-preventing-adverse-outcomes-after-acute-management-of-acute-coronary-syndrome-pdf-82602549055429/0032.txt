If a hypothetical patient transitioned into the multiple event states from a single event state, their utility in the multiple event state could be understated, because improvement in utility after the first event had been ignored. The ERG stated that that this problem was again related to the inability of the model to distinguish when events had occurred. The ERG noted that this was not the only assumption that the company could have made to calculate the utility value in the multiple event states. It could have assumed that the lowest utility value of the 2 events applied to the patients or, if the model could track the chronicity of events, it could have assumed that the utility of the
