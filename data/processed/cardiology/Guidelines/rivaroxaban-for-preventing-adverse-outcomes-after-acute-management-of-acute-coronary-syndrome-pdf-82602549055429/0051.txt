Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

experienced a fatal bleed with rivaroxaban. The Committee was aware that the analysis showed that even if rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily caused as many as 20 more fatal bleeds than observed in the trial, the estimated ICER remained below £10,000 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that despite the inflexibility of the company's economic model and the resulting constraints on the ERG's ability to undertake further exploratory analyses, the ICERs presented were a suitable basis for decision-making on the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban in addition to clopidogrel plus aspirin or with aspirin alone. 4.12 The Committee considered the ICER for the 2.5 mg dose of rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin plus clopidogrel or with aspirin alone, compared with aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin alone in patients with acute coronary syndrome with elevated cardiac biomarkers (STEMI or NSTEMI) and no history of stroke or TIA. The Committee noted that the company's base-case ICER was £6,203 per QALY gained, and the ERG's preferred base-case estimate was £5,622 per QALY gained. It accepted that there is uncertainty about the validity of the results based on ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 because of the risk of bias resulting from missing data and informative censoring. However,
