Rivaroxaban for preventing adverse outcomes after acute management of acute coronary

population seen in clinical practice in England. The ERG noted that of all patients randomised in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51, 74% were men and the mean age was 61.8 years. The ERG commented that patients with acute coronary syndrome in England are usually older, with a mean age of 65 years and 72 years for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI respectively. It highlighted that the EMA's assessment report noted that patients in the trial were considered to be at low risk. Patients in the trial had little comorbidity, lower than usual use of percutaneous coronary intervention and included a relatively small proportion of people aged over 75 years or who had impaired renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min. As a result, the findings from ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 may not be applicable to an older population or to those with a greater incidence of renal impairment and a higher baseline bleeding risk. 3.29 The ERG commented that mean treatment duration with rivaroxaban in ATLAS-ACS 2-TIMI 51 was 13.1 months. As a result, the evidence on efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily beyond this time is limited. The ERG noted that this is reflected in the summary
