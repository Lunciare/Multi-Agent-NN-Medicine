KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

is needed 4.11 For people who need to monitor AF recurrence, including those who have had an ischaemic stroke or a transient ischaemic attack without current evidence of AF, the results of the EAC's analysis show that KardiaMobile is likely to be cost incurring. This was driven by an increase in using anticoagulation for preventing strokes. The committee understood that the model included only a small selection of patients who are at low risk of developing strokes (CHA2DS2-VAScC score of 1) and that medication was the only intervention included in the model. Expert advice suggested that clinical management of patients being monitored for AF recurrence is complex and varied widely because of patients' comorbidities and their medical and treatment history. In clinical practice, there is no clear care pathway for monitoring AF recurrence. The committee accepted the limitations of the current model and concluded that more information is needed about the care pathway for AF recurrence monitoring and its associated resource use.
