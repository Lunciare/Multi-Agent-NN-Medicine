KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

Holter monitoring. This was supported by the results from an observational study (Yan et al. 2020). Evidence suggests that the KardiaMobile algorithm has a high diagnostic accuracy per electrocardiogram (ECG) recording 3.4 Four peer reviewed studies (Hermans et al. 2021, Lowres et al. 2016, Selder et al. 2019, William et al. 2018) reported on the diagnostic accuracy of AF detection using the KardiaMobile algorithm compared with clinical interpretation of the KardiaMobile ECG as the reference standard. Its sensitivity ranged between 92% and 99% per recorded ECG, with specificity between 92% and 98%. However, the external assessment centre (EAC) highlighted that diagnostic accuracy was reported on a per ECG recording and not a per person basis. Also, these 4 studies had 4 different patient populations with a pre-test probability of AF between 4.8% and 35.6%. The EAC also noted that KardiaMobile is not intended to be used to confirm the presence of AF as a standalone test but to help detect AF. All interpretations should be reviewed by healthcare professionals for clinical decision making. It is expected that false positives and negatives are likely to be captured by the clinical reviews. Evidence shows that using KardiaMobile reduces time to AF detection
