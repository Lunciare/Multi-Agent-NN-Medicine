ambulatory monitors are offered if a person does not have a compatible device. The clinical experts also noted that KardiaMobile may not be suitable for people who cannot stay still or have problems holding the device; for example, people with tremors may have difficulty with recording an accurate trace. Training is important to minimise unreadable ECG recordings when using KardiaMobile 4.8 The clinical experts highlighted the issue of unreadable ECG traces. They explained that the way people use the device is likely to affect the quality of ECG recordings. In clinical practice, healthcare professionals often provide support for people to set up the device, allowing them to also advise on effective use. There are also self-help videos that explain how to use the device. The clinical experts noted that a lack of experience using the device may lead to unreadable ECG recordings. The committee concluded that training is important to make sure people use the device correctly and minimise possible interference while taking the recording.
