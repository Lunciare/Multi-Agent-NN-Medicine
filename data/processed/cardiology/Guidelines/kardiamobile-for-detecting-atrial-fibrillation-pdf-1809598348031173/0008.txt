KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

would be useful in self-monitoring at home and improving their ability to access the care they needed. Two RCTs (Caceres et al. 2020, Guhl et al. 2020) showed that people who used KardiaMobile had a significant improvement in AF-specific quality-of-life scores compared with people in the control groups. The EAC noted that both trials used additional interventions, and the effect of KardiaMobile alone on quality of life may be difficult to interpret. The rate of unclassified ECG outputs varied in the studies but is falling because of software updates 3.7 Evidence reported that there were a proportion of ECG traces that did not fit the current KardiaMobile algorithm classifications, ranging from 9.6% to 27.6%. These outputs are presented as unclassified. However, the company stated that software updates are improving the classification algorithm, and the number of unclassified outputs is reducing. Also, around 0.6% to 1.9% of KardiaMobile outputs were unreadable. This often happens when an ECG trace has interference and cannot be interpreted by the Kardia app; however, a proportion of these can be interpreted by a clinician. Cost evidence Published cost evidence includes 2 UK studies representing NHS costs 3.8 Three published studies reported the economic impact of KardiaMobile:
