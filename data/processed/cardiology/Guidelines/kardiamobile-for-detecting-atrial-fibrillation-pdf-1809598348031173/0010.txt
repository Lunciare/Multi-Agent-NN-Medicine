secondary care setting. The model assessed the costs associated with diagnosing and managing AF. Overall, the company's base case showed that using KardiaMobile could save between £320 and £380 per person over 5 years because of the cost of the technology, reductions in repeat testing, referrals to secondary care and stroke events. For full details of the cost evidence, see section 9 of the assessment report in the supporting documentation. The company's cost model was updated to address the limitations presented by the EAC 3.10 The EAC was unable to validate the company's original model, and highlighted limitations and errors in some of the parameters and assumptions used. The complexity of the model meant that inconsistencies could not be investigated and corrected. There was a lack of robust evidence to support the need for such complex time dependencies in the diagnostic phase of the model, and this approach required several additional assumptions. The EAC considered that the diagnosis phase could have been modelled more simply. Overall, the EAC considered the model to be overly complex, not transparent and not verifiable. It also did not agree with underlying structural assumptions, parameter choice or their implementation in the model. 3.11 The company
