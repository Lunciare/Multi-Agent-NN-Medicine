KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

suspected AF presenting with palpitations 4.10 The committee felt that the EAC's original approach using a cost calculator did not capture the cost impact of using KardiaMobile. The EAC was therefore asked to develop a new cost model, to evaluate using KardiaMobile to detect AF in people presenting with undiagnosed palpitations and people being monitored for AF recurrence. From these further analyses, the committee accepted that KardiaMobile is slightly cost saving compared with standard care for patients with undiagnosed AF (people with symptomatic palpitations). This saving is driven by a reduction in diagnostic costs because the cost of KardiaMobile is lower than that of Holter monitor. The clinical experts explained that the benefits of KardiaMobile in this population are likely to be realised because KardiaMobile is better at detecting infrequent AF events compared with Holter monitor. The committee concluded that there are likely to be cost benefits using KardiaMobile in symptomatic patients with suspected paroxysmal AF. The care pathway for monitoring AF recurrence is complex and varied and more information is needed 4.11 For people who need to monitor AF recurrence, including those who have had an ischaemic stroke or a transient ischaemic attack without current evidence of AF, the
