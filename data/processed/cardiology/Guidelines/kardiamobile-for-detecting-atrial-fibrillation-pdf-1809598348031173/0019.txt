KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

model estimated KardiaMobile to be cost saving compared with other ECG monitors 4.9 The committee understood that the company's original cost model was complex. The model was simplified during consultation. Data from 6 comparative studies was used to estimate the cost impact using KardiaMobile for 2 separate cohorts: 1) undiagnosed people presenting with palpitations and 2) people with previously diagnosed AF at risk of AF recurrence. The committee noted that the results from the company's cost model showed that KardiaMobile is cost saving for each cohort compared with Holter monitor over a 5-year time horizon. The committee considered that some assumptions and parameters, such as 100% diagnostic accuracy for KardiaMobile, may be unlikely or may not fully reflect clinical practice. The committee concluded that the company's modified model was relevant to the decision problem, but still featured limitations, and considered the EAC's additional cost modelling a more appropriate basis for its decision making. The EAC's additional cost modelling suggests that KardiaMobile is likely to be cost saving in people with suspected AF presenting with palpitations 4.10 The committee felt that the EAC's original approach using a cost calculator did not capture the cost impact of using KardiaMobile. The EAC was
