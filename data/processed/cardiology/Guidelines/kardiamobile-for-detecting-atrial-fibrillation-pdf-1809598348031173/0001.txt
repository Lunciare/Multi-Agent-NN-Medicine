KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

1 Recommendations 1.1 KardiaMobile is recommended as an option for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) for people with suspected paroxysmal AF, who present with symptoms such as palpitations and are referred for ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring by a clinician. Why the committee made these recommendations Detecting atrial fibrillation in people with suspected paroxysmal AF usually involves wearing a continuous ECG monitor, such as a Holter monitor. KardiaMobile is a portable ECG recorder that can help detect AF. Clinical evidence shows that significantly more people had AF detected using the KardiaMobile single-lead device compared with a Holter monitor. Cost modelling shows that KardiaMobile is cost saving compared with Holter monitor by an average of £13.22 per patient over 2 years in people presenting with symptoms such as palpitations. KardiaMobile is cost saving because of a reduction in diagnostic costs including the cost of the device. For more information on the cost impact to the NHS, see the NICE resource impact summary report. 2 The technology Technology 2.1 KardiaMobile is a portable electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF). It is available as a single-lead or 6-lead (KardiaMobile-6L) ECG recorder. The single-lead device has 2 electrodes on the top surface. The person
