KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

KardiaMobile was on the single-lead device. It was advised that the single-lead device is commonly used in clinical practice to detect AF, and the use of the 6-lead device is limited in the NHS. The clinical experts agreed that the 6-lead device provides heart rhythm from multiple angles, and it could have incremental benefits in some people to detect other arrhythmias when a good quality electrocardiogram (ECG) trace is available. For AF detection, the committee and experts concluded that the single-lead device is suitable in most patients. Evidence on using KardiaMobile for people after AF is diagnosed would be valuable, including the clinical consequences 4.3 The clinical experts advised that AF is a chronic condition. After AF is diagnosed, people are likely to be on medications such as anticoagulation or rhythm control drugs to reduce the risk of stroke and control symptoms for a long time. The experts noted that KardiaMobile could improve medication management; for instance, some medications can only be used when the normal heart rhythm is restored. However, no direct evidence was available on the clinical benefits of KardiaMobile after diagnosis of AF. For example, there was no evidence for the association between early AF detection and
