KardiaMobile for detecting atrial fibrillation

model to be overly complex, not transparent and not verifiable. It also did not agree with underlying structural assumptions, parameter choice or their implementation in the model. 3.11 The company submitted an updated cost model, which was modified and simplified to address the EAC's comments. Furthermore, various scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were done to explore uncertainties of the cost impact. The model was informed by 6 comparative studies including 1 UK study (Reid et al. 2019) and the results showed that using KardiaMobile resulted in cost saving in 2 studies of people with palpitations, and in 3 studies of people who were monitored for recurrent AF but was cost incurring in a study for monitoring AF. The EAC was, however, unable to validate the company model without further clarifications from the company (see Appendix B - EAC commentary), limiting the certainty in the results presented. Additional cost modelling by the EAC showed KardiaMobile to be cost saving for detecting AF in people presenting with undiagnosed palpitations 3.12 The EAC initially did a simple cost calculator to explore the expected costs of using KardiaMobile to detect and treat AF over a 1-year time horizon. It then went on to
