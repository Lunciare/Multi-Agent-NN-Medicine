6 comparative studies, including 3 randomised controlled trials that showed improved atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using the single-lead KardiaMobile. The clinical experts agreed that monitoring with KardiaMobile could increase infrequent AF event detection because it could record an AF event whenever symptoms are presented. The external assessment centre (EAC) advised that the evidence base was strongest in people with undiagnosed palpitations and people with a history of AF who need to monitor their AF recurrence. The experts noted that, in clinical practice, KardiaMobile has been most commonly used in people presenting with palpitations for detecting infrequent AF events. The committee concluded that the population groups in the evidence base reflected the use of the KardiaMobile device in a wide range of relevant clinical contexts, but it considered the most persuasive clinical cases were symptomatic people with suspected paroxysmal AF. KardiaMobile single-lead device is an option for detecting AF but there is no evidence on the 6-lead device 4.2 The committee noted that all the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of KardiaMobile was on the single-lead device. It was advised that the single-lead device is commonly used in clinical practice to detect AF, and the use of the 6-lead device is
