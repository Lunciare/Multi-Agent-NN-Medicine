EAC initially did a simple cost calculator to explore the expected costs of using KardiaMobile to detect and treat AF over a 1-year time horizon. It then went on to develop a new cost model that better captured the clinical pathway of using KardiaMobile for detection and ongoing monitoring of AF, compared with Holter monitoring in the NHS. The additional analyses included people presenting with undiagnosed palpitations and people who need to monitor AF recurrence after treatment. The base case results of the additional analyses showed a saving of £13.22 per person over 2 years when KardiaMobile was used for detecting AF in people presenting with undiagnosed palpitations but an additional £85.91 cost per patient over 10 years when KardiaMobile was used for monitoring AF recurrence detection in a population at low risk of having a stroke (CHA2DS2-VAScC score of 1). 4 Committee discussion Clinical-effectiveness overview Evidence supports using KardiaMobile for improved detection of atrial fibrillation in people with suspected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 4.1 The committee noted considerable evidence from 6 comparative studies, including 3 randomised controlled trials that showed improved atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using the single-lead KardiaMobile. The clinical experts agreed that monitoring with KardiaMobile could increase infrequent
