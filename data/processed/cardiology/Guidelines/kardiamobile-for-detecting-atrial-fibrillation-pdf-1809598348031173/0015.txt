However, no direct evidence was available on the clinical benefits of KardiaMobile after diagnosis of AF. For example, there was no evidence for the association between early AF detection and reduction in longer-term outcomes such as stroke events. The committee understood the limitations of the evidence base and concluded that more research would be of value that explores the use of KardiaMobile after AF diagnosis, including the impact of using KardiaMobile on clinical outcomes. NHS considerations overview KardiaMobile is easy to use and to access which means it is well suited for ambulatory monitoring 4.4 Evidence from published studies and patient experts shows that KardiaMobile is easier to use compared with other ECG monitors such as the Holter monitor. People with experience of using KardiaMobile found the device to be accessible at symptom onset and that it allowed improved access to care when needed. It has been well accepted across people of different age groups if they have a compatible mobile device. The committee concluded that KardiaMobile is a convenient device that people can use at home to monitor their heart rhythms. Patient selection will improve the care pathway and should be guided by clinical judgement 4.5 Patient selection is
