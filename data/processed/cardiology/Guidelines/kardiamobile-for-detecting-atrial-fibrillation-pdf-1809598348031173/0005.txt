6 population groups: • people with palpitations • people with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), who have had treatment (ablation, cardioversion, or medical therapy) to restore sinus rhythm and used KardiaMobile to identify recurrence • people with diagnosed AF to assess AF burden • people with transient AF after surgery or hospitalisation whose heart rhythms reverted back to sinus rhythm before discharge and used KardiaMobile to identify recurrence • people after stroke or transient ischaemic attack who were monitored using KardiaMobile • mixed population including people with known or suspected AF. All published evidence is on the single-lead KardiaMobile device. For full details of the clinical evidence, see section 4 of the assessment report in the supporting documentation. Evidence shows that monitoring with KardiaMobile increases AF detection 3.3 Three RCTs including 1 UK trial (Goldenthal et al. 2019, Koh et al. 2021, Reed et al. 2019) found that significantly more people in the KardiaMobile monitored group had AF detected compared with those who had standard care, which included 24-hour Holter monitoring. This was supported by the results from an observational study (Yan et al. 2020). Evidence suggests that the KardiaMobile algorithm has a high diagnostic accuracy per electrocardiogram (ECG)
