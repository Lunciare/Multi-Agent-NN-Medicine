clinical decision making. It is expected that false positives and negatives are likely to be captured by the clinical reviews. Evidence shows that using KardiaMobile reduces time to AF detection but there is no direct evidence for clinical outcomes after AF diagnosis 3.5 Reed et al. (2019) showed that people using KardiaMobile had their symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia detected significantly earlier than those having standard care (9.9 days compared with 48.0 days, p=0.0004). This finding was supported by 1 observational study (Yan et al. 2020) which also reported that KardiaMobile significantly reduced the time to AF detection when compared with standard care. There was no direct published evidence to show that using KardiaMobile improves clinical outcomes (such as reduction in stroke) after a diagnosis of AF. KardiaMobile is easy to use and is associated with an improvement in quality of life 3.6 The evidence from 12 studies and a patient survey reported that KardiaMobile was easier to use compared with other ECG monitors such as Holter monitors. People felt that KardiaMobile would be useful in self-monitoring at home and improving their ability to access the care they needed. Two RCTs (Caceres et al. 2020, Guhl et al. 2020) showed that people
