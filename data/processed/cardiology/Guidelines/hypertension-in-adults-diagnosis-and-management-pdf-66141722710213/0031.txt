Recommendations for research The 2019 and 2022 guideline committees have made the following recommendations for research. Key recommendations for research 1 Automated blood pressure monitoring in people with atrial fibrillation Which automated blood pressure monitors are suitable for people with hypertension and atrial fibrillation? [2019] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale on monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets for people without cardiovascular disease. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: monitoring the response to treatment. 2 Thresholds for interventions in adults aged under 40 In adults aged under 40 with hypertension (with or without type 2 diabetes), what are the appropriate risk and blood pressure thresholds for starting treatment?
