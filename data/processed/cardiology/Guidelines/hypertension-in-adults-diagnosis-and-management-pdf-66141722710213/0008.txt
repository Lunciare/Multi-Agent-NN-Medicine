[2004] 1.3.2 Estimate cardiovascular risk in line with the recommendations on identifying and assessing cardiovascular disease risk in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease.

[2008] 1.3.3 For all people with hypertension offer to: • test for the presence of protein in the urine by sending a urine sample for estimation of the albumin:creatinine ratio and test for haematuria using a reagent strip • take a blood sample to measure glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), electrolytes, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol • examine the fundi for the presence of hypertensive retinopathy • arrange for a 12-lead electrocardiograph to be performed.
