Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

that the use of these devices would lead to lower blood pressure readings than in routine UK clinical practice. They also had concerns that some medicines were stopped when blood pressure targets were achieved, which may have had an impact on the results. The committee also discussed concerns about applicability of the population; for example, the participants had high cardiovascular risk levels, including many with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or renal impairment, and were already receiving treatment before the study started. These concerns made the evidence difficult to interpret and use to inform the recommendations. Further details of the committee's discussion of this study is included in evidence review D: targets. Evidence from a smaller study also showed some benefit of lowering clinic systolic blood pressure targets to 130 mmHg. However, the committee noted that the study was based on people already receiving treatment and that it lacked information on adverse events. The committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that blood pressure targets should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. Evidence for lower targets in people with type 2 diabetes was also limited, with some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure targets did not reduce
