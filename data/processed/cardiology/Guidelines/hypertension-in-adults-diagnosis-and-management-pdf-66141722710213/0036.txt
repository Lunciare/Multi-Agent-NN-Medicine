Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

diagnose hypertension. The committee members acknowledged that these findings were in line with their clinical experience and agreed that clinic blood pressure measurement alone would not be an adequate method to diagnose hypertension. The committee discussed repeat clinic blood pressure measurements when there is a difference in blood pressure between arms and noted that clinical practice varied. Based on their experience and knowledge, the committee members agreed that a cut-off of 15 mmHg would be more suitable than 20 mmHg, which was specified in the 2011 recommendations. This is in line with recent evidence that suggests a small difference in arm blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, possibly due to vascular damage. ABPM correlates well with invasive blood pressure measurement and can identify both white-coat and masked hypertension. Based on the evidence in the 2011 guideline and the committee's experience and knowledge, it was agreed that ABPM remains the gold standard for the accurate measurement of blood pressure in primary care. ABPM has therefore been retained as the preferred method for the diagnosis of hypertension. In addition, economic evidence obtained by updating the health economic model for the 2011 guideline confirmed that ABPM is still
