The Royal College of Physicians Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party guideline recommends a lower blood pressure target for people after stroke. However, the national quality indicators used in primary care do not use a lower blood pressure target for people with cardiovascular disease (including stroke and transient ischaemic attack).

Instead, the evidence from previous versions of the guideline was reassessed to look at outcomes for people with cardiovascular disease. Only evidence up to 2010 was re-analysed, because the 2019 update did not review evidence for people with cardiovascular disease. There was no difference in clinically relevant outcomes between people with and
