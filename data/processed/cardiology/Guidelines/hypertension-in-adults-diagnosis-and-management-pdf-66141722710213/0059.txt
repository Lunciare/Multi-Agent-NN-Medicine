The committee discussed the evidence for this and agreed that it was sufficient to support and retain this recommendation. The committee agreed it should be broadened to include the choice of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB; also referred to as A-type drugs), because they are now cost equivalent, and the committee also agreed they are clinically equivalent. For people of Black African or African–Caribbean family origin with type 2 diabetes, the previous recommendation was to offer step 1 dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor and either a diuretic (D-type drug) or a calcium channel blocker (CCB; C-type drug). However, these recommendations were based on monotherapy studies and when the committee looked at this evidence alongside the new dual therapy evidence review, they concluded that it was insufficient to recommend starting dual therapy in any subgroup of people with type 2
