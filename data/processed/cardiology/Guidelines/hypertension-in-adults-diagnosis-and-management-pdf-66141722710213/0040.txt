Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

treatment for hypertension in terms of reducing cardiovascular events or improving quality of life (see the recommendation for research on relaxation therapies). They also noted that a larger study would be needed to obtain meaningful results. How this might affect practice Relaxation therapies were not recommended for routine use in the 2011 guideline, and they are not used in current practice for the management of primary hypertension in adults. The 2011 recommendation advised that people may try them as part of their treatment to reduce blood pressure, but committee consensus was that uptake has been low. Therefore, current practice will not be affected by the removal of the 2011 recommendation. Starting antihypertensive drug treatment Recommendations 1.4.9 to 1.4.14 Why the committee made the recommendations The evidence suggested that antihypertensive drug treatment was effective at reducing cardiovascular events in people with a clinic blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or more (stage 2 hypertension). A large study also suggested there was benefit of treating people with stage 1 hypertension. However, other studies in people with a low cardiovascular risk did not identify a benefit of treatment, and the committee agreed that the benefit of treatment across different cardiovascular risk groups was uncertain.
