the higher reading. [2019] 1.2.2 If blood pressure measured in the clinic is 140/90 mmHg or higher: • Take a second measurement during the consultation. • If the second measurement is substantially different from the first, take a third measurement. Record the lower of the last 2 measurements as the clinic blood pressure. [2019] 1.2.3 If clinic blood pressure is between 140/90 mmHg and 180/120 mmHg, offer ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. See the section on identifying who to refer for people with a clinic blood pressure 180/120 mmHg or higher. [2019] 1.2.4 If ABPM is unsuitable or the person is unable to tolerate it, offer home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. [2019] 1.2.5 While waiting for confirmation of a diagnosis of hypertension, carry out: • investigations for target organ damage (see recommendation 1.3.3), followed by • formal assessment of cardiovascular risk using a cardiovascular risk assessment tool (see the section on full formal risk assessment in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease). [2019] 1.2.6 When using ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, ensure that at least 2 measurements per hour are taken during the person's usual waking hours
