Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

and insufficient to determine whether a lower target would be beneficial and whether it would outweigh the associated harms. Therefore, the 2011 clinic blood pressure target of 140/90 mmHg for adults under 80 years was retained and applies to people with or without type 2 diabetes. The corresponding HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) targets were also retained at 135/85 mmHg. The recommendations emphasise the importance of achieving and maintaining a level consistently below the person's blood pressure target, whether this target be based on clinic blood pressure, HBPM or ABPM. Based on their experience, the committee members felt that people with postural hypotension are at risk of adverse events if a sitting or lying blood pressure is used for monitoring, because this measurement would overestimate daytime blood pressure and result in overtreatment. For example, a patient with a sitting systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg might have a much lower blood pressure when standing and be at an increased risk of falls if treated based on their sitting blood pressure. The committee decided to recommend that 3 groups who are at risk of postural hypotension (people over 80 years, with type 2 diabetes and with symptoms of postural
