Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

blood pressure. The committee decided to recommend that 3 groups who are at risk of postural hypotension (people over 80 years, with type 2 diabetes and with symptoms of postural hypotension) should have their standing blood pressure measured, and their treatment modified accordingly if they have postural hypotension. The standing blood pressure should be used for future monitoring. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations should reinforce current good practice. However, the new recommendations place more emphasis on maintaining blood pressure consistently below the blood pressure targets. As a result, this could lead to a higher use of antihypertensive drugs and an increase in consultations to maintain target blood pressure. For people with type 2 diabetes and target organ damage (not covered by other guidelines), the slightly higher target blood pressure compared to that recommended previously may reduce adverse events and may lead to fewer appointments and reduced drug use.
