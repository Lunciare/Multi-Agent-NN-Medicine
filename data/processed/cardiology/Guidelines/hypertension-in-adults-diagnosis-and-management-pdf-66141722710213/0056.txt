There was no difference in clinically relevant outcomes between people with and without cardiovascular disease. Evidence was limited for people with stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or coronary artery disease. This evidence did not cover enough treatment comparisons to allow the committee to draw any firm conclusions. There are NICE guidelines on acute coronary syndromes and chronic heart failure, and these guidelines make recommendations on drug treatment that overlap with treatment for hypertension. To avoid confusion over the treatment pathway, the committee highlighted that these condition-specific recommendations should be applied first (for example, when prescribing an ACE inhibitor or an ARB for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction). How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendation reflects current practice for most types of cardiovascular disease.
