Additionally, the committee reviewed the evidence on whether specific subgroups of people with hypertension might benefit from starting on dual therapy, for example people with type 2 diabetes, older people, or those of particular family origins. Some limited evidence from a single study showed that initial dual therapy may reduce cardiovascular events in people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, but the committee members were disappointed that more comprehensive data was not available. The committee discussed the benefits of optimising treatment for hypertension early and agreed that this can substantially improve quality of life. However, there was not enough evidence to determine confidently the benefits or harms of starting treatment with dual therapy. In response to the lack of available evidence, the committee developed a recommendation for research on step 1 treatment to determine if particular
