80 with stage 1 hypertension and a cardiovascular risk above 10% should have a discussion with their healthcare professional about starting antihypertensive treatment, alongside lifestyle changes, and that this would be a clinically and cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee also agreed that antihypertensive treatment should be considered for people under 60 with a risk below 10%, with the degree of uncertainty in treating people at low risk reflected in the strength of the recommendation. The committee members were mindful of the additional population that would be affected by lowering the threshold and were aware that the decision to start drug treatment would depend on the person's preferences and their individual risk of cardiovascular disease. The recommendations highlight the importance of discussing the person's preferences for treatment and encouraging lifestyle changes. Some studies investigated the benefits of treating hypertension in people with lower cardiovascular risk or people with blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. However, some of these studies were not directly relevant because they included a high proportion of participants with chronic kidney disease and previous cardiovascular events. For this reason, several studies could not be used to inform the recommendations. For details of these studies see evidence review
