Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

with type 2 diabetes. Evidence for lower targets in people with type 2 diabetes was also limited, with some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure targets did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. Previous recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes (in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults) suggested a blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg in the presence of target organ damage such as kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. The committee noted that the evidence behind this recommendation was based on 2 small studies in people without hypertension. They also had concerns about the relevance of the study design. The committee were also aware of trial data showing less benefit in populations with type 2 diabetes with fewer additional risk factors. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a different blood pressure target for this subgroup. It was noted that people with later-stage chronic kidney disease are covered by other NICE guidelines. Overall, the committee agreed that the evidence was unclear and insufficient to determine whether a lower target would be beneficial and whether it would outweigh the associated harms. Therefore, the 2011 clinic blood pressure target of 140/90 mmHg for
