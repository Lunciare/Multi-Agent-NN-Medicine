Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

the recommendations No evidence for step 2 or step 3 treatment was identified that was relevant to determining the best sequence for step 2 and step 3 antihypertensive treatment. Some of the studies available on drug treatments for hypertension were not included in this review because they were designed to inform step 1 treatment. Others did not reflect UK clinical practice. For details of these studies see evidence review F: step 2 and step 3 treatment. Based on evidence from the previous version of the guideline and their clinical expertise, the committee members agreed to retain the same choice of drugs from the 2011 guideline, which reflect current best practice. The committee agreed that, in the absence of evidence of which treatment(s) are most effective for step 2 or step 3, the recommendation should be to offer any of these treatments based on an individualised approach informed by risks and benefits of each treatment and the person with hypertension's preference. The committee noted that the changes to the step 1 recommendations for some people with type 2 diabetes do not necessitate a change in the step 2 recommendations since the same options for combination treatment at step 2 are available.
