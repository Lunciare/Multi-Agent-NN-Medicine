[2019] 1.4.48 For people with confirmed resistant hypertension, consider adding a fourth antihypertensive drug as step 4 treatment or seeking specialist advice.

Use particular caution in people with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate because they have an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. [2019] In March 2019, this was an off-label use of some preparations of spironolactone. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. 1.4.50 When using further diuretic therapy for step 4 treatment of resistant hypertension, monitor blood sodium and potassium and renal function within 1 month of starting treatment and repeat as needed thereafter.
