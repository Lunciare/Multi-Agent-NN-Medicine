Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

small studies in which the participants did not have hypertension. Further evidence for lower treatment thresholds in people with type 2 diabetes was limited within this review, with the committee aware of some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure thresholds did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in people without additional risk factors. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a different threshold for starting treatment for this subgroup. There was no evidence identified on thresholds for people aged over 80, and no prior recommendation for this age group with hypertension below stage 2; therefore, the committee agreed that the threshold for starting treatment in people aged over 80 should be consistent with the target for treatment in this population (150/90 mmHg or lower). The committee discussed the additional risks of starting treatment in older people, particularly those who are frail or have multiple comorbidities. Based on their expertise and experience, they agreed that the use of clinical judgement should be highlighted in decision making for people with frailty or multimorbidity, and that it should apply to people of any age. The committee agreed that a number of factors should be considered when discussing
