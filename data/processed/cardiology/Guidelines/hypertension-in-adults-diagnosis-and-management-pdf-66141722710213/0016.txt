Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management

for people with hypertension identified as having a white-coat effect or masked hypertension (in which clinic and non-clinic blood pressure results are conflicting). Be aware that the corresponding measurements for ABPM and HBPM are 5 mmHg lower than for clinic measurements (see recommendation 1.2.8 for diagnostic thresholds). [2019] 1.4.19 For people who choose to use HBPM, provide: • training and advice on using home blood pressure monitors • information about what to do if they are not achieving their target blood pressure. Be aware that the corresponding measurements for HBPM are 5 mmHg lower than for clinic measurements (see recommendation 1.2.8 for diagnostic thresholds). [2019] 1.4.20 For adults with hypertension aged under 80, reduce clinic blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. See also table 1 for guidance on clinic blood pressure targets for people aged under 80 with type 1 diabetes or severe chronic kidney disease. [2019, amended 2022] 1.4.21 For adults with hypertension aged 80 and over, reduce clinic blood pressure to below 150/90 mmHg and ensure that it is maintained below that level. Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see NICE's guideline on multimorbidity). See also
