participants with chronic kidney disease and previous cardiovascular events. For this reason, several studies could not be used to inform the recommendations. For details of these studies see evidence review C: initiating treatment. The committee discussed the lack of evidence to inform a threshold for starting treatment in people aged under 40. It was agreed that this is an important area for future research and the recommendation for research was carried forward from the 2011 guideline (see the recommendation for research on thresholds for interventions in adults aged under 40). The committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that thresholds for starting treatment should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. The previous recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes (in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults) suggested starting antihypertensive drug treatment if lifestyle interventions alone did not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg or 130/80 mmHg in the presence of kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. However, this was based on evidence from 2 small studies in which the participants did not have hypertension. Further evidence for lower treatment thresholds in people with type 2 diabetes was limited within this review, with the committee
