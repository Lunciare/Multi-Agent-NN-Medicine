See also table 2 for guidance on clinic blood pressure targets for people aged 80 and over with type 1 diabetes or severe chronic kidney disease. [2019, amended 2022] 1.4.22 When using ABPM or HBPM to monitor the response to treatment in adults with hypertension, use the average blood pressure level taken during the person's usual waking hours (see recommendations 1.2.6 and 1.2.7). Reduce blood pressure and ensure that it is maintained: • below 135/85 mmHg for adults aged under 80 • below 145/85 mmHg for adults aged 80 and over. Use clinical judgement for people with frailty or multimorbidity (see also NICE's guideline on multimorbidity). [2019, amended 2022] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2019 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets for people without cardiovascular disease. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: monitoring the response to treatment. 1.4.23 Use the same blood pressure targets for
