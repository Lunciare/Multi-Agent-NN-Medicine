[2023] 1.2 Diagnosing hypertension 1.2.1 When considering a diagnosis of hypertension, measure blood pressure in both arms: • If the difference in readings between arms is more than 15 mmHg, repeat the measurements. • If the difference in readings between arms remains more than 15 mmHg on the second measurement, measure subsequent blood pressures in the arm with the higher reading. [2019] 1.2.2 If blood pressure measured in the clinic is 140/90 mmHg or higher: • Take a second measurement during the consultation. • If the second measurement
