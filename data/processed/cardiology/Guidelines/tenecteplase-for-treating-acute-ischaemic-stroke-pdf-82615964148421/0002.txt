Tenecteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

treatment of an acute ischaemic stroke. The evidence includes preliminary results from a large ongoing UK trial and published results from completed trials. A cost comparison of tenecteplase with alteplase suggests that it costs less. Administration, adverse-event and other resource-use costs are expected to be similar for the 2 treatments. So, tenecteplase is recommended. For all evidence, see the committee papers. To see what NICE did for alteplase, see the consideration of the evidence section in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke. 2 Information about tenecteplase Anticipated marketing authorisation indication 2.1 Tenecteplase (Metalyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) is indicated 'in adults for the thrombolytic treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) within 4.5 hours from last known well and after exclusion of intracranial haemorrhage'.
