Percutaneous laser coronary
angioplasty
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 26 January 2011
www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg378
Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with

Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty (IPG378)
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of percutaneous laser coronary
angioplasty is adequate to support the use of this procedure in carefully selected
patients for whom conventional angioplasty would otherwise be technically
difficult, provided that normal arrangements are in place for clinical governance,
consent and audit.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications and current treatments
2.1.1 Coronary artery disease (CAD) refers to the narrowing and occlusion of the
coronary arteries as a result of atherosclerosis. This can cause angina,
myocardial infarction and heart failure.
2.1.2 Treatment options for patients with CAD with severe stenosis or occlusion
include thrombolysis, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, stent placement,
percutaneous cutting balloon or coronary artery bypass grafting.
2.1.3 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty has been used for CAD with severe
stenosis or atherosclerotic occlusion, when standard techniques for
recannalisation are unlikely to succeed or have failed.

Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty (IPG378)
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty aims to penetrate plaque within
coronary arteries that is not amenable to standard techniques such as balloon
angioplasty or stenting alone.
2.2.2 A thin, flexible fibre-optic catheter connected to a laser-generating source
outside the body is introduced via the femoral artery. The catheter is advanced
over a guidewire through the artery to the blockage in the coronary artery, under
fluoroscopic guidance. The tip of the catheter system emits pulses of laser light
to vaporise the plaque while being slowly advanced across the lesion.
2.2.3 Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty has also been done using a laser
guidewire system but that method is not now in regular use.
2.2.4 This procedure is often used with adjunctive balloon angioplasty and followed by
angiography to document the results.
2.3 Efficacy
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes from the published literature
that the Committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more
detailed information on the evidence, see the overview.
2.3.1 A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 303 patients treated with laser guidewire
or mechanical guidewire reported procedural success (defined as the ability to
cross the target lesion at the first attempt) in 53% (76 out of 144) and 47% (75
out of 159) of patients respectively (p=0.33). A non-randomised controlled study
of 3,733 procedures reported that 'lesion success' assessed angiographically
was achieved in 89% and 94% of native vessels treated with laser angioplasty
using 2 different laser devices, and in 91% and 95% of saphenous vein grafts for
which laser treatment was attempted (absolute figures not stated). A case series
of 958 patients reported that among 55 patients who underwent immediate
postoperative angiographic assessment, coronary stenosis (assessed by the
percentage of artery diameter blocked) decreased from 83% at baseline to 49%
following laser angioplasty and to 38% following adjunctive balloon angioplasty

Percutaneous laser coronary angioplasty (IPG378)
(absolute figures not stated).
2.3.2 The RCT of 303 patients treated with laser guidewire or mechanical guidewire
reported no major adverse cardiac events in 54% (78 out of 144) and 67% (106
out of 159) of patients respectively at 400-day follow-up (p=0.026).
2.3.3 Major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction or revascularisation)
were more frequent after laser angioplasty compared with balloon angioplasty in
the meta-analysis of 9,222 patients at up to 1-year follow-up (odds ratio [OR]
1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.73).
2.3.4 A case series of 1,862 patients reported that 71% of patients had an improvement
in their angina symptoms, 13% had unchanged symptoms and 16% had worse
symptoms at 6-month median follow-up (absolute figures not stated).
2.3.5 A meta-analysis of 16 studies including a total of 9,222 patients reported that
angiographically measured restenosis occurred more frequently after laser
angioplasty than after balloon angioplasty (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.20) at
follow-up of between 3 months and 1 year. An RCT of 96 patients treated by laser
angioplasty and adjunctive balloon angioplasty or by balloon angioplasty alone
reported restenosis in 52% and 47% of patients respectively at 163 days median
follow-up (p=not significant; absolute figures not stated).
2.3.6 The case series of 1,862 patients reported restenosis greater than 50% of the
artery diameter in 54% (434 out of 797) of eligible patients undergoing
angiographic assessment at 6-month median follow-up. A case series of 495
stenosed saphenous vein grafts treated by laser angioplasty reported restenosis
in 55% of the 161 patients who had angiographic assessment at 6-month follow-
up (absolute figures not stated).
2.3.7 The Specialist Advisers listed key efficacy outcomes as procedural success,
angiographic success, quality-of-life scores, target vessel revascularisation and
cardiac enzyme level post procedure.

2.4 Safety
2.4.1 The meta-analysis of 9,222 patients treated by laser angioplasty or balloon
angioplasty reported no difference between the groups in the rate of myocardial
infarction at 30-day follow-up (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.82). A meta-analysis of
3,012 patients being treated for in-stent restenosis reported that the pooled
mean rate of major adverse cardiac events was 35% for laser angioplasty, 29%
for balloon angioplasty and 31% for stent-in-stent treatment (absolute figures not
stated).
2.4.2 A non-randomised controlled study of 8,932 procedures reported that the rate of
arterial perforation was 2% (5 out of 242) for laser angioplasty, less than 1% (11
out of 7,905) for balloon angioplasty and 0% (0 out of 116) for mechanical
rotational atherectomy.
2.4.3 The Specialist Advisers listed theoretical adverse events as death, coronary
dissection, abrupt vessel closure, thermal damage to the vessel and restenosis.
