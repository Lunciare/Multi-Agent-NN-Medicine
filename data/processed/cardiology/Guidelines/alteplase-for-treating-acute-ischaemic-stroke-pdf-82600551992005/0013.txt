Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

chose a population for the model based on SITS-MOST ('Safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke-monitoring study'), a European observational study of patients receiving alteplase. The manufacturer considered that this study population represented the mean age (68 years) and gender distribution (39.8% female) of patients who would receive alteplase in clinical practice in England and Wales. 3.14 For the first phase (0 to 6 months) of the manufacturer's economic model, the size of the effect of treatment with alteplase was informed by the manufacturer's meta-analyses for the 3 treatment windows as described in section 3.8. For the standard treatment arm, the proportion of people in each health state (39.53% independent, 32.56% dependent and 27.91% dead) was informed by the Lothian stroke registry, a registry in Edinburgh, Scotland, of 1,779 inpatients with suspected or confirmed stroke from 1989 to 2000. The manufacturer also provided an alternative distribution of the proportion of people who received standard treatment in each health state from the placebo arm of the ECASS 3 trial at 90 days. This alternative distribution (61.54% independent, 30.27% dependent and 8.19% dead) was used by the ERG in exploratory sensitivity analyses. The manufacturer then used the relative risks of death and death
