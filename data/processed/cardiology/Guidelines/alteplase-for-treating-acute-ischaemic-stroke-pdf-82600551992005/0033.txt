Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

model, which may have overestimated the QALYs accrued by people in the independent health state and therefore biased the results in favour of alteplase. However, the Committee considered that this was not a crucial limitation of the model because the ICERs were not sensitive to changes in the utility values in the manufacturer's sensitivity analyses, and therefore any downward adjustment over time would have had a small impact on the ICERs. The Committee was also aware that the manufacturer assumed that people who had a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in the economic model incurred the additional one-off cost of a CT scan but experienced no further disutility beyond that captured in the dependent or independent health states. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that this assumption was reasonable. Overall, the Committee concluded that the economic model adhered to the NICE reference case for economic analysis and Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) the modelling approach was reasonable. 4.10 The Committee considered the most plausible ICERs presented by the manufacturer and also by the ERG in its exploratory analyses. It agreed that alteplase either dominated standard care or had an ICER below £10,000 per QALY gained depending on the time-to-treatment
