Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

3- to 4.5-hour (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.33, p=0.42), the 0- to 3-hour (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03, p=0.88) or the 0- to 4.5-hour (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.18, p=0.41) treatment windows. For the outcome of death or dependence at 90 days, the manufacturer reported no statistically significant difference between alteplase and placebo for the 3- to 4.5-hour window (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05, p=0.14). However, a statistically significant difference in favour of alteplase was reported for both the 0- to 3-hour window (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, p=0.002) and the 0- to 4.5-hour window (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92, p<0.001). For the outcome of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurring within 10 days, patients randomised to receive alteplase within the 3- to 4.5-hour window had a statistically significant higher risk (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.06 to 21.87, p=0.04), with similar results for the 0- to 4.5-hour treatment window (RR 4.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 12.53, p=0.01). For the 0- to 3-hour window, the manufacturer reported a higher risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage among patients randomised to alteplase that was not statistically significant (RR 3.94, 95% CI 0.61 to 25.47,
