Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

noted that in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the manufacturer sampled independently the relative risks for death and death or dependence associated with treatment with alteplase, which had a marked impact on the ICERs in the one-way sensitivity analyses. The ERG noted that this did not take into account the likely correlation between the outcomes of death and death or dependence, and that the probabilistic sensitivity analysis might not provide an accurate description of the uncertainty around the mean costs and QALYs, although the ERG did not expect it to have a large impact on the ICER. 3.24 The ERG conducted an exploratory sensitivity analysis by replacing the proportion of people in the 3 health states (dependent, independent and dead) at the end of the first phase (0 to 6 months) taken from the Lothian stroke registry with those observed in the ECASS 3 trial population. Because mortality rates were lower in the ECASS 3 trial, a higher proportion of patients were in the independent state (61.54%) and a lower proportion in the dead state (8.19%). This sensitivity analysis resulted in an ICER of £4,451 per QALY gained for alteplase compared with standard care for the 0- to 4.5-hour window (incremental
