included different scenarios using additional clinical efficacy data from unplanned subgroup analyses of the ATLANTIS A and B and ECASS 2 trials for 3 to 4.5 hours, and weighted the results based on the assumption that in UK clinical practice a higher proportion of patients are treated during the 0- to 3-hour window (76%) than during the 3- to 4.5-hour window (24%). Using these analyses, alteplase either dominated placebo (that is, was both less costly and more effective) or had an ICER below £2,000 per QALY gained. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that alteplase had a high probability (above 90%) of being cost effective at a level of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained. 3.20 The manufacturer's base-case deterministic cost-effectiveness analysis for the 3- to 4.5-hour window resulted in an ICER of £6,272 per QALY gained for Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) alteplase compared with standard care (incremental costs £2,068; incremental QALYs 0.33). The probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in an ICER of £6,169 per QALY gained. The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses were similar to those for the 0- to 4.5-hour window, indicating that the ICERs were robust to changes in most input parameters, except
