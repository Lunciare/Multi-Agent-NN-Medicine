This alternative distribution (61.54% independent, 30.27% dependent and 8.19% dead) was used by the ERG in exploratory sensitivity analyses. The manufacturer then used the relative risks of death and death or dependence to calculate the distribution of people in the alteplase arm across the independent, dependent and dead states at the end of the first phase (6 months). The manufacturer used the relative risk of death to estimate the proportion of people who would die and therefore enter the dead state during the first phase. The proportion of people in the dependent state at 6 months was calculated as the difference between the estimated proportion of people who were dead or dependent, and the estimated proportion who were dead. The manufacturer assumed in the model that a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage had a cost impact (because it required a further diagnostic computed tomography [CT] scan), with the health consequences being captured in the Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) outcome of death or dependence from the clinical trials. 3.15 For the second phase of the model (6 to 12 months), the manufacturer assumed that people could move from the independent or dependent state to any other health state with equal
