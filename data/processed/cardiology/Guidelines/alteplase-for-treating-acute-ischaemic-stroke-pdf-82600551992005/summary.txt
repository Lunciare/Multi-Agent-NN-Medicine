Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) 2 The technology 2.1 Alteplase (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) is a tissue plasminogen activator manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. It activates the production of plasmin from its precursor plasminogen. Plasmin is an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. The aim of treatment is to reduce the impact of ischaemia by restoring blood flow through the occluded (blocked) artery. A UK marketing authorisation for alteplase to treat acute ischaemic stroke within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms was granted in September 2002.
