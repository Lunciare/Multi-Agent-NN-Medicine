was small. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage is the primary cause of death within 7 days for patients receiving alteplase treatment, and that clinicians have difficulty predicting which patients are at high risk. The Committee also noted that the proportion of other reported Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) serious adverse reactions and fatal adverse reactions in the ECASS 3 trial up to 90 days was similar across the 2 treatment arms. The Committee concluded that, although the increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage associated with alteplase is offset by significant improvements in favourable outcomes at 90 days, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage is an adverse event that needs to be included in modelling of the cost effectiveness of alteplase. 4.9 The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model, the assumptions on which the parameters were based, and the critique and exploratory analyses conducted by the ERG. The Committee noted that the model structure and many of the input parameters were identical to those used in the economic model for NICE technology appraisal guidance 122 (0- to 3-hour window) and agreed that this approach was appropriate. With regard to the clinical-effectiveness parameters used in the model,
