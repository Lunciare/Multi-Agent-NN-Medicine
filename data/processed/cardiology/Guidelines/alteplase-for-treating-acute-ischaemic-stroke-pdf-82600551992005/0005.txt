a randomised open-label blinded endpoint trial in which alteplase was administered within 6 hours of symptom onset. However, the manufacturer commented that this trial was not placebo controlled and therefore did not meet its trial selection criteria, and that no published results were available at the time of submission. 3.4 ECASS 3 was a placebo-controlled multicentre trial carried out across 130 sites in 19 European countries. Of the 821 patients 22 were from the UK. Patients were eligible for inclusion if aged between 18 and 80 years, diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke and able to receive treatment within 3 to 4.5 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Before randomisation, brain imaging was used to exclude intracranial haemorrhage. The trial randomly assigned eligible patients to receive 0.9 mg/kg of intravenous alteplase (n=418) or placebo (n=403). Patients were followed up for 90 days for outcomes. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between participants in the 2 treatment arms, but the initial severity of the stroke (as assessed by the National Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS; a 15-item quantitative measure of stroke-related neurological impairment]) and the proportion of patients with a history of previous stroke were both significantly higher in
