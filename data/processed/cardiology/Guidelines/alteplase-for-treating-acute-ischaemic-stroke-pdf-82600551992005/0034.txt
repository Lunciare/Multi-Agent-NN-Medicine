and also by the ERG in its exploratory analyses. It agreed that alteplase either dominated standard care or had an ICER below £10,000 per QALY gained depending on the time-to-treatment window considered. The Committee noted that the results were robust for most of the deterministic sensitivity analyses conducted by the manufacturer. The Committee also noted that none of the additional exploratory analyses undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs that varied substantially from those presented in the manufacturer's submission. The Committee considered that patients with acute ischaemic stroke who are admitted to hospital later (beyond 3 hours after onset of symptoms) may have less severe stroke and so any absolute benefit of treatment with alteplase compared with standard care may be diminished, resulting in a higher ICER. However, the Committee noted that the ICER for the 3- to 4.5-hour treatment window was low and therefore concluded that treating acute ischaemic stroke with alteplase within 0 to 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms was a cost- effective use of NHS resources. The Committee also agreed with the clinical specialists that extending the time window for treatment should not diminish the urgency with which people suspected of having an acute ischaemic
