Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

The Committee therefore concluded that alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after onset of stroke symptoms was an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke because it decreased the probability of disability. 4.7 The Committee considered the manufacturer's meta-analyses, which generated alternative estimates of alteplase's effect on all-cause mortality and also on death or dependence (modified Rankin scale score of 3 to 6) at 90 days for each of the 3 treatment windows (0 to 3 hours, 3 to 4.5 hours, and 0 to 4.5 hours), and which were used for the clinical-effectiveness parameters in the manufacturer's economic model. The Committee noted that the trials included in the meta- analyses for the 0- to 4.5-hour treatment window were of good methodological quality and were sufficiently similar in terms of study design and results. The Committee noted that there were no statistically significant differences in all- cause mortality reported at 90 days between alteplase and placebo for any of the 3 treatment windows. Therefore, the Committee agreed that an effect of alteplase on improving survival has currently not been proven. The Committee noted that a statistically significant difference in favour of alteplase was reported for the composite outcome of death or
