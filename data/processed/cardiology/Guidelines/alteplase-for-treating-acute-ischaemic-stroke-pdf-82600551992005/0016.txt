Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

values additional to those used in NICE technology appraisal guidance 122 on alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke within the first 3 hours after symptom onset. The manufacturer's submission for this appraisal identified 1 trial (Dorman et al. 1997) that collected EQ-5D utility values in a sample of 147 patients from the Lothian stroke registry. This trial provided utility values of 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79) for the independent state and 0.38 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.47) for the dependent state. The model assumed that these utility values remained fixed over time unless a person had a recurrent stroke which resulted in dependence, and thus a move from the independent to the dependent state. 3.17 The model included drug acquisition and administration costs as well as the costs of acute and long-term stroke care. The cost of alteplase was based on the mean body weight (76 kg) of patients in the 3- to 4.5-hour cohort from the SITS-MOST trial. Based on the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg, the average dose was 68.4 mg, resulting in a total estimated cost of £480 (£300 per 50-mg pack and £180 per 20-mg pack). Administration costs associated with alteplase of £1,316 per patient were
