(ERG). The decision problem addressed by the manufacturer considered whether treatment with alteplase was clinically effective compared with standard medical care (standard medical and supportive management that does not include alteplase) for treating acute ischaemic stroke in adults within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and whether alteplase treatment was a cost-effective use of NHS resources. 3.2 The manufacturer carried out a systematic literature search, which was based on a previously published Cochrane review ('Thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke'), but restricted the search to randomised controlled trials of alteplase. For the 0- to 3-hour treatment window, the manufacturer identified no trials other than those included in NICE's previous technology appraisal guidance on alteplase for the treatment of ischaemic stroke from 2007. The trials included NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) 1 and 2, ATLANTIS ('Thrombolysis for acute noninterventional therapy in ischaemic stroke') A and B, and ECASS (the 'European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study') 2. All these trials were multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials of alteplase administered at its licensed dose of 0.9 mg/kg. Treatment with alteplase was administered within 3 hours (NINDS 1 and 2), 5 hours (ATLANTIS B) or 6 hours (ATLANTIS A, ECASS 2) of onset
