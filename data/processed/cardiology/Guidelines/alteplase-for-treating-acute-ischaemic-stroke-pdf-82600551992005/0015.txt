the second phase of the model (6 to 12 months), the manufacturer assumed that people could move from the independent or dependent state to any other health state with equal probabilities for both treatment arms. These transition probabilities were based on the Lothian stroke registry. For the third phase of the model (beyond 12 months), the annual risk of a recurrent stroke (0.05), and the associated risk of mortality (0.25), were taken from the Lothian stroke registry. To estimate the mortality risk for people who did not have another stroke, the manufacturer took data from the Office for National Statistics life tables for England and Wales and adjusted them upward by a factor of 2.3 (taken from the Perth Community Stroke Study) to reflect the higher mortality rates among people who have had a stroke compared with the general UK population. 3.16 The manufacturer conducted a literature review to identify appropriate utility values for the independent and dependent states in the model. The manufacturer did not identify any relevant utility values additional to those used in NICE technology appraisal guidance 122 on alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke within the first 3 hours after symptom onset.
