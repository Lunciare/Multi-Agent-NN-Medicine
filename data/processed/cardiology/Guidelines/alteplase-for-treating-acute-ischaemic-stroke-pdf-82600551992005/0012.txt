by a modified Rankin scale score of 3 to 5. The model had 3 time phases: from 0 to 6 months when the model assumed the treatment effect of alteplase was complete at 90 days and maintained at 6 months; from 6 to 12 months when the model assumed no further treatment effect; and beyond 12 months when the model also assumed no further treatment effect from alteplase. However, beyond 12 months Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) the model assumed that people in the dependent or independent states could have a recurrent stroke. The model also assumed that people in the dependent state at 12 months and beyond do not move to an independent state, and that people in the independent state at 12 months and beyond do not move to a dependent state unless they survive a recurrent stroke. The model assumed a lifetime horizon with a cycle length of 6 months for the first 12 months, followed by cycles of 12 months thereafter. 3.13 The manufacturer chose a population for the model based on SITS-MOST ('Safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke-monitoring study'), a European observational study of patients receiving alteplase. The manufacturer considered that this study
