was associated with a statistically significantly higher probability of achieving a favourable global outcome score (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65, p=0.05). 3.8 The manufacturer presented a summary of adverse reactions based on intention- to-treat analyses in the ECASS 3 trial at 90 days. Fatal adverse reactions were reported for 7.7% of patients in the alteplase arm and 8.4% of those in the placebo arm. A statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in the alteplase arm had an intracranial haemorrhage (27.0% compared with 17.6%, p=0.001) or a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (2.4% compared with 0.3%, p=0.008) compared with the placebo arm. Three patients (0.7%) randomised to the alteplase arm had a fatal intracranial haemorrhage. Investigator-defined drug- related adverse reactions were reported for 23.9% of patients in the alteplase treatment arm and 6.9% of patients in the placebo arm. Other serious adverse reactions were reported for 25.1% of patients in the alteplase arm and 24.6% of those in the placebo arm. 3.9 The manufacturer conducted meta-analyses to calculate the relative risks associated with alteplase for all-cause mortality within 90 days, death or dependence within 90 days, and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 10 days for each of the 3 treatment windows (0
