outcome (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, p=0.04). 3.6 ECASS 3 also reported the composite outcome of death or dependence (defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale) at 90 days. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of patients who were dead or dependent between the alteplase and placebo treatment arms (33.5% compared Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) with 38.5%, relative risk [RR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05). 3.7 The ECASS 3 trial also reported as a secondary endpoint a global outcome score at 90 days, which combined a score of 0 to 1 on the modified Rankin scale, a score of 1 on the Glasgow outcome scale (a 5-point measure of brain injury, with 1 indicating independence and 5 death), a score of 95 to 100 on the Barthel index (a 10-item measure of a person's daily function, with higher scores reflecting higher function), and a score of 0 to 1 on the NIHSS. Randomisation to alteplase was associated with a statistically significantly higher probability of achieving a favourable global outcome score (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65, p=0.05). 3.8 The manufacturer presented a summary of
