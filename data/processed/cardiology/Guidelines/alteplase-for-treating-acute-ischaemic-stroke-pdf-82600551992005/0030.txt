Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

alteplase on improving survival has currently not been proven. The Committee noted that a statistically significant difference in favour of alteplase was reported for the composite outcome of death or dependence for the 0- to 3-hour and 0- to 4.5-hour treatment windows in the manufacturer's meta-analyses. The Committee therefore concluded that alteplase administered between 0 and 4.5 hours after onset of stroke symptoms was an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke because it decreased the probability of death or dependence. 4.8 The Committee considered the evidence on adverse reactions associated with alteplase. The Committee noted that a significantly higher proportion of patients in the alteplase arm had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 10 days compared with the placebo arm for the 3- to 4.5-hour window in the ECASS 3 trial and for the 0- to 4.5-hour window in the manufacturer's meta-analyses. However, the Committee noted that while alteplase increased the risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, the absolute number of patients in the ECASS 3 trial who had a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was small. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage is the primary cause of death within 7 days for patients receiving alteplase treatment, and that clinicians
