Institutes of Health stroke scale [NIHSS; a 15-item quantitative measure of stroke-related neurological impairment]) and the proportion of patients with a history of previous stroke were both significantly higher in the placebo arm. 3.5 The primary outcome in ECASS 3 was the presence or absence of disability at 90 days as assessed by the modified Rankin scale, which measures the degree of disability or dependence in people who have had a stroke and ranges from 0 (symptom free) to 6 (dead). From intention-to-treat analyses, 52.4% of patients randomised to the alteplase treatment arm had a favourable outcome at 90 days (a score of 0 or 1 [no significant disability]) compared with 45.2% of patients randomised to placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.76, p=0.04). After adjustment for confounding baseline variables (identified as being statistically significant at p<0.10) including treatment arm, NIHSS score, smoking, time from onset of stroke to treatment, and presence or absence of previous hypertension, alteplase remained statistically significantly associated with a favourable outcome (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, p=0.04). 3.6 ECASS 3 also reported the composite outcome of death or dependence (defined as a score of 3 to 6 on
