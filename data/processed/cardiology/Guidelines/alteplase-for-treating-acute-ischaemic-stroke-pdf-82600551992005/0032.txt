the economic model for NICE technology appraisal guidance 122 (0- to 3-hour window) and agreed that this approach was appropriate. With regard to the clinical-effectiveness parameters used in the model, the Committee acknowledged that the survival benefit associated with alteplase compared with standard care, which resulted from a point estimate for the relative risk for alteplase treatment and death of less than 1, was appropriately reflected in the economic model. However, the Committee noted that the manufacturer had assumed that the relative treatment effect of alteplase was maintained beyond 90 days up to 6 months in the model with no longer-term survival benefit beyond this point. The Committee considered that this may have been a conservative approach if alteplase offers a survival advantage compared with placebo beyond 6 months, a proposition the Committee found plausible, although not currently proven statistically, given that alteplase was associated with a reduction in death or dependence at 90 days. The Committee was aware that the utility values were not adjusted over time in the model, which may have overestimated the QALYs accrued by people in the independent health state and therefore biased the results in favour of alteplase. However, the Committee considered that this
