to 3-hour window, the manufacturer reported a higher risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage among patients randomised to alteplase that was not statistically significant (RR 3.94, 95% CI 0.61 to 25.47, p=0.15). 3.11 The manufacturer conducted a systematic review of published cost- effectiveness analyses but did not identify any studies that evaluated the cost effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms. Instead, the manufacturer adapted a published cost-effectiveness analysis (Sandercock et al. 2002) relevant to the decision problem from the previous guidance on alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke (NICE technology appraisal guidance 122) and used this as part of its submission. 3.12 The manufacturer developed a Markov model simulating patients with acute ischaemic stroke who do or do not receive alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were modelled through 3 possible health states: independent, dependent and dead. The independent state was defined by a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2 and the dependent state by a modified Rankin scale score of 3 to 5. The model had 3 time phases: from 0 to 6 months when the model assumed the treatment effect of alteplase
