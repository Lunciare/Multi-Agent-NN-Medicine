licensed dose of 0.9 mg/kg. Treatment with alteplase was administered within 3 hours (NINDS 1 and 2), 5 hours (ATLANTIS B) or 6 hours (ATLANTIS A, ECASS 2) of onset of stroke symptoms. Patients were followed up for outcomes for 90 days. The NINDS and ATLANTIS trials were conducted in North America and the ECASS trial in multiple sites in Europe (including the UK), Australia and New Zealand. 3.3 The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the manufacturer's submission focused on the extended 3- to 4.5-hour treatment window for which the only directly relevant trial identified by the manufacturer was ECASS 3. Other trials with data indirectly relevant to this treatment window were ATLANTIS A and B and ECASS 2, from which subgroup data specifically for the 3- to 4.5-hour window were used by the manufacturer in sensitivity analyses. The manufacturer noted that this involved stratifying data into subgroups that had not been specified before randomisation. The manufacturer also identified the third International Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) Stroke Trial (IST-3), a randomised open-label blinded endpoint trial in which alteplase was administered within 6 hours of symptom onset. However, the manufacturer commented that this trial was not placebo controlled and therefore
