Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses were similar to those for the 0- to 4.5-hour window, indicating that the ICERs were robust to changes in most input parameters, except for changes in the relative risks of death and death or dependence for treatment with alteplase. In an additional sensitivity analysis, the manufacturer pooled 3- to 4.5-hour efficacy data from the ECASS 2 and ATLANTIS trials with the ECASS 3 data. This sensitivity analysis resulted in an ICER of £5,631 per QALY gained for alteplase compared with standard care. 3.21 For the 0- to 3-hour treatment window, the manufacturer presented cost- effectiveness results similar to those presented in the previous guidance on alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke (NICE technology appraisal guidance 122); that is, alteplase dominated standard care, resulting in lower costs and more QALYs for both the deterministic and the probabilistic analyses. 3.22 The ERG considered that the clinical-effectiveness evidence submitted by the manufacturer was of good quality. The ERG noted that the patients randomised to the alteplase arm of both the NINDS trial (which provided clinical evidence for the 0- to 3-hour window) and the ECASS 3 trial had strokes that were less severe on average, which in
