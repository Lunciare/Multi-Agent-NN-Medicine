manufacturer to measure the effectiveness of alteplase from analyses that adjusted for baseline differences in potential confounding variables between the 2 treatment groups. In addition, the clinical specialists noted that the modified Rankin scale was widely used as a measure of disability in stroke patients in England and Wales. The Committee concluded that the ECASS 3 trial was of good methodological quality and provided robust evidence of the clinical efficacy of alteplase for the 3- to 4.5-hour treatment window. 4.6 The Committee considered the clinical effectiveness of alteplase for the 3- to 4.5-hour treatment window. The Committee noted that no statistically significant differences in mortality, or in the composite outcome of death or dependence, between patients randomised to alteplase or standard care were observed at 90-day follow-up. However, the Committee also noted that a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in the alteplase treatment arm achieved Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) a favourable outcome without significant disability (modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1) at 90-day follow-up. The Committee therefore concluded that alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after onset of stroke symptoms was an effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke because it decreased the probability
