decision problem defined in the scope and closely adhered to the NICE reference case requirements for economic analysis. The ERG commented that the manufacturer provided a reasonable strategy for searching Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) the literature for existing cost-effectiveness studies, although it did not explicitly state its exclusion criteria. The ERG stated that it was appropriate for the manufacturer to conduct separate analyses for patients eligible for treatment within the 0- to 3-hour window and the 3- to 4.5-hour window. The ERG noted that the utility values for the dependent and independent states did not allow for any decreases in health-related quality of life over time, which may have overestimated the lifetime QALYs accrued in the independent state. The ERG stated that, although this may have biased the QALY gains in favour of alteplase, the manufacturer's economic model was not sensitive to changes in the utility values, and so the effect of adjusting these values over time in the model was likely to be small. The ERG noted that in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the manufacturer sampled independently the relative risks for death and death or dependence associated with treatment with alteplase, which had a marked impact
