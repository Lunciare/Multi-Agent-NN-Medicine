Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

per QALY gained. 3.19 The manufacturer conducted a number of one-way sensitivity analyses on various parameters in the model, including the relative risks associated with alteplase of death or of death or dependence, the risk of recurrent stroke and mortality irrespective of previous treatment, the dose of alteplase treatment, the annual costs of care in the dependent and independent states, the cost of a fatal stroke, and the utility values. The results of these one-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the ICERs were robust to changes in most input parameters, except for the relative risks of death and death or dependence for treatment with alteplase applied in the first phase of the model. When the manufacturer used the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the relative risks of death (1.18) and death or dependence (0.92), alteplase treatment led to a very small loss in QALYs at a decreased cost compared with standard care, resulting in £44,342 saved per QALY lost. The manufacturer also conducted additional deterministic sensitivity analyses, which included different scenarios using additional clinical efficacy data from unplanned subgroup analyses of the ATLANTIS A and B and ECASS 2 trials for 3 to 4.5 hours, and weighted the
