Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

of both the NINDS trial (which provided clinical evidence for the 0- to 3-hour window) and the ECASS 3 trial had strokes that were less severe on average, which in turn may have biased the results in favour of alteplase. However, the manufacturer also presented adjusted analyses for the primary outcome (disability at 90 days) from the ECASS 3 trial. The ERG considered that the meta-analytical approach by the manufacturer was appropriate. The ERG agreed with the manufacturer that data derived from unplanned subgroup analyses from the ATLANTIS A and B and ECASS 2 trials, in which treatment with alteplase was administered up to 6 hours from onset of symptoms, should not be included in the base-case meta-analyses. The ERG also noted that heterogeneity between the studies included in the base-case meta-analyses for the 0- to 4.5-hour window for the outcomes of death and death or dependence was low and not statistically significant. 3.23 The ERG commented that the manufacturer submitted an economic model that was in line with the decision problem defined in the scope and closely adhered to the NICE reference case requirements for economic analysis. The ERG commented that the manufacturer provided a reasonable strategy for searching
