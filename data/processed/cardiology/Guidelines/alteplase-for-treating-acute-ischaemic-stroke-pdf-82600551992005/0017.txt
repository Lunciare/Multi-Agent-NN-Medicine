Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke

was 68.4 mg, resulting in a total estimated cost of £480 (£300 per 50-mg pack and £180 per 20-mg pack). Administration costs associated with alteplase of £1,316 per patient were based on estimates of extra staff time in the trial by Sandercock et al. (2002). For people in either treatment arm who had a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, the model included a one-off cost of £100 for an additional CT scan. For all health states in the model, the manufacturer applied Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) annual costs specific to the state (adjusted for inflation to 2012 to 2013 prices) adapted from a study by Youman et al. (2003), which calculated the costs of acute events and long-term stroke care. 3.18 The manufacturer's base-case deterministic cost-effectiveness analysis for the 0- to 4.5-hour window estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £2,441 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for alteplase compared with standard care (incremental costs £811; incremental QALYs 0.333). The probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in an ICER of £2,296 per QALY gained. 3.19 The manufacturer conducted a number of one-way sensitivity analyses on various parameters in the model, including the relative risks associated with alteplase of death or of
