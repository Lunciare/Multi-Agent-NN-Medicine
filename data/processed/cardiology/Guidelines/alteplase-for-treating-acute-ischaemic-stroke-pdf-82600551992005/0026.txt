from the patient experts that an important benefit of alteplase was its potential to reduce long-term disability caused by stroke, which can affect the quality of life of the patient and their families, carers and friends, and can also increase the need to adjust the patient's lifestyle and living conditions. The Committee was aware that brain imaging must be carried out to confirm the absence of intracranial bleeding before treatment with alteplase can be started. However, the Committee heard from 1 patient expert that some Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) people with acute ischaemic stroke may not have immediate access to brain- imaging facilities.

The Committee also heard from clinical specialists that Accident and Emergency departments of all acute-care hospitals in England and Wales should have access to 24-hour, 7 days a week brain-imaging facilities. The Committee recognised that patients outside the licensed indication for alteplase (under 18 years and over 80 years of age) in England and Wales may have the potential to benefit
