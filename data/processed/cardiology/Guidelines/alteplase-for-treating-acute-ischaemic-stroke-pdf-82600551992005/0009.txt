associated with alteplase for all-cause mortality within 90 days, death or dependence within 90 days, and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 10 days for each of the 3 treatment windows (0 to 3 hours, 3 to 4.5 hours, and 0 to 4.5 hours). The manufacturer presented results from both fixed and random- effects models. For the 0- to 3-hour window, the manufacturer used data from ECASS 2 and NINDS and used the relative risks from ECASS 3 for the 3- to 4.5-hour window. For the 0- to 4.5-hour window, the manufacturer used data from ECASS 2 (0 to 3 hours), ECASS 3 (3 to 4.5 hours) and NINDS (0 to 3 hours). Heterogeneity between the 3 studies was low for the outcomes of all-cause mortality and death or dependence, but moderate for the outcome of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Alteplase for treating acute ischaemic stroke (TA264) 3.10 The manufacturer compared all-cause mortality at 90 days for the 2 treatment arms. No statistically significant difference was observed between alteplase and placebo for the 3- to 4.5-hour (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.33, p=0.42), the 0- to 3-hour (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03, p=0.88) or the 0- to 4.5-hour (RR 0.89,
