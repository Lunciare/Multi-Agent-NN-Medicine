are frail and their life expectancy. (See also NICE's guideline on multimorbidity.) [December 2023] 1.7.9 If the person is taking the maximum tolerated dose and intensity of statin but the lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD is not met (see recommendation 1.7.1), consider additional lipid-lowering treatments recommended as options in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on: • alirocumab (TA393, June 2016) • evolocumab (TA394, June 2016) • ezetimibe (TA385, February 2016) • inclisiran (TA733, October 2021). See the relevant NICE technology appraisal guidance for full details. [December 2023] 1.7.10 Consider ezetimibe in addition to the maximum tolerated intensity and dose of statin to reduce CVD risk further, even if the lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD is met (see recommendation 1.7.1). [December 2023] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: escalation of lipid-lowering treatment for secondary prevention of CVD.
