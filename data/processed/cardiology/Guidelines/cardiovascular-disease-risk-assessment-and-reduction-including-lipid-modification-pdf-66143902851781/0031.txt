Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

1.12.6 Tell people that there is no evidence that omega 3 fatty acid compounds help to prevent CVD, except use of icosapent ethyl as described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with raised triglycerides (TA805, 2022). [2014] Combination treatment 1.12.7 To prevent CVD, do not offer the combination of a statin with: • a bile acid sequestrant (anion exchange resin), a fibrate or nicotinic acid or • an omega 3 fatty acid compound, except icosapent ethyl as described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with raised triglycerides (TA805, 2022). [2014, amended December 2023] Terms used in this guideline This section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline. Full lipid profile This involves taking a blood sample to measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and then calculating non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (a fasting sample is not mandated). LDL cholesterol results may not be reported in participants with triglyceride levels more than 4.5 mmol per litre or 9 mmol per litre depending on the formula
