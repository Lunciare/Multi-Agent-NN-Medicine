Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

better than QRISK2 at predicting CVD events for people with these risk factors. Use of QRISK3 should, therefore, result in more people within these groups being appropriately considered for risk reduction approaches including statin treatment. It was noted that the group of people with severe mental illness used to develop and validate QRISK3 included a high proportion of people with severe and moderate depression. This is reflected in the definition of severe mental illness in QRISK3 but does not reflect the definition used in electronic clinical systems in primary care. The committee agreed, informed by their clinical experience and expert opinion, that people with moderate to severe depression are not considered to have as great an increased risk of CVD as people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. By using data that grouped these conditions together, QRISK3 may underestimate CVD risk for people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. Despite this the committee agreed to recommend use of the tool for people with severe mental illness (however defined), but clinical judgement should inform interpretation. The committee was aware that the NHS Health Check best practice guidance states that gender should be recorded as reported by the individual. If
