Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

for full details. [December 2023] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: escalation of lipid-lowering treatment for secondary prevention of CVD. Assessing response to treatment See the section on assessing response to treatment. 1.11 Assessing response to treatment When to repeat blood tests 1.11.1 Measure liver transaminase and full lipid profile at 2 to 3 months after starting or changing lipid-lowering treatment. [May 2023, amended December 2023] 1.11.2 Measure liver transaminase at 12 months, but not again unless clinically indicated. [May 2023, amended December 2023] When to measure creatine kinase 1.11.3 Advise people who are being treated with a statin to seek medical advice if they develop unexplained muscle symptoms (pain, tenderness or weakness). If this occurs, measure creatine kinase. [May 2023] 1.11.4 If people report muscle pain, tenderness or weakness while taking a statin and have a creatine kinase level less than 5 times the upper limit of normal, reassure them that their symptoms are unlikely to be due to the
