Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

have more impact than lowering the statin treatment threshold. The 10% 10-year QRISK score was therefore retained as the threshold for offering statins. Although QRISK3 is specified in the recommendations, it is acknowledged that QRISK2 may be used in some circumstances until QRISK3 is embedded in electronic clinical systems (see the panel after recommendation 1.1.8 for details). The 10% threshold applies whether QRISK2 or 3 is used. Despite this, the committee agreed that a more person-centred approach should be adopted and recommended atorvastatin 20 mg as an option for people who want to take statins, irrespective of their QRISK3 score, or where clinical judgement suggests the person may be at high risk of CVD (for example, if the person has CVD risk factors not covered by QRISK3). How the recommendations might affect practice Most recommendations about statin treatment have been retained from the 2014 update of the guideline and so should not require a change in practice. National audit data suggests that about half of people with a QRISK score of 10% or more are on lipid-lowering treatment. It is unclear if people are not being offered treatment or if they are declining or stopping treatment. The recommendation to consider
