Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

persistent. An economic model was developed using estimates of the impact of lipid-lowering treatments on LDL cholesterol (from a network meta-analysis of the 34 RCTs), combined with estimates of the impact of LDL cholesterol reduction on major cardiovascular events (from a published meta-analysis of statin RCTs). The economic model calculated, for all possible baseline LDL cholesterol levels, the reduced admissions to hospital for stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular procedures and the associated life expectancy increases, quality of life improvements and treatment cost savings as a result of taking lipid-lowering treatments. This was offset against the cost of lipid-lowering treatments and associated monitoring costs. The data for the 2 PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab) were combined and were not analysed separately because treatment effects were found to be the same in the network meta-analysis. The model estimated the absolute LDL cholesterol target at which it was cost effective to escalate treatment for people on a high-intensity statin. The analysis explored different combinations of lipid-lowering treatments. Escalation of treatment was cost effective for people on statins with LDL cholesterol levels of more than 2.2 mmol per litre. There was a little more uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of escalating treatment for people
