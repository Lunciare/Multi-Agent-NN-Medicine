Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

for secondary prevention of CVD will lead to an increased use of lipid-lowering treatments. The committee was aware that NHS England had recently introduced a target as part of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). The target recommended in this guideline is similar to the 2023/24 QOF, although data showed that, in many people, the QOF target is not being met. In June 2023, the CVDPREVENT audit reported that 28.7% were meeting the target. Increased uptake of statins, ezetimibe and other lipid-lowering treatments will result in higher medication and monitoring costs to the NHS. It will also contribute to an increased workload in primary care, including for GP practices and pharmacies, and in laboratories that process lipid profile and liver function tests. The committee agreed that increased uptake of lipid-lowering treatments is necessary for an overall improvement in population health, but that the extra cost of lipid-lowering treatment would be partly offset by savings due to a reduction in CVD events (including hospital admissions for stroke, heart disease and cardiovascular procedures).
