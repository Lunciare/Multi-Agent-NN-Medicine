Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

for people on statins with LDL cholesterol levels of more than 2.2 mmol per litre. There was a little more uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of escalating treatment for people with LDL cholesterol levels between 2.0 mmol and 2.2 mmol per litre. An LDL cholesterol target of 1.8 mmol per litre was not cost effective. The committee decided that 2.0 mmol per litre was likely to be cost effective and would allow more people to be treated than 2.2 mmol per litre. Even though the main economic analysis was based on the impact of lipid-lowering treatment on LDL cholesterol levels, the committee recognised the need to identify a non- HDL cholesterol target for use when LDL cholesterol levels have not been requested or calculated. Using the distribution of LDL cholesterol levels for the population with CVD and on a statin in the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) dataset, 42% of people had LDL cholesterol levels of 2.0 mmol per litre or more. Using the same data, the threshold for non-HDL cholesterol that would produce an identical number of people being escalated for treatment was 2.6 mmol per litre. An alternative approach would be to use the Friedewald equation and insert
