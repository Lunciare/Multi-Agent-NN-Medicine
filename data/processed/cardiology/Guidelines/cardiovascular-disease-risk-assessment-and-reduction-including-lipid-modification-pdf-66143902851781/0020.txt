practice measurement frameworks, including those underpinned with financial incentives: IND278: The percentage of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL cholesterol level (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 2.0 mmol per litre or less for LDL cholesterol or 2.6 mmol per litre or less for non-HDL cholesterol. Initial treatment 1.7.2 Offer atorvastatin 80 mg to people with CVD, whatever their cholesterol level, unless the person meets the criteria in recommendation 1.7.3. [May 2023, amended December 2023] 1.7.3 Offer a lower dose of atorvastatin if any of the following apply: • it could react with other drugs • there is a high risk of adverse effects • the person would prefer to take a lower dose. [May 2023, amended December 2023] In December 2023, this was an off-label use of atorvastatin.

[May 2023, amended December 2023] 1.7.5 If a person has acute coronary syndrome, do not delay statin treatment. Measure full lipid profile on admission and at 2 to 3 months after starting treatment.
