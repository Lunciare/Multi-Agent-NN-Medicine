Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

much as possible in people with CVD. However, people respond differently to statins and other lipid-lowering treatments, and it is not cost effective to offer the full range of treatments to everyone with CVD. The clinical evidence consisted of 34 randomised control trials (RCTs). Clinically significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo were seen for all 4 lipid-lowering treatments covered by the clinical trials: alirocumab, evolocumab, ezetimibe and inclisiran. The majority of people in the trials were also taking statins. Modest reductions in major CVD events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and related deaths were also seen for all 4 medicines. The committee recognised that some of the trials involved short follow-up periods of 1 year or less, so these medicines are likely to have a bigger impact on CVD events over the long term. There was no clinically important increased risk of adverse events. Injection site reactions were more frequent with alirocumab, evolocumab and inclisiran than with placebo but these were mild and not persistent. An economic model was developed using estimates of the impact of lipid-lowering treatments on LDL cholesterol (from a network meta-analysis of the 34 RCTs), combined with estimates of the
