Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

Cardioprotective diet Recommendation 1.3.2 Why the committee made the recommendation There was no available evidence comparing the effectiveness of dietary cholesterol strategies with normal diets for adults with and without CVD, so the committee updated the 2014 recommendation based on their clinical experience and expert opinion. They removed the reference to restricting dietary cholesterol intake. Only evidence on dietary cholesterol was in scope for review and therefore the guidance on total fat intake and proportion of saturated fat versus unsaturated fat was not changed. How the recommendation might affect practice The committee agreed healthcare professionals already better understand the lack of a relationship between dietary cholesterol and CVD risk, so the new recommendation reflects current practice. The committee agreed there should be no change in practice or resource impact to the NHS because of this updated recommendation. Return to recommendation Discussions and assessment before starting statins Recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.7 Why the committee made the recommendations New evidence on adverse effects while on statins supported the 2014 recommendation. Evidence on the risk of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with statin use demonstrated a real effect, but the large body of evidence showed this was a very small increased risk when compared
