Return to recommendation 1.7.1 Return to recommendations 1.7.7 to 1.7.10 Return to recommendations 1.10.3 and 1.10.4 Assessing response to treatment Recommendations 1.11.1 to 1.11.12 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee agreed that more flexibility in the timing of blood tests to measure lipid levels after starting high-intensity statins was reflective of actual clinical practice and recommended a timeframe of 2 to 3 months, rather than at 3 months of treatment as recommended in the 2014 guideline. They also recommended blood tests should be done 2 to 3 months after changing treatment. They agreed that blood tests should provide a full lipid profile and that LDL cholesterol levels can be calculated rather than measured directly. They recommended that a full lipid profile should be done to inform annual medication reviews about secondary prevention of CVD, and considered for reviews about primary prevention of CVD. These changes were also applied to the recommendations on baseline blood tests before starting statins and statin treatment after an acute coronary syndrome. The evidence supported the 2008 and 2014 recommendations on when to measure creatine kinase, not stopping statins because of an increase in blood glucose or HbA1c and restarting statins if stopped
