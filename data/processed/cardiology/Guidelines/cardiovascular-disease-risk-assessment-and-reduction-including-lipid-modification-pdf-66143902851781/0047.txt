Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

of 10% or more are on lipid-lowering treatment. It is unclear if people are not being offered treatment or if they are declining or stopping treatment. The recommendation to consider starting atorvastatin 20 mg for people with QRISK3 scores less than 10% is a change in practice. The impact on medication and monitoring costs and workload will depend on the level of uptake. For details of the impact of an increase in statin use, see the impact section on lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD. Return to recommendations Statins for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease Recommendations 1.7.2 to 1.7.5 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence on both the effectiveness and adverse effects of statins showed high-intensity statins are clinically effective and cost effective compared to no statins, low-intensity statins, or medium-intensity statins for preventing CVD in people with CVD. The evidence supported the 2014 recommendations on initial treatment with statins and so they were retained. The recommendation on acute coronary syndromes was amended to clarify that a full lipid profile is needed on admission to hospital and 2 to 3 months after starting treatment. See the section on assessing response to treatment for further details. How the recommendations
