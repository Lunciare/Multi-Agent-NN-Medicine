could not be reliably assessed. However, the committee noted that the usefulness of lifetime risk tools is primarily in communicating risk. They agreed by consensus that lifetime risk tools should be considered to help inform discussions about risk and motivate lifestyle changes. The committee highlighted that these tools may underestimate the ongoing benefit of lipid- lowering treatments as they do not predict risk reduction from taking medicines, and noted this should be considered when interpreting the results. They agreed lifetime risk calculation would not be necessary for everyone, but it may be particularly useful for people with a QRISK3 score less than 10% or under 40s who have CVD risk factors. How the recommendation might affect practice Lifetime risk tools are not routinely used in current clinical practice. The committee noted that there may be resource implications for calculating lifetime risk score estimates because lifetime risk tools are not currently embedded into electronic clinical systems, so scores are not automatically generated. There may also be implementation costs related to educating healthcare professionals about lifetime risk calculators. It is not clear if use of lifetime risk tools will result in longer consultations. The committee agreed that the online calculators for lifetime
