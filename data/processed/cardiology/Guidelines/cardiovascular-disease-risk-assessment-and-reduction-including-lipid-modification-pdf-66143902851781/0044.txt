Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

as discussions on adverse effects are already an important part of current practice in prescribing and monitoring statins. Return to recommendations Lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease Recommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.12 Why the committee made the recommendations Evidence on both the effectiveness and adverse effects of statins showed high-intensity statins are clinically effective and cost effective compared to no statins, low-intensity statins, or medium-intensity statins for preventing CVD in people without CVD. The committee agreed to retain 20 mg as the recommended starting dose for all people starting atorvastatin for primary prevention of CVD. Although there was committee consensus that higher doses have a greater effect, they agreed that starting at the lowest effective dose was likely to be preferable to people, but that up-titration of the dose should be considered as appropriate, following recommendation 1.9.1. The evidence supported the 2014 recommendations on optimising lifestyle changes and treating comorbidities and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia before starting statins, so they were retained. The committee agreed to retain the following recommendations for research because there is still a lack of direct evidence in these areas: • statin treatment for older people • lipid-lowering treatment for people with type 1 diabetes.
