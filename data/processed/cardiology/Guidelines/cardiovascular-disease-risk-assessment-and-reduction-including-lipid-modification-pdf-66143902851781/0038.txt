not incorrectly considered to be at low risk. The 2014 recommendation to consider people aged 85 and older to be at increased risk of CVD was retained as the committee agreed with this statement and there are still no tools for this age group. The committee highlighted it is important that this group be considered for interventions to prevent CVD even though a formal risk assessment would not be carried out. The evidence for lifetime risk tools was not considered sufficient to recommend their use instead of 10-year risk tools. However, the committee agreed they can have value in communication of risk. See the section on communication about risk assessment, lifestyle changes and treatment. How the recommendations might affect practice QRISK2 is currently integrated into electronic clinical systems, so 10-year CVD risk assessments can be generated using data already available in a person's electronic records. At the time of development, the committee was aware of ongoing discussions about continuation of the inclusion of QRISK in electronic clinical systems. Using QRISK3 instead of QRISK2 will require clinical systems to be updated by software developers for the impact on practice to be minimised. Public Health England issued guidance in August 2021 on
