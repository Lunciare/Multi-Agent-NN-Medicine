Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

recommendations for research because there is still a lack of direct evidence in these areas: • statin treatment for older people • lipid-lowering treatment for people with type 1 diabetes. Statins and QRISK score Evidence showed that statins are cost effective for people with 10-year CVD risk scores less than 10%. The committee agreed that if more people took statins there would be a greater reduction in CVD events. However, they also recognised that practical considerations needed to be taken into account. They agreed that risk scores are an important aid to shared decision making on statins. National audit data (CVDPREVENT) suggests that 60% of people without CVD and a QRISK score of 20% or more are prescribed lipid-lowering treatment, compared with 50% for people with scores of 10% or more. Therefore, the committee consensus was that an even smaller proportion of people with scores less than 10% may choose to take statins. The committee agreed that focusing on increasing uptake among people with the most potential to benefit would have more impact than lowering the statin treatment threshold. The 10% 10-year QRISK score was therefore retained as the threshold for offering statins. Although QRISK3 is specified in the recommendations,
