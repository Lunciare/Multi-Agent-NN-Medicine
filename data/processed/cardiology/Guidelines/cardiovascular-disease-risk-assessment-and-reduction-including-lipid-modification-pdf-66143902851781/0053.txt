increasing medication should be taken into account. These should be considered and fully discussed with the person as part of informed shared decision making. Furthermore, the committee agreed that adherence may be lower for people on 2 pills rather than 1, especially if they are below the target. Statins are contraindicated or not tolerated The committee did not review the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of lipid-lowering treatments in people who are statin intolerant or for whom statins are contraindicated but based their recommendations on NICE's technology appraisal guidance on alirocumab, bempedoic acid, evolocumab, ezetimibe and inclisiran. The committee emphasised that statin treatment is known to be the most effective method of reducing the risk of CVD events and that this should be the main treatment for most people. They highlighted the importance of reviewing statin medication in response to adverse effects before deciding someone is statin intolerant. An economic analysis estimated the absolute LDL cholesterol target at which it was cost effective to escalate treatment for people on ezetimibe who are statin intolerant. The analysis explored different combinations of lipid-lowering treatments. The committee discussed whether the lipid target should be different because of the different treatment options and associated
