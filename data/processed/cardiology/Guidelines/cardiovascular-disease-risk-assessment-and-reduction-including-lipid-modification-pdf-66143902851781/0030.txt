diabetes and CKD. They do not apply to people with familial hypercholesterolaemia. For guidance on using fibrates, bile acid sequestrants and combination treatment for this population group, follow the recommendations on drug treatment in NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia. Adherence to statin treatment 1.12.1 Do not offer coenzyme Q10 or vitamin D to increase adherence to statin treatment. [2014] Fibrates 1.12.2 Do not routinely offer fibrates to prevent CVD. [2014, amended December 2023] Nicotinic acid 1.12.3 Do not offer nicotinic acid (niacin) to prevent CVD. [2014, amended December 2023] Bile acid sequestrants (anion exchange resins) 1.12.4 Do not offer a bile acid sequestrant (anion exchange resin) to prevent CVD. [2014, amended December 2023] Omega 3 fatty acid compounds 1.12.5 Do not offer omega 3 fatty acid compounds to prevent CVD. Icosapent ethyl is an exception to this if used as described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on icosapent ethyl with statin therapy for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with raised triglycerides (TA805, 2022). [2014, amended December 2023] 1.12.6 Tell people that there is no evidence that omega 3 fatty acid compounds help to prevent CVD, except use of icosapent ethyl as described in NICE's technology appraisal guidance
