who are statin intolerant. The analysis explored different combinations of lipid-lowering treatments. The committee discussed whether the lipid target should be different because of the different treatment options and associated costs. However, it was noted that this may introduce inequality regarding access to lipid-lowering treatment. Also, the target at which escalation of lipid-lowering treatment is cost effective did not change when the statin intolerant population was included in the economic model alongside the statin tolerant population, largely because the prevalence of statin intolerance is relatively low. Therefore, the committee agreed that the target for people who cannot take statins should be the same as for those who can take them. They recommended offering ezetimibe to people who cannot take statins (in line with NICE's technology appraisal guidance on ezetimibe) and, if this does not achieve the lipid target in this guideline, to offer alternative or additional lipid-lowering treatments (in line with other technology appraisal guidance). How the recommendations might affect practice It is expected that recommending a specific lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD will lead to an increased use of lipid-lowering treatments. The committee was aware that NHS England had recently introduced a target as part of the
