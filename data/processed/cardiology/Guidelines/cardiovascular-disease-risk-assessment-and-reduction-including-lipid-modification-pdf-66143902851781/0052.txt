Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

cholesterol that would produce an identical number of people being escalated for treatment was 2.6 mmol per litre. An alternative approach would be to use the Friedewald equation and insert the mean triglyceride level of 1.4 mmol per litre along with the LDL cholesterol of 2.0 mmol per litre. This approach also indicates a non-HDL cholesterol target of 2.6 mmol per litre. Both target measures are slightly higher than other national and international targets because, unlike other targets, the LDL cholesterol target is based on the cost effectiveness of treatment escalation. However, the committee thought it was sufficiently similar and, because it was more affordable, was more likely to be implemented. Statin plus ezetimibe In a separate analysis, escalation with statin plus ezetimibe (but no injectable treatment) was evaluated at different LDL cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe was cost effective regardless of LDL cholesterol, so the committee agreed that it could be considered for people with lipid levels below the agreed target. They noted that the trade-off between further reducing risk and increasing medication should be taken into account. These should be considered and fully discussed with the person as part of informed shared decision making. Furthermore, the committee agreed that adherence
