the guidance on ezetimibe (TA385, 2016). 1.7 Lipid-lowering treatment for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease These recommendations apply to people with and without type 1 and 2 diabetes. Also see the sections on optimising statin treatment and assessing response to treatment. Lipid target for people taking lipid-lowering treatments 1.7.1 For secondary prevention of CVD, aim for LDL cholesterol levels of 2.0 mmol per litre or less, or non-HDL cholesterol levels of 2.6 mmol per litre or less. [December 2023] For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on lipid target for secondary prevention of CVD. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D: escalation of lipid-lowering treatment for secondary prevention of CVD. As part of the December 2023 update, a new NICE indicator was developed to support quality improvement in managing cholesterol levels for people with CVD. This NICE indicator is suitable for inclusion in local and national general practice measurement frameworks, including those underpinned with financial incentives: IND278: The percentage of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in whom the last recorded LDL or non-HDL cholesterol level (measured in
