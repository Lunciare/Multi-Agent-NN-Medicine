Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

amended December 2023] 1.5.6 Do not routinely exclude from statin treatment people who have liver transaminase levels that are raised but are less than 3 times the upper limit of normal. [May 2023] 1.5.7 Before offering a statin, ask the person if they have had persistent generalised unexplained muscle symptoms (pain, tenderness or weakness), whether associated or not with previous lipid-lowering treatment. If they have, measure creatine kinase levels. If creatine kinase levels are: • more than 5 times the upper limit of normal, re-measure creatine kinase after 7 days; if creatine kinase levels are still 5 times the upper limit of normal, do not start statin treatment (see the section on treatment if statins are contraindicated or not tolerated) • raised but less than 5 times the upper limit of normal, start statin treatment at a lower dose. [May 2023] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on discussions and assessment before starting statins. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: statins: efficacy and adverse effects. Choice of drug based on clinical trials 1.5.8 Be aware
