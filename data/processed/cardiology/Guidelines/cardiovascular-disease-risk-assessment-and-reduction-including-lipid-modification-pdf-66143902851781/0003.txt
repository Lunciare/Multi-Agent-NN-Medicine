Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

between 25 and 84 without CVD. [May 2023] 1.1.8 Use the QRISK3 tool for people with type 2 diabetes aged between 25 and 84. [May 2023] Until electronic clinical systems in which QRISK2 is embedded are updated with QRISK3, it may be necessary to use QRISK2. When assessing risk for people taking corticosteroids or atypical antipsychotics or people with systemic lupus erythematosus, migraine, severe mental illness or erectile dysfunction, use QRISK3 because QRISK2 does not take these risk factors into account and may underestimate the 10-year CVD risk in these populations. 1.1.9 Do not use a risk assessment tool for people who are at high risk of CVD, including people with: • type 1 diabetes (see the section on primary prevention of CVD for people with type 1 diabetes) • an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria (see the section on primary and secondary prevention of CVD for people with chronic kidney disease [CKD]) • familial hypercholesterolaemia (see NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia) or other inherited disorders of lipid metabolism. [May 2023] 1.1.10 Recognise that CVD risk tools may underestimate risk in certain groups of people, including but not limited to:
