prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care, use a systematic strategy to identify people who are likely to be at high risk of CVD. [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.2 Prioritise people based on an estimate of their CVD risk before doing a full formal risk assessment. Estimate their CVD risk using CVD risk factors already recorded in primary care electronic medical records. [2008] 1.1.3 Review estimates of CVD risk on an ongoing basis for people over 40. [2008] 1.1.4 Prioritise people for a full formal risk assessment if their estimated 10-year risk of CVD is 10% or more. [2008, amended 2014] 1.1.5 Discuss the process of risk assessment with the person identified as being at risk, including the option of declining any formal risk assessment. [2008] 1.1.6 Do not use opportunistic assessment as the main strategy in primary care to identify CVD risk in unselected people. [2008] Full formal risk assessment 1.1.7 Use the QRISK3 tool to calculate the estimated CVD risk within the next 10 years for people aged between 25 and 84 without CVD. [May 2023] 1.1.8 Use the QRISK3 tool for people with type 2 diabetes aged between 25 and 84. [May 2023] Until electronic clinical systems
