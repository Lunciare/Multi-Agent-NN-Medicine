Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

the risk of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with statin use demonstrated a real effect, but the large body of evidence showed this was a very small increased risk when compared with similar populations not on statins; that is, when using high-intensity statins approximately 16% of people reported experiencing muscle pain, but of these cases only around 1 in 12 were likely to be due to the statin. The committee agreed to strengthen the recommendation to reassure people that the risk of these adverse effects occurring is low. The evidence supported the other 2014 recommendations, so they were retained. The committee agreed a full lipid profile should be provided before starting statins and amended the recommendation on lipid measures accordingly. See the section on assessing response to treatment for further details. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendation on adverse effects has been strengthened to emphasise the low risk of experiencing severe muscle adverse effects because of statin treatment. It is not expected to have an impact on resource use as discussions on adverse effects are already an important part of current practice in prescribing and monitoring statins.
