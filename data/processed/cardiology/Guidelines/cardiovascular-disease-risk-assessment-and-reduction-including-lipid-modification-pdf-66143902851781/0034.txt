Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification

research, see the rationale section on lipid-lowering treatment for primary prevention of CVD. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C: statins: efficacy and adverse effects. Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Full formal risk assessment Recommendations 1.1.7 to 1.1.11 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee agreed that the evidence suggested QRISK3 performed best among tools evaluated in a UK population to assess the risk of a person without established CVD having a CVD event within the next 10 years. They agreed that no tool is very good at accurately discriminating between who will and who will not have a CVD event, but that tools are useful for guiding decisions about interventions to prevent CVD based on estimated risk. A small amount of evidence suggested that the additional fields included in QRISK3 (such as severe mental illness, regular corticosteroid use and atypical antipsychotic use) enabled the tool to perform better than QRISK2 at predicting CVD events for people with these risk factors. Use of QRISK3 should, therefore, result in more people within these groups being appropriately considered for risk
