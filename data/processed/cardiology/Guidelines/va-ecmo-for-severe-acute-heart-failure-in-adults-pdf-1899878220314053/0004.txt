VA ECMO for severe acute heart failure in adults

its causes, so recovery is more likely in some people, such as people with reversible causes. Evidence suggests that VA ECMO improves survival in these people while they recover, or before they have a heart transplant or an implanted LVAD. For people with a low or uncertain chance of functional recovery who cannot have a heart transplant or an implanted LVAD, clinical trial evidence suggests that there is no benefit from VA ECMO. This may be because of the cause of their severe acute heart failure or because of their comorbidities. For this group, more research is needed on who might benefit from VA ECMO, so it should only be used in research. 2 Information about the procedure 2.1 Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) can be used for adults with severe acute heart failure as a bridge to recovery, or to having a heart transplant or an implanted left ventricular assist device. 2.2 In VA ECMO, blood is taken from the venous system (usually from the femoral vein or directly from the right atrium) and pumped through an oxygenator, where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. It is then returned to the arterial system, usually through the femoral or
