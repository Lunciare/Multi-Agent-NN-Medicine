VA ECMO for severe acute heart failure in adults

uncommon but rates are increasing, particularly in the postpartum period. Current practice 3.2 NICE has published recommendations on diagnosing and managing acute heart failure (see NICE's guideline on acute heart failure: diagnosis and management). Acute heart failure includes sudden significant deterioration in people with known cardiac dysfunction or the new onset of symptoms in people without previous cardiac dysfunction. Treatment involves medicines, including diuretics and inotropes, and invasive treatments such as: • electrophysiological interventions such as pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators • revascularisation procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention, valve replacement or repair • temporary use of intra-aortic balloon pumps or ventricular assist devices. Most acute heart failure can be managed with conventional treatment. Only a few people with severe acute heart failure will need venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). Unmet need 3.3 VA ECMO is a form of extracorporeal life support. It provides cardiac and respiratory support for people with severe acute heart failure that has not responded to other forms of treatment. VA ECMO is used when people have the potential to recover, or as a bridge to having a heart transplant or an implanted left ventricular assist device. Unlike a heart–lung (cardiopulmonary) bypass machine, it tends to
