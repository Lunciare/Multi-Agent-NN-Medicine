1 Recommendations As a bridge to recovery, heart transplant or implanted LVAD 1.1 Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) can be used as an option for severe acute heart failure in adults as a bridge to recovery, a heart transplant or an implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD). When the potential for functional recovery is low or uncertain, and a heart transplant or implanted LVAD is unsuitable 1.2 More research is needed on VA ECMO for severe acute heart failure in adults when the potential for functional recovery is low or uncertain, and a heart transplant or an implanted LVAD is unsuitable, before it can be used in the NHS. 1.3 This procedure should only be done as part of formal research and an NHS research ethics committee needs to have approved its use.
