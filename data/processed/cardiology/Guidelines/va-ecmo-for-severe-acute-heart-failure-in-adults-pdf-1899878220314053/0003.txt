VA ECMO for severe acute heart failure in adults

Healthcare professionals are also encouraged to enter data into the cardiogenic shock module in the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre Case Mix Programme. Who should be involved in the procedure Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary team. The procedure could be done in centres specialising in managing severe acute heart failure and by healthcare professionals with specific training in this procedure.
