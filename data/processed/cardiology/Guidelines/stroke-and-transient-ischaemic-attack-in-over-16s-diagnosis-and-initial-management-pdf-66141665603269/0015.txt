Stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s: diagnosis and initial management

220 mmHg. [2022] 1.5.5 Taking into account the risk of harm, consider rapid blood pressure lowering on a case-by-case basis for people with acute intracerebral haemorrhage who do not have any of the exclusions listed in recommendation 1.5.7 and who: • present beyond 6 hours of symptom onset or • have a systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mmHg. [2022] 1.5.6 When rapidly lowering blood pressure in people with acute intracerebral haemorrhage, aim to reach a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or lower while ensuring that the magnitude drop does not exceed 60 mmHg within 1 hour of starting treatment. [2022] 1.5.7 Do not offer rapid blood pressure lowering to people who: • have an underlying structural cause (for example, tumour, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm) • have a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of below 6 • are going to have early neurosurgery to evacuate the haematoma • have a massive haematoma with a poor expected prognosis. [2019] 1.5.8 When considering blood pressure lowering in young people aged 16 or 17 with acute intracerebral haemorrhage who do not have any of the exclusions listed in recommendation 1.5.7, seek advice from a paediatric specialist.
