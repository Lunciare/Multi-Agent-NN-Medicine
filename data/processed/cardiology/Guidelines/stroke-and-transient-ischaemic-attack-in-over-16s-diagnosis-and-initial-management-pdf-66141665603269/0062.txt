Stroke and transient ischaemic attack in over 16s: diagnosis and initial management

stroke care in the NHS is also highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan, the National Stroke Programme, the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party national clinical guideline for stroke, and the 2018 publication of NHS England's clinical commissioning policy for mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke in the NHS. Also, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health published guidelines in 2017 on the treatment of stroke in those under 18 years old. This guideline covers people over 16 with suspected or confirmed TIAs or completed strokes, that is, an acute neurological event presumed to be vascular in origin and causing cerebral ischaemia, cerebral infarction or cerebral haemorrhage. This includes first and recurrent events, thrombotic and embolic events and primary intracerebral haemorrhage of any cause, including venous thrombosis. Areas that are not covered include specific issues relating to the general management of underlying conditions and subarachnoid haemorrhage.
