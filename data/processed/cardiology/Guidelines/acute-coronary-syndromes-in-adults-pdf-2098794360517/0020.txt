measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with acute STEMI who present within 12 hours of onset of symptoms have primary PCI, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given. Data source: Local data collection. b) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with acute STEMI have access to primary PCI 24 hours a day. Data source: Local data collection. c) Evidence that commissioners with their services providers have developed a single care pathway for coronary reperfusion. Data source: Local data collection. Process a) Proportion of adults with acute STEMI who present within 12 hours of onset of symptoms who receive primary PCI within 120 minutes of when fibrinolysis could have been given. Numerator – the number in the denominator receiving primary PCI within 120 minutes of when fibrinolysis could have been given. Denominator – the number of adults with acute STEMI who present within 12 hours of onset of symptoms. Data
