Rationale In people with an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, coronary angiography to define the extent and severity of coronary disease, done within 72 hours of admission to hospital, offers advantages over an initial conservative strategy, provided there are no contraindications to angiography (such as active bleeding or comorbidity). Services should provide coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) as soon as it offers net clinical benefits; within 72 hours and sooner if possible. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the
