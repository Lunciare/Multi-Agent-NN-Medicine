KEYWORDS: coronary, adults, unstable, pci, acute, risk, angiography, statement, quality, coronary angiography, data, hours, events, unstable angina, angina

conditions called NSTEMI and unstable angina have their risk of another heart attack estimated to guide their treatment. Source guidance Acute coronary syndromes. NICE guideline NG185 (2020), recommendations 1.2.7 and 1.2.10 Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Assessment for risk of future adverse cardiovascular events Individual risk of future adverse cardiovascular events should be formally assessed using an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality (for example, Global Registry of Acute Cardiac Events [GRACE]). The formal risk assessment should include: • a full clinical history (including age, previous myocardial infarction and previous percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) • a physical examination (including measurement of blood pressure and heart rate) • resting 12-lead ECG (looking particularly for dynamic or unstable patterns that indicate myocardial ischaemia) • blood tests (such as troponin I or T, creatinine, glucose and haemoglobin). [NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes, recommendations 1.2.7 and 1.2.8] Categories for risk of future adverse cardiovascular events Table 1 Categories for the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events using 6-month mortality Predicted 6-month mortality Risk of future adverse cardiovascular events 1.5% or below Lowest >1.5% to 3.0% Low >3.0% to 6.0% Intermediate >6.0% to 9.0% High
