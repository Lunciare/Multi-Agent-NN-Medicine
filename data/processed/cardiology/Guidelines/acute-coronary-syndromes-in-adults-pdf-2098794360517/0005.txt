Acute coronary syndromes in adults

1 of the following: • symptoms of ischaemia • new or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave changes or new left bundle branch block • pathological Q wave changes in the ECG • imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality • identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography. [NICE's guideline on recent-onset chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, recommendation 1.2.6.1] Equality and diversity considerations Symptoms of acute coronary syndromes should be assessed in the same way in men and women and among people from different ethnic groups. Quality statement 2: Risk assessment for adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina Quality statement Adults with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina are assessed for their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events using an established risk scoring system that predicts 6-month mortality to guide clinical management. Rationale Assessing and categorising risk of future adverse cardiovascular events by formal risk assessment (for example, using the GRACE scoring system) in people who have been diagnosed with NSTEMI or unstable angina is important for determining early management strategies. It also allows the benefits of treatment to be balanced against the risks of treatment-related adverse events. Failure to categorise future
