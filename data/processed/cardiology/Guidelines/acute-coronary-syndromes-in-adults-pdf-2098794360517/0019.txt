Acute coronary syndromes in adults

PCI for acute STEMI Quality statement Adults with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present within 12 hours of onset of symptoms have primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy, as soon as possible but within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given. Rationale Primary PCI is a form of reperfusion therapy which should be done as soon as possible. This is because heart muscle starts to be lost once a coronary artery is blocked and the sooner reperfusion therapy is delivered the better the outcome for the patient. If too much time elapses the benefits of primary PCI may be lost. Because of the difficulty in timely delivery, in some areas primary PCI is no longer the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy over fibrinolysis. However, when performed early, primary PCI is more effective. To ensure the best outcomes for adults with STEMI, the ambulance service and hospitals delivering primary PCI should work together to minimise delays in treatment.
