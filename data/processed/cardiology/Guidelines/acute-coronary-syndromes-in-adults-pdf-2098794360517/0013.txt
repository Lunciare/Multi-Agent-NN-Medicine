Acute coronary syndromes in adults

within 24 hours of becoming clinically unstable. Rationale Coronary angiography is important to define the extent and severity of coronary disease. The benefits of an early invasive strategy appear to be greatest in people at higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events. In people with NSTEMI or unstable angina who are clinically unstable, coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) should be done as soon as possible so that appropriate treatment can be given. It may reduce lengthy hospital stays and prevent further cardiovascular events in both the short and long term. The timing of coronary angiography will be different for each person, but should be within 24 hours of becoming clinically unstable. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Structure Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with NSTEMI or unstable angina who are clinically unstable have coronary angiography (with follow-on PCI if indicated) as soon as possible, but within 24 hours of becoming clinically unstable. Data source: Local data collection. Process a) Length of time taken
