Venous thromboembolism in adults (QS201)
Quality statement 1: Timing of
pharmacological venous
thromboembolism prophylaxis
Quality statement
People aged 16 and over who are in hospital and assessed as needing pharmacological
venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis start it as soon as possible and within
14 hours of hospital admission. [2010, updated 2021]
Rationale
VTE risk assessments are carried out for most people admitted to hospital, but the results
are not always acted on promptly, meaning that pharmacological prophylaxis can be
delayed and the risk of hospital-acquired thrombosis increased. Ensuring that prophylaxis
is started as soon as possible and within 14 hours of hospital admission for medical,
surgical and trauma patients will reduce the chance of VTE.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of arrangements to ensure that people aged 16 and over who are in hospital and
assessed as needing pharmacological VTE prophylaxis start it as soon as possible and
within 14 hours of hospital admission.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary care services) ensure that written clinical protocols are in
place so that people aged 16 and over who are in hospital and assessed as needing
pharmacological VTE prophylaxis start it as soon as possible and within 14 hours of
hospital admission. They also have clinical protocols on considering an adjusted dose of
low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for people who are at extremes of body weight or
have impaired renal function. They ensure that they have healthcare professionals
available to carry out the assessment and prescribing systems designed to start VTE
prophylaxis within this timeframe.
Healthcare professionals (such as pharmacists, advanced nurse practitioners and
doctors) prescribe pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to people aged 16 and over who are
in hospital and assessed as needing pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. They discuss the
medicine with the person and involve them in making decisions about it, and give them

verbal and written information on the importance of using pharmacological VTE
prophylaxis correctly and possible side effects. They make sure that the person starts
treatment as soon as possible and within 14 hours of hospital admission. For people at
extremes of body weight or with impaired renal function, they consider adjusting the dose
of LMWH in line with the summary of product characteristics and locally agreed protocols.
Commissioners ensure that services have written clinical protocols in place for people in
hospital who are assessed as needing pharmacological VTE prophylaxis to start it as soon
as possible and within 14 hours of hospital admission. They also ensure they have clinical
protocols on considering an adjusted dose of LMWH for people who are at extremes of
body weight or have impaired renal function. They ensure that services have healthcare
professionals available to carry out the assessment and prescribing systems designed to
start VTE prophylaxis within this timeframe.
Peopleaged 16 and over who are in hospital and who need medicine to prevent blood
clots start taking the medicine within 14 hours of being admitted to hospital. People who
have a very low or high body weight or whose kidney function is impaired have the dose of
medicine they are given adjusted. They discuss the medicine with a healthcare
professional and make decisions about taking it. Their healthcare professional explains and
gives them written information about how to use the medicine and any possible side
effects.

Hospital admission
Admission as an inpatient, where a bed is provided for 1 or more nights, or admission as a
day patient, where a bed is provided for a procedure including surgery or chemotherapy
but not for an overnight stay. [NICE's guideline on venous thromboembolism in over 16s,
terms used in this guideline]
Equality and diversity considerations
The supporting information for this statement highlights that people should be given
verbal and written information on using VTE prophylaxis correctly and the possible side
effects. Information should be in a format that suits their needs and preferences. It should
be accessible to people who do not speak or read English, and it should be culturally
appropriate and age appropriate. For people with additional needs related to a disability,
impairment or sensory loss, information should also be provided as set out in NHS
England's Accessible Information Standard or the equivalent standards for the devolved
nations.
Heparins are a type of pharmacological prophylaxis used to prevent VTE. They are of
animal origin and this may be of concern to some people because of religious or ethical
beliefs. The suitability, advantages and disadvantages of alternatives to heparin should be
discussed with the person.

Venous thromboembolism in adults (QS201)
Quality statement 2: Venous
thromboembolism risk assessment for
people with lower limb immobilisation
Quality statement
People aged 16 and over who are discharged with lower limb immobilisation are assessed
to identify their risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). [new 2021]
Rationale
A significant number of people are discharged after hospital treatment for trauma or
orthopaedic surgery with temporary lower limb immobilisation. These people may have an
increased risk of VTE, but may not have their VTE risk assessed if they are treated in the
emergency department or as outpatients. Ensuring that they have a risk assessment will
enable them to have VTE prophylaxis if needed and reduce their risk of VTE and mortality.
It is also an opportunity to explain the risks of VTE from immobilisation to them.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary care services, such as orthopaedic departments, fracture
clinics and emergency departments) ensure that written clinical protocols are in place so
that people aged 16 and over who are discharged with lower limb immobilisation are
assessed to identify their risk of VTE and to decide whether they need pharmacological
VTE prophylaxis. They also have protocols on giving verbal and written information to
people and their family members or carers about the signs and symptoms of VTE, how to
reduce their risk of VTE and how to seek help if VTE is suspected, as well as the benefits
and possible side effects of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis.

People aged 16 and over who have a limb that is affected in a way that means they are
unable to bear weight on it when they are sent home from hospital (for example, with a
leg in a plaster cast or splint) have an assessment to check whether they need to take
medicine temporarily (until they can move their leg normally again) to prevent a blood clot
developing. They discuss the result of the assessment with a healthcare professional and
make decisions about taking the medicine if it is needed. Their healthcare professional
explains and gives them written information about the signs and symptoms of blood clots,
how to reduce their risk of getting a blood clot and what to do if they think they have one,
as well as the benefits and possible side effects of medicine to prevent blood clots.

Quality statement 3: Proximal leg vein
ultrasound scan for a 'likely' deep vein
thrombosis Wells score
Quality statement
People aged 18 and over with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Wells score of 2 points or
more have a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan within 4 hours of it being requested. [2013,
updated 2021]
Rationale
People aged 18 and over with a suspected DVT need to have a proximal leg vein
ultrasound scan quickly to diagnose or rule out a DVT so that treatment can be started
promptly if needed. The scan should be done within 4 hours of the request to avoid
unnecessary interim anticoagulation treatment. This excludes long-term anticoagulation
for secondary prevention or short-term anticoagulation when used for primary VTE
prevention in people with COVID-19. If DVT is ruled out, alternative diagnoses can be
investigated promptly.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as secondary care services) ensure that ultrasound scanning
equipment and staff are available to perform proximal leg vein ultrasound scans for people
aged 18 and over with a DVT Wells score of 2 points or more within 4 hours of the scan
being requested. They ensure that written clinical protocols are in place so that, if it is not
possible to have the scan result within 4 hours, people are offered a D-dimer test, then
interim therapeutic anticoagulation until the scan results are obtained (within 24 hours)
and treatment is reviewed.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, specialists and nurses) are aware of referral
pathways for proximal leg vein ultrasound scans, and refer people aged 18 and over with a
DVT Wells score of 2 points or more to have this imaging. If it is not possible to obtain the

scan result within 4 hours, they offer a D-dimer test, then interim therapeutic
anticoagulation and an ultrasound scan within 24 hours.
Commissioners ensure that services have referral pathways and written clinical protocols
in place so that people aged 18 and over with a DVT Wells score of 2 points or more can
have a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan within 4 hours of it being requested, or within
24 hours if this is not possible. They also ensure that services have the equipment and
capacity to perform this imaging within this timeframe.
People aged 18 and over who have signs and symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis
(blood clot) and are referred for an ultrasound scan have the scan within 4 hours of the
referral being made. If this is not possible, they are given the scan within 24 hours, and
offered a blood test to measure a protein called D-dimer, which can indicate whether there
is a blood clot, and an anticoagulant (medicine to treat blood clots) to take while waiting
for the scan.

Quality statement 4: Venous
thromboembolism anticoagulation review
Quality statement
People aged 18 and over taking anticoagulation treatment after a venous
thromboembolism (VTE) have a review at 3 months and then at least once a year if they
continue to take it long term. [2013, updated 2021]
Rationale
The benefits of anticoagulation treatment for VTE prevention become less certain over
time, and after 3 months treatment needs to be reviewed and a decision made about
whether to continue or stop treatment. Reviewing long-term anticoagulation treatment for
people who decide to continue it beyond 3 months ensures that treatment is guided by
the person's changing balance of benefits and risks, and changes in their preferences over
time. At a review, the information, advice and support provided to people when they
started having anticoagulation treatment should be reviewed and updated.

anticoagulation treatment.
Healthcare professionals (such as GPs, specialists and nurses) carry out a review for
people aged 18 and over taking anticoagulation treatment after a VTE after 3 months of
treatment to discuss the benefits and risks of continuing, stopping or changing the
anticoagulant. They give people information about when their anticoagulation will next be
reviewed. They also carry out a review for people taking long-term anticoagulation
treatment for secondary prevention of VTE at least once a year to review general health,
risk of VTE recurrence, bleeding risk, adherence, side effects and treatment preferences.
They make sure that they review and update the information, advice and support given to
people when they started having anticoagulation treatment.
Commissioners ensure that services have local systems in place to identify and invite for
review people aged 18 and over taking anticoagulation treatment after a VTE at 3 months
after starting treatment and adults taking long-term anticoagulation treatment for
secondary prevention of VTE at least once a year. They also ensure that services have the
capacity to carry out the reviews and to review and update the information, advice and
support given to people when they started having anticoagulation treatment.
People aged 18 and over who have had a blood clot and are taking an anticoagulant
(medicine to prevent another blood clot) have a review at 3 months to discuss whether to
continue or stop taking the anticoagulant, or change to a different anticoagulant. If they
continue the anticoagulant, they have a review at least once a year. The information,
advice and support they were given when they started having anticoagulation treatment is
reviewed and updated, and they are also given information about when their treatment
reviews will be scheduled.

Review at least once a year
A review of general health, risk of VTE recurrence, bleeding risk and treatment preferences
and to review and update the information, advice and support given when they started
treatment for people taking long-term anticoagulation treatment. [Adapted from NICE's
guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases, recommendation 1.4.12]
Equality and diversity considerations
NICE's guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases covers people aged 18 and over
because the evidence for the recommendations focused on this age group. This statement
applies to people aged 18 and over, but clinical judgement should be used when treating
people aged under 18 taking anticoagulation treatment after a VTE.
Information given to people should be in a format that suits their needs and preferences.
The reviews should be accessible to people who do not speak or read English, and it
should be culturally appropriate and age appropriate. For people with additional needs
related to a disability, impairment or sensory loss, information should also be provided as
set out in NHS England's Accessible Information Standard or the equivalent standards for
the devolved nations.
Heparins are a type of anticoagulant used to treat VTE. They are of animal origin and this
may be of concern to some people because of religious or ethical beliefs. The suitability,
advantages and disadvantages of alternatives to heparin should be discussed with the
person.

Quality statement 5: Follow-up for
outpatients with low-risk pulmonary
embolism
Quality statement
People aged 18 and over having outpatient treatment for suspected or confirmed low-risk
pulmonary embolism (PE) have an agreed plan for monitoring and follow-up. [new 2021]
Rationale
Having clear arrangements for monitoring and follow-up for outpatients ensures that they
receive the same quality of care from secondary care services as inpatients. Patients
should have a written plan that makes them aware of signs to look out for and how and
when to get help when needed. This will help to ensure that people having outpatient
treatment for suspected or confirmed PE act in a timely manner before things worsen.
Specialist services with expertise in thrombosis may not be available at all times, so it is
important that the plan also includes information about who they can contact if they need
advice outside normal service hours.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that people aged 18 and over having
outpatient treatment for suspected or confirmed low-risk PE have an agreed plan for
monitoring and follow-up.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare

professionals and provider organisations, for example from service specifications or local
protocols.
b) Evidence that information is available for people aged 18 and over having outpatient
treatment for suspected or confirmed low-risk PE on symptoms and signs to look out for,
and contact information for healthcare professionals they can discuss concerns with.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example from information leaflets.
Process
Proportion of people aged 18 and over having outpatient treatment for suspected or
confirmed low-risk PE who have an agreed plan for monitoring and follow-up.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who have an agreed plan for monitoring and
follow-up.
Denominator – the number of people aged 18 and over having outpatient treatment for
suspected or confirmed low-risk PE.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example from patient records.
Outcome
Rates of emergency admissions to hospital for people aged 18 and over having outpatient
treatment for low-risk PE.
Data source: Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare
professionals and provider organisations, for example from patient records.

Venous thromboembolism in adults (QS201)
people having outpatient treatment for suspected or confirmed low-risk PE.
Healthcare professionals (such as specialists, specialist nurses and allied health
professionals) discuss and agree a plan for monitoring and follow-up with people having
outpatient treatment for suspected or confirmed low-risk PE. They provide them with
written information on symptoms and signs to look out for, direct contact details of a
healthcare professional or team with expertise in thrombosis to discuss concerns with,
and information about out-of-hours services they can contact when their secondary care
healthcare team is not available. They should provide adequate information to enable
people to make an informed decision about outpatient management.
Commissioners ensure that services have the capacity and resources to discuss and
agree a plan for monitoring and follow-up with people having outpatient treatment for
suspected or confirmed low-risk PE.
People who are having outpatient treatment for a pulmonary embolism are given written
information on signs and symptoms they should look out for and who to contact if they
need help or advice, including out-of-hours services.

Venous thromboembolism in adults (QS201)
Update information
August 2021: This quality standard updates and replaces the quality standards on venous
thromboembolism in adults: reducing the risk in hospital (published June 2010), and
venous thromboembolism in adults: diagnosis and management (published March 2013).
The topic was identified for update following the annual review of quality standards. The
review identified:
• changes in the priority areas for improvement
• new guidance on venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and
thrombophilia testing (NG158)
• that the quality standards on venous thromboembolism in adults: reducing the risk in
hospital (QS3) and venous thromboembolism in adults: diagnosis and management
(QS29) should be combined.
Statements are marked as:
• [new 2021] if the statement covers a new area for quality improvement
• [2010 or 2013, updated 2021] if the statement covers an area for quality improvement
included in the 2010 or 2013 quality standard and has been updated.
Statement 5 in the 2010 version has been updated and is included in the updated quality
standard, marked as [2010, updated 2021].
Statements 2 and 8 in the 2013 version have been updated and are included in the
updated quality standard, marked as [2013, updated 2021].
The 2010 quality standard on venous thromboembolism in adults: reducing the risk in
hospital and the 2013 quality standard for venous thromboembolism in adults: diagnosis
and management are available as PDFs.

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standard advisory committees for details of standing
committee 3 members who advised on this quality standard. Information about the topic
experts invited to join the standing members is available from the webpage for this quality
standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.
Resource impact
NICE quality standards should be achievable by local services. The potential resource

impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource
impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource
impact products for the source guidance to help estimate local costs:
• resource impact statement for NICE's guideline on venous thromboembolism in
over 16s
• resource impact statement, template and report for NICE's guideline on venous
thromboembolic diseases.
Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the
quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
