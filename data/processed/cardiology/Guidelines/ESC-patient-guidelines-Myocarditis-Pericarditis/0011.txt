type of scan can directly visualise inflammation and scarring in the heart muscle to support myocarditis diagnosis. It may also show pericardial effusion and thickening of the pericardial layer. • Chest X-ray: This is often done to rule out other causes of chest pain (like pneumonia) or to check the size of the heart or the presence of fluid. It’s not definitive for IMPS but is helpful overall. • Cardiac catheterisation (coronary angiography): If doctors suspect a heart attack, they may do an angiogram to check if coronary arteries are blocked. Occasionally, a small biopsy of the heart muscle (endomyocardial biopsy) is taken, especially if myocarditis is severe or if specific treatments (immunosuppressants) are considered. • Coronary computed tomography (CT): This type of scan can rule out a blocked coronary artery. The decision to use CT or angiography depends on whether risk factors for blocked arteries are present. • Genetic testing may be performed during follow-up. Diagnosis is a process of putting all the pieces together. Often, pericarditis can be diagnosed with history, ECG and echo alone. Myocarditis can be trickier – many cases are diagnosed based on a combination of blood markers and scans, but a CMR or even
