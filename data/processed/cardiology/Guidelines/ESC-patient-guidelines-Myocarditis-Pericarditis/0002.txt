ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Myocarditis and Pericarditis:
KEYWORDS: heart, myocarditis, pericarditis, doctor, symptoms, inflammation, pain, recovery, chest, support, like, people, rest, medications, treatment

and pericarditis are conditions that involve inflammation of the heart. In myocarditis, the heart muscle (myocardium) itself becomes inflamed. In pericarditis, the lining that surrounds the heart (pericardium) becomes inflamed. Myocardium Pericardium Heart muscle Lining around the heart Lungs Heart wall Diaphragm Myocarditis and pericarditis often have the same cause but affect different parts of the heart. In some cases, because the pericardium and myocardium are close together, inflammation in one part can also affect the other. ‘Myopericarditis’ is mainly pericarditis with some myocarditis, while ‘perimyocarditis’ is mainly myocarditis with some pericarditis. The 2025 ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines introduce the new term ‘inflammatory myopericardial syndrome (IMPS)’ – this refers to the full spectrum of inflammatory myocardial and pericardial diseases, including those where both conditions overlap. This new umbrella term aims to increase awareness of the overlap and provide a new way for healthcare professionals to describe the condition during the diagnosis process. IMPS can occur in anyone – young or old, healthy or not – often following an infection or other trigger.
