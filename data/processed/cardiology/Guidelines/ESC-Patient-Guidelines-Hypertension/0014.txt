ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Elevated Blood Pressure and Hypertension:

for heart disease and are used less frequently for hypertension. Examples include atenolol and bisoprolol. MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists): These help the body get rid of excess salt while retaining potassium, which is beneficial for patients with difficult-to-treat forms of hypertension. Examples include spironolactone and eplerenone. SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitors: Originally developed for diabetes management, these drugs also have benefits in lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular risks by helping the kidneys excrete more glucose and sodium. Examples include dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Labetalol: Often used in pregnancy, this medication helps manage hypertension by relaxing blood vessels and reducing heart rate. Additional terms White coat hypertension: Elevated blood pressure readings only when at the doctor’s office, likely due to anxiety. Home readings are normal. Masked hypertension: Normal blood pressure readings in the doctor’s office but high readings at home, potentially due to less stress in the medical environment.
