ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Elevated Blood Pressure and Hypertension:

when your heart contracts. Diastolic pressure: This is the bottom number in a blood pressure reading. It measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart relaxes between beats. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors: These drugs work by relaxing blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart. Examples include enalapril and ramipril. ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers): These drugs relax blood vessels but work differently from ACE inhibitors. They block a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. Examples include losartan and valsartan. Calcium channel blockers: These medications lower blood pressure by preventing calcium from entering the cells of the heart and blood vessel walls, which helps relax the vessels. Examples are amlodipine and nifedipine. Diuretics: Sometimes called ‘water pills,’ diuretics help the kidneys remove excess salt and water from the body, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. Common diuretics include hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone. Beta-blockers: These drugs work by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartbeat, effectively lowering blood pressure. They are often prescribed for heart disease and are used less frequently for hypertension. Examples include atenolol and bisoprolol. MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists): These help the body get rid of excess salt while retaining
