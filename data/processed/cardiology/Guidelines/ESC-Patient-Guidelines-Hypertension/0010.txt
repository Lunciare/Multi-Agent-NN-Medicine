work properly. You can establish good medication-taking habits by following the PILLS strategy: Prompt: Place the medications or a reminder somewhere visible in your home. This can act as a trigger to take them each day. Audible prompts such as phone alarms or text reminders can help. Include others: Family members or friends may be able to remind you to take your medications or support you to have access to an adequate supply of medications at all times. Link it to events: Taking medications at the same time as regular daily events that happen in your usual context can help strengthen the habit e.g. on waking, going to bed or around meal times. Let your doctor or pharmacist know if you are having trouble with your medication: Your doctor or pharmacist may be able to make things easier by consolidating your medications, particularly if you are taking several medications e.g. using combination medications, deprescribing some medications or providing them in reminder packaging. Self-monitoring: Keeping a record of your medication taking may be helpful, using a pen and paper or digitally. This could be done in conjunction with self BP monitoring.
