What are the risks of high blood pressure? Many people do not notice or feel unwell when their BP is high, so it is important to be aware of the serious health risks that may occur if your BP is not kept under control. Untreated high BP can damage arteries, causing them to become stiff or narrow. Fatty material can build up in damaged arteries to the heart and brain, which may trigger a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke. In addition, hypertension may contribute to heart failure and may damage other organs, including the brain, eyes and kidneys. High BP can also cause complications during pregnancy.
