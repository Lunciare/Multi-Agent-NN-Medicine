Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

was assumed that the hazard ratio was equivalent to the hazard ratio estimated in the 'all patients' analysis. If there were no available data in the 'all patients' analysis, the hazard ratio was assumed to be 1. 3.22 In the model, people could permanently stop or switch treatment after an ischaemic stroke or a haemorrhagic stroke. After stopping treatment and switching to a new therapy, the transition probability (of health state and event) did not change to reflect the new therapy. The company assumed that people could not stop or switch treatment for any other reason because there would be no difference between treatment groups. 3.23 The adverse events considered in the company's model were non-intracranial haemorrhage major bleed, clinically relevant non-major bleeds, other intracranial haemorrhage, and transient ischaemic attack (assumed to be transient on clinical advice). ERG comments 3.24 The ERG considered that the assumption of proportionality that underpinned the network meta-analysis had been shown to be violated both within and between trials (see also sections 3.10 and 3.18). The ERG highlighted that this meant the hazard ratios used to inform the company's economic model were therefore unreliable. 3.25 The ERG highlighted that the model predicted that, of a
