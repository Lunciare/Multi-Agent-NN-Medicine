Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

Sankyo and a review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). Clinical effectiveness Overview of clinical trials 3.1 The primary source of evidence was ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, a randomised, international (46 countries, including 31 centres in the UK) double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial comparing edoxaban with warfarin. It included a total of 21,105 people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a moderate-to-high risk of stroke, defined as a CHADS score of 2 or more 2 (CHADS is a scoring system that measures risk factors associated with 2 congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes and stroke). People were randomly assigned to treatment with low-dose edoxaban (30 mg, n=7,034), high-dose edoxaban (60 mg, n=7,035) or warfarin (n=7,036). People randomised to edoxaban who were at increased risk of bleeding because of higher drug exposure (those weighing 60 kg or less, with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/ min, or having concomitant treatment with potent permeability glycoprotein inhibitors) had the dose reduced, either at randomisation or during the study, to 15 mg in the low-dose group and to 30 mg in the high-dose group. The clinical trial results presented below focus on the higher dose treatment arm because this is the recommended dose
