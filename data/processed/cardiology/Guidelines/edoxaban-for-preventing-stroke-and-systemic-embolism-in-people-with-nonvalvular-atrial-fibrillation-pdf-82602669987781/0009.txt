Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

similar effect compared with warfarin to that observed in the total study population, but there was a significant reduction in risk of stroke and systemic embolism in the subgroup with a centre-level TTR of less than 60%. When the TTR data were examined by quartiles, however, the p value for interaction was 0.50. Health-related quality of life 3.8 Health-related quality of life data were collected in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 using the self-administered EQ-5D questionnaire at baseline and then every 3 months, until the end of the study. Approximately 60% of patients (11,995 patients) provided quality-of-life data; 164 (1.4%) patients were from the UK. ERG comments on the clinical effectiveness data 3.9 The ERG noted that the statistically significant result for non-inferiority in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was driven largely by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke events in patients treated with edoxaban, but there was no statistically significant difference between edoxaban and warfarin for any other listed component or subcomponent. 3.10 The ERG commented that the estimate of treatment effect (hazard ratio) for the primary outcome may not be reliable because the assumption of proportional hazards between treatment with edoxaban or warfarin for haemorrhagic stroke (one of the components of the primary
