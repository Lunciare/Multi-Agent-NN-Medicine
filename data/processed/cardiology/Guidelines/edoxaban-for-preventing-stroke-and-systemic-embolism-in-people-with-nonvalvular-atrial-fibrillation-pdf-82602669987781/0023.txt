Warfarin had the highest probability (36.8%) of being the most cost-effective option at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. At a maximum acceptable ICER of £30,000 per QALY gained, apixaban had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective option (32.6%). In the pairwise comparison of edoxaban compared with warfarin, the probability of edoxaban being cost effective was 47.1% at a maximum acceptable ICER of £20,000 per QALY gained and 57.1% at a maximum acceptable ICER of £30,000 per QALY gained. 3.35 The company did 14 pairwise deterministic sensitivity analyses. It highlighted that the variables that had the most impact on the deterministic base case results were patients' starting age (lower limit 52.1 years,
