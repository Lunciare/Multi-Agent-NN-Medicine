The dose in the warfarin group was adjusted to maintain an international normalised ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0, and people in the trial were 'well controlled' on warfarin (median time spent in the therapeutic range [TTR] was 68.4%). 3.2 Patient characteristics were similar between the treatment groups including age, sex, ethnicity, risk factors, CHADS score and renal function.
