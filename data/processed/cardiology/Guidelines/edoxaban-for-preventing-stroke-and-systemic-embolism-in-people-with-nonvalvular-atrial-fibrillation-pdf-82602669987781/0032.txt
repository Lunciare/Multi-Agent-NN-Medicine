haemorrhagic stroke with edoxaban compared with warfarin. The Committee concluded that edoxaban was as clinically effective as warfarin for the primary efficacy outcome of reducing stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, and had nearly half the rate of haemorrhagic stroke events compared to warfarin. 4.4 The Committee considered the results of the company's subgroup analyses, which used data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. It noted that the company presented data for subgroups based on international normalised ratio (INR) control, that compared the efficacy of edoxaban and warfarin in relation to the median TTR for the study centre. One of the analyses showed that the relative benefits of edoxaban compared with warfarin were greater in centres where the centre-level TTR was less than 60%. The Committee noted comments from the company and the Evidence Review Group (ERG) that this was not consistent across all analysis sets. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to consider different treatment effects according to centre-level TTR. 4.5 The Committee noted that the company's subgroup analyses for risk of stroke (as defined by CHADS score) showed that the hazard ratio for edoxaban compared 2 with warfarin was stable and non-inferior across CHADS scores of 2
