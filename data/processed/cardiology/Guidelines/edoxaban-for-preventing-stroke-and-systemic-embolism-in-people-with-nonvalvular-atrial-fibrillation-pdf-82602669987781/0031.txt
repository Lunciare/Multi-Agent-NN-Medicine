Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

expected to be offered in the same place in the treatment pathway as other anticoagulants (that is, to women with a CHADS -VASc score of 2 and above, and to men with a score 2 of 1 or above), while taking bleeding risk into account. The Committee concluded that the trial was well designed and generalisable to clinical practice. 4.3 The Committee considered the results of ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. It noted that the primary efficacy outcome was a composite of stroke (both ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and systemic embolism. However, ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism could be considered direct treatment effects, whereas haemorrhagic stroke was a bleeding outcome and therefore an adverse event. The Committee noted that for the composite primary outcome, edoxaban was non-inferior to, but not superior to, well-controlled warfarin (which was defined in the trial as a median time in therapeutic range [TTR] of 68.4%). The Committee noted that when the individual components of the primary outcome were considered separately, there was only a statistically significant reduction in haemorrhagic stroke with edoxaban compared with warfarin. The Committee concluded that edoxaban was as clinically effective as warfarin for the primary efficacy outcome of reducing stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and
