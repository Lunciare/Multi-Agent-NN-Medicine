stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation; rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation; dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation). The Committee also noted that an INR monitoring cost of £265 was used by the company, and that this fell within a range previously accepted in NICE technology appraisals. The Committee concluded that the costs used in the model were appropriate. 4.13 The Committee considered the cost effectiveness of edoxaban compared with warfarin. It noted that the company's base-case deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for edoxaban compared with warfarin were £12,900 and £16,900 per QALY gained respectively. The Committee noted that the ERG considered the economic model to be robust to all of the company's sensitivity analyses, and to most of those done by the ERG. The Committee further considered the ERG's exploratory analyses. It noted that the change which had the largest single impact on the ICER was applying the hazard ratio from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 for haemorrhagic stroke (which increased the ICER to £17,100 per QALY gained). The Committee noted that the inclusion of all the ERG's preferred values in the model
