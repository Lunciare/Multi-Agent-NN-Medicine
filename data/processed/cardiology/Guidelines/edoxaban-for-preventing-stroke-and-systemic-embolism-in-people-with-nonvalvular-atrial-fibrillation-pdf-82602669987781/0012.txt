1.23%, respectively; HR 1.23 [1.02 to 1.50]; p=0.03). 3.14 The company stated that the 5 most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in the edoxaban or warfarin groups were urinary tract infections, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, dizziness and peripheral oedema. The company presented subgroup analyses for the primary safety outcome by centre-level TTR and by risk of stroke (as defined by CHADS ), which were consistent with the 2 overall population. Network meta-analysis 3.15 The company did not find any head-to-head studies that compared edoxaban with rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate or apixaban so it did a network meta-analysis to estimate the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban for treating atrial fibrillation, that included 4 trials: ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, and 3 trials of other newer oral anticoagulants (apixaban 5 mg twice-daily [ARISTOTLE]; dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice-daily or 110 mg twice-daily [RE-LY]; and rivaroxaban 20 mg once-daily [ROCKET-AF]). All 4 RCTs had a warfarin treatment arm. Because of significant differences in the patient characteristics and trial design between the 4 trials (for example, ARISTOTLE and RE-LY included people with a CHADS2 score of 1 or more, whereas the CHADS2 score was 2 or more in both ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and ROCKET-AF) only data from patients with
