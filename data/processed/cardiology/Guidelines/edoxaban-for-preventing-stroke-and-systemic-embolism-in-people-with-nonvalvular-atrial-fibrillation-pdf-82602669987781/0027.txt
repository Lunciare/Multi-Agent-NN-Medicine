which used its preferred alternative parameter values or formulae. The ERG also combined multiple parameters to give their preferred base case, which included: • corrected implementation of age-related utility adjustment • ERG-sourced utility values for systemic embolism • alternative utility values for myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack and ERG-sourced utility values for acute and post-stroke health states • assumption regarding the method used to switch patient medication from dabigatran 150 mg to 110 mg at age 80 • assumption regarding treatment discontinuation after haemorrhagic stroke • acute stroke fatality rate applied to all stroke events (16.8% for ischaemic and 31.6% for haemorrhagic stroke) • trial data on acute stroke case fatality rates used for all ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes • age-adjusted utility decrement per year amended to -0.00646 instead of -0.00029 • the daily cost of warfarin amended • the ENGAGE trial HR applied for haemorrhagic stroke. 3.41 None of the ERG's amendments to the company's model changed the results of the full incremental analyses; edoxaban was more expensive and less effective than at least one of the alternative treatments. When all of the ERG's preferred values were used in the model the pairwise deterministic ICER for the comparison of
