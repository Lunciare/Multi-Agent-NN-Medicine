Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

resources. 4.1 The Committee heard from clinical and patient experts that the current standard treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation is warfarin, although there is increasing use of newer agents. The Committee was aware that non-valvular atrial fibrillation is well-managed with warfarin for many people, but is associated with a number of problems including the need for regular monitoring and dose adjustment, and it has multiple food and drug interactions. The Committee heard from the patient and clinical experts that the number of people being prescribed anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation is increasing following publication of the NICE guideline on managing atrial fibrillation. This does not recommend aspirin for the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation, which has led to a higher uptake of both warfarin and the newer oral anticoagulants.
