Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

included people with a CHADS2 score of 1 or more, whereas the CHADS2 score was 2 or more in both ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and ROCKET-AF) only data from patients with a CHADS score of 2 or more from RE-LY and ARISTOTLE were used in the network 2 meta-analyses. 3.16 The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that for the composite endpoint of stroke and systemic embolism, efficacy was similar for high-dose edoxaban compared to other newer oral anticoagulants, but edoxaban significantly reduced major bleeding risk by 24%, 28%, and 17% compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg and dabigatran etexilate 110 mg, respectively. Major bleeding rates were similar between high-dose edoxaban and apixaban. Evidence Review Group's comments on the network meta-analysis 3.17 The ERG considered that the key characteristics of the trials (study population, design, outcome measures; and effect modifiers such as age, disease severity, and duration of follow-up) included in the network meta-analyses were sufficiently similar to justify combining the results. The company's approach used annualised event rates and the ERG considered that this approach minimised any potential bias resulting from differences in trial duration, which ranged from 1.8 years in ARISTOTLE (apixaban) to 2.8 years in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48
