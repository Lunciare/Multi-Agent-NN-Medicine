groups of the trial (see sections 3.40 and 3.41). 3.26 The ERG highlighted that the model overestimated overall survival for both treatment groups compared with ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, and that this potentially underestimated the relative effectiveness of edoxaban compared to warfarin. Utility values 3.27 The baseline quality of life for the health state of stable atrial fibrillation in the company's model (0.78) was taken from a study of patients with atrial fibrillation having warfarin in the UK (Khan, 2004). In the sensitivity analyses, health-related quality of life data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 were used (0.836). Health-related quality of life declined over time based on an adjustment for cohort aging (-0.00029 per year) to reflect the impact of age and thrombotic events on a patient's quality of life. Utility estimates for mild, moderate and severe stroke were derived from a published study by Gage (1996). The company assumed that patients who have a stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic embolic event experience a permanent decrement to their health-related quality of life. ERG comments 3.28 The ERG noted that the base case utility value for the stable atrial fibrillation health state had been derived from a UK study by Khan which had a
