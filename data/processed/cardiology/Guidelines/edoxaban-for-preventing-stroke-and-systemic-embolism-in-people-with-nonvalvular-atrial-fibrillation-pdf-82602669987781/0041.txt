Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 for haemorrhagic stroke (which increased the ICER to £17,100 per QALY gained). The Committee noted that the inclusion of all the ERG's preferred values in the model (see sections 3.40 and 3.41) resulted in a deterministic ICER of £16,000 per QALY gained and a probabilistic ICER of £22,100 per QALY gained. The Committee concluded that taking all of the analyses into account, edoxaban was cost effective compared with warfarin and could be recommended as an alternative to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who have 1 or more risk factors for stroke. 4.14 The Committee noted that the cost effectiveness of edoxaban compared with other newer oral anticoagulants was calculated using hazard ratios from the network meta-analysis, which the Committee considered to lack robustness (see section 4.8). In the full incremental analysis edoxaban, dabigatran etexilate 110 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban were strictly dominated by dabigatran etexilate 150 mg, which had an ICER of £7,645 per additional QALY gained compared to warfarin. However, there were very small differences in QALYs and costs between the newer oral anticoagulants. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to distinguish between the clinical and
