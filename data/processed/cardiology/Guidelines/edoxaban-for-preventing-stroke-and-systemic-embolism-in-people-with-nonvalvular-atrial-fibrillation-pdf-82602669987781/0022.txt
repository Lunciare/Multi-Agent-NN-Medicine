resource use 3.32 The ERG noted that although the cost of warfarin used in the company's model (£0.11 per day) was estimated using the list prices reported in the BNF, it is widely available to the NHS at discounted prices. The ERG did an exploratory analysis using the warfarin cost estimated from figures reported in the Department of Health's eMit database (£0.0375). Company's base-case results and sensitivity analysis 3.33 In the company's deterministic base case analysis (based on people with CHADS 2 ≥2), edoxaban, dabigatran etexilate 110 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban were strictly dominated (less effective and more costly) by dabigatran etexilate 150 mg, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £7,645 per additional QALY gained compared to warfarin (table 1).
