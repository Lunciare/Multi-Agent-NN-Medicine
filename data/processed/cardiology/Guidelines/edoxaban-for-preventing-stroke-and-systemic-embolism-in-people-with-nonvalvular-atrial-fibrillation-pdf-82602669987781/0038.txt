ratios obtained from the network meta-analysis were used in the economic model and that these estimates were considered unreliable by the ERG (see section 4.8). The Committee concluded that data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 were appropriate for calculating the cost effectiveness of edoxaban compared with warfarin, but the estimates of the cost effectiveness of edoxaban compared with dabigatran etexilate, apixaban and rivaroxaban were based on data that were associated with a high degree of uncertainty. 4.11 The Committee heard from the ERG that there were differences in the utility values used in the economic model, compared with other NICE technology appraisals for atrial fibrillation (apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation; rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation; dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation). It noted that even though EQ-5D data were collected at baseline in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 , the baseline utility value for stable atrial fibrillation used in the model was from another small UK study. The Committee noted that the ERG had identified a number of inconsistencies and had raised concerns about some of the sources of
