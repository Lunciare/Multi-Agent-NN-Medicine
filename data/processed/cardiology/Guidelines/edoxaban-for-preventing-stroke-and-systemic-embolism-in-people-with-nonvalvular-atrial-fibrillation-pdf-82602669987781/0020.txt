Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

comments 3.28 The ERG noted that the base case utility value for the stable atrial fibrillation health state had been derived from a UK study by Khan which had a modest sample size of 125 patients, with a low response rate, and was designed to assess the effectiveness of an anticoagulation education programme and self-monitoring of patients with atrial fibrillation taking warfarin. The ERG did not consider this to be representative of a general atrial fibrillation population and it preferred the use of EQ-5D data collected in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. 3.29 The ERG highlighted that the age-related utility decrement in the model (-0.00029 per annum) based on self-reported health status of a US population and valued using the UK tariff may not be generalisable to a UK population. The ERG preferred to use EQ-5D data from the Health Survey for England in its analysis, because this was a more representative population for the UK. This produced an estimated annual utility decrement of -0.00646. Resource use 3.30 The company used the BNF 68 (July 2014) to obtain drug costs in the model. All costs for the health states of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke and systemic embolic events were based on the
