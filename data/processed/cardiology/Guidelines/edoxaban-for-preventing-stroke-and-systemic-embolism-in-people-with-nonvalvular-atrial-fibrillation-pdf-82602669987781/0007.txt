study period. For the mITT overall study period, edoxaban was shown to be superior to warfarin for haemorrhagic stroke (p=0.001). The results were similar for the mITT population, the on-treatment period analysis and the ITT population analysis. 3.6 The company presented analyses for the primary efficacy results using the mITT analysis set (overall study period) for subgroups according to risk of stroke (defined by CHADS score) and renal function (creatinine clearance). The 2 subgroup analysis for risk of stroke demonstrated that, compared with warfarin, the hazard ratio for the edoxaban 60 mg/30 mg dose was stable and non-inferior across CHADS scores of 2 to 6. The subgroup analysis for renal function across 2 3 categories of creatinine clearance (normal renal function 80 ml/min or more; mild renal impairment more than 50 to less than 80 ml/min; and moderate renal impairment 30 to 50 ml/min), suggested that renal function had a significant impact on the efficacy of edoxaban in comparison to warfarin (p=0.0042). This result was shown to be consistent across analysis sets. The hazard ratios for the primary efficacy endpoint were 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.85) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.17) for the subgroups of people with
