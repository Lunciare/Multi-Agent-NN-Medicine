proportion of people with good renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) who would be eligible for treatment with edoxaban was in the region of 5% to 10%, and that these are often younger people. The Committee noted the company's rationale that the results of this sub-group analysis should be interpreted with caution (see section 3.6). It also noted the summary of product characteristics which states that, in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and high creatinine clearance, edoxaban should only be used after careful evaluation of a person's thromboembolic and bleeding risk. The Committee concluded that if edoxaban is used in accordance with the summary of product characteristics, there is no reason to make differential recommendations based on creatinine clearance. 4.7 The Committee considered the adverse events reported in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. It noted that for the primary safety outcome of major bleeding, edoxaban resulted in statistically significantly fewer bleeds than warfarin. Edoxaban also had statistically significantly fewer other bleeding events including fatal, intracranial and clinically relevant non-major bleeds. The Committee recognised the particular importance of the reduction in intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin. It also noted the statistically significantly higher numbers of gastrointestinal bleeds in people treated with edoxaban compared
