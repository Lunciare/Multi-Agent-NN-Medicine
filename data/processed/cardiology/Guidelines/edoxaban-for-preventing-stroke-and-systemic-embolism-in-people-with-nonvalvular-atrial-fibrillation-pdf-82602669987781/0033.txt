Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

analyses for risk of stroke (as defined by CHADS score) showed that the hazard ratio for edoxaban compared 2 with warfarin was stable and non-inferior across CHADS scores of 2 to 6. The 2 Committee concluded that there was no biologically plausible reason to indicate that the relative treatment effect would be dependent on the baseline risk of stroke. 4.6 The Committee discussed the subgroup analysis based on renal function, which used 3 categories of creatinine clearance (normal renal function, and mild or moderate impairment). It noted that the results of this analysis suggested a trend towards decreasing efficacy of edoxaban with increasing creatinine clearance (see section 3.6). The Committee heard from a clinical expert that this was likely to be because with better renal function edoxaban is removed by the kidneys more quickly, leading to a reduction in treatment effect. It also heard that this may apply to all newer oral anticoagulants, but data need to be re-evaluated to confirm this. It heard from the clinical experts that the proportion of people with good renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) who would be eligible for treatment with edoxaban was in the region of 5% to 10%, and that these
