used in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, which captured the main efficacy and adverse events of treatment. The Committee agreed that the model structure, perspective and time horizon were appropriate, although it questioned the relevance of the inclusion of myocardial infarction. It concluded that the analysis was consistent with the NICE reference case. 4.10 The Committee considered the clinical-effectiveness estimates used in the company's model. It noted that the comparison of edoxaban with warfarin used direct evidence from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 to inform the company's economic model. The Committee was aware of the ERG's concern that the assumption of proportional hazards for edoxaban and warfarin for haemorrhagic stroke (one of the components of the primary outcome) appeared to be violated in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. However, the Committee considered that the general modelling approach and the pairwise comparison with warfarin were appropriate. The Committee noted that for the comparison of edoxaban with the other newer oral anticoagulants, hazard ratios obtained from the network meta-analysis were used in the economic model and that these estimates were considered unreliable by the ERG (see section 4.8). The Committee concluded that data
