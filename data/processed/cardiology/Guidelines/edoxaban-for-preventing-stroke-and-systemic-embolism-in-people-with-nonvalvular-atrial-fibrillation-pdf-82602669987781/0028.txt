less effective than at least one of the alternative treatments. When all of the ERG's preferred values were used in the model the pairwise deterministic ICER for the comparison of edoxaban with warfarin was £16,008 per QALY gained, and the probabilistic ICER was £22,079 per QALY gained. When additional alternative amendments were included to reconcile the model survival outputs with the trial data, and to reflect the changing age and sex distribution over time, this changed the deterministic pairwise ICER to between approximately £15,176 and £15,807, and the probabilistic ICER to between £21,728 and £23,634 per QALY gained. 3.42 See the committee papers for full details of the evidence. 4 Consideration of the evidence The Appraisal Committee reviewed the data available on the clinical and cost effectiveness of edoxaban, having considered evidence on the nature of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the value placed on the benefits of edoxaban by people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical experts. It also took into account the effective use of NHS resources. 4.1 The Committee heard from clinical and patient experts that the current standard treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation is warfarin, although there is increasing use of newer agents.
