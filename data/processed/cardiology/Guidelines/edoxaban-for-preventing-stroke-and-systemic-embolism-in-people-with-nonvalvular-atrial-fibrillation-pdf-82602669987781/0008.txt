Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

analysis sets. The hazard ratios for the primary efficacy endpoint were 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.85) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.17) for the subgroups of people with mild or moderate renal impairment, respectively. In contrast, the relative risk of stroke or systemic embolic event was higher with edoxaban than with warfarin in the subgroup of people with normal renal function (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.79). The company noted that this analysis should be treated with caution because a variety of factors (including an unusually low event rate in the warfarin group, and potential imbalances between treatment groups because of randomisation not being performed within subgroups) could have contributed to the observed hazard ratio for stroke or systemic embolic event compared with warfarin in the subgroup of people with normal renal function. 3.7 The company also did an analysis comparing centre-level TTR above and below 60%. The p value for interaction was 0.0361 which indicated that in centres with a TTR above 60% edoxaban had a similar effect compared with warfarin to that observed in the total study population, but there was a significant reduction in risk of stroke and systemic embolism in the subgroup with
