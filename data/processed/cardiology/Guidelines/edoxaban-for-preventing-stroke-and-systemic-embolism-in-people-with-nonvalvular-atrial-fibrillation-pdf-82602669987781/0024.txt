did 14 pairwise deterministic sensitivity analyses. It highlighted that the variables that had the most impact on the deterministic base case results were patients' starting age (lower limit 52.1 years, upper limit 89.1 years), cost of treatment, monitoring costs for patients treated with edoxaban (baseline £0, upper limit £26.50), and the utility values of stable atrial fibrillation, post-event myocardial infarction and haemorrhagic stroke. 3.36 The company presented results of subgroup analyses for people with a CHADS 2 score of 3 or more, or with a centre-level TTR of 60% or more. In people with a CHADS score of 3 or more edoxaban, dabigatran etexilate 110 mg, and 2 rivaroxaban were strictly dominated (less effective and more costly) by apixaban and dabigatran etexilate 150 mg. For the subgroup of people with a centre-level TTR of 60% or more, edoxaban, dabigatran etexilate 110 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban were strictly dominated by dabigatran etexilate 150 mg, which had an ICER of £11,738 per additional QALY gained compared to warfarin. ERG's comments on the company's cost-effectiveness model results 3.37 Results from the company's base case probabilistic analysis were not explicitly included in the submission. However, they were calculated by the ERG using the company's
