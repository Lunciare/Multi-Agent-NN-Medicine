Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

of edoxaban for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Clinical effectiveness 4.2 The Committee considered the clinical-effectiveness data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, that compared edoxaban with warfarin. It considered that this trial was of good quality and discussed whether the results were generalisable to people with atrial fibrillation in the UK. The Committee noted that ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, like other trials of newer anticoagulants, used CHADS to assess the 2 risk of stroke rather than CHADS -VASc, which is now used in clinical practice, as 2 recommended in the NICE guideline on managing atrial fibrillation. The Committee understood from the clinical expert that the CHADS -VASc scoring 2 system was developed to better define those who would benefit from anticoagulation because a number people with a CHADS score of 1 would still 2 benefit. It also heard that although these people were not included in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, a lower baseline risk of stroke would not be expected to reduce the relative efficacy of the treatment. In clinical practice, edoxaban is expected to be offered in the same place in the treatment pathway as other anticoagulants (that is, to women with a CHADS -VASc score of 2 and above, and to
