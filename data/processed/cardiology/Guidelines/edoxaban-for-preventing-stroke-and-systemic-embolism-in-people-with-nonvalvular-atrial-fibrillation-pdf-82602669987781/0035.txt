Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

recognised the particular importance of the reduction in intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin. It also noted the statistically significantly higher numbers of gastrointestinal bleeds in people treated with edoxaban compared with warfarin. The Committee was aware that this is not unique to edoxaban, and that clinicians are now more experienced in using the newer oral anticoagulants and in managing the adverse events. It also heard from the clinical experts that administration of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate has been shown to reverse the effects of edoxaban. The Committee concluded that the risk–benefit profile of edoxaban was acceptable. 4.8 The Committee discussed the data for edoxaban compared with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran etexilate (110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily) and rivaroxaban, that were used in the company's network meta-analysis. The Committee noted that the trials included in the network meta-analysis were not directly comparable; for example, they had different baseline risks of stroke (with different CHADS inclusion criteria and mean CHADS scores) and differences in 2 2 time in the therapeutic range in the warfarin groups. The Committee also noted the ERG's concerns about the violation of the proportional hazards assumption in data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, from the trials
