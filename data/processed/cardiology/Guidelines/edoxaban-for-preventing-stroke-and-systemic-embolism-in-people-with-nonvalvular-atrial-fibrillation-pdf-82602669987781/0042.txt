Therefore, edoxaban could be recommended as a cost-effective treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation in people who have 1 or more risk factors for stroke. 4.15 The Committee concluded that the decision about whether to start treatment with edoxaban should be made after an informed discussion between the clinician and the person about the risks and benefits of edoxaban compared with warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban. For people considering switching from warfarin to edoxaban, the potential risks and benefits of edoxaban should be considered in the light of their level of international normalised ratio (INR) control. 4.16 The Committee was aware of NICE's position statement with regard to the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) 2014, and in particular the PPRS payment mechanism, when appraising edoxaban.
