The ERG highlighted that this meant the hazard ratios used to inform the company's economic model were therefore unreliable. 3.25 The ERG highlighted that the model predicted that, of a cohort of 1000 people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation having warfarin, there will be 157 stroke events. Using the company's approach to applying the risk of acute-stroke mortality, approximately 15 (9.6%) of these would be fatal, which is substantially less than the 16.8% reported in the study by Janes. The ERG assessed the impact of applying the acute mortality rates reported by Janes to all patients experiencing a stroke (ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke analysed separately; see sections 3.40 and 3.41). The ERG noted that mortality data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 were not used in the model and no rationale for this was given by the company. The ERG considered it more appropriate to use mortality data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. Therefore, in its exploratory analyses, the ERG extracted acute mortality data for ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke from the edoxaban groups of the trial (see sections 3.40 and 3.41). 3.26 The ERG highlighted that the model overestimated overall survival for both treatment groups compared with ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, and that
