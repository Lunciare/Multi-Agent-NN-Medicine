at least 2 (the baseline characteristics of ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48). The model consisted of 18 health states (patients entering the model with 'stable AF'), with 1-month cycles and a 30-year (remaining lifetime) time horizon from a starting age of 71 years. The company conducted the analysis from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services, and discounted costs and health effects at an annual rate of 3.5%. A half-cycle correction was applied to both costs and QALYs (with the exception of drug costs). The model design was based on previous economic analyses that were submitted to NICE (for example, apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non- valvular atrial fibrillation). 3.20 The health states in the company's model were defined by the clinical events considered to have a permanent impact on patients and were assumed to have an initial, as well a long-term, impact on costs, quality of life and mortality. The health states captured the main thrombotic events and adverse events of treatment including haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke (separated into mild, moderate and severe), systemic embolism and myocardial infarction. Health states were further subdivided into an initial health state (in which costs and quality of
