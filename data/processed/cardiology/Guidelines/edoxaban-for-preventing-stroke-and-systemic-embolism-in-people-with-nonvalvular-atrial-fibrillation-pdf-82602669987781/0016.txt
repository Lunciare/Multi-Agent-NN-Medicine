and ischaemic stroke (separated into mild, moderate and severe), systemic embolism and myocardial infarction. Health states were further subdivided into an initial health state (in which costs and quality of life associated with the acute event and the case fatality rate were applied in the month after the initial event), and a long-term health state in which ongoing event costs, quality of life and mortality were applied in each monthly cycle. Events that were considered to have no long-term impact in the model were other intracranial haemorrhage, non-intracranial haemorrhage major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major bleeds, and transient ischaemic attack. In the model, these events incurred costs and a disutility for the length of the event. 3.21 The monthly probability of each clinical outcome for edoxaban was estimated from annual event rates from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48. The transition probabilities for the comparators were obtained by applying the hazard ratio from the network meta-analysis for the intervention to the baseline probability. When there were no available data for a clinical outcome, it was assumed that the hazard ratio was equivalent to the hazard ratio estimated in the 'all patients' analysis. If there were no available data in the 'all patients' analysis, the
