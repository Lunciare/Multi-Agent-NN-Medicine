Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

the model was from another small UK study. The Committee noted that the ERG had identified a number of inconsistencies and had raised concerns about some of the sources of data used in the company model. However, the Committee noted that when the ERG's suggested revisions (alternative utility estimates for systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, and transient ischaemic attack) were applied, together with an amended age-adjusted utility decrement per year of -0.00646 instead of -0.00029 (see sections 3.40 and 3.41), they had only a minor impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The Committee concluded that the utility values used in the model, although open to debate, were not key drivers of the cost effectiveness. 4.12 The Committee considered the costs used in the company's model. It noted that costs for ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and systemic embolism were based on the Oxford Vascular Study (a cohort study of a UK population) and the costs were similar to those used in other NICE technology appraisals for atrial fibrillation (apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation; rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation; dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of
