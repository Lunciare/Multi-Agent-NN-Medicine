Edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

therapeutic range in the warfarin groups. The Committee also noted the ERG's concerns about the violation of the proportional hazards assumption in data from ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, from the trials of the other 3 newer oral anticoagulants, and in the warfarin groups of the 4 trials included in the network meta-analysis. It understood from the ERG that this meant that the hazard ratios produced by the network meta-analysis were not sufficiently robust to compare the relative clinical effectiveness of the newer oral anticoagulants. The Committee considered the results of the network meta-analysis in the light of the methodological issues and noted that all the newer oral anticoagulants appeared to have comparable efficacy for the composite primary and bleeding outcomes. The Committee concluded that the network meta-analysis results should be interpreted with caution, but edoxaban is unlikely to be different from rivaroxaban, apixaban and dabigatran etexilate in clinical practice. Cost effectiveness 4.9 The Committee considered the company's economic model. It noted that the economic analysis was largely based on the model used in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, which captured the main efficacy and adverse events of treatment.
