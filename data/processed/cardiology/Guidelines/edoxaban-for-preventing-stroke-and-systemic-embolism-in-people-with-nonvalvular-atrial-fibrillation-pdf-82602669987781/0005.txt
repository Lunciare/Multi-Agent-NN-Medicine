efficacy outcome was time to the first stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or systemic embolic event. People in the trial continued treatment and were followed up until approximately 672 primary efficacy endpoint events had been collected, which provided 87% power for confirming non-inferiority for each edoxaban regimen. A non-inferiority test using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population for the on-treatment period was pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan. To satisfy non-inferiority, the upper boundary of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of the primary efficacy endpoint comparing edoxaban with warfarin could not exceed 1.38, which was an estimate that preserved at least 50% of the benefit of warfarin over placebo. If edoxaban was shown to be statistically significantly non-inferior to warfarin, a superiority test would be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the overall study period. Clinical trial results 3.4 For the primary efficacy outcome (prevention of stroke or systemic embolic event) in the mITT analysis set (on-treatment and overall study period), edoxaban 60 mg/30 mg met the criteria for non-inferiority compared with warfarin. Stroke or a systemic embolic event occurred in 182 people in the edoxaban 60 mg/ 30 mg arm of the trial (1.18% per year)
