ERG considered that this approach minimised any potential bias resulting from differences in trial duration, which ranged from 1.8 years in ARISTOTLE (apixaban) to 2.8 years in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban). 3.18 The ERG noted that in addition to the violation of the proportional hazards assumption for some end points within ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, it was also violated within trials of the other 3 newer oral anticoagulants, and in the warfarin groups of the 4 trials included in the evidence network. The ERG highlighted that this meant the hazard ratios from the network meta-analysis were not reliable and should not be used to inform the company's economic model. Cost effectiveness 3.19 The company developed a Markov cohort model to compare edoxaban with warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with 1 or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or more, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and a CHADS 2 score of at least 2 (the baseline characteristics of ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48). The model consisted of 18 health states (patients entering the model with 'stable AF'), with 1-month cycles and a 30-year
