scheduled PCI. The manufacturer took the view that the trials were not comparable and, by inference, a comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor based on these trials was inappropriate and should be viewed with caution. The manufacturer noted that the PLATO and TRITON-TIMI 38 trials were similar in many ways, both including populations with ACS, both comparing the intervention plus aspirin to clopidogrel plus aspirin, and both sharing the same primary end point. However, there were important differences in the use of PCI and medical management, in the size and timing of the loading dose of clopidogrel, and in assessing myocardial infarction. Although the manufacturer considered the indirect comparison inappropriate, it cited a published paper based on the PLATO and TRITON-TIMI 38 trials that showed no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, death from any cause or the composite of these outcomes between the 2 drugs. Ticagrelor plus aspirin was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of major bleeding and major bleeding specifically associated with bypass grafting than prasugrel plus aspirin. The risk of major bleeding not related to CABG did not differ between patients taking prasugrel and those taking ticagrelor. 3.7 The PLATO trial included
