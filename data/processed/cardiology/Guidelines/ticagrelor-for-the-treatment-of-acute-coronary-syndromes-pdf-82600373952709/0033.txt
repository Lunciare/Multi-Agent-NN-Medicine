The Committee heard that in UK clinical practice people with NSTEMI are offered treatments depending on their GRACE or TIMI score; medical management is an option for people at lowest risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, whereas people at higher risk would be offered PCI and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that in the UK most people with NSTEMI undergo PCI. The Committee understood that of people in the UK with ACS, few have unstable angina and often do not need revascularisation, but do receive dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. The clinical specialists stated that in the UK it is unusual for a patient with STEMI to undergo CABG and that approximately 10% of patients with NSTEMI undergo CABG. Clinical effectiveness 4.3 The Committee considered the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel.
