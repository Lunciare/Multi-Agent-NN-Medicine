Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

only when using the 1-year time horizon, with an ICER of £33,764 per QALY gained. The manufacturer also presented base-case ICERs for the subgroups of ACS specified in the scope, which were £2,551 per QALY gained for STEMI, £5,217 per QALY gained for NSTEMI and £5,310 per QALY gained for unstable angina. 3.16 The manufacturer carried out deterministic sensitivity analyses to the base case and showed the effects of changing 43 model parameters. Only the change to the costs of the 'no further event' health state impacted substantially on the results. When the cost of the 'no further event' health state for ticagrelor plus aspirin was set to its lowest, ticagrelor plus aspirin dominated clopidogrel plus aspirin (that is, ticagrelor plus aspirin was more effective and less expensive than clopidogrel plus aspirin), whereas when the cost of the clopidogrel plus aspirin 'no further event' health state was set to its lowest, the ICER was £21,000 per QALY gained. Changes in all other parameters did not increase the ICER beyond £7,620. 3.17 The manufacturer ran scenario analyses for 0% and 6% discount rates, using published rather than PLATO-derived utility values, removing the 0.0328 downwards utility adjustment and removing the age-related decrease
