receive 12 months treatment with ticagrelor. The ERG also noted that for each patient category in the model, the resources used by each patient were calculated separately for each treatment arm, and these were multiplied by a corresponding unit cost and totalled for an estimated hospital- care cost per patient for the first 12-month period. The ERG had some concerns relating to this type of resource analysis, and conducted a combined analysis of resource use (taking the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups together), making some adjustments for double-counting of costs. Results suggested that the health state costs with ticagrelor were £100 lower (rather than £371 lower, as in the manufacturer's base-case) than the health state costs of clopidogrel, which would have the effect of doubling the estimated ICER at the 1-year time horizon. 3.31 The ERG noted that the manufacturer's base-case analysis estimated costs for the study drugs assuming 100% use in the trial period, despite evidence of deaths before the end of follow-up, treatment withdrawals, and poor adherence in some participants. The ERG instead incorporated data on drug use from the PLATO trial and noted that this reduced the average cost of both ticagrelor and clopidogrel substantially, and the difference
