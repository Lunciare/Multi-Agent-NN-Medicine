per QALY gained for STEMI, £7,215 per QALY gained for NSTEMI and £9,131 per QALY gained for unstable angina) represented the most plausible estimates for the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. The Committee noted that the ICERs produced with this analysis were within the range normally considered to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources and therefore ticagrelor plus low-dose aspirin should be recommended as a treatment option for up to 12 months in adults with ACS. However, the Committee agreed that the patient populations for STEMI and unstable angina needed to be further specified. 4.13 The Committee noted that the inclusion criteria in the PLATO trial for patients with STEMI, defined as ST elevation or new left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram, included the 'intention to perform primary PCI'. The Committee therefore agreed that only patients with STEMI that cardiologists intend to treat with primary PCI should be treated with ticagrelor. The Committee heard that there is a spectrum of severity with respect to unstable angina. The Committee was aware that in clinical practice in the UK a diagnosis of unstable angina could be made using less stringent criteria than those defined in the PLATO trial. The
