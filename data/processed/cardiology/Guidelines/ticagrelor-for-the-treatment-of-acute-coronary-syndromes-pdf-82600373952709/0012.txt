prasugrel plus aspirin, the manufacturer presented the results of a published indirect comparison of the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial and the PLATO trial, conducted by an independent group. 3.9 The manufacturer constructed a 2-part cost−utility model with a 1-year decision tree to model effectiveness based on data from the PLATO study, and a Markov model to extrapolate costs and benefits to a lifetime horizon (40 years), and to incorporate major clinical events. Patients in the model had ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina) and included patients whose condition was managed medically or with PCI or CABG; the model therefore reflected the marketing authorisation for ticagrelor. The model compared ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin. 3.10 The 1-year decision tree contained 4 mutually exclusive health states: non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, death from any cause, and no further event. The Markov model included 6 states: non-fatal myocardial infarction, post- myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, post-stroke, death, and no further event. Non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke were tunnel states, which allowed for a worse prognosis the first year after a non-fatal event compared with second and subsequent years. After the first year following a non-fatal event, patients proceeded to 1 of 4
