England and Wales, physicians typically categorise patients into lowest, low, intermediate, high and highest risk groups using the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) classification and treat them accordingly. 3.29 The ERG noted that the manufacturer adjusted the age of the modelled patients to reflect the UK population with ACS. The ERG noted potential problems with the methods chosen by the manufacturer, which may have led to inaccuracies. The ERG established that these inaccuracies represented an 8% underestimate of benefits from ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin and suggested that the ICER presented by the manufacturer may be an overestimate. 3.30 The ERG acknowledged that use of healthcare resources was estimated in the model using data from an imbedded health economic study, which collected details of hospital care received by patients during the PLATO trial. For the purposes of the model, only data for those patients in the 12-month cohort were included. This cohort comprised of patients who, based on timing of enrolment, had the potential to receive 12 months treatment with ticagrelor. The ERG also noted that for each patient category in the model, the resources used by each patient were calculated separately for each treatment
