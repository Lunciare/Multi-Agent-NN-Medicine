for ticagrelor plus aspirin are £3,407 per QALY gained for all patients, £3,551 per QALY gained for the STEMI group, £3,350 per QALY gained for the NSTEMI group and £3,405 per QALY gained for the group with unstable angina. Incorporating the least favourable combination of assumptions resulted in an estimated ICER for ticagrelor plus aspirin below £20,000 per QALY gained for each of the specified populations compared with 12 months' clopidogrel plus aspirin treatment. The central estimates from these sensitivity analyses were £7,897 per QALY gained for all patients, £8,872 per QALY gained for the STEMI group, £7,215 per QALY gained for the NSTEMI group and £9,131 for the subgroup with unstable angina. 3.33 The ERG noted that there are no head-to-head trial data comparing ticagrelor plus aspirin with prasugrel plus aspirin.
