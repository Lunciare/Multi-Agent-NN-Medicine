patients taking clopidogrel (13.8% versus 7.8% respectively; p<0.001). More patients taking ticagrelor plus aspirin discontinued treatment because of dyspnoea than patients taking clopidogrel plus aspirin (0.9% versus 0.1% respectively; p<0.001). Holter monitoring detected more ventricular pauses of 3 seconds or longer during the first week in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group than in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group, but these occurred infrequently at 30 days of treatment and were rarely associated with symptoms. Patients treated with ticagrelor had statistically significantly greater increases from baseline in levels of serum uric acid and serum creatinine compared with those on clopidogrel (p<0.001 for both events throughout the study). 3.6 The manufacturer identified no trials directly comparing ticagrelor plus aspirin with prasugrel plus aspirin. Instead, the manufacturer identified 2 trials comparing prasugrel plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin that provided data for an indirect comparison: the PLATO trial (ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin) and TRITON-TIMI 38, which compared prasugrel plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients (n=13,608) with ACS and scheduled PCI. The manufacturer took the view that the trials were not comparable and, by inference, a comparison between prasugrel and ticagrelor based on these trials was inappropriate and should
