immediately when a patient presents with symptoms. However, the Committee was concerned that a wrong diagnosis of unstable angina could result in the patient unnecessarily taking ticagrelor. The Committee therefore agreed that it would be appropriate to specify that before ticagrelor is continued beyond the initial treatment, the diagnosis of unstable angina should first be confirmed, ideally by a cardiologist. 4.14 The Committee noted the comments from consultees and commentators about whether 'lowest risk' patients (that is, patients who have a 6-month mortality of 1.5% or less as defined by the GRACE scoring system) should receive ticagrelor, given that NICE's previous guideline on unstable angina and NSTEMI (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) stipulates that these patients would not receive clopidogrel because the harms potentially outweigh the benefits. The Committee concluded that, because patients potentially suitable for treatment with ticagrelor with unstable angina must have at least 1 specific risk factor for myocardial infarction as well as ST-segment changes on electrocardiography, these patients would therefore not be classed as 'lowest risk'. 4.15 The Committee heard from the primary care trust expert that although treatment with ticagrelor relative to clopidogrel appeared cost effective within the range considered to
