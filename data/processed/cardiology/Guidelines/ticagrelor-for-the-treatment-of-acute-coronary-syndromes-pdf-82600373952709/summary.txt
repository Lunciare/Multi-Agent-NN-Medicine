1 Recommendations 1.1 Ticagrelor in combination with low-dose aspirin is recommended for up to 12 months as a treatment option in adults with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) that is, people: • with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) – defined as ST elevation or new left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram – that cardiologists intend to treat with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or • with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or • admitted to hospital with unstable angina – defined as ST or T wave changes on electrocardiogram suggestive of ischaemia plus 1 of the characteristics defined in section 1.2. Before ticagrelor is continued beyond the initial treatment, the diagnosis of unstable angina should first be confirmed, ideally by a cardiologist.
