(11.6% versus 11.2% respectively; p=0.43), or in the end point of bleeding defined by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scale. Both were analysed according to which treatment a patient took, rather than to which a patient had been randomised; these findings were consistent across all major subgroups. Patients randomised to ticagrelor experienced more overall major and minor bleeding (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.20; p=0.008) as well as more major bleeding not related to CABG (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38; p=0.03). Intracranial bleeding was more common in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group than in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group, with fatal intracranial bleeding statistically significantly more common in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group (HR not reported; p=0.02). Fatal bleeding excluding intracranial bleeding was statistically significantly more common in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group (HR not reported; p=0.03). There was no difference between the 2 groups in relation to overall fatal bleeding (0.3% in each group). Patients randomised to ticagrelor experienced dyspnoea statistically significantly more often than patients taking clopidogrel (13.8% versus 7.8% respectively; p<0.001). More patients taking ticagrelor plus aspirin discontinued treatment because of dyspnoea than patients taking clopidogrel plus aspirin (0.9% versus 0.1% respectively; p<0.001).
