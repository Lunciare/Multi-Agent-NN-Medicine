Although only 281 patients in the PLATO trial were from centres in the UK, the ERG considered that they were not dissimilar to other European participants. The ERG also noted that participants in the PLATO trial were younger than patients with ACS in England and Wales, but that the manufacturer's model accounted for this difference. 3.21 The ERG noted that for patients with STEMI not undergoing PCI, NICE recommends dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) for at least 4 weeks (from NICE's previous guideline on MI: secondary prevention, now replaced by NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction: cardiac rehabilitation and prevention of further cardiovascular disease). From statements in the 'clinical need and practice' and 'evidence and interpretation' sections of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease, the ERG concluded that standard practice for STEMI should include dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 months for patients undergoing revascularisation with bare-metal stents and 12 months for patients undergoing revascularisation with drug-eluting stents. 3.22 The ERG considered that the PLATO trial reflects current clinical practice and that all patients received antiplatelet treatment at a clinically appropriate dose.
