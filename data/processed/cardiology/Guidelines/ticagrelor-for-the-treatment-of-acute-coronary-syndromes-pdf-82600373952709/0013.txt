a worse prognosis the first year after a non-fatal event compared with second and subsequent years. After the first year following a non-fatal event, patients proceeded to 1 of 4 mutually exclusive health states: post-myocardial infarction, post-stroke, death or no further event. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. The Markov model used a half-cycle correction to adjust for simulated costs and outcomes. The model did not permit a patient to discontinue treatment for any reason other than death. 3.11 In the model, costs, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued beyond the first year of treatment with ticagrelor or clopidogrel; however, the model assumed that the beneficial effect of ticagrelor does not persist beyond 1 year. This means that the transition probabilities between states in the Markov model were the same for both treatment arms; the only difference between treatment arms was the number of patients who started the Markov model in each state, which was based on the output of the 1-year decision tree. Adverse events (notably bleeding) were not included in the structure of the model, but the increased costs and decreased health-related quality of life associated with adverse events recorded in PLATO (as part
