of myocardial infarction, stroke, severe recurrent cardiac ischaemia, recurrent cardiac ischaemia, transient ischaemic attack, other arterial thrombotic events and death from vascular causes. 3.3 The results showed that the relative risk of experiencing a primary end point event was 16% lower in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 0.92; p<0.001). Of the components of the primary end point, randomisation to ticagrelor plus aspirin reduced the incidence of myocardial infarction (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95; p=0.005) and death from vascular causes (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91; p=0.001), but not of stroke (HR 1.17; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.52). Randomisation to ticagrelor plus aspirin reduced the absolute risk of experiencing the primary end point from 11.7% to 9.8% at 12 months (absolute risk reduction 1.9%) compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin. 3.4 The manufacturer explored the consistency of effects and safety end points in 25 pre-specified subgroups and 8 post-hoc subgroups. An analysis was conducted of the primary end point in several predefined subgroups. The manufacturer's submission stated that analyses showed statistically significant differences in treatment efficacy in 3 groups: geographic region; body weight above or below
