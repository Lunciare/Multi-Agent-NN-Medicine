The Committee noted that no clear differences had been established on adherence between once-a-day clopidogrel and twice-a-day ticagrelor. The Committee noted comments from consultees and commentators that, particularly with a gastrointestinal bleed, the fast offset (time taken for ticagrelor to become inactive after it is stopped) could put a patient at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke more quickly than had the patient been taking clopidogrel, and with insufficient time to consult a cardiologist. However, the Committee heard from the manufacturer that missing a dose of ticagrelor would not result in a lower level of platelet activation than if the patient were treated with clopidogrel without missing a dose. The Committee heard that when a CABG is planned, the marketing authorisation recommends stopping ticagrelor 7 days before the procedure, suggesting that the offset is not as fast as had been suggested in the consultation comments.
