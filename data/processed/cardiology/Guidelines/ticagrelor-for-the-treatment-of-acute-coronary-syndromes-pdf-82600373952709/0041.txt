unstable angina are unlikely to benefit from ticagrelor because subgroup analysis shows benefit only for patients whose blood tests following the index event were positive for troponin. The Committee noted, however, that neither the test for interaction by clinical presentation of ACS nor the test for interaction by whether a patient had a positive or negative test for troponin were positive (p value for interaction 0.41 and 0.29 respectively). Lastly, no evidence of statistical or biological plausibility was presented to support effect modification by presentation of ACS, and there are no trials using ticagrelor for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the Committee concluded that providing specific recommendations only for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI and excluding those with unstable angina would be speculative, would counter the statistical evidence, and would risk excluding patients who could benefit from treatment with ticagrelor. 4.9 The Committee was aware of comments from consultees and commentators that the estimate of total mortality remained 'exploratory'. This was because the analysis plan for PLATO stated that secondary end points should be tested individually in a pre-specified order, so mortality should not have been included because it followed the non-statistically significant result for stroke.
