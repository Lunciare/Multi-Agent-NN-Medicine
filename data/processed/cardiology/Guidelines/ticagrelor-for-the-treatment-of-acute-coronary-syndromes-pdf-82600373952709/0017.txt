use and determined costs for all patients participating in the PLATO study by recording admissions to hospital, interventions, investigations, blood products, re-operations due to bleeding, and use of concomitant or study drugs to estimate total healthcare costs associated with ticagrelor and clopidogrel. Resource use included costs from randomisation to the time of discharge from hospital, as well as after discharge from hospital to the end of the PLATO study. The manufacturer also included in sensitivity analyses the costs of a visit to the GP and of a blood test to check renal function, as stipulated in the SPC for ticagrelor. 3.15 In its deterministic base case (40-year time horizon), the manufacturer's model estimated that ticagrelor provides an incremental health gain of 0.108 QALYs compared with clopidogrel, at an incremental cost of £379, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3,521 per QALY gained. The manufacturer also presented results using time horizons of 1 year, 5 years, 10 years and 20 years: the ICER differed substantially from the base-case ICER only when using the 1-year time horizon, with an ICER of £33,764 per QALY gained. The manufacturer also presented base-case ICERs for the subgroups of ACS specified in the scope,
