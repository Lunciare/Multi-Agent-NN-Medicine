more overall major and minor bleeding as well as more major bleeding not related to CABG. The Committee considered that the mortality benefit associated with ticagrelor outweighed the risks and concluded that ticagrelor was a clinically effective treatment option for people with ACS. 4.8 The Committee discussed whether ticagrelor plus aspirin would be more or less effective in any subgroups including patients with STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina. The Committee noted that several additional subgroups were presented in the trial. The Committee noted that among those defined in the scope (STEMI, NSTEMI, unstable angina) there was no statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity, consistent with no difference in effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel by clinical presentation of ACS. The Committee appreciated that the numbers of patients by subgroup may have been too small to detect a difference in effectiveness. The Committee heard from the manufacturer that it had not corrected for multiple comparisons when analysing the many subgroups. The Committee noted the comment from a consultee saying that patients with unstable angina are unlikely to benefit from ticagrelor because subgroup analysis shows benefit only for patients whose blood tests following the index event were positive for troponin. The Committee noted,
