myocardial infarction at any time during the decision-tree part of the model and remain in the non-fatal myocardial infarction health state to the end of the decision-tree part of the model, then progress to the 'post-myocardial infarction' state for all remaining cycles until death (whether from cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular causes). Similarly, patients may instead have a non-fatal stroke as their first event (after the initial presentation with ACS) during a cycle, and then progress to the post- stroke state until death. The ERG considered that this structure does not represent reality, because it does not allow patients to have more than 1 myocardial infarction, more than 1 stroke, or both myocardial infarctions and strokes in their lifetime following their initial presentation with ACS, and that this may bias future costs and benefits. The ERG also noted that the model simplified the natural history of treated cardiovascular disease by keeping constant the transition probability of previously event-free patients (since initial treatment for ACS) experiencing a non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke throughout the long-term Markov model. The modelling ignored the increase in risk associated with other factors, notably, increasing age. The ERG considered that this omission may have led to the manufacturer's
