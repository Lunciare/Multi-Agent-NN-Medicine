the comparison of ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin, the manufacturer identified 1 trial, the PLATO trial, an international, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, phase 3 study. The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin over 12 months in people with ACS whose symptoms began up to 24 hours before their admission to hospital. In the trial, 18,624 adult patients with ACS with or without ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram from 43 countries including 18 UK centres (n=281) were admitted to hospital, and randomised to either ticagrelor plus aspirin (n=9,333) or clopidogrel plus aspirin (n=9,291). In the ticagrelor group, patients received a loading dose of 180 mg of ticagrelor, then 90 mg twice a day. Patients randomised to clopidogrel received loading doses of 300 to 600 mg of clopidogrel, then 75 mg every day thereafter. Patients did not need loading doses of clopidogrel if they had taken clopidogrel before admission or had received clopidogrel after admission but before randomisation (median approximately 5 hours). In the time between admission and randomisation, 46% of patients in both the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups received clopidogrel. All patients also received aspirin (in addition to ticagrelor
