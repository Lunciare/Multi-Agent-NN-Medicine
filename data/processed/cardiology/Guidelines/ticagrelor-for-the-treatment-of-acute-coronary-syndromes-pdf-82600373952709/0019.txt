Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

3.17 The manufacturer ran scenario analyses for 0% and 6% discount rates, using published rather than PLATO-derived utility values, removing the 0.0328 downwards utility adjustment and removing the age-related decrease in utility per cycle. The results of the scenario analyses showed that the ICER for ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin ranged from £2,358 to £4,699 per QALY gained. 3.18 The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that at £5,000 per QALY gained, the probability of ticagrelor plus aspirin being cost effective compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin was 76.6%. At £20,000 per QALY gained, the probability of ticagrelor plus aspirin being cost effective compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin was 99.9%. 3.19 The manufacturer's submission also provided results for ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with prasugrel plus aspirin for the subgroup receiving PCI, based on the results of a published indirect comparison of the PLATO and TRITON-TIMI 38 trials. Because of the small proportion of patients who participated in the TRITON-TIMI 38 substudy of quality of life (EQ-5D was collected in only 461 of 13,608 patients at baseline), the model incorporated utility information from the literature, rather than from the substudy. If costs from the PLATO-HECON substudy were not available, the manufacturer
