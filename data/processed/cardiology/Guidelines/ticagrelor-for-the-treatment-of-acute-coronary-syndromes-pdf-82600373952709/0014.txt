(notably bleeding) were not included in the structure of the model, but the increased costs and decreased health-related quality of life associated with adverse events recorded in PLATO (as part of PLATO-HECON) were included in the first year (decision tree) of the model. The manufacturer assumed that adverse events including bleeding and dyspnoea have no lasting effects beyond the 12-month duration of the trial. To model the incidence of cardiovascular complications beyond 1 year (in the Markov component of the model), the manufacturer assumed a constant probability of 3.15% per year for non-fatal myocardial infarction and 1.02% per year for non-fatal stroke. The risk of death from MI after the index event (STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina) was assumed to be the same as that of death at least 1 year after the index ACS event. 3.12 For the 1-year decision tree, the manufacturer used a parametric time-to-event survival model with a Weibull distribution to determine the baseline risk (that is, the risk of cardiovascular events and death in the clopidogrel group). The manufacturer then applied HRs reflective of the effectiveness of ticagrelor from the PLATO study to this baseline risk to determine the risk in patients taking ticagrelor. Using
