primary end point in several predefined subgroups. The manufacturer's submission stated that analyses showed statistically significant differences in treatment efficacy in 3 groups: geographic region; body weight above or below a gender-specific median; and use of lipid-lowering drugs at randomisation. The HRs by type of ACS at presentation – unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI – were 0.96 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.22), 0.83 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.94) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.98) respectively with a non-statistically significant test for interaction (p=0.41). The manufacturer presented 6 analyses in subgroups that included patients whose condition was managed invasively, managed medically, patients with STEMI, patients with diabetes, patients with genetic polymorphisms, and patients undergoing CABG. The results of these 6 subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the primary analysis. 3.5 The manufacturer reported adverse events from the PLATO study, specifically bleeding, dyspnoea and ventricular pauses. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary safety end point of 'major' bleeding between the ticagrelor plus aspirin and clopidogrel plus aspirin groups (11.6% versus 11.2% respectively; p=0.43), or in the end point of bleeding defined by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scale. Both were analysed according to which treatment a patient
