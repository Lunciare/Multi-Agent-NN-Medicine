end point was inconsistent with the concept that the effect of a treatment should have an effect of similar magnitude and direction on all components of a primary end point. For example, in the PLATO study, the HR for stroke (non-significantly higher with ticagrelor) differed from those for myocardial infarction and death from vascular causes (significantly lower with ticagrelor). The ERG concluded that the results of the overall composite end point should be interpreted cautiously. The ERG also noted that the manufacturer excluded 'silent' myocardial infarctions (defined as new or presumed pathological Q waves on ECG in the absence of symptoms). The ERG considered that the secondary end points and their components reflected those used in other cardiovascular trials. 3.23 The ERG noted that the manufacturer tested whether the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin differed across 25 pre-specified and 8 post-hoc subgroups, without adjustment for multiple comparisons. The ERG expressed concern about the large number of subgroups and potential overemphasis of any statistically significant results from these analyses, which might have occurred by chance alone. With these caveats noted, the ERG observed that the regional analysis showed that in the USA, patients randomised
