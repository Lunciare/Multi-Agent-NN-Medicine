Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

which ticagrelor is licensed and the subgroups. The Committee was aware of the concerns raised by the ERG around the structure of the model adopted in the manufacturer's submission, and agreed that the assumption that patients could not experience multiple cardiovascular events over-simplified the clinical course of patients with ACS. The Committee noted that if the model had included the possibility of more than 1 cardiovascular event after the index event, and had accounted for the increased risk of a cardiovascular event associated with having had prior events, then the ICERs for ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel would be lower than in the manufacturer's base case. This is because at the end of the 1-year decision tree, more patients on clopidogrel than on ticagrelor had experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke, and were therefore at higher risk of experiencing another event. The Committee was aware of the ERG's concerns over the method used to adjust for age, but agreed that this would not result in major changes to the ICERs. The Committee also noted that it would have been more appropriate to incorporate a utility value that reflected clinical practice rather than modelling the average utility score, but acknowledged that this
