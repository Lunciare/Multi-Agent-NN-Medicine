participants. The ERG instead incorporated data on drug use from the PLATO trial and noted that this reduced the average cost of both ticagrelor and clopidogrel substantially, and the difference in drug costs of ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin reduced from £651 to £507 per patient. Applying the ERG's amended age adjustment, resource use, and costs of study drugs to the manufacturer's model resulted in a 42% increase in the manufacturer's ICER for the 1-year time horizon from £36,177 to £51,204 per QALY gained. However, the ERG emphasised that both the incremental costs and additional benefits associated with ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin were very small at longer time horizons, and subject to considerable uncertainty. 3.32 The ERG conducted a wide-ranging sensitivity analysis, calculating overall deterministic cost-effectiveness estimates for all combinations of 4 long-term variables – survival gain at 12 months, life expectancy at 12 months, the mean long-term utility value and the mean long-term discounted cost per patient year. The most favourable ICERs for ticagrelor plus aspirin are £3,407 per QALY gained for all patients, £3,551 per QALY gained for the STEMI group, £3,350 per QALY gained for the NSTEMI group and £3,405
