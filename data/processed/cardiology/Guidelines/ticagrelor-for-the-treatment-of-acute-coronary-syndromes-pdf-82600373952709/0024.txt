significant results from these analyses, which might have occurred by chance alone. With these caveats noted, the ERG observed that the regional analysis showed that in the USA, patients randomised to ticagrelor plus aspirin did worse than those randomised to clopidogrel plus aspirin. 3.24 For patients with STEMI who receive bare-metal stents, the ERG highlighted concerns about the comparator treatment included in the economic evaluation. It interpreted NICE's technology appraisal guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease as stating that dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 months was standard practice for patients undergoing revascularisation with bare-metal stents, whereas for patients undergoing revascularisation with drug- eluting stents, NICE's previous guideline on MI: secondary prevention (now replaced by NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction: cardiac rehabilitation and prevention of further cardiovascular disease) recommends dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months. Another concern of the ERG was that the manufacturer treated the STEMI group as a homogeneous population and estimated a single ICER. By contrast, the ERG believed that STEMI has 4 distinct populations differing by treatment: STEMI with medical management, STEMI revascularised with drug-eluting stent, STEMI revascularised with bare-metal stent and STEMI with other intervention (for example, CABG). 3.25 The ERG
