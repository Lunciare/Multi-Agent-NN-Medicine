5 hours). In the time between admission and randomisation, 46% of patients in both the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups received clopidogrel. All patients also received aspirin (in addition to ticagrelor or clopidogrel) with a loading dose of 325 mg, then 75 to 100 mg daily. Patients already taking aspirin did not need a loading dose of aspirin. 3.2 The primary end point was time to first event (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or death from vascular causes). The planned duration of treatment and follow-up was 12 months. If before this time 1,780 individuals had a primary end point event, then patients who had not yet been followed for 12 months would finish the study at their 6 or 9-month visit. At the end of the trial, 1,878 participants had experienced events, and the median duration of treatment was 9.1 months. Secondary end points included: myocardial infarction; stroke; death from vascular causes; death from any cause; a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and death from any cause; and a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, severe recurrent cardiac ischaemia, recurrent cardiac ischaemia, transient ischaemic attack, other arterial thrombotic events and death from vascular causes. 3.3 The results showed that the relative
