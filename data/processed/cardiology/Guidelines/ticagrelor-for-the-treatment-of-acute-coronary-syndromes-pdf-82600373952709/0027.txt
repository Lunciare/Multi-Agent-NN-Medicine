Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

the long-term Markov model. The modelling ignored the increase in risk associated with other factors, notably, increasing age. The ERG considered that this omission may have led to the manufacturer's model inaccurately estimating future events, costs and progressive changes in the outcomes and quality of life of patients. 3.27 The ERG was concerned that the model applied an average utility score for the first year, whereas clinical experience showed that ACS patients experience an initial decline in utility that steadily improves. Therefore, the ERG noted that the ICER at 12 months may be an underestimate. 3.28 The ERG noted that in the manufacturer's submission the subgroups of interest in the economic evaluation did not reflect the subgroups of interest in the clinical section. The ERG could not verify the estimates of clinical effectiveness used in the manufacturer's model ascribed to ticagrelor in patients with NSTEMI or unstable angina. The ERG also noted that the manufacturer considered the subgroup with unstable angina as a homogeneous group whereas, in clinical practice in England and Wales, physicians typically categorise patients into lowest, low, intermediate, high and highest risk groups using the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) classification and treat them accordingly.
