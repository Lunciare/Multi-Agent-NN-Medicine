The Committee discussed the concerns about safety and adverse effects associated with ticagrelor. The Committee heard that dyspnoea (shortness of breath), ventricular pauses, increases in serum uric acid and increases in serum creatinine from baseline were statistically significantly more common in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group, and noted that patients randomised to ticagrelor were more likely to discontinue the study drug because of adverse reactions. The Committee heard from the patient experts that dyspnoea frustrated patients with ACS and the clinical specialists stated that a patient randomised to ticagrelor was 9 times as likely to discontinue the study because of dyspnoea as a patient randomised to clopidogrel, but that the absolute risk, at less than 1%, was small. The Committee heard from the manufacturer that the effects of dyspnoea were limited mainly to mild episodes. The Committee noted no statistically significant difference in the primary safety end point of major bleeding between ticagrelor plus aspirin and clopidogrel plus aspirin but that patients on ticagrelor plus aspirin experienced more overall major and minor bleeding as well as more major bleeding not related to CABG. The Committee considered that the mortality benefit associated with ticagrelor outweighed the risks and
