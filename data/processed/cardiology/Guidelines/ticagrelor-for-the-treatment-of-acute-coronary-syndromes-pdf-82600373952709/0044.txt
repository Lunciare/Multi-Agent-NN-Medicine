Committee also noted that it would have been more appropriate to incorporate a utility value that reflected clinical practice rather than modelling the average utility score, but acknowledged that this too was unlikely to have a large impact on the ICERs. The Committee noted comments from consultees that the adverse event profile should be fully built into the structure of the economic model. The Committee was aware that the 1-year decision tree part of the economic model took account of all costs and changes in quality of life associated with the adverse events of treatment. 4.12 The Committee was aware of the ERG's concerns about the manufacturer's method of estimating resource use and costs. It was aware that these limitations could skew the differences in total costs between the 2 treatment arms. The Committee accepted the ERG's adjustments to the manufacturer's model and noted the resulting estimates of cost effectiveness. The Committee agreed that the central ICERs from the ERG's sensitivity analysis (£7,897 per QALY gained for all ACS, £8,872 per QALY gained for STEMI, £7,215 per QALY gained for NSTEMI and £9,131 per QALY gained for unstable angina) represented the most plausible estimates for the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor
