distinct populations differing by treatment: STEMI with medical management, STEMI revascularised with drug-eluting stent, STEMI revascularised with bare-metal stent and STEMI with other intervention (for example, CABG). 3.25 The ERG stated that as the trial was designed to test the efficacy of 12 months of treatment, all patients should have been treated for 12 months. The ERG noted that the PLATO trial design did not involve uniform duration of treatment, instead, the protocol stipulated that patients could leave the study at their 6- or 9-month visit if a predetermined number of primary end-point events had occurred by that time. Approximately 44% of patients were followed up for 12 months in the trial. This increased the uncertainty in the estimates of effectiveness at the conclusion of the trial, which in turn was the prime driver of the Markov model and, therefore, the long-term benefits for patients. 3.26 The ERG noted that the model featured 2 separate paths. In 1 path, after first presentation with ACS, patients may have a subsequent non-fatal myocardial infarction at any time during the decision-tree part of the model and remain in the non-fatal myocardial infarction health state to the end of the decision-tree part of the
