Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

evidence for the clinical effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. The Committee noted that the manufacturer based its submission on a large trial, PLATO, which compared ticagrelor plus aspirin with clopidogrel plus aspirin. The Committee noted that ticagrelor plus aspirin reduced the relative risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and death from vascular causes by 16% compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin. The Committee also noted that if the components of the primary end point were considered individually, the reductions in myocardial infarction and death from vascular causes were statistically significant (16% and 21% respectively) for patients randomised to the ticagrelor plus aspirin group. The Committee also noted the non-statistically significant increase in the incidence of stroke, in particular haemorrhagic stroke, in patients randomised to the ticagrelor group. The Committee considered the clinical evidence for ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin in the subgroups of patients that were specified in the scope (STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina) and noted that the test for interaction showed no statistical difference between the groups (p=0.41), interpreting this as no difference in the effectiveness between treatments by clinical presentation of ACS. The Committee noted that the manufacturer had performed a large substudy of quality
