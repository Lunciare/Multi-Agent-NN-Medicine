and NSTEMI patients would receive PCI. The Committee was also aware that results of the PLATO study showed no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between the patients whose condition was managed medically or otherwise. The Committee concluded that the trial was broadly reflective of clinical practice in the UK. 4.5 The Committee was aware that nearly half (46%) of all patients in the study received clopidogrel in hospital before randomisation, and that of those randomised to clopidogrel, only approximately one-fifth received a loading dose in the range (600 to 675 mg) recommended in the UK (600 mg). The Committee also noted that not all patients in the PLATO trial received treatment for 12 months and that the median duration of treatment was 9 months. The Committee heard that the results presented included those censored before 12 months. The Committee noted that the Kaplan–Meier curves depicting the 2 arms of the trial separated as early as 1 month and up to 1 year and, therefore, concluded that neither the difference in loading doses of clopidogrel nor censoring was likely to have substantially biased the results. 4.6 The Committee understood that ticagrelor is administered twice a day compared with once a day
