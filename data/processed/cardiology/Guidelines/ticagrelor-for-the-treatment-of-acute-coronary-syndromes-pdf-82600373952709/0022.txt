drug-eluting stents. 3.22 The ERG considered that the PLATO trial reflects current clinical practice and that all patients received antiplatelet treatment at a clinically appropriate dose. The ERG was satisfied with the manufacturer's means of categorising adverse events from bleeding. The ERG expressed concerns about the components of the primary efficacy end point in the PLATO trial. Firstly, the primary end point was inconsistent with the concept that all components of an end point should be of similar importance to patients. For example, the average utility values from the 12-month cohort in the PLATO-HECON study used in the manufacturer's model differed by end point and were 0.246 for death from a vascular cause, 0.812 for myocardial infarction and 0.736 for stroke. Secondly, the primary end point was inconsistent with the concept that all components of an end point occur with similar frequencies. For example, in 18,624 participants there were 795 vascular deaths, 1,097 myocardial infarctions and 231 strokes during the median 9.1-month follow-up in the PLATO study. Thirdly, the primary end point was inconsistent with the concept that the effect of a treatment should have an effect of similar magnitude and direction on all components of a primary end point.
