Ticagrelor for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes

clopidogrel group). The manufacturer then applied HRs reflective of the effectiveness of ticagrelor from the PLATO study to this baseline risk to determine the risk in patients taking ticagrelor. Using data in the 1-year decision tree derived from the PLATO study, the manufacturer estimated from patients in the clopidogrel group age-adjusted event rates (myocardial infarction, stroke, death from any cause and death from vascular causes) for a UK population with ACS (mean age of PLATO patients, 62.2 years; reported age of UK patients with ACS in 2009 to 2010, 69.7 years). In the Markov model, the transition probabilities from the no event health state to each of the non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke health states were estimated from a study that the manufacturer commissioned from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project and the General Practice Research Database. The probabilities of transitioning between all other health states were based on relative risks applied to the probability of death in standard life tables. 3.13 The manufacturer used the 12-month cohort (patients who were eligible for a 12-month follow-up) in the PLATO-HECON study to calculate the utility accrued in the study and reported it as the average utility value for a patient
