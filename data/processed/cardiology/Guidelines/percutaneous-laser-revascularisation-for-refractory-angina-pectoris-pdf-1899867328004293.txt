Percutaneous laser
revascularisation for refractory
angina pectoris
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 27 May 2009
www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg302
Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful

Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris (IPG302)
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.
1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on percutaneous laser revascularisation (PLR) for
refractory angina pectoris shows no efficacy and suggests that the
procedure may pose unacceptable safety risks. Therefore, this procedure
should not be used.
2 The procedure
2.1 Indications and current treatments
2.1.1 Angina pectoris is chest discomfort, often described as pressure or pain,
typically occurring on exertion. It is caused by inadequate delivery of
oxygen to the heart muscle, usually because of coronary artery disease.
Refractory angina is a severe angina form that cannot be controlled by
normal medical or surgical treatment.
2.1.2 Angina treatment depends on symptoms, medical history and
angiography findings. Treatments include anti-anginal medication and
revascularisation interventions (percutaneous coronary intervention or
coronary artery bypass surgery). For patients with refractory angina,
these treatments have either failed or are not clinically suitable.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris is
carried out with the patient under local anaesthesia. A catheter is

Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris (IPG302)
inserted through the femoral artery, and advanced to the heart under
fluoroscopic guidance. Ischaemic areas are selected for treatment using
echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scan and coronary
angiography. A laser device is then used to create a number of channels
in the myocardium.
2.2.2 A number of different types of laser can be used for this procedure.
2.3 Efficacy
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in
the published literature and which the Committee considered as part of the evidence
about this procedure. For more detailed information on the evidence, see the
systematic review.
2.3.1 A meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1040
patients reported no difference in mortality at 12-month follow-up
between PLR-treated patients and medically managed patients (three
RCTs), spinal cord stimulation (one RCT) or sham therapy (two RCTs)
(pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32 to 1.7).
2.3.2 An RCT of 298 patients reported no difference in mean myocardial
perfusion test score (using single photon emission computed
tomography [SPECT] imaging; scoring system not described) between
patients treated with high-dose PLR (defined as 20–25 laser pulses),
low-dose PLR (defined as 10–15 laser pulses) or sham therapy (17.7
points, 19.3 points and 17.3 points, respectively at 6-month follow-up [p
= 0.35]).
2.3.3 An RCT of 221 patients comparing PLR with medical management
reported no difference in mean left ventricular ejection fraction between
PLR-treated patients (median 51%) and medically managed patients
(median 50%) at 3-month follow-up (significance not stated). An RCT of
82 patients reported no difference in mean left ventricular ejection
fraction between patients treated with PLR (64%) and sham therapy
(63%) at 12-month follow-up (significance not stated).

2.3.4 A meta-analysis of three RCTs reported no difference in post-procedural
exercise tolerance using the Bruce Protocol Stress Test (a treadmill test)
in patients treated with PLR compared with other interventions. A meta-
analysis of five RCTs reported that exercise tolerance for PLR-treated
patients was 17.7 seconds greater than in patients treated with
comparators at 12-month follow-up (95% CI 4.4 to 31.0). When only
studies with adequate patient blinding to allocated treatment were
included in the meta-analysis, exercise tolerance differences at either 6
or 12 months were not significant.
2.3.5 In the RCTs of 298 and 141 patients there was no difference in the
proportion of patients whose Canadian Cardiac Society Angina (CCSA)
score improved by two or more classes at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.33).
In an RCT of 82 patients, the proportion of patients with an improved
CCSA score of two or more classes compared with baseline was not
significantly different from patients treated with sham therapy at
12-month follow-up (35% [14/40]; 14% [6/42], respectively) (p = 0.04).
2.3.6 Specialist Advisers listed the key efficacy outcome as reduction of
angina, which may or not be associated with objective measures,
including improvement of perfusion scans, angina status and exercise
capacity.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 A meta-analysis of five RCTs including 819 patients reported no
difference in mortality (up to 30-day follow-up) between PLR-treated
patients and medically managed patients (three RCTs), spinal cord
stimulation (one RCT) or sham therapy (two RCTs) (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.4 to
4.9).
2.4.2 In six RCTs including 938 patients, the pooled myocardial infarction rate
was higher in PLR-treated patients (7% [34/515]) than in the control
groups (4% [17/423]). One RCT of 221 patients reported higher left
bundle branch block rates following PLR (5% [5/110]) compared with
medical management (1% [1/111]) (significance and follow-up not stated).
2.4.3 Randomised controlled trials of 298 and 221 patients reported left

Percutaneous laser revascularisation for refractory angina pectoris (IPG302)
ventricular perforation rates of 1% (2/196) and 3% (3/110), respectively, in
PLR-treated patients (none were reported in patients treated with
comparators; events occurring during 30-day follow-up or within 24
hours, respectively; significance not stated for either). In a case series of
25 patients treated with PLR, the myocardial perforation rate was 4% (1/
25). A case series of 30 patients treated with PLR reported that 3% (1/
30) of patients had pericardial tamponade during the procedure.
2.4.4 Among four RCTs, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack
occurred more frequently in patients treated with PLR (4% [10/285]) than
in patients in the control arms of the studies (2% [5/287]) (significance
and follow-up not stated).
2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers listed adverse events reported in the literature as
myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and puncture site complications. They
considered theoretical adverse events to include death, perforation of
the cardiac muscle, damage to coronary arteries or other important
structures, stroke and pericardial effusion.
