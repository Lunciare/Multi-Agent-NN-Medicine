lithotripsy may be an efficient approach to managing calcified coronary arteries and may lead to better stent placement and improved patient outcomes. The procedure 2.4 In this procedure, intravascular lithotripsy is administered to the calcified coronary artery before the stent is placed during PCI. 2.5 A percutaneous guidewire is passed through a catheter inserted from the radial or femoral artery into the coronary artery. Then, an intravascular lithotripsy catheter with embedded emitters enclosed in an integrated angioplasty balloon is passed and connected to an external generator with a cable. The catheter is advanced to the target lesion guided by X-ray imaging of radio-opaque markers on the catheter. The balloon is then inflated with a saline and contrast solution to ensure contact with the vessel wall. The lithotripsy cycle is then started. For every cycle, the catheter emits localised, high-energy, pulsatile, unfocused, circumferential, sonic, pressure waves (lasting microseconds). These waves pass through the inflated balloon into the wall of the coronary artery. As the waves travel into the wall and the connective tissue, they disrupt calcium deposits (both intimal and medial) by micro-fracturing the calcified lesions. The balloon is then deflated to allow blood supply to return to the heart. 2.6
