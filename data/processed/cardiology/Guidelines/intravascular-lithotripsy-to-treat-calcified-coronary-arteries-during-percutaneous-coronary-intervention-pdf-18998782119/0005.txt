outcomes to be: improved quality of life, reduced major cardiovascular events and coronary artery patency. 3.3 The professional experts and the committee considered the key safety outcomes to be: potential risk of coronary rupture and myocardial infarction. 3.4 Patient commentary was sought but none was received. Committee comments 3.5 The committee noted that: • the incidence of coronary artery calcification in people having percutaneous coronary intervention is increasing • the importance of calcification is more recognised • CT coronary angiography may show the presence of calcification so intravascular lithotripsy can be planned beforehand if the percutaneous coronary intervention is being done electively • the number of procedures recorded in the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) database has increased rapidly over the past few years. 3.6 The committee was informed that: • there is more research being done on using intravascular lithotripsy for eccentric calcified lesions • this procedure may result in less distal embolisation than other procedures used to manage calcification.
