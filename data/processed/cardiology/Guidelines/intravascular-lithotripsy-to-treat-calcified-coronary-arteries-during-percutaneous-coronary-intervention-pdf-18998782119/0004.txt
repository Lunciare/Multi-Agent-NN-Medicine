connective tissue, they disrupt calcium deposits (both intimal and medial) by micro-fracturing the calcified lesions. The balloon is then deflated to allow blood supply to return to the heart. 2.6 The cycle can be repeated until the lesion has expanded enough to allow optimal stent placement or the total pulses available are used. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 14 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included is based on about 8,300 people from 2 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 small randomised controlled trial, 2 pooled analyses of prospective studies, 5 prospective studies, 2 retrospective cohort studies and 2 case reports. It is presented in the summary of key evidence section in the interventional procedures overview. Other relevant literature is in the appendix of the overview. 3.2 The professional experts and the committee considered the key efficacy outcomes to be: improved quality of life, reduced major cardiovascular events and coronary artery patency. 3.3 The professional experts and the committee considered the key safety outcomes to be: potential
