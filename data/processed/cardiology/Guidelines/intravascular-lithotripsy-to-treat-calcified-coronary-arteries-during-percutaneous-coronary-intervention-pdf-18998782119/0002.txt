in-stent restenosis • high rates of stent thrombosis • the need for subsequent target lesion revascularisation after endovascular interventions. Current treatments 2.2 Standard endovascular treatment options for modifying calcium or plaque during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) include balloon angioplasty using standard or high-pressure non-compliant balloons; cutting or scoring balloons; and stenting with or without coronary atherectomy (such as rotational, orbital or laser atherectomy). These treatments aim to allow optimal stent expansion and achieve maximal luminal gain. But they may sometimes lead to localised wall injury, balloon rupture or the risk of coronary vessel dissections or perforation. Intravascular lithotripsy is another endovascular treatment option for PCI. Unmet need 2.3 Addressing calcified coronary lesions during PCI presents a significant challenge. Calcified plaques can hinder stent deployment and expansion, increasing the risk of complications such as arterial dissection or inadequate stent expansion. Existing options for managing heavily calcified coronary arteries during PCI such as balloon angioplasty may not be effective in fracturing severe calcifications. By using sonic waves to fracture calcium deposits, intravascular lithotripsy may be an efficient approach to managing calcified coronary arteries and may lead to better stent placement and improved patient outcomes. The procedure 2.4 In this procedure, intravascular lithotripsy
