ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on The Management of Chronic and Acute Heart Failure:

breathlessness or fatigue, that may appear alongside signs such as swollen ankles, caused by something wrong in the heart. Heart failure can be acute (comes on quickly and severely, requiring urgent attention) or chronic (long-lasting, with the coming-and-going of symptoms). This document mainly refers to chronic heart failure. Types of Heart Failure Heart failure occurs when the pumping action of the heart is impaired. This impairment may be mild or severe. Generally, there are three types of chronic heart failure based on the amount of blood that is pumped out of the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, during each heartbeat. This is known as the ‘left ventricular ejection fraction’. The three types of chronic heart failure are: • Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) • Heart Failure with mildly reduced Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF) • Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) HFrEF HFmrEF HFpEF Left ventricular ≤ 40 (less or equal 41%-49% ≥ 50% (greater or ejection fraction to) equal to) Changes in In HFrEF, the heart HFmrEF is between In HFpEF, the heart heart structure is usually enlarged HFrEF and HFpEF is less enlarged compared with a than in HFrEF; the normal heart and left ventricle
