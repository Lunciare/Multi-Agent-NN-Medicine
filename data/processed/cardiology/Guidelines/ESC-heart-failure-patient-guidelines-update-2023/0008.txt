ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on The Management of Chronic and Acute Heart Failure:

with HFrEF: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), beta-blockers (BB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. The table below explains how the different medicines work: Type of medicine What it does Angiotensin converting enzyme Relax blood vessels and reduce how hard the inhibitors (ACE-I) heart has to work Angiotensin receptor neprilysin Work in a similar way to ACE-I (above) and inhibitors (ARNI) have additional heart-protective effects Beta-blockers (BB) Slow down the heart so that it doesn’t have to work as hard, and protect the heart from future heart attacks Mineralocorticoid receptor Reduce build-up of fluid and sodium, reducing antagonists (MRA) scarring of heart muscle, and thus protect the heart Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 Help remove fluid and sodium, protecting the (SGLT2) inhibitors heart and kidneys2 You may also receive other types of medications to control your symptoms or improve your condition, e.g., diuretics (‘water pills’, which help your body get rid of salt [sodium] and water) are recommended to reduce excess fluid and lower pressures within the heart. Medications for People with HFmrEF Most research into medication for people living with heart failure has been focused on treatment of people with HFrEF. However, for
