Diagnosis of Heart Failure To be diagnosed with heart failure, you must have symptoms and/or signs of heart failure as well as abnormalities and functional problems in the heart as seen on tests. The types of tests and investigations you may have to diagnose your condition are shown below: Blood tests, Electrocardiogram (ECG), X-ray Echocardiogram (echo), such as BNP/ checks electrical activity of ultrasound of the heart NT-proBNP the heart These tests will identify which type of heart failure you have (HFrEF, HFmrEF, or HFpEF) and guide the appropriate course of treatment. You may need further tests for better evaluation of the features of your heart failure and how your condition will develop. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is sometimes used instead of or with an echo to identify particular characteristics of the heart, including scarring of the heart muscle. The types of treatments that you receive will be chosen depending on how much help your heart needs to function. The more that is known about your diagnosis, the better your doctors can personalise your treatment options, which may improve your symptoms and/or outcomes. Severity
