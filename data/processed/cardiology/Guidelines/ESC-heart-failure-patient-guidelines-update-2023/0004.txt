HFmrEF is between In HFpEF, the heart heart structure is usually enlarged HFrEF and HFpEF is less enlarged compared with a than in HFrEF; the normal heart and left ventricle is pumping weakly smaller compared with the HFrEF heart and stiffened Changes in The left ventricle fills with higher pressure than is normal. heart function There is higher pressure in the lungs, veins and liver that can lead to breathlessness and/or oedema (swelling) The changes associated with each type of chronic heart failure are shown below: Left ventricle Right ventricle Normal heart Left Left ventricle Right ventricle Right ventricle ventricle Weakened Stiffened heart muscle heart muscle HFrEF HFpEF Advanced Heart Failure Advanced heart failure is a development of chronic heart failure when symptoms cannot be fully controlled despite maximum therapy. This is sometimes referred to as ‘resistance to treatment’. Advanced heart failure is different from when acute heart failure arises in a patient with chronic heart failure, which describes the rapid onset of a change in heart function that requires urgent attention.
