Percutaneous deep venous arterialisation for chronic limb-threatening ischaemia

support clinicians to collect and report data on outcomes and safety for everyone having this procedure. • Regularly review data on outcomes and safety for this procedure. 1.4 Further research should report: • details of patient selection (including number of patients dependent on dialysis) • details of the procedure technique • duration of anticoagulation • patient outcomes (including planned and unplanned reintervention rate, major amputation rate, and quality of life). Why the committee made these recommendations The evidence is limited in quality and quantity; in particular, long-term data and quality of life data are lacking. The evidence includes different procedure techniques and different ways of selecting patients who have no other options for arterial revascularisation (restoring blood flow to a body part in which the blood vessels have become blocked). So, in people who have limited treatment options, this procedure can be used with special arrangements. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia of the lower extremities is caused by severely narrowed or blocked arteries. It is an advanced stage of peripheral arterial disease. The severely reduced blood supply causes ischaemic pain, ulceration, tissue loss and gangrene. It is associated with high amputation and
