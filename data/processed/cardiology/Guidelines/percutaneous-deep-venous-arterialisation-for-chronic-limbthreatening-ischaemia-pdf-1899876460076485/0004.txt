Percutaneous deep venous arterialisation for chronic limb-threatening ischaemia

common femoral artery, and retrograde venous access is established through the tibial vein. Arterial and venous catheters are inserted and advanced to the target artery and vein (most frequently the posterior tibial artery and vein). Once both catheters are positioned with a crossover point, a needle is used to create an arteriovenous fistula. Valvulotomy of the vein is then done, usually from the crossover point to the midfoot. Multiple stents are placed in the vein from the level of the calcaneus to the arteriovenous crossover point, and a crossing stent is inserted to maintain the arteriovenous fistula. This establishes retrograde blood flow down the veins, which become arterialised. 2.6 Arteriography is done at the end of the procedure to visualise blood flow into the deep venous arch. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 7 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 1 single-arm pivotal study, 2 single-arm pilot studies, and 4 case series. It is presented in the summary of key evidence section in the interventional procedures
