arms. However, an exploratory analysis showed that, among those who had abdominal pain at baseline in APPROACH (17 out of 66 patients across the 2 arms), patients having volanesorsen (7 out of 33) had a statistically significant reduction in the average maximum intensity of abdominal pain, compared with those on placebo (10 out of 33; p=0.0227). The ERG commented that this difference may have been because of the higher baseline rates of abdominal pain in this subgroup, making it easier to detect an effect. The committee noted that some patients continued to have a certain level of abdominal pain while on volanesorsen, which made its effect on abdominal pain unclear. However, it acknowledged that, because abdominal pain is a frequent symptom associated with FCS, the reduction in pain seen in the trial would be beneficial for people with the condition. Overall study results 4.14 The committee concluded that the clinical trial evidence showed that volanesorsen would likely provide benefits in lowering TG levels and on clinical outcomes (AP and abdominal pain). It also considered the additional data from APPROACH OLE and the EAMS that became available during consultation (mostly confidential, therefore cannot be presented here). These data showed a trend
