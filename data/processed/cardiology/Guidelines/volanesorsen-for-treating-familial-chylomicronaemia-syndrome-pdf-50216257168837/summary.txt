1 Recommendations 1.1 Volanesorsen is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome in adults with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronaemia syndrome who are at high risk of pancreatitis, and when response to diet and triglyceride-lowering therapy has been inadequate. It is recommended only if the company provides volanesorsen according to the commercial arrangement. Why the committee made these recommendations Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that has a significant effect on the quality of life of people with the condition, and their families and carers. People with the condition have severe abdominal pain, unpredictable and recurrent acute pancreatitis and fatigue, and need to have a restricted low-fat diet. Current treatment options are limited. Clinical trial evidence shows short-term benefits with volanesorsen, including reduced triglyceride (a type of fat found in the blood) levels.
