resources. For a most plausible ICER above £100,000 per QALY gained, judgements about the acceptability of the highly specialised technology as an effective use of NHS resources must take account of the magnitude of the incremental therapeutic improvement, as revealed through the number of additional QALYs gained and by applying a 'QALY weight'. It understood that a weight between 1 and 3 can be applied when the QALY gain is between 10 and 30 QALYs. The committee discussed the QALY gains associated with volanesorsen. It highlighted that these were below 10 in the analysis that was most plausible to the committee (the exact QALY gains are considered commercial in confidence by the company, so cannot be reported here). The committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that volanesorsen would meet the criteria for applying a QALY weight. Cost-effectiveness results 4.33 The committee considered the results of the economic analysis, taking into account the company's base case and the ERG's exploratory scenario analyses. It acknowledged that neither the company's base case nor the ERG scenarios were without flaws. The committee's preferred base case included the following assumptions: • a rate ratio of 0.29 for volanesorsen's protective effect on AP
