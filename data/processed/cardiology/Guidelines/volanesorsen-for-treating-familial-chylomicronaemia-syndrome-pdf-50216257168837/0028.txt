Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

be 41 years • comprised 54.5% women and • was assumed to have the same characteristics as patients in APPROACH: － AP history – 0 or 1 or more episodes in the past 5 years － baseline TG levels – below 10 mmol per litre (low-risk band); between 10 mmol per litre and below 22.6 mmol per litre (medium-risk band); 22.6 mmol per litre or more (high-risk band), which were used to define health states in the Markov model. 4.18 The company's economic analysis adopted an NHS perspective and implemented a 59-year time horizon (assumed to represent the maximum remaining lifetime of a patient). A discount rate of 3.5% per year was used for both cost and health outcomes. The committee was satisfied that the model structure reflected the general course of the condition, although it recalled the uncertainty in the relationship between TG levels and risk of AP in people with FCS (see section 4.10). Model assumptions Assumptions on volanesorsen's indirect and direct effects on AP 4.19 In the model, the company assumed that volanesorsen would reduce the risk of AP: • indirectly by reducing patients' TG-risk band, and • directly by reducing the risk of AP independent of
