lipoprotein lipase activity) may be more relevant for this condition. Because FCS is caused by a defect in lipoprotein lipase, TGs cannot be converted in people with this condition, resulting in chylomicron accumulation and consequently pancreatitis. There are no clinical data supporting this argument because chylomicrons are less readily quantified. However, a reduction in both TGs in chylomicrons and AP events in people having volanesorsen was seen in APPROACH. The committee accepted that there is a general linear relationship between TG levels and risk of AP, but it remained uncertain whether this was generalisable to people with FCS. It concluded that, although it is uncertain whether the linear relationship applies in FCS, reduced TG levels may be associated with reduced risk of AP in this population, as shown in the clinical trials. Study outcomes Responder analysis 4.11 The company did several responder analyses. The committee particularly looked at 2 of them. This is because they were highly relevant to the decision making for TG level bands as defined in the company's economic model (see section 4.17) and to volanesorsen's stopping rule in the summary of product characteristics (see section 3.1 and section 4.17). These analyses included: • attaining fasting TG
