of bias because 0.13 was derived from a before–after comparison using patients as their own controls, and 0.35 may be confounded because there was no placebo arm in APPROACH OLE. It also suggested that some double counting will remain irrespective of the rate ratio selected. The committee recalled the concern about the relationship between TG level and risk of AP. It recognised the limitations of developing an evidence base for an ultra-rare disease, and around estimating the most plausible rate-ratio values associated with using volanesorsen given the lack of trial data. In the absence of robust evidence, the committee considered that a rate ratio of 0.29, applied to all patients in the model, was reasonable. Stopping treatment 4.21 The committee noted that relatively high stopping rates were seen across the clinical studies. In APPROACH, 42% (14 out of 32) of patients stopped treatment before month 12, and 79% stopped before week 104. It understood that adverse events were the most common reason for stopping. Stopping rates from APPROACH OLE were considered academic in confidence by the company, so cannot be presented here. The committee was also aware that only 1 patient stopped treatment in the EAMS because of cancer recurrence.
