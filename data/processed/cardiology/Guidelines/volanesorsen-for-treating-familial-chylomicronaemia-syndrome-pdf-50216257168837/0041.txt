It pointed out that these can all seriously affect the quality of life of people with FCS, but were not captured in the model because of similar features with either the vignette descriptions or other symptoms. The committee understood that these factors could have affected quality of life and therefore cost effectiveness. However, it considered that, if these factors were associated with either a decrease or increase in TGs, it would have preferred to see them in the vignette study. It also noted that it was not presented with sufficient evidence on this in the clinical trials. The committee concluded that, because no empirical data were provided, the possible effect of these factors on the cost-effectiveness estimate was unknown. Applying QALY weighing 4.32 The committee understood that the interim process and methods of the highly specialised technologies programme (2017) specifies that a most plausible ICER of below £100,000 per QALY gained for a highly specialised technology is normally considered an effective use of NHS resources. For a most plausible ICER above £100,000 per QALY gained, judgements about the acceptability of the highly specialised technology as an effective use of NHS resources must take account
