Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

to the long- term efficacy and safety of volanesorsen and the likely rate of stopping treatment. The committee concluded that the difference between the licensed and trialled dosing regimens contributed to further uncertainties. It also concluded that, because of the higher dosing and initially less-intensive monitoring in trials, volanesorsen's short-term effect on clinical and safety outcomes may have been overestimated and there are uncertainties in interpreting its clinical benefits in the long term. Percentage change in TG level as a surrogate outcome 4.8 The primary outcome measure in APPROACH was the percentage change from baseline in TG levels at month 3 (there were no formally designated primary and secondary outcomes in APPROACH OLE). In APPROACH, at month 3, volanesorsen treatment was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful change in TG levels compared with placebo (percentage difference in change from baseline in TG: 94.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -121.7 to -66.6; p<0.0001). Clinical data from APPROACH OLE is considered academic in confidence by the company, so cannot be presented here. However, the company stated that the results showed a substantial decrease in TG levels with volanesorsen at month 3. The committee was aware that percentage change in TG levels
