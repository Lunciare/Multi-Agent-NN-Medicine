Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

by the company (see section 4.14). Based on this, it preferred the ERG's exponential function, which does not suggest that most patients continue after a high initial rate of drop out. The committee agreed that the ERG's initial stopping rate of 10% per year (see section 4.22) was more likely in clinical practice than the low rate in the EAMS. It therefore concluded that the ERG's exponential curve best reflected the likely change in stopping rate with volanesorsen in clinical practice over time, and that this assumption should be used in the model. Source of utility data 4.25 The utility data collected in APPROACH were not used in the model. The company explained that this was because utility values for both treatment arms were higher than the average UK index value and it considered them implausible. Instead, the utility values for the base case were derived from a vignette study commissioned by the company. In response to concerns raised by the committee about the vignette study, the company provided additional information on the methodology after consultation. Substantial information about this study is considered academic in confidence by the company, so cannot be discussed in detail here. The committee noted several
