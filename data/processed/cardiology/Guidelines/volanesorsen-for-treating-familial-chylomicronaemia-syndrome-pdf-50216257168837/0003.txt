more difficult to manage. 2.2 Current treatment options for people with FCS are limited. To keep plasma triglyceride levels low, management consists of severely restricting dietary fat intake (usually to between 10 g and 20 g daily, about a quarter of the normal daily intake suggested for an adult) and consuming no alcohol. People with the condition may take several drugs to control pain and other symptoms of FCS, including corticosteroids, analgesics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, diabetes treatments and antithrombotic drugs. People on a fat-restricted diet need supplements of essential fatty acids (linoleic and alpha linolenic acids) and fat- soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K). In addition, treatments for hypercholesterolaemia (such as fibrates, nicotinic acids and statins) may be prescribed but are of limited value. The strict dietary regimen is highly restrictive and often challenging for people with the condition and their families. Also, people often still have high triglyceride levels even when the diet is closely followed. 2.3 The prevalence of FCS is estimated to be 1 to 2 per million people, which equates to about 55 to 110 people in England. At the time of the evidence submission, there were thought to be around 80 to 100 people
