Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

challenging, particularly if diabetes develops. They also explained that people may have mixed experiences of symptom and disease management approaches, depending on their triglyceride (TG) levels, but that a new treatment option would offer considerable hope to them and to their families. The committee recognised that there is a significant unmet need for effective treatment options for FCS. Diagnosis 4.3 The clinical experts explained that, historically, FCS has been diagnosed by several clinical criteria, including abdominal pain, AP and raised TG levels refractory to lipid-lowering therapy (but not due to other causes such as type 2 diabetes or hypothyroidism). Given the rarity of the disease, people with FCS often have delayed diagnosis, or misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Genetic diagnosis is becoming more common. It identifies some mutations in lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein 2 and 5, lipase maturation factor 1 or GPIHPB1 genes, which code for proteins involved in lipoprotein lipase activity. The expert from NHS England noted that genetic testing would become available from April 2020, which will help with the identification and genetic confirmation of FCS. Impact of the new technology Clinical evidence 4.4 The clinical evidence available for volanesorsen included: • APPROACH (n=66) – a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial
