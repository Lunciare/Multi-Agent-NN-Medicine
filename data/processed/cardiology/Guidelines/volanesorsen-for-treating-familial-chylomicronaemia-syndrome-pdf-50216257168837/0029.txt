model, the company assumed that volanesorsen would reduce the risk of AP: • indirectly by reducing patients' TG-risk band, and • directly by reducing the risk of AP independent of TG-risk bands. In the company's original base case, the risk estimate associated with volanesorsen's direct protective effect on the risk of AP (0.13, p value not reported) was estimated from a post-hoc analysis. This compared the event rate of AP in patients 5 years before enrolment in APPROACH OLE with their event rate while on treatment (see section 4.12). The rate ratio of 0.13 was applied to patients with historical and recurrent APs in the model. The ERG noted this would represent double counting of the benefits because it was calculated from a population in whom there was already potential for reducing TG levels (via the indirect effect of volanesorsen on TG levels). It was also subject to risk of bias because patients were their own control and because of regression to the mean. The ERG therefore removed some of the double counting by applying a multiplication factor of 0.50 to both historical and recurrent AP rates within specific TG-risk bands. The committee preferred the ERG's assumption, given the lack
