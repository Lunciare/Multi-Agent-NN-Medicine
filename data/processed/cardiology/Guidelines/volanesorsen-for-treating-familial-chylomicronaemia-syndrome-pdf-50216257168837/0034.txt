affected the model results. Stopping could happen in the model because of not meeting the continuation criteria (see section 4.17), death, lack of adherence to the treatment and monitoring, or adverse events. In the company's original model, stopping was modelled by fitting parametric survival functions to time-on-treatment data for 32 patients on volanesorsen once every 2 weeks within APPROACH OLE and using log-normal curves to predict when treatment would stop. After consultation, the company capped the stopping rate at 20%. The committee understood that relatively high stopping rates were seen across the clinical studies (see section 4.21) and considered this cap implausible. However, it was also aware that only 1 person stopped treatment in the EAMS even though patients had volanesorsen once every 2 weeks from the start in the scheme (see section 4.21). The committee recalled the discussion on declining stopping rates in the long term, and that there may be differences in the stopping rate between clinical trials and the EAMS because of the different settings as explained by the company (see section 4.14). Based on this, it preferred the ERG's exponential function, which does not suggest that most patients continue after a high initial rate of drop
