information on the methodology after consultation. Substantial information about this study is considered academic in confidence by the company, so cannot be discussed in detail here. The committee noted several methodological issues associated with the study, including the process of constructing the vignettes, uncertainties in the dimensions that defined health states and value-laden language used throughout the vignette. The committee concluded that the source of utility values was subject to risk of bias and that this would contribute to uncertainty in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Using utility values derived from the vignette study 4.26 The ERG noted that the vignettes did not distinguish between patients who were on treatment and those who were not, but instead by low- or high-risk TG bands and whether an AP event occurred. This contrasted with how the utility values were used in the company's model. In the model, utility for a patient was determined by whether they were having volanesorsen or standard care on the basis that mean TG levels were considerably lower in patients who were having treatment. The ERG had concerns about this approach. It provided alternative utilities in its base case, which used the vignette results but linked the utility
