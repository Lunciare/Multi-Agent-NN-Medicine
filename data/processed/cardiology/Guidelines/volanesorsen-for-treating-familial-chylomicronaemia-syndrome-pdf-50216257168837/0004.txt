Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

per million people, which equates to about 55 to 110 people in England. At the time of the evidence submission, there were thought to be around 80 to 100 people with FCS eligible for treatment with volanesorsen in the UK. 2.4 Treatment with volanesorsen has been provided since March 2018 under an Early Access to Medicines Scheme at several specialist centres. The company explained that, at the time of evaluation, 20 people were having volanesorsen (with treatment duration ranging from 1 to 15 months). A further 5 people have been identified to start treatment. 3 The technology 3.1 Volanesorsen (Waylivra, Akcea) is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) production. ApoC-III inhibits the metabolism of triglycerides via the actions of both the lipoprotein lipase and lipoprotein lipase-independent pathways. It selectively binds to apoC-III mRNA to prevent the production of the apoC-III protein, so increasing metabolism of triglycerides. Volanesorsen has a marketing authorisation 'as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride-lowering therapy has been inadequate'. Volanesorsen is administered by subcutaneous injection. The recommended starting dosage, as described in the summary
