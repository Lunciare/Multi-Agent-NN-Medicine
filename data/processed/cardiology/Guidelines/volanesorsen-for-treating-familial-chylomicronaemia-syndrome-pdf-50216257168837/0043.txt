base case nor the ERG scenarios were without flaws. The committee's preferred base case included the following assumptions: • a rate ratio of 0.29 for volanesorsen's protective effect on AP risk • a stopping rate of 10% per year (exponential model) • applying utility data in the model using the ERG's approach of linking utility values to TG levels and health states • a carer utility decrement of 0.02. The committee acknowledged that substantial uncertainties remained about volanesorsen's protective effect on AP risk and applying utility data from the vignette study in the model. It noted that, because of the outstanding uncertainties, the company revised its commercial offer for volanesorsen. This brought the ICER down to £98,013 per QALY gained compared with best supportive care and using the committee's preferred assumptions. Taking this into account, the committee concluded that the most plausible ICER could be considered an effective use of NHS resources for highly specialised technologies. Impact of the technology beyond direct health benefits and on the delivery of the specialised service 4.34 The committee discussed the effects of volanesorsen beyond its direct health benefits and the testimony of the patient experts. It understood from patient and clinical experts that
