The committee acknowledged the positive psychological effect that volanesorsen may have on patients and carers, and on their lifestyle. It agreed that there would be some effect of FCS on the utility for carers but thought that applying the 0.04 utility decrement may be unrealistic. It considered that it may be smaller than 0.03, which represents a family decrement for patients with new musculoskeletal conditions. It concluded that it would prefer a utility decrement of 0.02 applied in the model. Factors not considered by the committee: comorbidities and malnutrition 4.31 The company explained that some comorbidities and symptoms such as joint pain, numbness or tingling of digits, use of corticosteroids and opioids, and nutritional status were not included in the model. It pointed out that these can all seriously affect the quality of life of people with FCS, but were not captured in the model
