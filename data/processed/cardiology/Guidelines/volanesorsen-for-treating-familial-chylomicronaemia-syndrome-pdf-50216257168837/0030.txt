the double counting by applying a multiplication factor of 0.50 to both historical and recurrent AP rates within specific TG-risk bands. The committee preferred the ERG's assumption, given the lack of clinical trial data, but acknowledged that volanesorsen was likely to have some protective effect on risk of AP. 4.20 At consultation, the company explained that using an additional multiplication factor was necessary because the size of the reduction in risk of AP with volanesorsen was not adequately captured in the model. Therefore, in its updated model, a rate ratio of 0.27 (to low or medium TG health states) and 0.28 (to high TG health states) was applied. The company noted these ratios were midpoints between 0.13 (original submission) and 0.35 (the ratio of pooled event rates of volanesorsen once every 2 weeks dosing from APPROACH, APPROACH OLE and COMPASS compared with the pooled event rates of placebo from APPROACH and COMPASS in patients with a history of AP). The ERG highlighted that both estimates were subject to considerable risk of bias because 0.13 was derived from a before–after comparison using patients as their own controls, and 0.35 may be confounded because there was no placebo arm in APPROACH OLE.
