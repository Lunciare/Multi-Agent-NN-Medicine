company's economic model (see section 4.17) and to volanesorsen's stopping rule in the summary of product characteristics (see section 3.1 and section 4.17). These analyses included: • attaining fasting TG levels of below 750 mg per decilitre (8.5 mmol per litre) between baseline and month 3 • a 40% reduction in fasting TG levels between baseline and month 3. In APPROACH, 76.7% (23 out of 33) of patients having volanesorsen and 9.7% (3 out of 33) of those on placebo met the first of these endpoints (odds ratio: 186.16, 95% CI 12.86 to not applicable; p<0.0001). Similarly, for the second of these endpoints, evidence from APPROACH showed that more patients on volanesorsen (87.9%, 29 out of 33) met the endpoint compared with those on placebo (9.1%, 3 out of 33) at month 3 (odds ratio: 99.69, 95% CI 15.75 to 631.06; p<0.0001). Generally, a reduction in TG levels at month 3 or a moderate-to-high relative reduction in TG levels was seen. The ERG noted that this showed that a substantial proportion of patients were likely to continue treatment after stopping rules are applied (see section 3.1). The clinical experts explained that it is difficult to identify a population threshold in
