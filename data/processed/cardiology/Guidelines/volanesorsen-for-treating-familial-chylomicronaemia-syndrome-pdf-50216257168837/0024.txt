These data showed a trend towards a TG-lowering benefit in people having the treatment at weekly and fortnightly dosing. The ERG noted that the evidence raised the possibility that response to the treatment may wane over time, but any reduction was likely to be small. The committee concluded that volanesorsen would likely provide some long-term benefits, although this was associated with substantial uncertainty, particularly at the licensed dose. Health-related quality of life 4.15 Health-related quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D and SF-36 in APPROACH and APPROACH OLE. In APPROACH, there was no statistically significant change from baseline for the EQ-5D-5L or SF-36 at month 3 (p=0.2920 and p=0.6627 respectively), at month 6 (p=0.5923 and p=0.9226 respectively) and at month 12 (p=0.4079 and p=0.7912 respectively). Baseline EQ-5D values were very high for both treatment arms (utility more than 0.97) in APPROACH. The committee noted that this was not in line with the patient testimonies, which indicated that FCS substantially affects every aspect of their lives. One patient expert explained that the EQ-5D does not
