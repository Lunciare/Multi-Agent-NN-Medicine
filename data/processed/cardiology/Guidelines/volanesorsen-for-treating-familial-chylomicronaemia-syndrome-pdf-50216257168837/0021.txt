proportion of patients were likely to continue treatment after stopping rules are applied (see section 3.1). The clinical experts explained that it is difficult to identify a population threshold in TG levels for clinical events (such as pancreatitis) in FCS. However, they agreed that there is likely to be a level below which someone is unlikely to have pancreatitis, so it is appropriate to consider that people whose TG levels reach the endpoints defined above are at 'lower risk'. The ERG highlighted that the evidence showed that response rates wane over time, so the treatment effect may vary. But the committee concluded that, based on the evidence, TG levels would likely fall to levels at which pancreatitis is less likely in a substantial proportion of patients. However, it remained uncertain whether this benefit would last in the long term. Acute pancreatitis 4.12 Evidence from a preplanned safety analysis showed that 1 patient having volanesorsen (n=33) and 3 patients on placebo (n=33) had AP (p=0.6132) in APPROACH. A post-hoc analysis comparing the AP event rate 5 years before treatment with the AP event rate while on treatment in the same trial showed a statistically significant difference in favour of volanesorsen (p=0.0242).
