Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

and a long-term Markov model. In each 3-month model cycle, patients moved between TG bands or remained in the same band, had AP, developed chronic pancreatitis or died. Patients with historical AP moved to the recurrent AP category when having AP. Treatment with volanesorsen was assumed to be weekly within the initial 3-month period and fortnightly in the Markov stage until treatment was stopped or death (in line with the dosing schedule in the summary of product characteristics). All patients who had standard care in the initial phase progressed to the standard-care Markov model. Patients who had volanesorsen had to meet continuation criteria (a TG level reduced by 25% or more or below 22.6 mmol per litre, or both) to remain on volanesorsen, otherwise they progressed to the standard-care arm. The population in the model was in line with the indication (see section 3.1). A high risk of pancreatitis was defined as having had a previous AP event in the model. The hypothetical cohort of patients: • was assumed to be 41 years • comprised 54.5% women and • was assumed to have the same characteristics as patients in APPROACH: － AP history – 0 or 1 or more episodes
