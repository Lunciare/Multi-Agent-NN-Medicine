Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

the AP event rate 5 years before treatment with the AP event rate while on treatment in the same trial showed a statistically significant difference in favour of volanesorsen (p=0.0242). The same post-hoc analysis comparing the event rate of AP 5 years before treatment with that while on treatment in APPROACH OLE gave a rate ratio of 0.13 (p value not reported). The ERG highlighted that this risk estimate was highly uncertain because it was derived from a before–after comparison using patients as their own control, so there was a high risk of recollection bias. In general, the ERG noted that volanesorsen might reduce AP events, but the effect size was unclear. The committee agreed with the ERG and noted that the company's risk estimate of AP was uncertain and subject to risk of bias because of the methods used. Abdominal pain 4.13 The preplanned efficacy analyses describing the average maximum intensity of abdominal pain during the on-treatment period in APPROACH did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms. However, an exploratory analysis showed that, among those who had abdominal pain at baseline in APPROACH (17 out of 66 patients across the 2 arms), patients having volanesorsen (7
