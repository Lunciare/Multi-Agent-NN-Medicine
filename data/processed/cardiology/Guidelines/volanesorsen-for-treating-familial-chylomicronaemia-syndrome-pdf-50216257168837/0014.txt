authorisation for 'high risk of pancreatitis' is likely to include anyone with high TG levels. Dosing 4.7 The volanesorsen dose stated in the marketing authorisation was not used in the clinical trials or for the population in the EAMS (see section 4.4). The committee discussed the implications of this for interpreting the evidence on volanesorsen's clinical efficacy and safety. It queried the frequent dose adjustments and pauses seen in studies. It concluded that these would be more likely under the intensified monitoring regime of the EAMS and the clinical trials, than in clinical practice. It also considered the effect of these on patients, TG levels and clinical outcomes. It understood that, in the EAMS, patients all started on once every 2 weeks dosing but could up titrate to the licensed dose if response was not sufficient. The committee considered that the reason given for the dose adjustments and pauses was understandable from a general pharmacological point of view. But in the clinical trials the dose adjustments and pauses added uncertainty to the long- term efficacy and safety of volanesorsen and the likely rate of stopping treatment. The committee concluded that the difference between the licensed and trialled dosing regimens contributed
