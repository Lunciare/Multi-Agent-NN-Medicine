identification and genetic confirmation of FCS. Impact of the new technology Clinical evidence 4.4 The clinical evidence available for volanesorsen included: • APPROACH (n=66) – a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of volanesorsen (n=33) compared with placebo (n=33). Volanesorsen was administered by subcutaneous injection (285 mg) once weekly. After the 52-week trial period, patients could either have a 13-week follow up or enter the APPROACH OLE open-label extension study. • COMPASS (n=114) – a multicentre double-blind randomised placebo- controlled trial in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia from many different causes; only 7 patients had FCS. Volanesorsen was administered by subcutaneous injection (285 mg) once weekly. After 26 weeks, patients could either have a 13-week follow up or enter the APPROACH OLE open-label extension study. • APPROACH OLE – an ongoing single-arm open-label study assessing the safety and efficacy of dosing and extended dosing with volanesorsen. Volanesorsen was administered by subcutaneous injection (285 mg) once weekly. Information about treatment arms and patient numbers is considered academic in confidence by the company, so cannot be presented. • The Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS; n=20) – an ongoing programme that provides access to volanesorsen (administered by subcutaneous injection, 285
