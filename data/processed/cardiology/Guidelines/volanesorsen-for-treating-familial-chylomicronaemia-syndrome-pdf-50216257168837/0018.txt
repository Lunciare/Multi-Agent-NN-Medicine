Volanesorsen for treating familial chylomicronaemia syndrome

clinical experts also suggested that people with FCS may have AP at lower TG levels than patients with raised TG levels from other causes. 4.10 During consultation, the company provided further information on the possible relationship between TG and AP in people with FCS. It explained that people with FCS are at a higher risk of AP compared with those with other hypertriglyceridaemia disorders. This is because they have chronically higher mean serum TG levels, their TG levels are more volatile and they have higher rates of previous AP. The ERG argued that the peaks in TG concentration may simply be a function of higher average TGs, and that there is no evidence linking incidence of AP to peak TG levels. The clinical experts noted that TG concentration alone may not be an adequate surrogate for AP in people with FCS. This is because the relationship between TGs and chylomicrons (the lipoprotein particles that transport triglycerides derived from dietary fat from the intestine to the rest of the body via lipoprotein lipase activity) may be more relevant for this condition. Because FCS is caused by a defect in lipoprotein lipase, TGs cannot be converted in people with this condition, resulting
