here. However, the company stated that the results showed a substantial decrease in TG levels with volanesorsen at month 3. The committee was aware that percentage change in TG levels is a surrogate outcome for clinical outcomes such as AP. The company explained that percentage change in TG levels is a commonly used and important outcome that shows an effect of volanesorsen. The ERG explained that, at subsequent time points, the decrease in TG levels was generally lower than that seen at month 3 in APPROACH, but that any possible waning effect of volanesorsen is probably small. This was supported by additional evidence from APPROACH OLE that became available during consultation, although the ERG also noted that follow up in studies did not appear to go beyond around 3 to 4 years. Therefore, the long-term effects of volanesorsen measured by percentage change in TG levels were uncertain. The committee concluded that volanesorsen was effective in lowering TG levels in people with FCS, although the extent of the effect in the long term was unclear. Relationship between TG levels and AP in people with FCS 4.9 The committee considered the company's evidence on a possible dose-response relationship between TG levels and
