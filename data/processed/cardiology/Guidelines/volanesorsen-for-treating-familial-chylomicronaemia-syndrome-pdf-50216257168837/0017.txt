long term was unclear. Relationship between TG levels and AP in people with FCS 4.9 The committee considered the company's evidence on a possible dose-response relationship between TG levels and the risk of AP, suggesting that increased TG levels lead to an increased risk of AP. TG levels below 10 mmol per litre are associated with a low risk of AP. Risk increases with TG levels above 10 mmol per litre, becoming particularly high at levels of 22.6 mmol per litre or more. These assumptions were used in the company's economic model to define certain health states (see section 4.17). The clinical experts noted that there is a linear relationship between TG levels and risk of AP in the general population. However, there is a lack of evidence about whether this dose-response relationship is generalisable to FCS. TG levels can be variable and volatile among people with FCS (see section 4.6), and they are likely to have individual thresholds at which they are at high risk of developing AP. The clinical experts also suggested that people with FCS may have AP at lower TG levels than patients with raised TG levels from other causes. 4.10 During consultation, the company provided
