are older and who might have more comorbidities would be less likely to be involved in a clinical trial so they might be under-represented. The committee noted EMPEROR-Reduced was not powered to show any difference in subgroups by age. The clinical experts said there would be no apparent reason why relative treatment effects would be different between subgroups of younger and older ages. The committee concluded that data from the intention-to-treat population in EMPEROR-Reduced was broadly generalisable to NHS clinical practice. Empagliflozin plus standard care compared with placebo plus standard care is clinically effective 3.5 The primary efficacy outcome in EMPEROR-Reduced was a composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure. Intention-to- treat analyses showed that empagliflozin plus standard care reduced the incidence of the primary outcome by 25.0% compared with placebo plus standard care (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.86; p<0.0001). At a median follow up of 16 months, results showed that 19.4% of people having empagliflozin plus standard care had an event compared with 24.7% in the placebo group. The committee concluded that empagliflozin is clinically effective compared with placebo and that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular events when added to
