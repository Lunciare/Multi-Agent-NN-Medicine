taking empagliflozin for heart failure who also have diabetes might need adjustments in their diabetes medication for safety reasons because of an increased risk of ketoacidosis. The committee considered that risk factors should be identified, and some increased monitoring may be needed for treating heart failure with empagliflozin. So, it considered that a heart failure specialist was the most appropriate clinician to advise on starting treatment. The committee also noted that the summary of product characteristics states an assessment of renal function is recommended before starting empagliflozin and this should be done periodically during treatment. So, the committee considered that monitoring should be done by the most appropriate healthcare professional. The committee further noted that NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction included recommendations on who should advise on starting treatment and appropriate monitoring. The committee concluded that a heart failure specialist should advise on starting empagliflozin and monitoring should be done by the most appropriate healthcare professional. 4 Implementation 4.1 Section 7 of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013 requires clinical commissioning groups, NHS England
