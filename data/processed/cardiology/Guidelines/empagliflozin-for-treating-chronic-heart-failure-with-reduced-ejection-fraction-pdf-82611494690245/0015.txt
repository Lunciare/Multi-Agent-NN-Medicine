analysis to help with decision making. However, it argued that this type of analysis would amplify any uncertainty in the results of the indirect treatment comparison. The company's base-case cost–utility analysis assumed there was no survival benefit with empagliflozin over dapagliflozin. However, it assumed that taking empagliflozin would lead to improvements in renal function and reduced hospitalisations for heart failure. This was based on the results of the Bucher indirect treatment comparison (see section 3.6). The company's probabilistic and deterministic cost-effectiveness estimates suggested that empagliflozin dominated dapagliflozin (meaning it was less costly and at least equally effective). The ERG did additional scenario analyses to show the effect of adding the different outcomes included in the Bucher indirect treatment comparison. These scenarios included the following assumptions: • equal effectiveness in all outcomes • survival benefit for dapagliflozin • survival benefit for dapagliflozin and a reduction in hospitalisations for heart failure for empagliflozin • survival benefit for dapagliflozin, a reduction in hospitalisations for heart failure and an improvement in renal function for empagliflozin. For the assumption of equal effectiveness, the results showed no difference in total costs or quality-adjusted life years between the 2 treatments. The results for the other scenarios included
