Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

The clinical experts said that the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure did not distinguish between the 2 SGLT2 inhibitors. For this reason, they would also consider that empagliflozin and dapagliflozin would be used in the same groups of people. They further noted that it would be unlikely that someone who is not eligible for treatment with dapagliflozin would be eligible for treatment with empagliflozin. This was because the technologies are considered to work in the same way. The committee concluded that dapagliflozin was the most appropriate comparator for this appraisal. Clinical evidence EMPEROR-Reduced is the key trial and is broadly generalisable to NHS clinical practice 3.4 EMPEROR-Reduced was a double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing empagliflozin plus standard care with placebo plus standard care. Standard care could include medical therapy with an ACE inhibitor, an ARB, a beta blocker or an MRA. The trial included people aged at least 18 who had had a diagnosis of chronic heart failure for at least 3 months. They had moderate to severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This was defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less based on
