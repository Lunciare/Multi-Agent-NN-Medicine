Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

compared with 24.7% in the placebo group. The committee concluded that empagliflozin is clinically effective compared with placebo and that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular events when added to standard care. Indirect treatment comparison The indirect treatment comparison shows that clinical outcomes between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are similar 3.6 There were no trials directly comparing empagliflozin with dapagliflozin so the company presented an indirect treatment comparison using the Bucher method. This compared the results from EMPEROR-Reduced with those from DAPA-HF. DAPA-HF was a phase 3 multinational double-blind randomised controlled trial. It compared dapagliflozin plus standard care with placebo plus standard care in people with stable symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The company supported the indirect comparison with the results from a published pooled meta- analysis reported by Zannad et al. (2020). This pooled data for dapagliflozin and empagliflozin to create class effect estimates for SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo. The ERG broadly agreed that the results from the meta-analyses suggested there was a statistically significant benefit with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo for all outcomes. However, the ERG noted that the results of the meta-analysis were only based on 1 trial of empagliflozin and 1 trial
