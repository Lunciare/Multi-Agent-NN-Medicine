Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo for all outcomes. However, the ERG noted that the results of the meta-analysis were only based on 1 trial of empagliflozin and 1 trial of dapagliflozin. It therefore considered the Bucher comparison was a more appropriate method of assessing the comparative efficacy of empagliflozin compared with dapagliflozin. The results of the indirect treatment comparison suggested there was no difference between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin in any of the outcomes (all results are confidential and cannot be reported here). However, the results suggested a trend towards possible differences in cardiovascular deaths, all-cause mortality and renal function. The committee was aware that the ERG had explored this uncertainty in the cost–utility analysis (see section 3.8). The committee noted that there were some baseline differences in the Bucher indirect treatment comparison between people in EMPEROR- Reduced and DAPA-HF. People in EMPEROR-Reduced may have had a more severe renal impairment than people in DAPA-HF. This meant that people in EMPEROR-Reduced may have been more likely to have a hospitalisation for heart failure or mortality event compared with those in DAPA-HF. The committee acknowledged the limitations of the comparison but agreed it was appropriate for decision making. The committee concluded
