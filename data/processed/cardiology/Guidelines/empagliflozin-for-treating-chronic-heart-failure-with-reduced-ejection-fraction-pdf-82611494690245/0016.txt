empagliflozin. For the assumption of equal effectiveness, the results showed no difference in total costs or quality-adjusted life years between the 2 treatments. The results for the other scenarios included in the ERG's analyses were in the south-west quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane. This means that empagliflozin was estimated to be less costly and less effective than dapagliflozin (the exact results are academic in confidence and cannot be reported here). The committee understood that the ERG's scenarios were exploratory only. It also agreed that they were uncertain. This was because they were based on the results of the Bucher indirect treatment comparison, which showed no overall difference between the 2 treatments. The committee considered its earlier conclusion that dapagliflozin was the most appropriate comparator (see section 3.3) based on: • its comparable mechanism of action • its use in a comparable place in the treatment pathway • the results of the indirect treatment comparison, which showed no difference between the 2 treatments. The committee was satisfied that empagliflozin is similarly effective to dapagliflozin and that its costs are identical. It concluded to recommend empagliflozin as an option for treating symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Empagliflozin is not
