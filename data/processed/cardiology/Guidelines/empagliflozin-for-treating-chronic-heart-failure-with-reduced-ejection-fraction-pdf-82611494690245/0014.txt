quality-of-life effects. The clinical experts explained that the KCCQ is a well-validated comprehensive quality-of-life and symptom questionnaire for heart failure. The ERG stated that it was satisfied with the company's choice of KCCQ-CSS states in the model. The committee concluded that the company's model structure was appropriate for decision making. Cost-effectiveness estimates Empagliflozin is recommended as an option for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 3.8 The company considered that a cost-comparison was the most appropriate way to estimate the cost effectiveness of empagliflozin compared with dapagliflozin. This was based on an assumption of equivalent effectiveness between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin. It noted that both drugs had the same list price, dosing frequency and method of administration, and that available evidence suggested the treatments were clinically equivalent. The ERG suggested that a cost–utility analysis may have been more appropriate. This was because the company's assumption of equal effectiveness was based on only 2 trials and ignored potential uncertainty (see section 3.6). After technical engagement, the company provided a cost–utility analysis to help with decision making. However, it argued that this type of analysis would amplify any uncertainty in the results of the indirect treatment comparison. The company's base-case cost–utility
