Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

The treatment pathway People should be optimised on standard care before having a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor 3.2 NICE's guideline on diagnosing and managing chronic heart failure in adults recommends a range of drug treatments for newly diagnosed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These are separated into first-line and specialist treatments. First-line treatments include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (ARBs) when an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated. Beta blockers can also be offered and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) can be offered if appropriate and tolerated. The company's submission had suggested that empagliflozin should be positioned as an add-on to first-line treatment in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who may or may not have comorbidities. The committee understood that this is narrower than the marketing authorisation, which does not specify use as an add-on treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The clinical experts said the company's positioning was now in line with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. These guidelines recommend that empagliflozin or dapagliflozin (another SGLT2 inhibitor) could be started earlier in the care pathway for heart
