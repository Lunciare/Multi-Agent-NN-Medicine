Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

at least 3 months. They had moderate to severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This was defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less based on the New York Heart Association functional class 2 to 4. The clinical experts said that the trial findings were generalisable to NHS clinical practice. However, they highlighted several differences between the population in EMPEROR-Reduced and people having treatment in the NHS: • The average age in the intention-to-treat population was 67 years, while the average in the NHS at diagnosis is 77 years. • The proportion of women (24%) was smaller than would be expected in the NHS. • The proportion of people using an ACE inhibitor or ARB was lower than would be expected in the NHS. The ERG stated that the characteristics of people in EMPEROR-Reduced, may not reflect that of the population in the NHS. The clinical experts agreed this might be an issue of how people are recruited to take part in clinical trials. People who are older and who might have more comorbidities would be less likely to be involved in a clinical trial so they might be under-represented. The committee noted EMPEROR-Reduced was not
