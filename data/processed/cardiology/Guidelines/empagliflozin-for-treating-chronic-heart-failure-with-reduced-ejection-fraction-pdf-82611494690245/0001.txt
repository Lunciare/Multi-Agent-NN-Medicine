Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

1 Recommendations 1.1 Empagliflozin is recommended as an option for treating symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults, only if it is used as an add-on to optimised standard care with: • an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin 2 receptor blocker (ARB), with a beta blocker and, if tolerated, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), or • sacubitril valsartan with a beta blocker and, if tolerated, an MRA. 1.2 Start empagliflozin for treating symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction on the advice of a heart failure specialist.
