empagliflozin. This was because most people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in England and Wales would have at least one of these treatment options. It did not consider dapagliflozin to be a relevant comparator because it considered that this was not standard care in the NHS. It cited recent market data suggesting that dapagliflozin is used by very few people with heart failure alone, and is most frequently used by people with heart failure and type 2 diabetes. The committee noted that NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had only been published in February 2021 so there had been a relatively short period of time to consider uptake. The clinical experts stated uptake had increased widely since publication of the guidance and that it would now be considered as standard care. The committee considered whether empagliflozin and dapagliflozin would likely be used interchangeably in the same place in the treatment pathway for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The clinical experts said that the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure did not distinguish between the 2 SGLT2 inhibitors.
