the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. These guidelines recommend that empagliflozin or dapagliflozin (another SGLT2 inhibitor) could be started earlier in the care pathway for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The committee noted this was not directly in line with NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dapagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. This recommends that dapagliflozin is used after standard care is optimised. The committee noted that there are a range of treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It concluded that empagliflozin was an appropriate treatment that should be used as an add-on to optimised standard care. Dapagliflozin is the most appropriate comparator for this appraisal 3.3 The final scope for this appraisal listed 2 comparators: individually optimised standard care without empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin as an add-on to standard care. The company stated that individually optimised standard care was the most relevant comparator. That is, people should have the most appropriate treatments used for standard care before starting treatment with empagliflozin. This was because most people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in England and Wales would have at least one of these treatment options. It did not consider
