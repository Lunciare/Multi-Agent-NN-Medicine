for heart failure or mortality event compared with those in DAPA-HF. The committee acknowledged the limitations of the comparison but agreed it was appropriate for decision making. The committee concluded that the results of the Bucher indirect treatment comparison showed that the clinical outcomes between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are similar. The company's economic model The company's model is suitable for decision making 3.7 The company modelled cost effectiveness using a state transition model with 5 states (4 based on symptom severity plus 1 for death). It captured disease severity using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score (CSS). This is a disease-specific measure of quality of life. People transitioned through quartiles based on KCCQ-CSS (0 to 100, with high scores indicating lower symptom burden), and a specific utility and cost associated with each state. The committee considered whether the KCCQ is an appropriate measure to capture quality-of-life outcomes. It noted that there may be some inconsistencies in how the size of effect translates from trial data to modelled quality-of-life effects. The clinical experts explained that the KCCQ is a well-validated comprehensive quality-of-life and symptom questionnaire for heart failure. The ERG stated that it was satisfied with the company's
