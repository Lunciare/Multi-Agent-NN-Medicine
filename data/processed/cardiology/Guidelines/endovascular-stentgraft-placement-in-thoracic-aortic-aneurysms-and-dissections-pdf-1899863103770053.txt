Endovascular stent–graft
placement in thoracic aortic
aneurysms and dissections
Interventional procedures guidance
Published: 22 June 2005

1 Guidance
1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endovascular stent–graft
placement in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections indicates that it
is a suitable alternative to surgery in appropriately selected patients,
provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit
and clinical governance.
1.2 Clinicians should enter all patients having endovascular stent–graft
placement in thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections into the thoracic
stent–graft registry supported by the Vascular Society of Great Britain
and Ireland and the British Society of Interventional Radiology.
1.3 The procedure should be performed by a multidisciplinary team with
access to facilities for cardiothoracic surgery and cardiopulmonary
bypass.

2 The procedure
2.1 Indications
2.1.1 A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a condition in which weakening of the wall
of the aorta leads to a localised dilatation of the vessel. In an aortic
dissection, there is leakage of blood between the layers of the vessel
wall. Aneurysms and dissections may rupture, causing massive internal
bleeding. Rupture of the thoracic aorta has high mortality, even with
treatment.
2.1.2 Conventional surgery for aneurysms of the thoracic aorta involves
replacing the affected part of the aorta with a synthetic graft. Aortic
dissections may be managed medically or surgically, depending on the
site involved and whether there are complicating features.
2.2 Outline of the procedure
2.2.1 Endovascular stent–graft placement involves inserting a metallic stent
covered with graft material inside the aorta. This is usually achieved by
catheterising the femoral arteries. The stent–graft is positioned and
deployed using X-ray guidance.
2.3 Efficacy
2.3.1 A systematic review of the published evidence on this procedure was
commissioned by the Institute. A total of 29 studies were identified for
inclusion (27 case series and two comparative observational studies).
2.3.2 In one comparative study, the technical success rate was 100% (67/67
patients). The overall technical success rate was 93% across 18 studies
(16 case series and two comparative studies).
2.3.3 The rate of conversion to open repair varied from 0% (0/26 patients) to
7% (1/14 patients). The proportion of patients who experienced an
increase in aneurysm size varied from 0% (0/18) to 7% (2/29) of patients.

In the study with the largest number of patients, the aneurysm increased
in size (by ( 5 mm) in 5% (4/84) of patients. The proportion of patients
who experienced a decrease in aneurysm size varied from 100% (18/18)
to 17% (5/29) of patients. For more details, refer to the Sources of
evidence.
2.4 Safety
2.4.1 The 30-day mortality rate varied from 0% (in several studies with a
combined population of 94 patients) to 14% (2/14 patients). The overall
mortality ranged from 3% (1/37 patients) to 24% (11/46 patients) across
17 studies with a mean follow-up of 14 months.
2.4.2 The most commonly reported complication following endovascular
stent–graft placement was endoleak (incomplete sealing of the
aneurysm). Nineteen studies reported at least one patient with an
endoleak, with a mean incidence of 13% over 12 months (the total
number of patients in these studies was 752; follow-up ranged from 3 to
25 months). Five studies with a total of 83 patients reported that there
were no cases of endoleak during a mean follow-up period of 12 months.
2.4.3 Injuries to the access artery were reported in nine case series, and
included iliac artery dissection in 4% (1/26) of patients, perforation of the
iliac artery in 4% (1/27) and dissection/rupture of the femoral artery in 6%
(2/34) of patients. One case series reported stent fracture in 13% (11/84)
of patients, and six cases of stent migration were reported across 15
case series.
2.4.4 Other reported complications included wound complications in 25% (8/
32) of patients, stroke in 19% (8/43), renal failure requiring dialysis in 11%
(2/19) and paraplegia in 7% (3/43) of patients. For more details, refer to
the Sources of evidence.
2.5 Other comments
2.5.1 It was noted that there was a lack of long-term data on the durability of
stent–grafts.
