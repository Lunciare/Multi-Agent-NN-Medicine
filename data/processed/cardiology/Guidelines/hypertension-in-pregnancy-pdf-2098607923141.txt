Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
This standard is based on NG133 and NG201.
This standard should be read in conjunction with QS22, QS28, QS32, QS3, QS37,
QS15, QS46, QS60, QS105, QS135 and QS192.
Quality statements
Quality statement 2 updates and replaces quality statement 7: risk assessment – pre-
eclampsia in NICE's quality standard on antenatal care.
Statement 1 Women of childbearing potential with treated hypertension are given
information annually about safe antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy.
Statement 2 Pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia at the booking
appointment are offered a prescription of 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin to take daily from
12 weeks until birth.
Although this use is common in UK clinical practice, in August 2021, this was an off-label
use of aspirin. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
Statement 3 Pregnant women taking antihypertensive medication have a blood pressure
target of 135/85 mmHg or less.
Statement 4 Pregnant women with severe hypertension are admitted for a full assessment,
carried out by a healthcare professional trained in managing hypertension in pregnancy.
Statement 5 Women with pre-eclampsia who have severe hypertension or are at a high
risk of adverse events, or if there are any clinical concerns are admitted to hospital and
monitored.
Statement 6 Women with pre-eclampsia have a senior obstetrician involved in any
decisions about the timing of birth.
Statement 7 Women who have had hypertension in pregnancy have a plan for ongoing
antihypertensive management included in their postnatal care plan, which is
communicated to their GP when they are transferred to community care after the birth.

Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
Quality statement 1: Pre-pregnancy advice
for women with treated hypertension
Quality statement
Women of childbearing potential with treated hypertension are given information annually
about safe antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy.
Rationale
Information can be provided to women who may become pregnant about safe
antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy as part of an annual review of hypertension
care. Women should be informed about potential risks, including the risk of congenital
abnormalities, linked to particular antihypertensive drugs. This should enable women to
arrange a discussion with the healthcare professional responsible for managing their
hypertension about alternative antihypertensive treatments if they are planning pregnancy
or become pregnant.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that women of childbearing potential with
treated hypertension are given information annually about safe antihypertensive treatment
during pregnancy.
Data source: Local data collection.

Process
Proportion of women who have had treated hypertension for 12 months or longer who
received information about safe antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy in the past
12 months.
Numerator – the number of women in the denominator who received information about
safe antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy in the past 12 months.
Denominator – the number of women of childbearing potential who have had treated
hypertension for 12 months or longer.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that systems are in place to give women of childbearing
potential with treated hypertension information annually about safe antihypertensive
treatment in pregnancy.
Healthcare professionals give information annually to women of childbearing potential
with treated hypertension about safe antihypertensive treatment in pregnancy.
Commissioners ensure they commission services that give information annually to women
of childbearing potential with treated hypertension about safe antihypertensive treatment
in pregnancy.
Women who are having treatment for hypertension (high blood pressure) and who may
become pregnant are given information annually about safe treatment for high blood
pressure during pregnancy.

Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
[The 12-month timeframe is not derived from the NICE guideline on hypertension in
pregnancy. It is considered a practical timeframe to enable stakeholders to measure
performance]
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Safe antihypertensive treatment
Women taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor
blockers (ARBs) should be provided with information to advise that there is an increased
risk of congenital abnormalities if these drugs are taken during pregnancy, and discuss
alternative antihypertensive treatment with the healthcare professional responsible for
managing their hypertension, if they are planning pregnancy. The Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) drug safety update on ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin II receptor antagonists: not for use in pregnancy states 'Use in women who are
planning pregnancy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, in which case the
potential risks and benefits should be discussed'. If ACE inhibitors or ARBs are being taken
for other conditions such as renal disease, alternative treatment should be discussed with
the healthcare professional responsible for managing their condition.
Women taking thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics should be provided with information to
advise that: there may be an increased risk of congenital abnormality and neonatal
complications if these drugs are taken during pregnancy, and to discuss alternative
antihypertensive treatment with the healthcare professional responsible for managing their
hypertension, if they are planning pregnancy.
Women who take antihypertensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs or thiazide
or thiazide-like diuretics should be provided with information to advise that the limited
evidence available has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such
treatments. [NICE's guideline on hypertension in pregnancy, recommendations 1.3.2 to
1.3.5]
Treated hypertension
Hypertension that is treated with 1 or more antihypertensive drug. [Adapted from NICE's
full guideline on hypertension in pregnancy]

Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
Annual review
Women with childbearing potential are given information annually about safe
antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy. [Expert opinion]
Equality and diversity considerations
'Childbearing potential' should be determined for women on an individual basis. Access to
information about safe antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy should not be
determined solely by age, because childbearing potential is also dependent on factors
other than age.
Where information is provided, there must be equal access to information for all women,
including those with additional needs, such as physical or learning disabilities, and those
who do not speak or read English. Women receiving information should have access to an
interpreter or advocate if needed.
For women with additional needs related to a disability, impairment or sensory loss,
information should be provided as set out in NHS England's Accessible Information
Standard or the equivalent standards for the devolved nations.

Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
Quality statement 2: Antenatal assessment
of pre-eclampsia risk
This quality statement updates and replaces quality statement 7: risk assessment – pre-
eclampsia in NICE's quality standard on antenatal care.
Quality statement
Pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia at the booking appointment are
offered a prescription of 75 mg to 150 mg of aspirin to take daily from 12 weeks until birth.
Although this use is common in UK clinical practice, in August 2021, this was an off-label
use of aspirin. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.
Rationale
Aspirin prophylaxis, unless contraindicated, reduces the occurrence of pre-eclampsia,
preterm birth and fetal and neonatal mortality in women at increased risk of developing
the condition (if they have 1 high risk factor or more than 1 moderate risk factor for pre-
eclampsia).
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that pregnant women have their risk factors
for pre-eclampsia identified and recorded at the booking appointment.

Hypertension in pregnancy (QS35)
Quality statement 4: Assessing women
with severe hypertension in pregnancy
Quality statement
Pregnant women with severe hypertension are admitted for a full assessment, carried out
by a healthcare professional trained in managing hypertension in pregnancy.
Rationale
Effective and safe control of severe hypertension is the most important aspect of critical
care management, because the main causes of maternal death and severe maternal
morbidity (including stroke) are the consequence of poorly controlled hypertension.
Women with severe hypertension in pregnancy should be referred from primary care or
emergency departments as soon as possible to receive assessment from healthcare
professionals with expertise in managing hypertensive disorders. This is essential to
ensure early identification of pre-eclampsia and the provision of critical care where it is
needed.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Blood pressure over 160 mmHg systolic, or over 110 mmHg diastolic. [NICE's guideline on
hypertension in pregnancy, terms used in this guideline]
Full assessment
This should include blood pressure measurements, proteinuria testing and blood tests in
accordance with those set out for severe gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia with
severe hypertension in the NICE guideline on hypertension in pregnancy. [NICE's guideline
on hypertension in pregnancy, recommendation 1.4.3, table 1]
Hypertension in pregnancy
This definition includes chronic hypertension (present at the booking visit or before
20 weeks of pregnancy; this could include pre-existing hypertension), gestational
hypertension (new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without proteinuria) and pre-
eclampsia (new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks of pregnancy and the coexistence

Quality statement 5: Admission to hospital
for women with pre-eclampsia
Quality statement
Women with pre-eclampsia who have severe hypertension or are at a high risk of adverse
events, or if there are any clinical concerns, are admitted to hospital and monitored.
Rationale
Women with pre-eclampsia who have severe hypertension or are at a high risk of adverse
events, or if there are any clinical concerns for the wellbeing of the woman or baby, should
be admitted to hospital to enable their condition to be fully assessed and its progress
monitored. High-quality care should include an integrated package of care for these
women that includes admission and monitoring. Some women may need to stay in hospital
until after the birth of their baby. For other women, monitoring may be possible if pre-
eclampsia is stable and if the woman has access to monitoring services, and can be
readmitted to hospital if her clinical condition deteriorates.

Quality statement 6: Timing of birth for
women with pre-eclampsia
Quality statement
Women with pre-eclampsia have a senior obstetrician involved in any decisions about the
timing of birth.
Rationale
Some women who have pre-eclampsia with mild or moderate hypertension will progress to
severe pre-eclampsia, which is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Because the
progress of the condition differs between women, a senior obstetrician should be involved
in any decisions about the timing of birth.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that women with pre-eclampsia have a senior
obstetrician involved in decisions about the timing of birth.

Quality statement 7: Transfer of
information about ongoing management
Quality statement
Women who have had hypertension in pregnancy have a plan for ongoing antihypertensive
management included in their postnatal care plan, which is communicated to their GP
when they are transferred to community care after the birth.
Rationale
There are particular risks to women who have had hypertension in pregnancy (such as the
risk of stroke) in the immediate postnatal period. The development of an individualised
care plan for women who have had hypertension in pregnancy before they are transferred
to community care should support ongoing antihypertensive management and enable risks
to be monitored and addressed, including variations in blood pressure.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

This definition includes chronic hypertension (present at the booking visit or before
20 weeks of pregnancy; this could include pre-existing hypertension), gestational
hypertension (new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks without proteinuria) and pre-
eclampsia (new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks of pregnancy and the coexistence
of 1 or more of the following new-onset conditions):
• proteinuria (urine protein:creatinine ratio 30 mg/mmol or more, or albumin:creatinine
ratio of 8 mg/mmol or more, or at least 1 g/litre [2+] on dipstick testing) or

Quality statement 8: Communicating
information about future risks
Quality statement
Women who have had gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia discuss future pregnancy
and lifetime cardiovascular risks during a medical review at their 6- to 8-week postnatal
medical check.
Rationale
The long-term risks for women who have had hypertension in pregnancy include
developing high blood pressure and an increased lifetime cardiovascular risk. Increased
awareness and surveillance may lead to earlier intervention, such as antihypertensive
treatment, with likely benefits for the woman. Women should be made aware of risks in
future pregnancies resulting from hypertension in a previous pregnancy.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Update information
July 2019: Changes have been made to align this quality standard with the NICE guideline
on hypertension in pregnancy. Statement 2 has been amended to reflect the
recommended dose of aspirin for pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. The
blood pressure target in statement 3 was changed for pregnant women taking
antihypertensive medication, in line with the updated guideline. In statement 5 the criteria
for hospital admission and frequency of monitoring were changed. In statement 6 the
involvement of a senior obstetrician in decisions on the timing of birth for women with pre-
eclampsia was highlighted. References and links to source guidance have also been
updated.
Minor changes since publication
August 2021: Recommendation numbers, references and links to source guidance have
been updated to align statement 2 with the updated NICE guideline on antenatal care.

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
Information about the topic expert group members is available from the webpage for this
quality standard.
This quality standard has been included in the NICE Pathways on antenatal care and
hypertension in pregnancy which bring together everything we have said on a topic in an
interactive flowchart.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.

Resource impact
NICE quality standards should be achievable by local services. The potential resource
impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource
impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource
impact statement for NICE's guideline on antenatal care to help estimate local costs.
Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the
quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
