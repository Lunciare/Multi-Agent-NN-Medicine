Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Quality statement 1: Diagnosis
Quality statement
Adults with a baseline total cholesterol above 7.5 mmol/l are assessed for a clinical
diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).
Rationale
Most of the 120,000 people estimated to have FH are undiagnosed and untreated.
Because untreated FH carries a very high risk of cardiovascular disease, it is important
that every opportunity is taken to identify people with FH and offer them treatment.
Considering a clinical diagnosis of FH in people with high cholesterol will result in greater
identification of FH and support cascade testing of their relatives. This will lead to more
treatment to reduce cholesterol levels and prevention of coronary events among people
with FH.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with a baseline total cholesterol
above 7.5 mmol/l are assessed for a clinical diagnosis of FH.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
Proportion of adults with a baseline total cholesterol above 7.5 mmol/l who are assessed
for a clinical diagnosis of FH.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Quality statement 2: Specialist referral
Quality statement
People with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are referred for
specialist assessment.
Rationale
Diagnosing and managing FH in an individual and their relatives can be complex, and is
best achieved when there is access to specialist services. Specialist assessments, which
include DNA testing, can confirm a diagnosis. Once an accurate diagnosis has been made,
people with FH can receive appropriate treatment, and cascade testing can be started to
identify affected family members.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that people with a clinical diagnosis of FH are
referred for specialist assessment.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that a protocol for referral for a specialist
assessment is agreed between primary and secondary care.

Specialist assessment
This should include:
• confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of FH made by a GP or other healthcare
professional
• an offer of DNA testing to increase the certainty of the diagnosis
• initiation of cascade testing if a diagnosis is confirmed.
A specialist assessment should be performed by a healthcare professional with expertise
in FH who has access to the wider skills of a multidisciplinary team. This team should
include a dietitian, cardiologist and paediatrician, and a clinical genetic specialist to take a
family history and obtain informed consent for a DNA test. For children and young people,
this should be a specialist with expertise in FH in children and young people.
Children refers to people younger than 10, young people refers to those aged 10 up to and
including age 15, and adults refers to people aged 16 and older.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Quality statement 4: Diagnosis in children
under 10 years
Quality statement
Children at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are offered diagnostic tests by the
age of 10 years.
Rationale
Children with FH begin to develop cardiovascular disease before clinical signs appear, with
thickening of the carotid artery wall identifiable by the age of 10 years. Diagnosis by the
age of 10 years allows lifestyle changes and tailored therapy if indicated, which will reduce
long-term problems associated with high cholesterol and improve long-term health.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that children at risk of FH are offered diagnostic
tests by the age of 10 years.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)
FH relates to heterozygous FH only.
Children at risk of FH
Children (under 10 years) with 1 affected parent.
Diagnostic tests
Children at risk of FH because of 1 affected parent receive either of the following
diagnostic tests:
• A DNA test if the family mutation is known.
• LDL-C concentration measurement if the family mutation is not known. When
excluding a diagnosis of FH a further LDL-C measurement should be repeated after
puberty because LDL-C concentrations change during puberty.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia]
Specialist with expertise in FH in children and young people
A healthcare professional with expertise in FH in children and young people who has
access to the wider skills of a multidisciplinary team. This team should include a dietitian,
cardiologist and paediatrician, and a clinical genetic specialist to take a family history and
obtain informed consent for a DNA test. All children and young people being investigated
for a diagnosis of FH should be referred to a specialist with expertise in FH in children and
young people in a child-focused setting.
Child-focused setting
A child-focused setting is defined as valuing the child's view and validating their voice in
making decisions impacting their lives. A child-focused facility or space is one designed
with the children's needs in mind. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on familial
hypercholesterolaemia, terms used in this guideline]

Quality statement 5: Cascade testing
Quality statement
Relatives of people with a confirmed diagnosis of monogenic familial
hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are offered DNA testing through a nationwide, systematic
cascade process.
Rationale
Most people in the UK with FH are undiagnosed. Cascade testing has been shown to be
effective for identifying people with FH, especially when provided nationwide. Nationwide
cascade testing ensures that all family members can access DNA testing wherever they
live.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)
FH relates to heterozygous FH only.
Monogenic FH
Present when an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of elevated LDL-C levels is
seen in the extended family of the proband (for example, on average 50% of first-degree
relatives have elevated levels). In relatives, the age- and gender-specific diagnostic
cut-offs in NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia should be used because the
Simon Broome diagnostic cut-offs are not appropriate for relatives. The diagnosis of
monogenic FH can also be given when the index case carries a documented FH-causing
mutation in the LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 genes.
Confirmed diagnosis of monogenic FH
This requires evidence from DNA testing of an FH-causing mutation in the LDLR, APOB or
PCSK9 genes. Before cascade testing is initiated in relatives, a diagnosis of monogenic FH
in the index person should be confirmed by a specialist with expertise in FH.
Cascade testing
A mechanism for identifying people at risk of a genetic condition by a process of family
tracing. For FH, the test employed is a DNA test where a disease-causing mutation has
been identified in the index individual/proband.

Quality statement 6: Drug treatment in
adults
Quality statement
Adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) receive lipid-modifying drug treatment to
reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline.
Rationale
Lipid-modifying drug treatment reduces LDL-C levels and prevents the development of
cardiovascular disease. Studies indicate that treatment that lowers LDL-C levels by more
than 50% from baseline offers greater benefit for plaque stabilisation than treatment that
is less effective at reducing LDL-C.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with FH receive lipid-modifying drug
treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
Proportion of adults with FH who receive appropriate lipid-modifying drug treatment.
Numerator – The number of people in the denominator receiving appropriate
lipid-modifying drug treatment.

Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
Number of adults with FH whose LDL-C concentration is reduced by more than 50% from
baseline within 1 year.
Data source: Local data collection using a dedicated database.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that systems are in place for adults with FH to receive
lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from
baseline.
Healthcare practitioners offer adults with FH lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce
LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from baseline.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services that offer adults with FH
lipid-modifying drug treatment to reduce LDL-C concentration by more than 50% from
baseline.
Adults with FH are offered drugs to reduce the low-density cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)
FH relates to heterozygous FH only.
Adults with FH
Adults (aged 16 and older) should have a diagnosis of FH made by a specialist with
expertise in FH.
Baseline LDL-C
The concentration before treatment.
Lipid-modifying drug treatment
Lipid-modifying drug treatment should be given in accordance with the following:
• to achieve the recommended reduction:
－ offer a high-intensity statin with the lowest acquisition cost as the initial treatment
－ increase dose of statin to maximum licensed or tolerated dose
• ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended if the person is intolerant to statin therapy or
there are contraindications to initial statin therapy
• co-administer ezetimibe with initial statin therapy when serum total or LDL-C
concentration is not appropriately controlled and a change from initial statin therapy to
an alternative statin is being considered.
Statins are classified as high intensity if they produce greater LDL-C reductions than
simvastatin 40 mg (for example, simvastatin 80 mg and appropriate doses of atorvastatin
and rosuvastatin).
Treatment for FH is usually provided by either a specialist with expertise in FH or a GP
through a shared care arrangement. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on familial
hypercholesterolaemia, recommendations 1.3.1.2 to 1.3.1.6, 1.3.1.11, and terms used in this

guideline]
Equality and diversity considerations
The statement has been restricted to adults only because there is currently no evidence
on which to base any specific target for lowering LDL-C in children and young people
under 16 years. However, lipid-modifying drug treatment should be considered by the age
of 10 years in line with NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia.
Women with FH should be advised that lipid-modifying drug treatment should not be taken
if they are planning to conceive or during pregnancy because of the risk of fetal
abnormality. Women should be advised that lipid-modifying drug treatment should be
stopped 3 months before they attempt to conceive. Women with FH should be advised
about the potential risks and benefits of re-starting lipid-modifying drug treatment for the
mother and breastfed infant. Resins are the only lipid-modifying drug treatment that
should be considered during breastfeeding.

Quality statement 7: Drug treatment in
children
Quality statement
Children with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are assessed for lipid-modifying drug
treatment by a specialist with expertise in FH in a child-focused setting by the age of
10 years.
Rationale
Children with FH begin to develop cardiovascular disease before clinical signs appear, with
thickening of the carotid artery wall identifiable by the age of 10 years. Once a child is
diagnosed as having FH, it is important they should be assessed for lipid-modifying drug
treatment as soon as possible. The assessment should include a discussion of the harms
and benefits of different treatments. This allows children to start treatment as soon as it is
appropriate and before significant atherosclerosis has developed.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that children with FH are assessed for
lipid-modifying drug treatment by a specialist with expertise in FH in a child-focused
setting by the age of 10 years.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers ensure that systems are in place for children with FH to be assessed for
lipid-modifying drug treatment by a specialist with expertise in FH in a child-focused
setting by the age of 10 years.
Specialists with expertise in FH in children and young people assess children with FH for
lipid-modifying drug treatment in a child-focused setting by the age of 10 years.
Commissioners ensure that they commission services in which specialists with expertise
in FH assess children with FH for lipid-modifying drug treatment, in a child-focused
setting, by the age of 10 years.
Children with FH have an assessment for possible drug treatment to reduce the
low-density cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in their blood by a specialist in a children's
department, by the age of 10 years.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (QS41)
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)
FH relates to heterozygous FH only.
Assessment for lipid-modifying drug treatment
The decision to offer or defer lipid-modifying drug treatment for a child or young person
should take into account their age, age at onset of coronary heart disease within the
family and the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, including their LDL-C
concentration. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on familial hypercholesterolaemia,
recommendation 1.3.1.18]
Specialist with expertise in FH in children and young people
A healthcare professional with expertise in FH in children and young people who has
access to the wider skills of a multidisciplinary team. This team should include a dietitian,
cardiologist and paediatrician, and a clinical genetic specialist to take a family history and
obtain informed consent for a DNA test.
Child-focused setting
A child-focused setting is defined as valuing the child's view and validating their voice in
making decisions impacting their lives. A child-focused facility or space is one designed
with the children's needs in mind. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on familial
hypercholesterolaemia, terms used in this guideline]
Equality and diversity considerations
Boys and girls should have equal access to lipid-modifying drug treatment for FH. There is
anecdotal evidence that some clinicians are less likely to recommend statins in a girl than
a boy at the same level of individual risk, arguing that because the age at onset of
coronary heart disease in women is later than in men, the start of drug treatment can be
'safely' delayed until adulthood. However, many young women will need to stop statins for
several years when they are trying to conceive, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Because the accumulation of LDL-C burden is similar in boys and girls, this will result in the

exposure to high LDL-C being greater in early adulthood in young women than in their
male siblings. Gender should not influence a clinician's decision to offer treatment; the
decision should be made in accordance with the recommendations in NICE's guideline on
familial hypercholesterolaemia, which indicate that lipid lowering with statins should be
considered by the age of 10 years.

Quality statement 8: Annual review
Quality statement
People with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are offered a structured review at least
annually.
Rationale
Regular structured review enables treatment to be monitored and adjusted to achieve the
recommended LDL-C concentration. It also enables monitoring for the possible
development of symptoms and signs of coronary heart disease and optimising
management. Records can be maintained of affected family members and information can
be tailored to individual circumstances. Progress with cascade testing of at-risk relatives
can be monitored.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details about our standing
committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is
available from the webpage for this quality standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.
Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the

quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Good communication between healthcare practitioners and people with familial
hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is essential. Treatment, care and support, and the information
given about it, should be culturally appropriate. It should also be accessible to people with
additional needs such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and to people who do
not speak or read English. People with FH should have access to an interpreter or
advocate if needed.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
