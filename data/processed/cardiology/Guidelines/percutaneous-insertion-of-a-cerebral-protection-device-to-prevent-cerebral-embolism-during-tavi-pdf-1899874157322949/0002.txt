Percutaneous insertion of a cerebral protection device to prevent cerebral embolism

procedure should be done by the multidisciplinary team that is considering the suitability of TAVI. 1.4 This procedure should only be done in specialised centres, and only by clinicians and teams with specific training and experience in complex endovascular interventions. Centres doing this procedure should have both cardiac and vascular surgical support for the emergency treatment of complications and subsequent patient care. 1.5 NICE encourages further research on percutaneous insertion of a cerebral protection device to prevent cerebral embolism during TAVI. This should include details of patient selection and risk stratification for TAVI-related stroke. NICE may update the guidance on publication of further evidence. 2 The condition and procedure The condition 2.1 Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) aims to provide a less invasive alternative to open cardiac surgery for treating aortic stenosis, avoiding the need for sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass. However, debris may be dislodged during the TAVI procedure. This can enter the cerebral circulation and embolise, causing cerebral ischaemic events including a stroke. The procedure 2.2 Percutaneous insertion of a cerebral protection device aims to prevent debris dislodged during TAVI from passing into the cerebral circulation. The aim is to reduce the risk of cerebral ischaemic events including a
