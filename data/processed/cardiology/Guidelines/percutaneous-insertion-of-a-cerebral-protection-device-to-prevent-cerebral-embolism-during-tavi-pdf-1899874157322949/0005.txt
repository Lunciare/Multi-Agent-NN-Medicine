Percutaneous insertion of a cerebral protection device to prevent cerebral embolism

are different types of devices available to prevent cerebral embolism during TAVI, and they work in different ways. The committee noted that most of the evidence it reviewed came from 1 type of device, and that the technology is evolving. 3.6 Embolic stroke following TAVI is rare, but when it happens it can be devastating. The studies reviewed by the committee had limited statistical power to evaluate rare outcomes. 3.7 Using a cerebral protection device does not eliminate the risk of embolic stroke following TAVI. 3.8 Detecting cerebral lesions resulting from incomplete protection is challenging and the methods for doing it may have differed between the studies. 3.9 The valves used for the TAVI procedure differ, but cerebral protection benefit during TAVI has been demonstrated across all valve types.
