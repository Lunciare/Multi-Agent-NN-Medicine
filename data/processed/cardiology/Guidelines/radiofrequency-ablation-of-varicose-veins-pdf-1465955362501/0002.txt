100% of long saphenous veins. In one study, patients who received radiofrequency ablation had less pain and required less analgesia compared with those who had standard surgery (stripping). 2.3.2 In general, the evidence showed that fewer than 5% of patients continued to have symptoms, such as leg pain, leg fatigue, oedema and noticeable varicose veins, after the procedure. There were high patient satisfaction rates. For more details, see the overview. 2.3.3 The Specialist Advisors reported that the long-term results of this procedure were unknown, though in the short-term it seemed efficacious. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 One study showed similar postoperative complication rates of approximately 50% in the radiofrequency ablation and stripping arms, including minor complications. Other studies showed that skin burns occurred in 2% to 7% of patients who had radiofrequency ablation. Paraesthesiae occurred in 0% to 15% of patients, and were more common in patients whose treatment was below the knee. Clinical phlebitis occurred in 2% to 3% of patients, deep vein thrombosis occurred in 1% and pulmonary embolism was uncommon, occurring in fewer than 1%. For more details, see the overview. 2.4.2 The Specialist Advisors reported similar complications to those above. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 The Committee noted that
