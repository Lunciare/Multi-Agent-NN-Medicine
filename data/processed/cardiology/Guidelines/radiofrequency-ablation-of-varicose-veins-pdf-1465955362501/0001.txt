1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins appears adequate to support the use of this procedure as an alternative to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping, provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Symptomatic venous insufficiency is common. Saphenous vein insufficiency is the most common form of venous insufficiency in those presenting with symptoms, which include pain, leg fatigue, oedema, skin changes and venous ulcers. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins involves heating the wall of the vein using a bipolar generator and catheters with sheathable electrodes. 2.2.2 The long saphenous vein is accessed above or below the knee, either percutaneously via an intravenous cannula/venepuncture sheath or via a small incision. The catheter is manually withdrawn at 2.5 to 3 cm/minute, and the vein wall temperature is maintained at 85°C. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 Evidence indicated that radiofrequency treatment resulted in immediate occlusion of 90% to 100% of long saphenous veins. In one study, patients who received radiofrequency ablation had less pain and required less analgesia compared with those who had standard surgery (stripping). 2.3.2 In
