Endovascular insertion of an intrasaccular wire-mesh blood-flow disruption device for intracranial aneurysms

Rupture of intracranial aneurysms causes subarachnoid haemorrhage and is associated with a very poor prognosis. About 10% of people die before reaching hospital and a further 50% die within 4 weeks. About 50% of people who survive a subarachnoid haemorrhage have a persistent neurological deficit. 2.2 If an intracranial aneurysm is detected before it ruptures, treatment may be recommended to prevent it rupturing in the future. This is typically only done if the risk of a rupture is particularly high. Current treatments 2.3 Current options for managing intracranial aneurysms include coiling, often with stent placement (stent-assisted coiling), neurosurgical clipping through a craniotomy (with or without bypass procedures), parent vessel occlusion (by open neurosurgery or by endovascular means) and conservative management. Flow diverter embolisation devices, which are placed in the parent blood vessel to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm itself, may be an option for some people with intracranial aneurysms. The procedure 2.4 Endovascular insertion of an intrasaccular wire-mesh blood-flow disruption device for intracranial aneurysms is used for the embolisation of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. It may be particularly suitable for people with wide-necked aneurysms. The procedure is usually done under general anaesthesia. A catheter is inserted into
