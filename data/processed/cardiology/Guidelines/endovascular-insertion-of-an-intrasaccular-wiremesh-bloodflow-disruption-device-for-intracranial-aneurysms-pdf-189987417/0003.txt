Endovascular insertion of an intrasaccular wire-mesh blood-flow disruption device for intracranial aneurysms

embolisation of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. It may be particularly suitable for people with wide-necked aneurysms. The procedure is usually done under general anaesthesia. A catheter is inserted into the femoral artery and advanced into the cerebral circulation under X-ray guidance. A second, smaller catheter is put inside the first and is inserted into the aneurysm. A basket-like device made of fine wire mesh is then pushed through the second catheter and placed into the aneurysm sac. The mesh device covers the aneurysm neck and obstructs blood flow into the aneurysm sac, creating blood stasis and promoting endothelial growth across the neck of the aneurysm. The appropriate device size is selected according to the aneurysm width and height. 2.5 The aim is to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing or to stop further bleeding from an aneurysm that has already ruptured. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 To inform the committee, NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 13 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 1 systematic review, 2 non-randomised comparative studies, 9
