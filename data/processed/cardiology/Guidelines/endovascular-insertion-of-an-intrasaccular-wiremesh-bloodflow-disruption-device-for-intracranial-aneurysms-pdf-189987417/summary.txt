1 Recommendations 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endovascular insertion of an intrasaccular wire-mesh blood-flow disruption device for intracranial aneurysms is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. Find out what standard arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page. 1.2 Patient selection should be done by a multidisciplinary team, except for in emergency situations, when this may be replaced by a discussion between an interventional neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon. 1.3 The procedure should only be done in specialised centres with expertise in the use of this technology and access to neurosurgical facilities. 2 The condition, current treatments and procedure The condition 2.1 An intracranial aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, usually where it branches. Most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they rupture.
