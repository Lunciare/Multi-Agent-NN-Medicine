Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral

several areas (such as the coronary and peripheral arteries) are at higher risk of events. However other factors also increase risk including diabetes, high body mass index and smoking. At technical engagement, it was queried whether the company's subgroups are clinically relevant and represent people at highest risk of atherothrombotic events who are likely to benefit most from treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin. The clinical experts agreed that although these subgroups are clinically identifiable and relevant, there are other groups of people who are also at high risk. These include people who have had myocardial infarction or stroke, and those with multi-vessel coronary disease and diabetes. These people could derive similar benefit from rivaroxaban plus aspirin as seen in the 3 subgroups, because there was no between-group heterogeneity in relative treatment effects reported in COMPASS. The committee acknowledged the company's attempt to predict people with higher baseline risk using the 3 subgroups but noted that although the subgroups are illustrative of people at high risk, they do not identify all people at highest absolute risk of ischaemic events. The clinical experts also highlighted the difficulty in identifying people who are at greatest risk in clinical practice and agreed that, because
