evidence for rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel. The clinical experts explained that clopidogrel is the preferred antiplatelet treatment for people with peripheral artery disease (based on NICE's technology appraisal guidance for the prevention of occlusive vascular events), but it is not a relevant comparator for the whole COMPASS population. This is because aspirin is the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with stable coronary artery disease, and clopidogrel is only recommended when aspirin is unsuitable because of contraindication or hypersensitivity. The committee concluded that clopidogrel is not a relevant comparator for the overall COMPASS population and that it is appropriate to base its recommendation on a comparison of rivaroxaban plus aspirin with aspirin alone. The indirect comparison of rivaroxaban against ticagrelor does not provide reliable estimates of relative effectiveness or risk of bleeding 3.8 To estimate the relative efficacy of rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin, the company did an indirect treatment comparison of COMPASS against data from another trial (PEGASUS). The ERG highlighted that the indirect comparison is methodologically sound, but there are important differences between the patients included in the 2 trials. The proportion of people who had had a myocardial
