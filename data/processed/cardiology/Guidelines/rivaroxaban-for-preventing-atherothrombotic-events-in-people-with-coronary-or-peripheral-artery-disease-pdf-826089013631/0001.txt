artery disease 1 Recommendations 1.1 Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is recommended within its marketing authorisation, as an option for preventing atherothrombotic events in adults with coronary artery disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease who are at high risk of ischaemic events. 1.2 For people with coronary artery disease, high risk of ischaemic events is defined as: • aged 65 or over, or • atherosclerosis in at least 2 vascular territories (such as coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arteries), or • 2 or more of the following risk factors: － current smoking － diabetes － kidney dysfunction with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min (note that rivaroxaban is contraindicated if the eGFR is less than 15 ml/min) － heart failure － previous non-lacunar ischaemic stroke. 1.3 Assess the person's risk of bleeding before considering rivaroxaban. Treatment should only be started after an informed discussion with them about the risks and benefits of rivaroxaban, weighing up the risk of atherothrombotic events against the risk of bleeding.
