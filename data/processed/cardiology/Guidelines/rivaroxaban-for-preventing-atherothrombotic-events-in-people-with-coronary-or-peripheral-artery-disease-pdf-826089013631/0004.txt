Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral

was aware that several issues were resolved during the technical engagement stage, and agreed that: • It is more clinically plausible to substitute transition probability values used in the economic model that were numerically zero with non-zero values taken from the REACH registry. • The company's economic model underestimates the effect of varying the stratified mortality outcome 'cardiovascular death' in its sensitivity analyses. The company used the hazard ratio (HR) value for 'all cardiovascular death' from the COMPASS trial and assumed the same HR for all stratified death events in its model. Each mortality HR was then varied separately in the deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Because each death rate only included a small proportion of all cardiovascular deaths, the effect of varying the HRs individually in the sensitivity analyses was underestimated. This issue had no effect on the results of the base-case analysis and only related to the uncertainty in the sensitivity analyses. The committee recognised that there were remaining areas of uncertainty associated with in its decision making. It discussed the following issues (issues 1, 2 and 3), which were outstanding after the technical engagement stage. Clinical need and current management Patients rely on clinicians to discuss with
