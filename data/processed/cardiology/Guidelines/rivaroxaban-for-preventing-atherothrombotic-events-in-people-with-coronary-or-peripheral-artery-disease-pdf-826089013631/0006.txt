potential benefits and risks should be fully discussed. Patients would welcome an additional treatment option with an acceptable benefit-risk ratio for the prevention of atherothrombotic events 3.2 NICE's guideline on myocardial infarction: cardiac rehabilitation and prevention of further cardiovascular disease (now replaced by NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes) recommends dual antiplatelet therapy for people who have had an acute myocardial infarction. NICE's guideline on management of stable angina recommends considering aspirin 75 mg daily for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. NICE's technology appraisal guidance recommends ticagrelor in combination with aspirin for preventing atherothrombotic events in people who have had a myocardial infarction and are at high risk of a further event. The clinical experts noted that despite widespread use of aspirin in both acute and secondary care, the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and dying from cardiovascular disease remains high for these patients. An additional treatment option that could reduce this risk would be welcomed by patients. The potential clinical benefit from treatment would need to be assessed, taking into consideration the potential risk of major bleeding events. The committee concluded that people with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease would welcome an additional treatment option with an
