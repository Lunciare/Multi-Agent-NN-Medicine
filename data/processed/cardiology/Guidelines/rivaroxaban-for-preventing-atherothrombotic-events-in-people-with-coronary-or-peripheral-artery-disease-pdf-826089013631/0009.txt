people at highest absolute risk of ischaemic events. The clinical experts also highlighted the difficulty in identifying people who are at greatest risk in clinical practice and agreed that, because there is no inter-group difference in treatment effects in COMPASS, the results from the overall population should be considered for decision making. However, the committee was aware that, within the overall eligible population, clinicians are likely to identify people at highest absolute risk of ischaemic events and offer rivaroxaban to those who are likely to have the highest potential absolute benefit. People at high risk of ischaemic events and no known increased bleeding risk will have the most favourable benefit−risk profile. The committee concluded that the efficacy results from the whole COMPASS population should be considered rather than the 3 subpopulations identified by the company, and it did not consider the subgroups further. Rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events 3.4 The primary efficacy outcome in COMPASS was a composite of 3 major cardiovascular events: myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and 'cardiovascular death'. The committee noted that rivaroxaban plus aspirin showed a statistically significant relative risk reduction of 24% in major cardiovascular events compared with aspirin (HR 0.76, 95%
