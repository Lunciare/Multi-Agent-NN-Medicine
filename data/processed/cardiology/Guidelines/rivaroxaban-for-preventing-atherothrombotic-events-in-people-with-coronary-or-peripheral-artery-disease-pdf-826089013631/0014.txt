Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral

highlighted that the indirect comparison is methodologically sound, but there are important differences between the patients included in the 2 trials. The proportion of people who had had a myocardial infarction was 100% in PEGASUS, but 62% in COMPASS. Also, the time since a myocardial infarction was between 1 and 3 years in PEGASUS, but in COMPASS people could have had a myocardial infarction at any time within the past 20 years. A clinical expert also noted that people in PEGASUS and COMPASS did not necessarily have the same baseline bleeding risk, and the trials used different methods to define significant bleeding (modified ISTH in COMPASS and TIMI in PEGASUS), making it difficult to compare the rates of bleeding in the 2 trials. The committee noted that the company did not use the results of the indirect comparison in its economic model. It concluded that COMPASS and PEGASUS have too many differences to allow a reliable estimate of the relative efficacy or bleeding risk of rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin. The company's economic model The model is appropriate for decision making 3.9 The company modelled cost effectiveness using a Markov model with 5 states (event-free, non-fatal myocardial
