Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral

benefits of continuing treatment with rivaroxaban should be regularly reviewed. Why the committee made these recommendations People with chronic coronary artery disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease can have atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. A clinical trial of people at high risk of ischaemic events shows that, compared with aspirin alone, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduces the risk of having an ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or dying from cardiovascular disease. However, it increases the risk of bleeding. The benefits and risks of rivaroxaban plus aspirin are only known for the specific population in the trial; that is, people at high risk of ischaemic events as defined by the inclusion criteria of the trial. A person's risk of bleeding should be assessed before rivaroxaban is considered. The decision to start treatment should be taken after an informed discussion about the risks and benefits, weighing up the risk of ischaemic events against the bleeding risk. The cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban is within the range that is considered an acceptable use of NHS resources. Aspirin plus rivaroxaban is therefore recommended as a treatment option for people at high risk of having atherothrombotic events, who are not identified as having an increased
