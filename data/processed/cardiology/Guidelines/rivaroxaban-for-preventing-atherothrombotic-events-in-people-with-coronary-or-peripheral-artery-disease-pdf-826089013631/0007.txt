into consideration the potential risk of major bleeding events. The committee concluded that people with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease would welcome an additional treatment option with an acceptable benefit-risk ratio for the prevention of atherothrombotic events. Clinical evidence It is appropriate to consider the overall COMPASS population for decision making 3.3 COMPASS is a double-blind randomised clinical trial comparing rivaroxaban plus aspirin against aspirin alone in people with stable coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease who are at high risk of ischaemic events. The company presented data for the overall trial population and also for 3 subpopulations that it identified as being at especially high baseline risk of ischaemic events: people with coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, people with coronary artery disease and heart failure, and people with coronary artery disease and poor kidney function. The risk of ischaemic events is related to the person's medical history and the extent of atheroma. People with heart failure, diabetes, poor kidney function or diffuse atherosclerosis affecting several areas (such as the coronary and peripheral arteries) are at higher risk of events. However other factors also increase risk including diabetes, high body mass index and smoking. At
