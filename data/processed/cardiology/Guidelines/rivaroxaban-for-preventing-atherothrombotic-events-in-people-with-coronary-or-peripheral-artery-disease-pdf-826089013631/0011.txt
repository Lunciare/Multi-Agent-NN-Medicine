intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or bleeding into the surgical site requiring re-operation), and/or bleeding leading to hospitalisation (with or without an overnight stay). The risk of major bleeding, as defined by the modified ISTH criteria, increased by 70% in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group compared with aspirin alone (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.05; p<0.001). The bleeds in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group were mostly gastrointestinal, with non-significant differences for the other components of the primary safety outcome. The committee concluded that rivaroxaban plus aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban should only be used in people at high risk of ischaemic events defined by the inclusion criteria of COMPASS 3.6 The clinical experts highlighted that COMPASS is a highly selected population that includes people at high risk of ischaemic events but excludes people with a known increased bleeding risk. The committee noted that the benefits and risks of rivaroxaban plus aspirin are only known for the specific population of people in COMPASS; that is, people with a high risk of ischaemic events as defined by the inclusion criteria of the trial. The committee recalled that the clinical benefits and risks associated with rivaroxaban
