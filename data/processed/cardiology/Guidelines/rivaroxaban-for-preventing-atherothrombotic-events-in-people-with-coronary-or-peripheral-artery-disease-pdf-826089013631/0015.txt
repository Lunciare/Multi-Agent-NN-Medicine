Rivaroxaban for preventing atherothrombotic events in people with coronary or peripheral

ticagrelor plus aspirin. The company's economic model The model is appropriate for decision making 3.9 The company modelled cost effectiveness using a Markov model with 5 states (event-free, non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage and death). These were subdivided into acute event (0 to 3 months after an acute event), post-event (3 or more months after an acute event) and second acute event. The efficacy and clinical parameters in the model were derived from COMPASS for the comparison of rivaroxaban plus aspirin against aspirin alone. For the comparison against ticagrelor plus aspirin, the results from the indirect comparison of COMPASS and PEGASUS were not directly used to inform the economic model. Instead, the model used HRs from the COMPASS and PEGASUS trials, which the committee considered appropriate. The committee concluded that the structure of the company's model is appropriate for decision making. Cost-effectiveness estimates Rivaroxaban plus aspirin is cost effective compared with aspirin alone 3.10 The company's base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone is £14,185 per quality- adjusted life year gained. The committee noted that the ICER is in the range normally considered cost effective and therefore concluded that rivaroxaban plus aspirin
