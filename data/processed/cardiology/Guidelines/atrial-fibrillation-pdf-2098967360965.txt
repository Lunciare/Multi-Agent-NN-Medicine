Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
This standard is based on NG196 and HTG353.
This standard should be read in conjunction with QS3, QS6, QS9, QS11, QS21, QS28,
QS84, QS15, QS2, QS100, QS103, QS120 and QS183.
Quality statements
Statement 1 Adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk
2 2 C
score of 2 or above are offered anticoagulation.
Statement 2 Adults with atrial fibrillation are not prescribed aspirin as monotherapy for
stroke prevention.
Statement 3 Adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation discuss the
options with their healthcare professional at least once a year.
Statement 4 Adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist who have poor
anticoagulation control have their anticoagulation reassessed.
Statement 5 Adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms
are referred for specialised management within 4 weeks.
Statement 6 (developmental) Adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K
antagonist therapy are supported to self-manage with a coagulometer.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 1: Anticoagulation to
reduce stroke risk
Quality statement
Adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or
2 2 C
above are offered anticoagulation.
Rationale
Adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or
2 2 C
above are at a much higher risk of having a stroke than the general population.
Anticoagulation therapy can help to prevent strokes by reducing the likelihood of a blood
clot forming. A person's bleeding risk should be taken into account in reaching a decision
about anticoagulation, although for most people the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs
the bleeding risk.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults with
non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or above are
2 2 C
offered anticoagulation.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
Proportion of adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
score of 2 or above who receive anticoagulation.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who receive anticoagulation.
Denominator – the number of adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a
CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or above.
2 2 C
Data source: Local data collection. Data can be collected using the NHS Quality and
Outcomes Framework indicator AF007.
Outcome
Stroke rates in adults with a primary diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
Data source: Local data collection. Data can be collected using the Royal College of
Physicians' Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), question 2.1.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary, secondary and tertiary care services) have written clinical
protocols in place to ensure that anticoagulation is offered to adults with non-valvular
atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or above.
2 2 C
Healthcare professionals offer anticoagulation to adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
and a CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or above.
2 2 C
Commissioners commission primary, secondary and tertiary care services with written
clinical protocols to ensure that adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a
CHA DS -VAS stroke risk score of 2 or above are offered anticoagulation.
2 2 C
Adults with a type of atrial fibrillation called 'non-valvular' who are identified by their
doctor as being at higher risk of having a stroke are offered treatment with a medicine
called an anticoagulant, to lower their risk of having a blood clot that could cause a stroke.

Source guidance
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline 196 (2021), recommendation
1.6.3
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
CHA DS -VASc stroke risk score
2 2
The CHA DS -VASc stroke risk score estimates the risk of stroke in people with
2 2
non-valvular atrial fibrillation. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation,
recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.6.3]
Bleeding risk score
Bleeding risk, estimated using ORBIT bleeding risk score, should be taken into account
when offering anticoagulation. The ORBIT bleeding risk score estimates the risk of
bleeding.
Although ORBIT is the best tool for this purpose, other bleeding risk tools may need to be
used until it is embedded in clinical pathways and electronic systems. [Adapted from
NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendation 1.2.2]

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 2: Use of aspirin
Quality statement
Adults with atrial fibrillation are not prescribed aspirin as monotherapy for stroke
prevention.
Rationale
The risks of taking aspirin outweigh any benefits of taking it as monotherapy for stroke
prevention in adults with atrial fibrillation. Healthcare professionals should be aware that
adults with atrial fibrillation may need to take aspirin for other indications.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local monitoring arrangements to ensure that adults with atrial fibrillation are
not prescribed aspirin as monotherapy for stroke prevention.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
Proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed aspirin as monotherapy for
stroke prevention.

Data source: Local data collection. Data can be collected using the Royal College of
Physicians' Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), question 2.1.6.
Outcome
Rates of prescribing aspirin.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary and secondary care services) monitor prescribing of
pharmacological treatment(s) for adults with atrial fibrillation and have protocols in place
to ensure that aspirin is not prescribed as monotherapy for stroke prevention.
Healthcare professionals do not prescribe aspirin as monotherapy for stroke prevention
for adults with atrial fibrillation.
Commissioners specify that primary and secondary care services ensure that aspirin is
not prescribed as monotherapy for stroke prevention for adults with atrial fibrillation.
Adults with atrial fibrillation are not prescribed aspirin on its own for preventing stroke.
Source guidance
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline 196 (2021), recommendation
1.6.14
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Aspirin as monotherapy for stroke prevention
Adults with atrial fibrillation might be taking aspirin for a variety of other conditions; if so,

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
this may result in the person taking aspirin (for the other conditions) as well as
anticoagulants. If a person chooses not to take anticoagulants, this decision and the
reason(s) for it should be documented. [NICE's 2014 full guideline on atrial fibrillation]

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 3: Discussing options
for anticoagulation
Quality statement
Adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation discuss the options with
their healthcare professional at least once a year.
Rationale
Adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation should have the opportunity to discuss the choice
of suitable anticoagulants with their healthcare professional, in order to improve
adherence to treatment. Available options should include direct-acting oral anticoagulants
and vitamin K antagonists. In adults with valvular atrial fibrillation, only vitamin K
antagonists can be used, and this should be explained to the person. Adherence to
anticoagulation can help to prevent stroke by reducing the likelihood of a blood clot
forming.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults with atrial fibrillation who are
prescribed anticoagulation can discuss the options with their healthcare professional at
least once a year.
Process

Numerator – the number in the denominator who discuss the options with their healthcare
professional at least once a year.
Denominator – the number of adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed
anticoagulation.
Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
a) Patient experience.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Rates of adherence to anticoagulation therapy for adults with atrial fibrillation.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary and secondary care services) have protocols in place to ensure
that adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation can discuss the
options with their healthcare professional at least once a year.
Healthcare professionals discuss the options at least once a year with adults with atrial
fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation. There should not be mandatory use of
vitamin K antagonists before offering non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for
people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.
Commissioners specify that primary and secondary care service providers have protocols
in place to ensure that adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation can
discuss the options with their healthcare professional at least once a year.
Adults with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed an anticoagulant have the chance to talk
with their doctor at least once a year about the types of anticoagulant they could have and
the advantages and disadvantages of each.

1.4.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.3 to 1.6.5
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Anticoagulants
Anticoagulants for people with atrial fibrillation include direct-acting oral anticoagulants
(such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) and vitamin K antagonists.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendations 1.6.3 to 1.6.5]
Discuss
Any discussion with an adult with atrial fibrillation should involve both oral and written
information. A patient decision aid can be used to inform the discussion. A discussion
should take place at least once a year to review the need and quality of anticoagulation.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendation 1.6.17, NICE's
guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, recommendation 1.5.12, and expert
consensus]
Equality and diversity considerations
Discussions with adults with atrial fibrillation about choice of anticoagulants should take
into account any additional needs, such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and
people who do not speak or read English. People should have access to an interpreter or
advocate if needed.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 4: Anticoagulation
control
Quality statement
Adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist who have poor anticoagulation
control have their anticoagulation reassessed.
Rationale
Improving poor anticoagulation control by reassessing the international normalised ratio
(INR) at each visit can ensure that a person's risks of stroke and of having a major bleed
are as low as possible.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols to ensure that adults with
atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist have their anticoagulation reassessed if their
anticoagulation control is poor.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
a) Proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist who have their
time in therapeutic range (TTR) recorded at each visit for INR assessment.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their TTR recorded at each visit for

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
INR assessment.
Denominator – the number of adults with atrial fibrillation taking a vitamin K antagonist.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Proportion of adults with poor anticoagulation control who have it reassessed.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who have their anticoagulation reassessed.
Denominator – the number of adults with poor anticoagulation control.
Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
a) Rates of thromboembolic complications.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Patient experience.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary care services) have systems in place with written clinical
protocols for reassessing anticoagulation in adults with atrial fibrillation who are taking a
vitamin K antagonist and have poor anticoagulation control.
Healthcare professionals reassess anticoagulation and record the results for adults with
atrial fibrillation who are taking a vitamin K antagonist and have poor anticoagulation
control.
Commissioners commission secondary care services that have written clinical protocols
for reassessing anticoagulation in adults with atrial fibrillation who are taking a vitamin K

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
antagonist and have poor anticoagulation control.
Adults with atrial fibrillation who are taking a type of anticoagulant called a vitamin K
antagonist (such as warfarin) have their anticoagulation treatment reassessed if regular
tests show that it isn't working well.
Source guidance
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline 196 (2021), recommendations
1.6.10 to 1.6.13 and 1.6.17
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Poor anticoagulation control
Poor anticoagulation control can be shown by any of the following:
• 2 INR values higher than 5 or 1 INR value higher than 8 within the past 6 months
• 2 INR values less than 1.5 within the past 6 months
• TTR less than 65%.
The NICE guideline on atrial fibrillation recommends that TTR is measured at each visit and
at least annually, and that healthcare professionals should:
• use a validated method of measurement such as the Rosendaal method for
computer-assisted dosing or proportion of tests in range for manual dosing
• exclude measurements taken during the first 6 weeks of treatment
• calculate TTR over a maintenance period of at least 6 months.
[NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendations 1.6.10, 1.6.11 and 1.6.17]
Reassessing anticoagulation
The NICE guideline on atrial fibrillation recommends that the following factors should be
taken into account and addressed if they are contributing to poor anticoagulation control:

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
• cognitive function
• adherence to prescribed therapy
• illness
• interacting drug therapy
• lifestyle factors including diet and alcohol consumption.
If poor anticoagulation control cannot be improved as a result of this reassessment, the
risks and benefits of alternative stroke prevention strategies should be evaluated and
discussed with the person. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation,
recommendations 1.6.12 and 1.6.13]

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 5: Referral for
specialised management
Quality statement
Adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms are referred
for specialised management within 4 weeks.
Rationale
Prompt referral of adults with atrial fibrillation to specialised management if treatment fails
can help to alleviate symptoms and reduce the likelihood of poor outcomes such as stroke
and heart failure.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements and referral pathways to ensure that adults with atrial
fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms are referred for specialised
management within 4 weeks.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
Proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms
who are referred for specialised management within 4 weeks.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who are referred for specialised management

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
within 4 weeks.
Denominator – the number of adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control
their symptoms.
Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
a) Adults with atrial fibrillation symptom control.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Rates of stroke and heart failure for adults with atrial fibrillation.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (primary and secondary care services) have procedures in place to
ensure that adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms
are referred for specialised management within 4 weeks.
Healthcare professionals refer adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control
their symptoms, to specialised management within 4 weeks.
Commissioners ensure that primary and secondary care providers have procedures in
place so that adults with atrial fibrillation whose treatment fails to control their symptoms
are referred for specialised management within 4 weeks.
Adults with atrial fibrillation who still have symptoms after treatment are referred within
4 weeks for specialised care that aims to ease their symptoms and reduce their risk of
having a stroke or heart failure.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Source guidance
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline 196 (2021), recommendation
1.5.1
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Fails to control symptoms
Adults whose treatment fails to control the symptoms of atrial fibrillation at any stage.
[Adapted from NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendation 1.5.1]
Referred within 4 weeks
Referral should be no longer than 4 weeks after the final failed treatment or no longer than
4 weeks after recurrence of atrial fibrillation after cardioversion. [Adapted from NICE's
guideline on atrial fibrillation, recommendation 1.5.1]
Specialised management
Specialised management can be provided by an 'atrial fibrillation specialist' such as a
cardiologist or nurse with an interest in arrhythmia. Specialised management should be
provided through a package of care that covers key elements of service provision, tailored
to the person with atrial fibrillation. Formally documenting key elements of the service can
help to ensure that it has been delivered. [NICE's 2014 full guideline on atrial fibrillation]

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Quality statement 6 (developmental):
Self-monitoring of anticoagulation
Developmental quality statements set out an emergent area of cutting-edge service
delivery or technology currently found in a minority of providers and indicating outstanding
performance. They will need specific, significant changes to be put in place, such as
redesign of services or new equipment.
Developmental quality statement
Adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy are supported to
self-manage with a coagulometer.
Rationale
Enabling adults with atrial fibrillation to self-manage their coagulation using a
coagulometer can help to optimise their anticoagulation treatment. As well as reducing the
frequency of hospital or clinic visits, it can improve health outcomes such as risk of stroke
and bleeding.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements for adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K
antagonist therapy to be supported to self-manage with a coagulometer.
Data source: Local data collection.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Process
Proportion of adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who
are supported to self-manage with a coagulometer.
Numerator – the number in the denominator who are supported to self-manage with a
coagulometer.
Denominator – the number of adults with atrial fibrillation on long-term vitamin K
antagonist therapy.
Data source: Local data collection.
Outcome
a) Patient experience.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Rates of adults on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who self-manage.
Data source: Local data collection.
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (secondary care services) make coagulometers for self-monitoring
available to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy,
and ensure that support is available for their use.
Healthcare professionals offer coagulometers to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on
long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy so that they can self-monitor their coagulation
status, provided that they are willing and able to do so. Healthcare professionals also
provide support for people using the coagulometers.
Commissioners ensure that secondary care providers have coagulometers for
self-monitoring available and offer them to adults with atrial fibrillation who are on

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy, and provide support for their use.
Adults with atrial fibrillation who are taking a vitamin K antagonist over a long time are (if
appropriate) offered a monitor they can use to help check how well the treatment is
working, if they want to use the monitor and can do so. They are also given support by
healthcare professionals to use the monitor.
Source guidance
Atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease: self-monitoring coagulation status using point-of-
care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS system). NICE HealthTech guidance 353 (2025),
recommendation 1.1
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Coagulometer
Coagulometers monitor blood clotting in adults taking anticoagulants.
The CoaguChek XS system is recommended for self-monitoring coagulation status in
adults on long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy who have atrial fibrillation if:
• the person prefers this form of testing and
• the person or their carer is both physically and cognitively able to self-monitor
effectively.
[Adapted from NICE's HealthTech guidance on atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease:
self-monitoring coagulation status using point-of-care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS
system), recommendation 1.1]
Support
Patients and carers should be trained in the effective use of the CoaguChek XS system
and clinicians involved in their care should regularly review their ability to self-monitor.
Equipment for self-monitoring should be regularly checked using reliable quality-control
procedures, and by testing patients' equipment against a healthcare professional's

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
coagulometer which is checked in line with an external quality assurance scheme. Ensure
accurate patient records are kept and shared appropriately. [NICE's HealthTech guidance
on atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease: self-monitoring coagulation status using point-
of-care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS system), recommendations 1.3 and 1.4]
Equality and diversity considerations
For adults with atrial fibrillation who may have difficulty with or who are unable to
self-monitor, such as people with disabilities, the possibility of their carers helping with
self-monitoring should be considered. Coagulometers currently come at a cost to the adult
with atrial fibrillation, so reasonable adjustments should be made for the socioeconomic
status of the adult.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Update information
February 2018: The source guidance and definitions for statement 6 have been updated to
ensure alignment with the updated NICE diagnostics guidance on self-monitoring
coagulation status using point-of-care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS system). In
statement 3, the rationale and definition sections have been changed to include edoxaban
as an option for anticoagulation to reflect NICE technology appraisal guidance on
edoxaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial
fibrillation.
Minor changes since publication
December 2025: Links have been updated throughout to NICE's HealthTech guidance
353, which replaces NICE's diagnostics guidance on self-monitoring coagulation status
using point-of-care coagulometers.
June 2021: Further information was added to bleeding risk score in the definitions section
of statement 1.
April 2021: Source guideline recommendation numbers were updated throughout and
definitions for statements 1 and 2 were amended in line with the updated NICE guideline
on atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details of our standing
committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is
available from the webpage for this quality standard.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.
Resource impact
NICE quality standards should be achievable by local services. The potential resource
impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource
impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource
impact products for the NICE guideline on atrial fibrillation to help estimate local costs.

Atrial fibrillation (QS93)
Diversity, equality and language
During the development of this quality standard, equality issues were considered and
equality assessments for this quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified
during development of the quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
