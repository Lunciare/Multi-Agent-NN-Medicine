Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline replaces CG180.
This guideline is the basis of QS93.
This guideline should be read in conjunction with TA275, TA249, TA355, TA256 and
TA197.
Overview
This guideline covers diagnosing and managing atrial fibrillation in adults. It includes
guidance on providing the best care and treatment for people with atrial fibrillation,
including assessing and managing risks of stroke and bleeding.
See the MHRA advice on warfarin and other anticoagulants – monitoring of patients during
the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes reports of supratherapeutic anticoagulation with
warfarin.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Commissioners and providers
• People with atrial fibrillation, their families and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Detection and diagnosis
1.1.1 Perform manual pulse palpation to assess for the presence of an irregular pulse if
there is a suspicion of atrial fibrillation. This includes people presenting with any
of the following:
• breathlessness
• palpitations
• syncope or dizziness
• chest discomfort
• stroke or transient ischaemic attack. [2006]
1.1.2 Perform a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to make a diagnosis of atrial
fibrillation if an irregular pulse is detected in people with suspected atrial
fibrillation with or without symptoms. [2021]
1.1.3 In people with suspected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undetected by 12-lead ECG
recording:
• use a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor if asymptomatic episodes are
suspected or symptomatic episodes are less than 24 hours apart
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 6 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 7 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
• use an ambulatory ECG monitor, event recorder or other ECG technology for
a period appropriate to detect atrial fibrillation if symptomatic episodes are
more than 24 hours apart. [2021]
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2021 recommendations and
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on detection and
diagnosis.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A:
effectiveness of tests for detection and evidence review B: accuracy of tests for
detection.
1.2 Assessment of stroke and bleeding risks
Stroke risk
1.2.1 Use the CHA DS -VASc stroke risk score to assess stroke risk in people with any
2 2
of the following:
• symptomatic or asymptomatic paroxysmal, persistent or permanent atrial
fibrillation
• atrial flutter
• a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus
rhythm or catheter ablation. [2021]
See the section on review of people with atrial fibrillation for advice on
reassessment of stroke risk.
For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it
might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on stroke risk.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C
and D: tools to predict stroke in people with atrial fibrillation.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 8 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Bleeding risk
1.2.2 Assess the risk of bleeding when:
• considering starting anticoagulation in people with atrial fibrillation and
• reviewing people already taking anticoagulation.
Use the ORBIT bleeding risk score because evidence shows that it has a
higher accuracy in predicting absolute bleeding risk than other bleeding risk
tools. Accurate knowledge of bleeding risk supports shared decision making
and has practical benefits, for example, increasing patient confidence and
willingness to accept treatment when risk is low and prompting discussion of
risk reduction when risk is high. Although ORBIT is the best tool for this
purpose, other bleeding risk tools may need to be used until it is embedded
in clinical pathways and electronic systems. [2021]
1.2.3 Offer monitoring and support to modify risk factors for bleeding, including:
• uncontrolled hypertension (see NICE's guideline on hypertension in adults)
• poor control of international normalised ratio (INR) in patients on vitamin K
antagonists
• concurrent medication, including antiplatelets, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
• harmful alcohol consumption (see NICE's guideline on alcohol-use disorders:
diagnosis, assessment and management of harmful drinking and alcohol
dependence)
• reversible causes of anaemia. [2021]
Discussing the results of the risk assessment
1.2.4 Discuss the results of the assessments of stroke and bleeding risk with the
person taking into account their specific characteristics, for example
comorbidities, and their individual preferences. For further guidance, see the
section on enabling patients to actively participate in their care in NICE's

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services. [2021]
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on bleeding risk.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E
and F: risk stratification tools for predicting bleeding in people with atrial fibrillation.
1.3 Assessment of cardiac function
1.3.1 Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in people with atrial fibrillation:
• for whom a baseline echocardiogram is important for long-term management
• for whom a rhythm-control strategy that includes cardioversion (electrical or
pharmacological) is being considered
• in whom there is a high risk or a suspicion of underlying structural or
functional heart disease (such as heart failure or heart murmur) that
influences their subsequent management (for example, choice of
antiarrhythmic drug)
• in whom refinement of clinical risk stratification for antithrombotic therapy is
needed (see section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and
section 1.6 on stroke prevention). [2006, amended 2014]
1.3.2 Do not routinely perform TTE solely for the purpose of further stroke risk
stratification in people with atrial fibrillation for whom the need to start
anticoagulation therapy has already been agreed on appropriate clinical criteria
(see section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and section 1.6 on
stroke prevention). [2006, amended 2014]
1.3.3 Perform transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in people with atrial
fibrillation:
• when TTE demonstrates an abnormality (such as valvular heart disease) that
warrants further specific assessment
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 9 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 10 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
• in whom TTE is technically difficult and/or of questionable quality and when
there is a need to exclude cardiac abnormalities
• for whom TOE-guided cardioversion is being considered. [2006]
1.4 Personalised package of care and information
1.4.1 Offer people with atrial fibrillation a personalised package of care. Ensure that the
package of care is documented and delivered, and that it covers:
• stroke awareness and measures to prevent stroke
• rate control
• assessment of symptoms for rhythm control
• who to contact for advice if needed
• psychological support if needed
• up-to-date and comprehensive education and information on:
－ cause, effects and possible complications of atrial fibrillation
－ management of rate and rhythm control
－ anticoagulation
－ practical advice on anticoagulation in line with the recommendations on
information and support for people having anticoagulation treatment in
NICE's guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases
－ support networks (for example, cardiovascular charities). [2014]
1.4.2 Follow the recommendations in NICE's guideline on shared decision making.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Medicines adherences and optimisation
1.4.3 To support adherence and ensure safe and effective medicines use in people
with atrial fibrillation, follow the recommendations in NICE's guidelines on
medicines adherence and medicines optimisation. [2021]
1.5 Referral for specialised management
1.5.1 Refer people promptly at any stage if treatment fails to control the symptoms of
atrial fibrillation and more specialised management is needed. This should be
within 4 weeks after the failed treatment or after recurrence of atrial fibrillation
after cardioversion. [2014]
1.6 Stroke prevention
Anticoagulation
1.6.1 When discussing the benefits and risks of anticoagulation use clinical risk profiles
and personal preferences to guide treatment choices. Discuss with the person
that:
• for most people the benefit of anticoagulation outweighs the bleeding risk
• for people with an increased risk of bleeding, the benefit of anticoagulation
may not always outweigh the bleeding risk, and careful monitoring of
bleeding risk is important. [2021]
1.6.2 When deciding between anticoagulation treatment options:
• Discuss the risks and benefits of different drugs with the person and follow
the recommendations in NICE's guideline on shared decision making.
• Follow the recommendations on patient involvement in decisions about
medicines in NICE's guideline on medicines adherence and patient decision
aids in NICE's guideline on medicines optimisation.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
• Take into account any contraindications for each drug and follow the
guidance in the British National Formulary and the MHRA advice on direct-
acting oral anticoagulants, in particular for advice on dosages in people with
renal impairment, reversal agents and monitoring. [2021]
1.6.3 Offer anticoagulation with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant to people with atrial
fibrillation and a CHA DS -VASc score of 2 or above, taking into account the risk
2 2
of bleeding. Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are recommended
as options, when used in line with the criteria specified in the relevant NICE
technology appraisal guidance (see the section on direct-acting oral
anticoagulant treatment options). [2021]
1.6.4 Consider anticoagulation with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant for men with
atrial fibrillation and a CHA DS -VASc score of 1, taking into account the risk of
2 2
bleeding. Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban are recommended as
options, when used in line with the criteria specified in the relevant NICE
technology appraisal guidance (see the section on direct-acting oral
anticoagulant treatment options). [2021]
1.6.5 If direct-acting oral anticoagulants are contraindicated, not tolerated or not
suitable in people with atrial fibrillation, offer a vitamin K antagonist. See the
section on self-monitoring and self-management of vitamin K antagonists. [2021]
1.6.6 For adults with atrial fibrillation who are already taking a vitamin K antagonist and
are stable, continue with their current medication and discuss the option of
switching treatment at their next routine appointment, taking into account the
person's time in therapeutic range. [2021]
1.6.7 Do not offer stroke prevention therapy with anticoagulation to people aged under
65 years with atrial fibrillation and no risk factors other than their sex (that is,
very low risk of stroke equating to a CHA DS -VASc score of 0 for men or 1 for
2 2
women). [2021]
1.6.8 Do not withhold anticoagulation solely because of a person's age or their risk of
falls. [2021]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Direct-acting oral anticoagulant treatment options
1.6.9 For direct-acting oral anticoagulants recommended as options in NICE
technology appraisal guidance for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in
some people with atrial fibrillation, see the guidance on:
• edoxaban (TA355, 2021)
• apixaban (TA275, 2021)
• rivaroxaban (TA256, 2021)
• dabigatran etexilate (TA249, 2021).
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on stroke prevention.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G1:
anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in people with atrial fibrillation and
evidence review G2: anticoagulant therapy health economics analysis.
Assessing anticoagulation control with vitamin K antagonists
1.6.10 Calculate the person's time in therapeutic range (TTR) at each visit. When
calculating TTR:
• use a validated method of measurement such as the Rosendaal method for
computer-assisted dosing or proportion of tests in range for manual dosing
• exclude measurements taken during the first 6 weeks of treatment
• calculate TTR over a maintenance period of at least 6 months. [2014]
1.6.11 Reassess anticoagulation for a person whose anticoagulation is poorly controlled
shown by any of the following:
• 2 INR values higher than 5 or 1 INR value higher than 8 within the past
6 months
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 13 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 14 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
• 2 INR values less than 1.5 within the past 6 months
• TTR less than 65%. [2014]
1.6.12 When reassessing anticoagulation, take into account and if possible address the
following factors that may contribute to poor anticoagulation control:
• cognitive function
• adherence to prescribed therapy
• illness
• interacting drug therapy
• lifestyle factors including diet and alcohol consumption. [2014]
1.6.13 If poor anticoagulation control cannot be improved, evaluate the risks and
benefits of alternative stroke prevention strategies and discuss these with the
person. [2014]
Self-monitoring and self-management of vitamin K antagonists
NICE has developed diagnostics guidance on atrial fibrillation and heart valve disease:
self-monitoring coagulation status using point-of-care coagulometers (the CoaguChek XS
system).
Antiplatelets
For guidance on antiplatelet therapy for people who have had a myocardial infarction and
are having anticoagulation, see antiplatelet therapy for people with an ongoing separate
indication for anticoagulation in NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes.
1.6.14 Do not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to people with atrial
fibrillation. [2014]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 15 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Review of people with atrial fibrillation
1.6.15 For people who are not taking an anticoagulant, review stroke risk when they
reach age 65 or if they develop any of the following at any age:
• diabetes
• heart failure
• peripheral arterial disease
• coronary heart disease
• stroke, transient ischaemic attack or systemic thromboembolism. [2014]
1.6.16 For people who are not taking an anticoagulant because of bleeding risk or other
factors, review stroke and bleeding risks annually, and ensure that all reviews and
decisions are documented. [2014]
1.6.17 For people who are taking an anticoagulant, review the need for anticoagulation
and the quality of anticoagulation (taking into account MHRA advice on direct-
acting oral anticoagulants about bleeding risk and the need to monitor renal
function in patients with renal impairment) at least annually, or more frequently if
clinically relevant events occur affecting anticoagulation or bleeding risk. [2014]
Left atrial appendage occlusion
1.6.18 Consider left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) if anticoagulation is
contraindicated or not tolerated and discuss the benefits and risks of LAAO with
the person. For more information see NICE's interventional procedure guidance
on percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage in non-valvular atrial
fibrillation for the prevention of thromboembolism. [2014]
1.6.19 Do not offer LAAO as an alternative to anticoagulation unless anticoagulation is
contraindicated or not tolerated. [2014]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
1.7 Rate and rhythm control
This section covers rate and rhythm control in non-acute settings. See section 1.8 for rate
and rhythm control for people presenting acutely (either new onset or destabilisation of
existing atrial fibrillation).
Rate control
1.7.1 Offer rate control as the first-line treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation except in
people:
• whose atrial fibrillation has a reversible cause
• who have heart failure thought to be primarily caused by atrial fibrillation
• with new-onset atrial fibrillation
• with atrial flutter whose condition is considered suitable for an ablation
strategy to restore sinus rhythm
• for whom a rhythm-control strategy would be more suitable based on clinical
judgement. [2014]
1.7.2 Offer either a standard beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol) or
a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) as initial
rate-control monotherapy to people with atrial fibrillation unless the person has
the features described in recommendation 1.7.4. Base the choice of drug on the
person's symptoms, heart rate, comorbidities and preferences. [2021]
In April 2021, this was an off-label use of diltiazem. See NICE's information on
prescribing medicines.
1.7.3 For people with atrial fibrillation and concomitant heart failure, follow the
recommendations on the use of beta-blockers and avoiding calcium-channel
blockers in NICE's guideline on chronic heart failure. [2021]
1.7.4 Consider digoxin monotherapy for initial rate control for people with
non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if:
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 16 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 17 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
• the person does no or very little physical exercise or
• other rate-limiting drug options are ruled out because of comorbidities or the
person's preferences. [2021]
1.7.5 If monotherapy does not control the person's symptoms, and if continuing
symptoms are thought to be caused by poor ventricular rate control, consider
combination therapy with any 2 of the following:
• a beta-blocker
• diltiazem
• digoxin. [2021]
In April 2021, this was an off-label use of diltiazem. See NICE's information on
prescribing medicines.
1.7.6 Do not offer amiodarone for long-term rate control. [2021]
For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2021 recommendations and
how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on rate control.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review I:
non-ablative rate control therapies.
Rhythm control
1.7.7 Consider pharmacological and/or electrical rhythm control for people with atrial
fibrillation whose symptoms continue after heart rate has been controlled or for
whom a rate-control strategy has not been successful. [2014]
Antiarrhythmic drug therapy
1.7.8 Assess the need for drug treatment for long-term rhythm control, taking into
account the person's preferences, associated comorbidities, risks of treatment

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 18 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
and likelihood of recurrence of atrial fibrillation. [2014]
1.7.9 Do not offer class 1c antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide or propafenone to
people with known ischaemic or structural heart disease. [2014]
1.7.10 If drug treatment for long-term rhythm control is needed, consider a standard
beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol) as first-line treatment
unless there are contraindications. [2014]
1.7.11 If beta-blockers are contraindicated or unsuccessful, assess the suitability of
alternative drugs for rhythm control, taking comorbidities into account. [2014]
1.7.12 Dronedarone is recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance as a
second-line treatment option for long-term rhythm control in some people after
successful cardioversion. For full details, see the guidance on dronedarone
(TA197, 2012). [2014]
1.7.13 Consider amiodarone for people with left ventricular impairment or heart failure.
[2014]
1.7.14 In people with infrequent paroxysms and few symptoms, or if symptoms are
induced by known precipitants (such as alcohol, caffeine), a 'no drug treatment'
strategy or a 'pill-in-the-pocket' strategy (in which antiarrhythmic drugs are taken
only when an episode starts) should be considered and discussed with the
person. [2006]
1.7.15 In people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 'pill-in-the-pocket' strategy should
be considered for those who:
• have no history of left ventricular dysfunction, or valvular or ischaemic heart
disease and
• have a history of infrequent symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and
• have a systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg and a resting heart
rate above 70 bpm and
• are able to understand how to, and when to, take the medication. [2006]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Cardioversion
1.7.16 For people having cardioversion for atrial fibrillation that has persisted for longer
than 48 hours, offer electrical (rather than pharmacological) cardioversion.
[2014]
1.7.17 Consider amiodarone therapy starting 4 weeks before and continuing for up to
12 months after electrical cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm, and discuss the
benefits and risks of amiodarone with the person. [2014]
1.7.18 For people with atrial fibrillation of greater than 48 hours' duration, in whom
elective cardioversion is indicated:
• both transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)-guided cardioversion and
conventional cardioversion should be considered equally effective
• a TOE-guided cardioversion strategy should be considered:
－ if experienced staff and appropriate facilities are available and
－ if a minimal period of precardioversion anticoagulation is indicated due to
the person's choice or bleeding risks. [2006]
Left atrial ablation
1.7.19 If drug treatment is unsuccessful, unsuitable or not tolerated in people with
symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation:
• consider radiofrequency point-by-point ablation or
• if radiofrequency point-by-point ablation is assessed as being unsuitable,
consider cryoballoon ablation or laser balloon ablation. [2021]
1.7.20 When considering left atrial ablation, discuss the risks and benefits and take into
account the person's preferences. In particular, explain that the procedure is not
always effective and that the resolution of symptoms may not be long-lasting.

atrial fibrillation with symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction thought to be
caused by high ventricular rates. [2014]
1.7.25 When considering pacing and atrioventricular node ablation, reassess symptoms
and the consequent need for ablation after pacing has been carried out and drug
treatment further optimised. [2014]
1.7.26 Consider left atrial catheter ablation before pacing and atrioventricular node
ablation for people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or heart failure caused by
non-permanent (paroxysmal or persistent) atrial fibrillation. [2014]
1.8 Management for people presenting acutely with
atrial fibrillation
Rate and rhythm control for people presenting acutely
1.8.1 Carry out emergency electrical cardioversion, without delaying to achieve
anticoagulation, in people with life-threatening haemodynamic instability caused
by new-onset atrial fibrillation. [2014]
1.8.2 In people with atrial fibrillation presenting acutely without life-threatening
haemodynamic instability:
• offer either rate or rhythm control if the onset of the arrhythmia is less than
48 hours
• offer rate control if onset is more than 48 hours or is uncertain. [2014]
1.8.3 In people with atrial fibrillation presenting acutely with suspected concomitant
acute decompensated heart failure, seek senior specialist input on the use of
beta-blockers and do not use calcium-channel blockers. [2021]
1.8.4 Consider either pharmacological or electrical cardioversion depending on clinical
circumstances and resources in people with new-onset atrial fibrillation who will
be treated with a rhythm-control strategy. [2014]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
1.8.5 If pharmacological cardioversion has been agreed on clinical and resource
grounds for new-onset atrial fibrillation, offer:
• a choice of flecainide or amiodarone to people with no evidence of structural
or ischaemic heart disease or
• amiodarone to people with evidence of structural heart disease. [2014]
1.8.6 In people with atrial fibrillation in whom the duration of the arrhythmia is greater
than 48 hours or uncertain and considered for long-term rhythm control, delay
cardioversion until they have been maintained on therapeutic anticoagulation for
a minimum of 3 weeks. During this period offer rate control as appropriate.
[2006, amended 2014]
1.8.7 Do not offer magnesium or a calcium-channel blocker for pharmacological
cardioversion. [2014]

Anticoagulation for people presenting acutely with atrial
fibrillation
1.8.8 In people with new-onset atrial fibrillation who are receiving no, or
subtherapeutic, anticoagulation therapy:
• in the absence of contraindications, offer heparin at initial presentation
• continue heparin until a full assessment has been made and appropriate
antithrombotic therapy has been started, based on risk stratification (see
section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and section 1.6 on
stroke prevention). [2006, amended 2014]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
1.8.9 In people with a confirmed diagnosis of atrial fibrillation of recent onset (less than
48 hours since onset), offer oral anticoagulation if:
• stable sinus rhythm is not successfully restored within the same 48-hour
period after onset of atrial fibrillation or
• there are factors indicating a high risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence,
including history of failed cardioversion, structural heart disease, prolonged
atrial fibrillation (more than 12 months), or previous recurrences or
• it is recommended in section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks
and section 1.6 on stroke prevention. [2006, amended 2014]
1.8.10 In people with new-onset atrial fibrillation, if there is uncertainty over the precise
time since onset, offer oral anticoagulation as for persistent atrial fibrillation (see
section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and section 1.6 stroke
prevention). [2006, amended 2014]
1.9 Initial management of stroke and atrial
fibrillation
1.9.1 For guidance on the initial management of stroke and atrial fibrillation see
recommendation 1.4.17 in NICE's guideline on stroke and transient ischaemic
attack in over 16s. [2014]

－ a standard beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol)
－ a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil)
• do not offer digoxin. [2006, amended 2014]
In April 2021, this was an off-label use of diltiazem. See NICE's information on
prescribing medicines.
1.10.2 In people having cardiothoracic surgery who are already on beta-blocker therapy,
continue this treatment unless contraindications develop (such as postoperative
bradycardia or hypotension). [2006, amended 2014]
1.10.3 Do not start statins in people having cardiothoracic surgery solely to prevent
postoperative atrial fibrillation. [2021]
1.10.4 In people having cardiothoracic surgery who are already on statins, continue this
treatment. For further advice on statins for the prevention of cardiovascular
disease, see NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and
reduction. [2021]

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect practice.
Detection and diagnosis
Recommendations 1.1.2 and 1.1.3
Why the committee made the recommendations
The evidence did not support changing the recommended diagnostic tests to either
replace 12-lead ECG as the test to confirm persistent atrial fibrillation or replace pulse
palpation as the initial step for persistent atrial fibrillation in a 2-step strategy. The
committee clarified that 12-lead ECG should be used as the test to confirm atrial
fibrillation, to prevent the use of less accurate ECG devices, such as mobile and lead-I ECG
devices. The committee agreed that, although the evidence showed that accuracy varied,
there was some evidence that new devices were accurate and showed promise. It was
noted that NICE has produced diagnostics guidance on lead-I ECG devices for detecting
symptomatic atrial fibrillation using single time point testing in primary care. The
committee made a research recommendation on tests to diagnose persistent atrial
fibrillation to encourage further high-quality research in this area to guide future practice.
The committee agreed that the evidence on tests to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
was not clear enough to warrant a change in practice from the 2014 recommendation.
However, the evidence did show that longer durations of detection increased accuracy.
The committee made a research recommendation on tests to diagnose paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations reflect current good practice and are unlikely to have an impact on
practice.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Stroke risk
Recommendation 1.2.1
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee decided to prioritise identifying people above or below a certain risk
threshold (discrimination) in its interpretation of the evidence rather than estimating a
person's risk of stroke in absolute terms.
The evidence suggested that a score of 2 or more is the ideal threshold for the
CHA DS -VASC in terms of indicating the need for anticoagulation. (Men with a
2 2
CHA DS -VASc score of 1 were regarded as being at intermediate risk, and a group in
2 2
whom anticoagulation should also be considered.) The evidence showed that this
threshold of 2 or more offered a good combination of high sensitivity (0.92) and adequate
specificity (0.23).
The high sensitivity means that the tool would correctly identify almost everyone who
would later have a stroke if they did not receive anticoagulants. Importantly, this will allow
them to be prescribed anticoagulants to reduce their risk of stroke.
The adequate specificity means that 23% of the people who would not later have a stroke
(even when not taking anticoagulants) would be correctly identified as not needing
anticoagulation. This would prevent these people from having adverse events from
anticoagulants. It also means that 77% of people who would not later have a stroke
(without anticoagulation) would be wrongly identified as needing anticoagulation.
However, this was thought to be acceptable given the perceived lesser harms from
unnecessarily giving anticoagulants compared with not giving anticoagulants to people
who need them, together with the inevitable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
The ATRIA stroke risk score was shown to have better overall accuracy, but although it had
better specificity than CHA DS -VASc (fewer false-positive results) it had lower sensitivity,
2 2
meaning that more people at risk would be missed (more false-negative results) compared
with the CHA DS -VASc score. As already suggested, sensitivity was agreed by the
2 2
committee to be more important than specificity because the risks of unnecessary
anticoagulation are outweighed by the risks of not treating people who need
anticoagulation. In addition, the ATRIA risk score may result in a time delay in calculating
the results.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
The committee also discussed that the evidence for the QStroke risk calculator suggested
that it might be a useful tool. However, the evidence was limited, and they agreed that
further research was needed.
How the recommendation might affect practice
The recommendation does not constitute a change in practice, and so there would not be
a resource impact on the NHS.
Return to recommendations
Bleeding risk
Recommendations 1.2.2 to 1.2.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed that anticoagulation should usually be considered in people at risk
of stroke even if bleeding risk is high, and so a bleeding risk tool should not be used to
provide a cut off for determining who should have anticoagulation. Instead, the tool should
be used to provide accurate knowledge of absolute bleeding risk, which can support
discussions between the person and their healthcare professional about bleeding risk
modification and appropriate levels of vigilance. They therefore agreed that accurately
estimating absolute risk (calibration) is more important than identifying a risk threshold for
anticoagulation (discrimination) when choosing between different bleeding risk tools.
The committee focused on calibration data for the tools with the most evidence: ORBIT,
HAS-BLED and ATRIA. The calibration evidence clearly suggested that ORBIT was more
accurate than HAS-BLED and ATRIA at predicting absolute risk of major bleeding, both for
people using vitamin K antagonists and those using direct-acting oral anticoagulants.
Importantly, ORBIT was better calibrated at all levels of major bleeding risk, including
higher levels. ORBIT was also better at predicting absolute risk of intracranial
haemorrhage.
The discrimination data showed little difference between tools in predicting major
bleeding, with some outcome measures showing no difference and others showing a slight
benefit for either ORBIT or HAS-BLED. Evidence showed that ORBIT had a significantly

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 33 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
higher specificity and a slighter lower sensitivity than the other tools, but the committee
agreed that the lower sensitivity would not be a drawback when used to inform
discussions of risk.
The committee agreed that the evidence overall, and particularly the calibration data
demonstrating higher accuracy of absolute risk, strongly supported ORBIT as the tool of
choice.
The committee agreed that NICE's previous advice on monitoring and addressing
modifiable risk factors was still relevant and added reversible causes of anaemia because
it is a component of the ORBIT tool.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Use of the ORBIT score is a change in practice, which will take time to implement. The
committee considered that the more accurate prediction of the absolute risk of bleeding is
a real advantage in supporting patients and clinicians in shared decision making, which
should lead to better clinical outcomes. The committee considered carefully a number of
practical issues set out in this section. Overall, the committee concluded that this change
is one that is worth making.
One potential concern discussed by the committee is that ORBIT does not include all of
the modifiable risk factors included in HAS-BLED so does not serve as a reminder of these
to clinicians. However, the committee considered that fully investigating modifiable risk
factors is established clinical practice, regardless of the tool used.
Another potential challenge is that ORBIT is not the recommended bleeding risk tool for
other conditions (such as venous thromboembolism). Therefore, an initial transition period
may be needed for training and education in both primary and secondary care while
healthcare professionals become familiar with the tool. This will have a resource impact,
although it will be time limited. The committee also noted that use of the ORBIT tool, and
access to online versions, is straightforward.
Finally, the committee also discussed that, unlike HAS-BLED, ORBIT is not embedded in GP
systems, which may cause some initial practical difficulties. However, because this will
involve changes to centralised software, it is thought that it will be straightforward to
implement and ORBIT will quickly be included in GP systems. Neither tool is included in
hospital systems although both are widely available on smartphone apps.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Return to recommendations
Stroke prevention
Recommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.8
Why the committee made the recommendations
Evidence from an analysis of several studies showed that direct-acting oral anticoagulants
are more effective than warfarin for a number of outcomes. An economic model also
showed that they offered a better balance of benefits to costs than warfarin. There were
no studies directly comparing the direct-acting anticoagulants head-to-head but indirect
comparisons based on the clinical evidence showed that the different direct-acting oral
anticoagulants offered different benefits depending on the outcome considered. When all
these outcomes were combined in the cost-effectiveness analysis, apixaban was the most
clinically effective and cost-effective anticoagulant based on UK drug tariff prices at the
time. However, the committee had concerns over the lack of head-to-head comparisons,
differences in the study populations and uncertainties in the economic model.
Based on the evidence and their experience, the committee decided not to recommend
one direct-acting oral anticoagulant over the others, but instead to emphasise that
treatment should be tailored to the person's clinical needs and preferences. Each
anticoagulant has different risks and benefits that should be considered and fully
discussed with the person as part of informed shared decision making. The committee
highlighted that the choice might be affected by factors such as renal impairment and
swallowing difficulties, and that healthcare professionals should refer to the BNF for
advice on contraindications and cautions. They also stressed the importance of adherence
and factors that might affect this, such as dosing frequency, when making the decision. If
direct-acting oral anticoagulants are not suitable, for example in people with
antiphospholipid syndrome, the committee agreed that a vitamin K antagonist should be
offered.
For people already established and stable on a vitamin K antagonist, the committee agreed
that the benefits of changing to a direct-acting anticoagulant need to be discussed.
Therefore, the risks and benefits of changing medication, the person's time in therapeutic
range and the person's preferences should be explored at their next routine appointment.
The committee agreed that the existing thresholds for the CHA DS -VASc score threshold

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 35 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
for anticoagulation are in line with current practice.
Although bleeding risk scores may occasionally be used as a reason not to offer
anticoagulation, the committee agreed that they should typically be used as a prompt to
identify and manage modifiable risk factors for bleeding rather than as a reason for not
offering anticoagulation in people at increased risk. The committee discussed that when
anticoagulation is not given because of bleeding risk, people should have regular review
and reconsideration for treatment.
The committee were concerned that anticoagulation is sometimes not recommended for
people at risk of falls and for older people, even though age is factored into the bleeding
risk score and falls are rarely a cause of major haemorrhage. Age was therefore added to
the previous recommendation on people at risk of falls to ensure that anticoagulation is
offered in this population when needed. The benefits and harms should be discussed with
the person.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations are likely to lead to a change in current practice, with a reduction in
warfarin use. The committee noted that this has been a prescribing trend over recent
years and it may lead to a contraction in warfarin clinic services. The unit cost of
direct-acting anticoagulants is greater than that for warfarin, so there is likely to be a
resource impact from increased use of direct-acting anticoagulants.
Return to recommendations
Rate control
Recommendations 1.7.2 to 1.7.6
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee made some updates to the 2014 recommendations, based on their
experience and knowledge.
The use of beta-blockers or rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers for initial rate-control
treatment was retained by the committee because this is current practice and there was
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 35 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 36 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
insufficient evidence to suggest an alternative option. The committee agreed that the
choice of treatment should still be made based on the symptoms, heart rate, comorbidities
and preferences of those being treated.
The committee agreed that the recommendations should refer to NICE's guideline on
chronic heart failure for advice on using beta-blockers and avoiding rate-limiting
calcium-channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil in people who have atrial
fibrillation with heart failure.
The committee agreed that digoxin monotherapy for non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
should continue to be considered for people who are sedentary. Based on their
experience, the committee agreed that it may also be considered as a treatment option
when other rate-limiting drugs are not suitable, so they expanded the recommendation in
the previous guideline to also cover these circumstances. The committee were aware that
some clinicians feel that digoxin monotherapy is often better than alternatives for
improving symptoms; however, the lack of evidence currently available meant that the
recommendation for digoxin was not expanded to cover further groups of people.
In the absence of new evidence, the committee also agreed with the existing
recommendation for combination therapy options if initial monotherapy fails, which is
consistent with the committee's experience and current practice.
There was a lack of evidence on long-term rate control, and the committee were aware of
numerous serious side effects associated with the long-term use of amiodarone (including
thyroid, lung and nerve damage), many of which are irreversible. The committee noted that
although the most common side effects were less severe, the occurrence of severe side
effects was unpredictable and long-term rate control with amiodarone should be avoided.
Amiodarone should only be used as an interim therapy, for example while waiting for
cardioversion, and would not usually be taken for longer than 12 months.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations reflect current practice. Digoxin monotherapy may now be an
option in non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if comorbidities or patient preferences limit other
rate-control drug choices. However, the committee agreed that this already happens in
practice.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Left atrial ablation
Recommendations 1.7.19 to 1.7.20
Why the committee made the recommendations
Ablation may be a treatment option if antiarrhythmic drug treatment has not been
successful or is not tolerated. The committee reviewed new clinical and health economic
evidence for the different types of ablation for people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and
agreed that the catheter ablation techniques were the most clinically effective ablation
options. Thoracoscopy and the hybrid techniques led to lower recurrence, but they also
led to more serious adverse effects. There were no clear differences in efficacy between
the 4 catheter ablation techniques: radiofrequency point-by-point, radiofrequency
multi-electrode, laser and cryoballoon ablation.
A new economic model was developed for the guideline using the clinical evidence from
people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. It showed that radiofrequency point-by-point
ablation was more cost effective over a lifetime than antiarrhythmic drug treatment and
other ablation strategies in people for whom 1 or more antiarrhythmic drug has failed.
Cryoballoon, radiofrequency multi-electrode and laser ablation were the second, third and
fourth most cost-effective options respectively.
The committee acknowledged that the NHS reference cost used for the catheter ablation
procedures may not fully capture differences in resource use between the different
techniques. However, despite further analysis to adjust costs and account for this,
radiofrequency point-by-point ablation remained the most cost-effective option, and other
catheter ablation techniques are therefore unlikely to provide a cost-effective use of NHS
resources. Based on the economic model results the committee agreed that
radiofrequency point-by-point ablation should be considered in people with symptomatic
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if drug treatment is unsuccessful, unsuitable or not tolerated.
The committee noted that cryoballoon and laser ablation may be more suitable for some
patients because they can sometimes be carried out without general anaesthesia, and
cryoballoon ablation may be quicker to perform, with same-day discharge more likely.
There is also an increased risk of fluid overload from saline irrigated radiofrequency
ablation. They decided that either cryoballoon or laser ablation could be considered if
radiofrequency point-by-point ablation is not suitable; for example, if a short procedure
time is a priority or for people with a recent history of decompensated heart failure who

are at increased risk of fluid overload. Radiofrequency multi-electrode was not included as
an alternative due to its lower efficacy relative to cryoballoon and laser ablation and
concerns about a higher risk of stroke.
There was limited evidence for ablation in people with persistent atrial fibrillation. Despite
this, the committee decided that the evidence, combined with their experience and
knowledge (also noting the Packer et al. CABANA randomized clinical trial, 2019, which
contained a mixed population of people with persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation)
was sufficient to support ablation as an option to be considered for those with persistent
symptoms that are not alleviated by, or who cannot have, antiarrhythmic drugs. The
committee agreed that ablation can be effective in people with persistent atrial fibrillation,
and that this population might have as much to gain from ablation as people with
paroxysmal symptoms. The committee agreed that the cost-effectiveness analyses of
different types of ablation in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could also be applied to this
population.
The committee emphasised the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of
catheter ablation with the person, in particular the risk of adverse events. The discussion
should also include that, in the experience of the committee, the effects of ablation may
not be long term.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee noted that the recommendations are likely to reinforce current practice.
Ablation is carried out in a relatively restricted population (approximately 1% to 2% of all
people with atrial fibrillation currently have ablation) and is usually reserved for people in
whom antiarrhythmic drugs have failed. The recommendation is likely to lead to a change
in the types of ablation offered, with more people receiving radiofrequency point-by-point
ablation and fewer having other catheter ablation techniques.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Why the committee made the recommendations
Most of the evidence on preventing recurrence after ablation was for amiodarone. The
evidence suggested that amiodarone may reduce recurrence of atrial fibrillation after
ablation. However, there was evidence of an increased risk of hospitalisation and the
committee noted the known side effects of amiodarone, which, although rare, can be
severe and life-threatening.
There was a lack of evidence for other antiarrhythmic drugs and there were no
comparisons between different antiarrhythmic drugs. Therefore, the committee agreed
that there was too much uncertainty to recommend one specific antiarrhythmic drug over
others.
In addition, the studies often made no distinction between people who had been on
antiarrhythmic drugs up to ablation and those who had not. There is variation in current
practice on whether people who were not previously taking antiarrhythmic drugs should
start them after ablation to reduce recurrence. However, the evidence did not support
making separate recommendations to clarify this.
The committee decided that antiarrhythmic drug treatment should be considered after
ablation, but only after discussion with the person, taking into account their preferences
for treatment and the potential individual risks and benefits. In particular, the committee
noted that people should fully understand the potential adverse events associated with
these drugs. While there is some variation, the committee agreed that good current
practice is for patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs up to ablation to continue them for
3 months after ablation and reassess the need for drug treatment after this time.
How the recommendations might affect practice
There is some variation in current practice. Practice is likely to change in some centres
both in prescribing and in the need for a more formal reassessment of treatment at
3 months. The impact on use of antiarrhythmic drugs is difficult to predict, but there may
be an increase from current levels. Increased resources may be needed for reassessment,
but it is anticipated that this could be performed at routine follow-up appointments with a
cardiologist.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Rate and rhythm control for people presenting
acutely
Recommendation 1.8.3
Why the committee made the recommendation
The committee agreed that the evidence was too limited in quality and quantity to be able
to specify a preferred rate-control drug for acute atrial fibrillation. Although there was
some evidence that amiodarone was better than digoxin for rate control, the committee
had concerns about the quality of the evidence and the short timeframe used in 1 study,
which it agreed could disadvantage digoxin. In addition, there was limited evidence
available for morbidity and adverse events for this comparison and no evidence identified
for other drug classes.
The committee highlighted that the existing recommendations gave no guidance on acute
atrial fibrillation with acute decompensated heart failure. Using their expertise and
experience the committee agreed that advice on the use of beta-blockers and rate-
limiting calcium-channel blockers should be included because they can lead to further
deterioration in people with pulmonary oedema caused by heart failure.
How the recommendation might affect practice
The recommendations do not constitute a change in practice, and so are unlikely to have a
resource impact.

Preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation
Recommendations 1.10.3 and 1.10.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee noted that the most recent studies reviewed showed no benefit from
statins in reducing atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery. This contrasted with
analysis of the evidence overall, which showed a small but definite benefit from statins.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
The committee agreed that the evidence of no effect in the newer studies was important,
because these studies were larger and of higher quality than the older studies included in
the analysis.
Although the newer studies suggested that statins did not affect the short-term risk of
stroke, they did suggest a greater risk of mortality in the peri-operative period compared
with placebo treatment or usual care. The committee agreed that although the additional
risk of death was probably small, it was important, especially alongside the lack of
convincing evidence of benefit.
For these reasons, the committee decided that statins should not be given to prevent atrial
fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery. However, the committee wanted to highlight that
statins have an important role in preventing cardiovascular events other than atrial
fibrillation and that people already taking statins for other reasons should continue to do
so.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee agreed that the recommendation would not constitute a change in
practice, and that there would not be a resource impact on the NHS.
Return to recommendations
Managing atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic
surgery
Recommendations 1.10.5 and 1.10.6
Why the committee made the recommendations
The evidence on managing postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery in
people without pre-existing atrial fibrillation was limited – many of the studies reviewed
were old and included small numbers of participants. There were few studies comparing
drug classes, and the committee agreed that they could not recommend a particular class
of drugs based on such limited evidence.
One larger study comparing mixed rate control and rhythm control with a

potassium-channel blocker (amiodarone) with or without rate control suggested little
difference between the 2 groups. Based on this evidence and their experience, the
committee decided that rhythm control could be considered but that the evidence no
longer supported the stronger recommendation included in the 2014 guideline. The
committee noted that postoperative atrial fibrillation often resolves naturally, meaning that
rate control rather than rhythm control may be a suitable option for some people. Reducing
the emphasis on rhythm-control strategies will allow rate-control strategies to be
considered if appropriate for the person.
The committee were also aware of the risk of adverse events if amiodarone, a rhythm
control drug, is taken long-term. They highlighted that if a rhythm-control strategy is
chosen, the need for rhythm control drugs should be reassessed at approximately 6
weeks, in line with current practice, and they should not be continued automatically for
long periods of time. The committee agreed that 6 weeks is an appropriate time point to
assess the person's recovery, including for example prosthetic valve function, and to
check if sinus rhythm has been restored.
The committee did not make a separate recommendation for people with pre-existing
atrial fibrillation because of a lack of evidence. The committee noted that most people
undergoing mitral valve surgery with pre-existing atrial fibrillation would undergo left atrial
surgery to treat atrial fibrillation at the same time.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Rhythm control for the treatment of new-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic
surgery is current practice and amiodarone is most commonly used. This can still be
considered, but there may be a reduction in the use of rhythm control in this population
and an increase in the use of rate-control drugs instead.

Stopping anticoagulation
Recommendations 1.11.1 and 1.11.2

conditions#notice-of-rights). 47
--- Страница 43 ---
Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Why the committee made the recommendations
There was limited evidence on whether to continue anticoagulation or to stop it and switch
to aspirin after successful treatment of atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation. The
committee agreed that the evidence was insufficient and that there was too much
uncertainty in the results to make a recommendation based on the evidence. The
committee therefore developed research recommendations on stopping anticoagulation
after ablation and stopping anticoagulation after resolution of postoperative atrial
fibrillation to encourage further research.
The committee was concerned about the potential withdrawal of anticoagulation in people
who had not had ablation or cardiac surgery for atrial fibrillation, but in whom sinus rhythm
is now present and atrial fibrillation is no longer detectable. In particular, the committee
noted that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is not always detectable. Based on their
experience, the committee made a consensus-based recommendation to ensure that
decisions about stopping anticoagulation in this population are based on formal risk
assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and patient preference.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee felt that the recommendation would not constitute a change in practice,
and that there would not be a resource impact on the NHS.

Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management (NG196)
Context
Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder (affecting approximately 2% of
the adult population), and estimates suggest its prevalence is increasing. Atrial fibrillation
causes palpitations and breathlessness in many people but it may be silent and
undetected. If left untreated it is a significant risk factor for stroke and other morbidities: it
is estimated that it is responsible for approximately 20% of all strokes and is associated
with increased mortality. Men are more commonly affected than women and the
prevalence increases with age and in underlying heart disease, diabetes, obesity and
hypertension.
Atrial fibrillation is typically detected as an irregular pulse or an irregular rhythm on an
electrocardiogram (ECG). This may be an incidental finding or may arise while investigating
symptoms suggestive of the disease. Because atrial fibrillation can be intermittent,
detection and diagnosis may be challenging.
The aim of treatment is to prevent complications, particularly stroke, and alleviate
symptoms. Drug treatments include anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke and
antiarrhythmics to restore or maintain the normal heart rhythm or to slow the heart rate in
people who remain in atrial fibrillation. Non-pharmacological management includes
electrical cardioversion, which may be used to 'shock' the heart back to its normal rhythm,
and catheter or surgical ablation to create lesions to stop the triggers that cause atrial
fibrillation. These procedures can markedly reduce the symptom burden when drug
therapy is ineffective or not tolerated.
This update focuses on areas of new evidence and changing practice since the 2014 NICE
guideline. These include methods of identifying atrial fibrillation; assessing stroke and
bleeding risk; antithrombotic agents; ablation strategies; preventing recurrence; and
preventing and managing postoperative atrial fibrillation. This guideline update includes
recommendations on these specific issues.
The recommendations apply to adults (18 years or older) with atrial fibrillation, including
paroxysmal (recurrent), persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. They
do not apply to people with congenital heart disease precipitating atrial fibrillation.

Update information
30 June 2021: We further corrected recommendation 1.2.2 on using the ORBIT score to
assess bleeding risk to reinstate the link to the previous calculation tool, which was
amended in error on 10 June. The tool includes the full criteria, including options for
reduced haemoglobin and reduced haematocrit which are available once the patient's sex
has been selected.
10 June 2021: We amended recommendation 1.2.2 on using the ORBIT score to assess
bleeding risk so that it links to a calculation tool that includes the full list of criteria,
including reduced haemoglobin, reduced haematocrit and history of anaemia. We deleted
a paragraph of text from the rationale and impact section for recommendation 1.8.3 that
was included incorrectly.
April 2021: We have reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on diagnosis
and assessment, assessment of stroke and bleeding risks, preventing stroke, rate and
rhythm control, preventing recurrence, and preventing and managing postoperative atrial
fibrillation. These recommendations are marked [2021].
Recommendations marked [2014] and [2006] last had an evidence review in 2014 and
2006 respectively. In some cases, minor changes have been made to the wording for
clarity and to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the meaning.
Minor changes since publication
March 2025: We replaced technology appraisal guidance recommendations with links to
the relevant guidance in the sections on direct-acting oral anticoagulant treatment options
and antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
August 2023: As part of our work to make our guidance more useful and usable, we are
testing out some changes to improve the way we present our guidance.
Recommendations from the following technology appraisals guidance have been brought
into this guideline:
