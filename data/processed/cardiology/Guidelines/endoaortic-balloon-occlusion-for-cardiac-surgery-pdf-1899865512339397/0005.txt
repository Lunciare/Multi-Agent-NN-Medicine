Endoaortic balloon occlusion for cardiac surgery

balloon occlusion. 2.4.6 In the case series of 306 and 151 patients, myocardial infarction was reported in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. 2.4.7 The specialist advisers reported anecdotal adverse events including aortic dissection, balloon puncture, balloon migration, damage to aortic intima, device movement causing loss of occlusion, femoral artery damage, difficulty positioning the balloon, death due to failure to deliver cardioplegia, and inability to complete planned surgery due to occlusion failure. Additional theoretical adverse events noted by the advisers were stroke, inadequate myocardial protection and cerebral ischaemia due to balloon misplacement and arterial embolism. The advisers noted that this procedure has the potential to reduce stroke risk in patients who have a very calcified aorta.
