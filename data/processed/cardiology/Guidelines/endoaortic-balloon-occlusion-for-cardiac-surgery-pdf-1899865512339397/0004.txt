127 patients, no aortic dissections occurred. 2.4.3 In a case series of 449 patients, there were no significant differences in the incidences of arrhythmias, pulmonary dysfunction, bleeding, renal failure or low cardiac output between those treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion and those treated with transthoracic clamping. However, the rates of neurological complications were higher in patients who had endoaortic balloon occlusion (p<0.05; absolute numbers not given). (Neurological complications were defined as stroke and transient hemiplegia.) 2.4.4 In five case series, stroke or transient ischaemic attack was reported in 4% (2 out of 52), 2% (2 out of 127), 0.4% (1 out of 306), 1% (1 out of 117) and 1% (1 out of 151) of patients. 2.4.5 In seven case series, re-exploration for bleeding or tamponade was required in 10% (6 out of 60), 9% (26 out of 306), 7% (14 out of 209), 6% (9 out of 151), 4% (5 out of 117), 4% (1 out of 23) and 2% (3 out of 127) of patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion. 2.4.6 In the case series of 306 and 151 patients, myocardial infarction was reported in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. 2.4.7 The specialist advisers reported anecdotal adverse events
