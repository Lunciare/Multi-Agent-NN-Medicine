into an artery (normally the femoral artery in the groin) and manipulated towards the aortic root. The balloon at the tip of the catheter is filled with saline to occlude the aorta and prevent blood flow. Various devices can be used for this procedure. 2.2.3 Continuous transoesophageal echocardiographic monitoring is used to detect balloon migration along with other forms of monitoring such as radial arterial pressure monitoring and direct monitoring of the surgical field, as necessary. 2.3 Efficacy Sections 2.3 and 2.4 describe efficacy and safety outcomes which were available in the published literature and which the committee considered as part of the evidence about this procedure. For more details, see the overview. 2.3.1 There were no outcomes reported in the literature that related directly to the efficacy of endoaortic balloon occlusion alone. 2.3.2 The specialist advisers considered key efficacy outcomes to include efficiency of cardioprotection, reduced length of hospital stay, duration of cardiac arrest and avoidance of the use of a cross-clamp from outside. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 In a case series of 306 patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion, the 30-day mortality rate was 1% (3 out of 306) and the rate of late deaths (mean follow-up 20 months)
