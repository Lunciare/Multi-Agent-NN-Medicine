Endoaortic balloon occlusion for cardiac surgery

case series of 306 patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion, the 30-day mortality rate was 1% (3 out of 306) and the rate of late deaths (mean follow-up 20 months) was 2% (6 out of 306). A case series comparing 117 patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion with 117 matched controls treated with conventional aortic cross-clamping reported one perioperative death in each group. In four case series, 5% (11 out of 209), 4% (6 out of 151), 1% (1 out of 127) and 25% (13 out of 52) of patients who were treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion died in hospital. 2.4.2 The three case series of 306, 209 and 117 patients treated with endoaortic balloon occlusion all reported aortic dissection in 1% (3 out of 306, 3 out of 209, and 1 out of 117) of patients. One aortic dissection in the case series of 151 patients was judged by the authors to be unrelated to the endoaortic balloon occlusion device. In the case series that described 58, 120 and 127 patients, no aortic dissections occurred. 2.4.3 In a case series of 449 patients, there were no significant differences in the incidences of arrhythmias, pulmonary dysfunction, bleeding, renal failure or
