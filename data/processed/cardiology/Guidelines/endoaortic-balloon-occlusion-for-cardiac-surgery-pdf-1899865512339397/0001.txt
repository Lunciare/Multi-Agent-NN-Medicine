1 Recommendations 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endoaortic balloon occlusion for cardiac surgery is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 1.2 The procedure should only be carried out by a highly experienced team and with the use of continuous transoesophageal echocardiography. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications and current treatments 2.1.1 Endoaortic balloon occlusion is performed to achieve temporary obstruction of the aorta during cardiac surgery, including mitral valve repair or replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. 2.1.2 Occlusion of the aorta is required in a number of cardiac operations. This is normally achieved by external application of an aortic cross-clamp, either during conventional open surgery or during minimally invasive cardiac procedures. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 This procedure is usually employed during minimally invasive cardiac operations (also known as port-access surgery) that require endovascular aortic occlusion, cardioplegia and left ventricular decompression. 2.2.2 A balloon catheter is inserted through the skin into an artery (normally the femoral artery in the groin) and manipulated towards the aortic root. The balloon at the tip of the catheter is filled with saline to occlude
