1 Recommendations 1.1 Acoramidis can be used, within its marketing authorisation, as an option to treat wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in adults. Acoramidis can only be used if the company provides it according to the commercial arrangement. 1.2 Use the least expensive option of the suitable treatments (including acoramidis and tafamidis), having discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the available treatments with the person with the condition. Take account of administration costs, dosages, price per dose and commercial arrangements. What this means in practice Acoramidis must be funded in the NHS in England for the condition and population in the recommendations, if it is considered the most suitable treatment option. Acoramidis must be funded in England within 30 days of final publication of this guidance.
