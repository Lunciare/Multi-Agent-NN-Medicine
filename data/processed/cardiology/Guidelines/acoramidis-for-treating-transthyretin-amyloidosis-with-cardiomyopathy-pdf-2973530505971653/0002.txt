Acoramidis for treating transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy

were made Usual treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is tafamidis. Acoramidis works in a similar way to tafamidis and would be offered to the same population. Clinical trial evidence suggests that acoramidis is more effective than placebo. Acoramidis has not been directly compared in a clinical trial with tafamidis, but an indirect comparison suggests that they are likely to have similar clinical effectiveness. There are uncertainties with the clinical-effectiveness evidence, including: • how effective acoramidis is in people with severe heart failure, and • that some people in the trial had both acoramidis and tafamidis. But these uncertainties are unlikely to have affected the overall results. A cost comparison suggests that the costs for acoramidis are similar to or lower than those for tafamidis. So, acoramidis can be used. For all evidence, see the committee papers. For more information on NICE's evaluation of tafamidis, see the committee discussion section in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on tafamidis for treating transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. 2 Information about acoramidis Marketing authorisation indication 2.1 Acoramidis (Beyonttra, Bayer) is indicated for the 'treatment of wild-type or variant transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR- CM)'.
