events for CABG with and without the MiraQ system were based on Becit et al. (2007). The base-case analysis compared a 0% postoperative myocardial infarction rate for patients assessed clinically and with VeriQ versus a 5% rate for patients who had clinical assessment alone. The treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and associated rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £1,667 per patient. The cost of treatment by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,657 per episode. The base-case analysis compared a 1% rate for intra-aortic balloon pumping for patients assessed clinically and with VeriQ versus a 7% rate for patients who had clinical assessment alone. There was no difference in the rate of intraoperative re-exploration of bleeding and incidence of deep sternal infection between the arms of the model. No adverse event costs as a result of using the VeriQ system were included in the model because none have been reported. 5.6 The cost saving associated with the MiraQ system in the base case was £115 per patient based on purchase of a VeriQ 2011 console (£32,000), using a PS probe (£1,582 for 30 uses), and annual maintenance costs (£1,800) payable at the end of year 2. 5.7 The
