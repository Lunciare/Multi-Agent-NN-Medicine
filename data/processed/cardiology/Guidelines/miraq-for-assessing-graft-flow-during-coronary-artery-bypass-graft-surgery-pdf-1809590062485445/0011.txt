determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality after CABG. It was advised that the majority of graft failures in the perioperative period are due to technical imperfections which, if recognised, might be corrected at the time of surgery. 3.9 The committee noted that perioperative myocardial infarction resulting from graft failure may cause serious complications such as left ventricular dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and haemodynamic instability, which can necessitate prolonged intensive therapy unit stay. These complications may need interventions such as intra-aortic balloon pumping, coronary angiography and early reoperative CABG surgery. They may also lead to readmission to hospital. 3.10 The committee considered that the available evidence supported the claim that transit time flow measured by the VeriQ system can identify grafts that have reduced flow as a result of technical imperfections. 3.11 The committee recognised limitations in the available evidence. The main studies were observational, with potential for bias. The study by Kieser et al. (2010) investigated the VeriQ system on arterial grafts only, whereas in the NHS the majority of CABGs are vein grafts. Nevertheless, it judged that there was sufficient additional evidence relating to predecessor devices and sufficient expert advice to support the expectation that routinely revising all appropriate grafts
