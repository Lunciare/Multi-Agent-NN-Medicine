p=0.005). Mortality following non-emergency surgery was significantly higher in the patient group with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (5 of 54, 9%) than in the group with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (5 of 250, 2%, p=0.02). 3.5 Becit et al. (2007) evaluated the effect on the surgical results of CABG of detecting graft dysfunction by intraoperative transit time flow measurement using the VeriQ system in a case–control study in Turkey. A pulsatility index of greater than 5 and diastolic filling percentage of less than 50% were used as the indicators of inadequate flow. The study compared the surgical outcomes for 2 matched series of consecutive patients whose operations were performed by the same surgeons. The study group (n=100) had transit time flow measurement during surgery and the control group (n=100) did not. Three per cent (9 of 303) of grafts in 9 (9%) patients in the study group were revised on the basis of abnormal transit time measurements, and after revision all flow values and flow patterns improved. No information was presented about graft revision in the control group. The incidence of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion for low cardiac output was significantly lower in the
