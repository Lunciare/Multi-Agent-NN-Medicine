was when there was no change in the usage rate of intra-aortic balloon pumping in either arm of the model (3.5%). The external assessment centre advised that this is a pessimistic view and that the MiraQ system is likely to be cost saving when used appropriately. Committee considerations 5.8 The committee considered that the assumptions made in the cost model were realistic and that the range of savings calculated for the use of MiraQ was likely to be realised in practice. 5.9 The committee noted that the manufacturer's cost model did not include potential cost savings from reductions in intensive therapy unit stay and reduced readmission rates. The cost savings associated with the MiraQ system may therefore have been underestimated. 5.10 The committee also noted that the manufacturer's estimated usage of the MiraQ system at 1 patient per day for 220 days per year was likely to be conservative. The committee was advised that on average 3 to 4 CABG operations are performed per day in a cardiac operating theatre in the UK. Increased annual use of a MiraQ system is expected to reduce the estimated equipment cost per procedure because the capital cost of the VeriQ system will be
