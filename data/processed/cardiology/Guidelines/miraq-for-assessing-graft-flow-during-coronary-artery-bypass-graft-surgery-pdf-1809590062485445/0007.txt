a pulsatility index of less than or equal to 5. The remaining 74 (7%) grafts (in 59 patients, 18%) had a pulsatility index of greater than 5, but grafts were revised only when an abnormally high pulsatility index was accompanied by other indications of graft malfunction (abnormal electrocardiogram [ECG] changes, regional wall motion abnormality on transoesophageal echocardiography or haemodynamic compromise). On this basis, 20 grafts (in 14 patients, 4%) that were suspected to be problematic were revised. 3.4 For analysis of the findings, patients were divided into 2 groups: the 277 (82%) with at least one graft with a pulsatility index of less than 5, and 59 (18%) with at least one graft with a pulsatility index of greater than 5. Major adverse cardiac events (recurrent angina, perioperative myocardial infarction, postoperative angioplasty, re-operation and/or perioperative death) occurred significantly more often in patients with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (10 of 59, 17%) when compared with patients with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (15 of 277, 5.4%, p=0.005). Mortality following non-emergency surgery was significantly higher in the patient group with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (5 of 54, 9%) than in the group with a
