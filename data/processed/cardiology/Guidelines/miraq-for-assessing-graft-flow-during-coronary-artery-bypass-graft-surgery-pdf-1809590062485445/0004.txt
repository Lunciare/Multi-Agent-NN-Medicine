disease is a common cause of symptoms, disability and death. It is caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to stenosis or occlusion of the coronary arteries. NICE's guideline on stable angina recommends that revascularisation of the blocked coronary arteries using CABG or percutaneous coronary interventions should be considered in people whose symptoms are not satisfactorily controlled by medical treatment. 2.7 CABG aims to bypass narrowed or blocked segments of the coronary arteries using grafts. Grafts are usually constructed from lengths of the patient's own long saphenous vein or their internal mammary artery, although other vessels are also used. 2.8 Cardiac surgeons use a variety of techniques to avoid technical imperfections during CABG, but assessment of graft flow is usually subjective. Techniques used vary according to the graft used, the surgical technique, and the surgeon's individual preference. They include the surgeon assessing resistance and perfusion beyond a graft by flushing fluid through it before restoring flow, and both observing and palpating grafts for pulsation when blood flow has been re- established. 2.9 There are a number of methods for the objective assessment of the technical results and of blood flow. Transoesophageal echocardiography evaluates heart function after bypass by assessing regional left ventricular
