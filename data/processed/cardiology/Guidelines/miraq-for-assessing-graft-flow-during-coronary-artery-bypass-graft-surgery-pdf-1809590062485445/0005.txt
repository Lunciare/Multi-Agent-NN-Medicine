There are a number of methods for the objective assessment of the technical results and of blood flow. Transoesophageal echocardiography evaluates heart function after bypass by assessing regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, which can be compared with preoperative regional left ventricular function. Perioperative graft flow can be visualised in the operating theatre using conventional angiography or using indocyanine green fluorescence. NICE has produced interventional procedures guidance on intraoperative fluorescence angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft. This guidance states that current evidence suggests that the procedure is safe enough for routine use in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency. 3 Clinical evidence Summary of clinical evidence 3.1 The key clinical outcomes for the MiraQ system presented in the decision problem were: • incidence of graft failure • time to graft failure • peri and postoperative clinical events associated with graft failure (including mortality) • frequency of the need for graft revision and changes in VeriQ measurements afterwards • the need for repeat coronary revascularisation procedures • long-term morbidity and mortality. 3.2 The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the MiraQ system was based on 2 retrospective observational studies that examined surgical outcomes, and one comparative
