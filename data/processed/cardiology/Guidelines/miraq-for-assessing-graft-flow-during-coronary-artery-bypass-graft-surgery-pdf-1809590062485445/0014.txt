(for example, valve replacement surgery) have concomitant CABG. Based on this large number of patients, any reduction in graft occlusion rates by the MiraQ system during CABG surgery potentially offers significant cost savings to the NHS. 4.2 The committee was informed that the MiraQ system is easy to use and does not significantly increase operative time. Committee considerations 4.3 As described in section 3, the committee judged that reduction in graft occlusion rates by MiraQ assessment and appropriate revision at the time of surgery could decrease complication rates. This could reduce the likelihood of subsequent interventions, prolonged intensive therapy unit and hospital stay, and readmission. Each of these reductions would result in significant resource savings. 5 Cost considerations Cost evidence 5.1 The economic evidence for the MiraQ system comprised a new cost analysis to assess the cost savings to the NHS of introducing the MiraQ system for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, compared against clinical assessment. 5.2 In the base-case analysis, the equipment cost for the MiraQ system was about £111 per procedure and the additional time for measuring flow in 3 grafts was 2.35 minutes. The equipment costs were based on the VeriQ 2011
