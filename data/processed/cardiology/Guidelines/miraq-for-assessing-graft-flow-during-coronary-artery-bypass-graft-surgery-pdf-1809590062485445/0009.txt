flow patterns improved. No information was presented about graft revision in the control group. The incidence of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion for low cardiac output was significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group (1 of 100 versus 7 of 100, p<0.05). Also, perioperative myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group (0 of 100 versus 5 of 100, p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the patient groups in intraoperative re-exploration for bleeding or deep sternal infection. 3.6 Nordgaard et al. (2010) investigated the variation in pulsatility index measurement between 2 different flowmeters (VeriQ and Transonic) and examined whether increasing filtering of the flowmeter signals influenced flow curves and pulsatility index. The VeriQ and Transonic flowmeters have default filter settings of 20 Hz and 10 Hz respectively. Flow patterns in 19 patients recorded simultaneously by both flowmeters during CABG surgery were analysed. This showed that the VeriQ system provided systematically higher pulsatility index values than the Transonic device (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 2.7±1.2 versus 1.8±0.6 respectively, p<0.001). 3.7 Clinical evidence was also available from 26 studies on predecessor devices of the VeriQ system which were designed to evaluate
