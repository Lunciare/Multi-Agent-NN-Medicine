values are given in brackets). The main parameter changes were the cost of the MiraQ console £34,000 (£32,000) and probes £1,481 (£1,582) with 50 uses (30 uses). These costs resulted in a MiraQ system cost of about £141 (£111) per procedure. The cost of the time taken to perform a minor revision was estimated to be £24 (£11), and for major revisions, £396 (£180). Treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and associated rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £2,031 (£1,667) per patient and treatment cost by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,574 (£2,657) per episode. Base-case results for the 2017 revised model shows the cost saving associated with the MiraQ system was £141 (£115) per patient. Further details of the 2017 revised model are in the revised model summary. [2018] 2022 guidance review 5.13 For the 2022 guidance review, the EAC reviewed 87 studies that used the Medistim device (MiraQ or previous equivalent versions). It found that most of the evidence was based on single-arm studies with large in-between study heterogeneity. There was, therefore, not enough high-quality evidence to justify any changes to the guidance. 5.14 The EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs and changes to
