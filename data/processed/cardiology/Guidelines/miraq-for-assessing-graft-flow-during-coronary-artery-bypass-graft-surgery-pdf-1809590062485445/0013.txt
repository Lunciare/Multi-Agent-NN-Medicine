recent joint guidelines on myocardial revascularisation issued by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) have recommended graft evaluation by objective methods before leaving the operating theatre after CABG surgery. These guidelines refer to flow less than 20 ml/minute and a pulsatility index of greater than 5 as predicting technically inadequate grafts that need revision before leaving the operating theatre. 3.15 The committee recognised that the clinical outcomes of CABG surgery have improved in the UK in the past 20 years and that complication rates are now very low. However it was advised that there is still a perioperative graft occlusion rate of 1% to 3%. The committee considered that the VeriQ system has potential to reduce this graft occlusion rate and so further reduce morbidity and mortality after CABG. 4 NHS considerations System impact 4.1 Approximately 22,500 isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations are performed in the UK each year. In addition, a substantial proportion of patients having other cardiac surgery (for example, valve replacement surgery) have concomitant CABG. Based on this large number of patients, any reduction in graft occlusion rates by the MiraQ system during CABG surgery potentially offers
