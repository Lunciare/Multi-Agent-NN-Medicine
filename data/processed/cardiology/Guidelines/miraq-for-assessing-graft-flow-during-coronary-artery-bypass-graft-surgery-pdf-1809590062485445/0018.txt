on purchase of a VeriQ 2011 console (£32,000), using a PS probe (£1,582 for 30 uses), and annual maintenance costs (£1,800) payable at the end of year 2. 5.7 The sensitivity analysis based on the parameters and ranges identified by the manufacturer showed that estimates of cost saving for the MiraQ system are robust. The key drivers of the cost saving were the reduction in the rate of postoperative myocardial infarction and the reduction in use of intra-aortic balloon pumping associated with the use of the MiraQ system. The highest cost saving obtained in the sensitivity analysis was £323 per patient and was associated with 0% use of intra-aortic balloon pumping in patients assessed with the MiraQ system compared with a usage rate of 14% in patients assessed without the MiraQ system. The lowest cost saving, of £38 per patient, was obtained for a 2.5% postoperative myocardial infarction rate. The only case in which use of the MiraQ system was not cost saving (when the cost per patient was £45) was when there was no change in the usage rate of intra-aortic balloon pumping in either arm of the model (3.5%). The external assessment centre advised that this is a
