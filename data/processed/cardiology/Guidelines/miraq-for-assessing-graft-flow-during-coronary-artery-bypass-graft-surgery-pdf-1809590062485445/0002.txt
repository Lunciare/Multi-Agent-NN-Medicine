using specially designed probes. A microcomputer with a 19-inch touch screen mounted on a moveable trolley is used to control the probes and store their outputs. 2.3 The MiraQ system can use 2 types of probes to assess blood flow during CABG procedures (the PS and PQ). These differ in the number of recommended reuses and their method of sterilisation. Only the PS probe is considered in this guidance, because the PQ probe needs ethylene oxide sterilisation, which is not thought to be widely available in the NHS. The probes deliver a bidirectional ultrasound beam across a target vessel and the system analyses the returning signal to calculate the blood flow through the vessel at a default filter setting of 20 Hz. A real-time flow curve is displayed together with the mean blood flow in ml/minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage. This information can be used to determine whether flow through the graft and its anastomoses is acceptable. If not, then the graft can be explored to detect imperfections and revised as necessary to achieve acceptable blood flow. 2.4 The cost of the MiraQ system stated in the sponsor's submission includes £32,000 for the VeriQ 2011 console, and £1,582
