± standard deviation [SD]: 2.7±1.2 versus 1.8±0.6 respectively, p<0.001). 3.7 Clinical evidence was also available from 26 studies on predecessor devices of the VeriQ system which were designed to evaluate the technical performance of devices, to compare them against the other methods of graft flow assessment such as intraoperative fluorescence imaging and postoperative X-ray angiography; and to assess the predictive value of abnormal transit time flow measurement on short and long-term clinical outcomes of CABG surgery. These were evaluated by the external assessment centre and, on balance, their opinion was that the studies showed that transit time flow measurements by the VeriQ system predecessor devices predicted short-term graft failure following CABG surgery and were easier to carry out than other methods. However, they also thought that assessing graft flow with transit time flow measurement alone may prompt unnecessary graft revision in some cases and there is inadequate evidence about whether transit time flow measurement predicts long-term patient survival. Committee considerations 3.8 The committee recognised that graft dysfunction is a major determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality after CABG. It was advised that the majority of graft failures in the perioperative period are due to technical imperfections which, if recognised, might
