1.1 The MiraQ system is recommended as a cost saving option for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Why the committee made these recommendations Clinical evidence shows that the MiraQ system is effective for assessing coronary artery bypass grafts and allows for grafts to be revised during surgery. This may reduce the frequency of graft occlusion and may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. The MiraQ system can lead to an estimated cost saving of £80.27 per person compared with clinical assessment. [2022] 2 The technology Description of the technology 2.1 The MiraQ cardiac system (MCQ0, Medistim ASA) uses ultrasound for the non- invasive assessment of graft blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is intended for use in patients with coronary artery disease who are having CABG surgery.
