Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guidance represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, health
professionals are expected to take this guidance fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients. The application of the
recommendations in this guidance is at the discretion of health professionals and their
individual patients and do not override the responsibility of healthcare professionals to
make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation
with the patient and/or their carer or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to provide the funding required to
enable the guidance to be applied when individual health professionals and their patients
wish to use it, in accordance with the NHS Constitution. They should do so in light of their
duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance
equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
This guidance replaces TA4.
This guidance is partially replaced by TA152 and NG185.
1 Recommendations
1.1 Stents should be used routinely when percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is
the clinically appropriate procedure for people with stable angina.
For recommendations on drug-eluting stents for people with unstable angina,
non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment-
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), see recommendation 1.1.18 and
recommendation 1.2.18 in NICE's guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2020]
1.2 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal
guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
[2008]
1.3 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal
guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
[2008]
1.4 This recommendation has been replaced by NICE's technology appraisal
guidance on drug-eluting stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
[2008]
1.5 This guidance specifically relates to the present clinical indications for PCI and
excludes conditions (such as many cases of stable angina) that are adequately
managed with standard drug therapy. [2003]

2 Clinical need and practice
2.1 CAD is by far the most common cause of heart disease, resulting from the
narrowing of coronary arteries ('stenosis') caused by deposition of
atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary artery stenosis may be asymptomatic or may
lead to angina, a chest pain that may be severe enough to restrict or prevent
exertion. A critical reduction of the blood supply to the heart may result in MI or
death.
2.2 CAD causes about 2,100 deaths annually per million of the population in England
and Wales (about 110,000 deaths in total), 1 of the highest rates in the world. CAD
is also the cause of considerable morbidity and loss of ability to lead a normal life.
Approximately 1.4 million people in England and Wales suffer from angina, the
most common form of such morbidity.
2.3 Stenotic lesions are categorised as A, B1, B2 and C. A denotes a relatively short
(less than 10 mm) and easily accessible lesion. C denotes lesions that: are
relatively long (greater than 20 mm); may be less accessible, tortuous and/or
have side branches; and may be totally occluded.
2.4 CAD may affect 1 or more arteries, which may be of different calibres. Occlusion
may be partial or total.
2.5 The symptoms and health risks that are associated with a stenosed artery may
be treated medically – by modification of risk factors (for example, smoking,
hyperlipidaemia, obesity and hyperglycaemia) and/or by drug treatment (for
example, beta-adrenergic blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers,
antiplatelet agents and statins).
2.6 If these medical treatments fail or are inappropriate, 2 invasive therapies are
available. The first, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), involves major
cardiac surgery. The second, so-called balloon angioplasty, or percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), involves a non-surgical widening from
within the artery using a balloon catheter. When inflated, the balloon increases
the calibre of the artery.

Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
2.7 Recently, most PTCA procedures have involved the use of stents. Stents are thin
wire-mesh structures that act as permanent prosthetic linings to keep the artery
inflated and maintain its patency. PCI is a generic term to encompass PTCA with
or without adjunct techniques such as stenting.
2.8 For disease in a single artery, PCI with a stent has been the more frequent
treatment; for disease in 2 arteries, patient numbers for PCI with a stent and
CABG have been similar; and for more than 2 affected arteries, CABG has been
used much more frequently.
2.9 The major problem with PCI is restenosis of the artery, which has 3 main causes.
The first, recoil of the artery, happens when the balloon is deflated. It usually
occurs immediately or within 24 hours of completion of the procedure, and may
require emergency CABG. Stents essentially eliminate recoil of the artery. The 2
subsequent problems, mostly arising during the first 6 months, are contraction of
the adventitia secondary to an injury reaction (3 to 6 months), and proliferation of
smooth muscle cells within the arterial wall (4 to 6 months). A repeat procedure is
consequently required in approximately 20% of patients with simple lesions. This
rate of reintervention is much higher (up to 50%) for arteries of small calibre,
saphenous vein grafts, long lesions, total occlusions and in people with diabetes.
2.10 Recent advances in stent technology have reduced some of the problems of
restenosis, as well as lowering the cost of stents. In addition, the use of
antiplatelet drugs and other therapeutic strategies to prevent thrombosis have
improved long-term outcomes.
2.11 One of the main criteria for assessing the clinical effectiveness of PTCA with
stents compared with standard PTCA (without stents) is the ability to reduce the
incidence of subsequent attacks of angina as well as major adverse coronary
events (MACE), which include death, MI and the need for further
revascularisation procedures (CABG or repeat PCI).
2.12 Patients for whom both a CABG and a PCI involving stenting are appropriate
techniques would, other things being equal, choose PCI in almost all cases, even
though the chances of restenosis are greater. This is because the procedure is
less invasive, has a lower chance of death during the operation, and involves a
much shorter and less painful recuperation time.

2.13 Approximately 39,000 PCI procedures were undertaken in the UK in 2001,
equating to 663 per million of the population – a rate that had increased at an
average of 14% per year over the previous 10 years. The rate for the UK remains
below that of the European Union (EU) average, which exceeds 1,000 per million
of the population.
2.14 In the UK, the proportion of PCI procedures using stents rose steeply between
1993 and 1999, from below 10% to nearly 80%. It has continued to increase,
although more slowly, to about 85% in 2001.
2.15 The number of CABG procedures performed each year in the UK has increased
from 15,700 in 1991 to 24,700 in 1999 to 2000, or from 292 to 464 per million of
the population. The rate of increase has slowed since the first half of the 1990s.
2.16 The National Service Framework for Coronary heart Disease target, set in March
2000 for revascularisations (PCIs and CABGs), is at least 1,500 per million of the
population (750 for each type of intervention). At current growth rates, the
combined target will be reached by about 2005.

3 The technology
3.1 This appraisal is a review of previous NICE technology appraisal guidance on
ischaemic heart disease – coronary artery stents (TA4) covering bare metal stent
(BMS), and a new appraisal of drug-eluting stent (DES). BMS have already been
described in section 2 as part of existing practice. The rest of this section is
devoted to methods of reducing restenosis and, in particular, to the use of DES
as a means of achieving this.
3.2 Methods of reducing restenosis include: coating the stent with an appropriate
drug; introducing an emitter of radioactive particles at the stenting site
(brachytherapy); and creating the slow release of a drug from the stent, making
the stent 'drug-eluting'. For DES, the drug is held temporarily in place within a
polymer 'painted' onto the metallic stent. Other than 1 trial (the ELUTES trial),
there is little evidence in favour of coating the stent directly with an active drug
(without a polymer); this technology, and brachytherapy, are outside the scope of
this appraisal.
3.3 Although a number of drugs have been tested in the context of DES, only 3 have
been granted CE (Conformite Europeene) marking for use within EU countries:
paclitaxel, which inhibits cell division, elutes from the Taxus stent; sirolimus
(previously known as rapamycin), an immunosuppressive agent that reduces
inflammation, elutes from the Cypher stent; and dexamethasone, a synthetic
adrenocortical steroid that reduces inflammation, elutes from the BiodivYsio
stent. These drugs may elute at different rates, depending on the presence or
absence of additional polymer coatings on the stent. Because the performance of
a DES depends critically on the particular drug being used, each DES should be
regarded as a separate technology. However, as yet, studies directly comparing
different DES have not been performed.
3.4 Both types of stent (BMS and DES) require the use of an antiplatelet drug in
addition to aspirin. Such drugs should be used after the implantation of a stent, in
accordance with the device-specific instructions for use (IFU).
3.5 List prices for both BMS and DES differ between manufacturers, and some
manufacturers produce more than 1 stent in each class, at different prices. Prices

for BMS range from about £600 to £900 and for DES from about £1,300 to £1,500
per stent. For bare-metal and drug-eluting stents that are the same apart from
their drug-eluting properties, the difference in cost is about £500 to £600. Costs
may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.

4 Evidence and interpretation
The Appraisal Committee considered evidence from a number of sources.
4.1 Clinical effectiveness
4.1.1 The Assessment Report presents 3 sets of comparison: PCI without stents versus
PCI with BMS; PCI with BMS versus CABG; and BMS versus DES.
4.1.2 Assessment of the relative clinical effectiveness of stents considers the likelihood
of restenosis discovered on follow-up and the requirement for repeat intervention
(revascularisation). Repeat intervention may occur: (i) because of a requirement
of the trial protocol, specifying a repeat angiographic examination at a
predetermined interval (so-called 'protocol-driven' reintervention); or (ii) following
a recurrence of symptomatic angina in the patient (that is, 'clinically driven'
reintervention). The frequency of protocol-driven reinterventions is higher than
that of clinically driven reinterventions, because angiography is usually
mandatory at 6 months in the trial protocol whereas in clinical practice it is
carried out only after recurrence of symptoms. Accordingly, the absolute
differences observed between the treatment and control arms of clinical trials are
likely to be higher than would be expected to occur in clinical practice.
PCI with BMS versus PCI (without stents)
4.1.3 Fifty randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were analysed comparing the use of PCI
with BMS versus PCI without stents. Because of differences in, and completeness
of, the reporting of these trials, the number of trials on which meta-analyses are
based is a subset of these 50 trials. In a meta-analysis comprising 12 trials
involving 5,700 patients with non-specified ischaemic heart disease, where a
composite endpoint of revascularisation, MI or death (MACE) was reported, the
MACE rate was statistically significantly different at 6 months' follow-up: 23.0%
for the PCI without stents group versus 15.4% for the PCI with BMS group, with
an odds ratio (OR) of 1.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45 to 1.90). The
difference was smaller after 12 months' follow-up but still statistically significant.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32
--- Страница 11 ---
Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
Of the above 12 trials, 7, involving 3,500 patients, reported data for 12-months'
follow-up: the MACE rate was 22.0% for the PCI without stents group versus
18.9% for the PCI with stents group (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.58).
4.1.4 Differences in MACE rates were due almost entirely to differences in the rate of
restenosis. For the outcomes of acute MI and deaths, for which individual trials
were not powered to detect statistically significant differences, meta-analyses
showed that while both of these sets of events occurred less frequently in those
treated with PCI using BMS than in PCI without stents, in neither case was the
result statistically significant.
4.1.5 Overall, the results of the RCTs showed that the use of PCI with BMS has
significant advantages over the use of PCI without stents, in terms of lower rates
of restenosis at 6 and 12 months.
4.1.6 According to the joint professional submission, the likelihood of restenosis is
greater in small vessels, because a given tissue regrowth will have a greater
proportionate effect in a vessel of smaller calibre. In 8 out of 9 studies that
looked at vessels of a small calibre (less than 3 mm), restenosis rates were lower
in the BMS arm than in the PCI without stent arm, and in 2 of these studies, the
difference was statistically significant. A meta-analysis showed a statistically
significant advantage for PCI with BMS. However, restenosis rates were still high
in this group.
4.1.7 According to the joint professional submission, the restenosis rate increased by
an estimated 8 to 13 percentage points with every 10-mm increase in the length
of BMS required.
PCI with BMS versus CABG
4.1.8 There were 6 RCTs in the meta-analysis. None of the trials involved a DES.
4.1.9 For single-vessel disease, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different at
6 months' follow-up in 2 trials involving a total of 300 patients: 12.6% for CABG
versus 25.8% for PCI with BMS (OR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.74). The higher MACE
rate for PCI with BMS reflects the higher rate of restenosis following this

procedure.
4.1.10 For multiple-vessel disease, the MACE rate was statistically significantly different
at 12 months' follow-up in 2 trials involving a total of 2,300 patients: 12.3% for
CABG versus 24.5% for PCI with BMS (OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.54).
4.1.11 At 36 days' follow-up, the rate of acute MIs was statistically significantly lower
following PCI with BMS, but the difference between the 2 procedures was not
statistically significant at 6 and 12 months.
4.1.12 No statistically significant differences were reported for deaths, because the
trials were not powered to detect differences in these uncommon events.
BMS versus DES
4.1.13 There were 12 RCTs comparing BMS with DES. Of these, 7 involved paclitaxel, 4
sirolimus, 1 everolimus and 1 actinomycin stents. The first 2 sets of trials
(paclitaxel and sirolimus) are considered separately below, and the last 2 trials
have not been considered here because they involved products that have not
been granted CE marking. No RCT for the third DES with a CE mark (eluting
dexamethasone) has yet been reported.
4.1.14 Paclitaxel-eluting stents
4.1.14.1 Based on 4 trials with a paclitaxel DES (Taxus and non-CE-marked stents),
involving almost 1,000 patients, the MACE rate for PCIs using a paclitaxel DES
was not statistically significantly lower at 36 days or at 1 year, but it was
statistically significantly lower at 6 months: 7.4% for DES versus 15.4% for BMS
(OR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.73). From a random effects model (which takes
account of heterogeneity of results between trials), the 6-month data for the
MACE rate were not statistically significant (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.43). Most
of the MACE events refer to restenosis. However, the 2 trials of the Taxus DES
stent (which has a CE mark), involving 583 patients, yielded a statistically
significantly lower MACE rate at 6 months: 7.2% for DES versus 18.4% for BMS
(OR 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.59); and at 12 months: 9.7% for DES versus 20.5% for

BMS (OR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67).
4.1.14.2 Paclitaxel DES have not been demonstrated to show an advantage over BMS in
either mortality or prevention of MI. However, in a series of trials of the Taxus
stent (the TAXUS trials), the MI rate for PCIs using a paclitaxel DES was
statistically significantly lower at 6 months: 1.7% for DES versus 5.9% for BMS (OR
0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.99). The statistical significance of this result was not
maintained at 12 months: 2.8% for DES versus 5.8% for BMS (OR 0.56; 95% CI,
0.23 to 1.37).
4.1.14.3 Multivariate analysis of data from the TAXUS trials shows that once the effect of
small-calibre arteries and long lesions has been allowed for, the difference in
performance between DES and BMS for people with diabetes is not statistically
significantly different from that of people without diabetes.
4.1.15 Sirolimus-eluting stents
4.1.15.1 The MACE rate for PCIs using a sirolimus DES (Cypher and non-CE-marked
stents) was not statistically significantly lower at 36 days, but it was lower at 9
months and at 1 year; at 9 months the rate was 7.4% for DES versus 18.9% for
BMS (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47), and at 1 year it was 7.8% for DES versus
21.8% for BMS (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.43). Most of the MACE events refer to
restenosis. The trials of the Cypher sirolimus DES (which has a CE mark) showed
a statistically significantly lower MACE rate compared with trials of BMS at 9
months (OR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.45), 12 months (OR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22 to
0.43), and 24 months (OR 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.97).
4.1.15.2 Sirolimus-eluting stents in general have not been shown to have either a mortality
or acute MI advantage over BMS in trials, and neither do the DES within the
subset of Cypher stent trials.
4.1.15.3 According to the joint professional submission, in larger arteries, PCIs using a
sirolimus DES have shown very low rates of restenosis, approaching zero. In
small-calibre arteries, PCIs using a sirolimus DES have shown lower rates of
restenosis than PCIs using a BMS (for example, 7% versus 20% restenosis at 9
months in the SIRIUS trial for vessels of mean calibre 2.3 mm).

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32
--- Страница 14 ---
Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
4.1.15.4 In patients with diabetes and those with longer lesions, rates of restenosis
following PCIs using a sirolimus DES have been higher than those of the 'average'
patient, but still much lower than following PCIs using the BMS control.
Subsequent post hoc subgroup analysis from 1 of the manufacturers from a trial
involving patients who received a DES was considered by the Committee. The
analysis compared the restenosis rate for people with diabetes with that for
people without diabetes. It showed that the restenosis rate for those with
diabetes as a whole was higher than for the non-diabetes group, but the
difference was not statistically significant. In addition, the analysis did not control
for artery calibre or length.
4.1.15.5 According to the joint professional submission, for every 10 mm increase in the
length of the stent, the difference in restenosis rate between a Cypher DES and
Cypher BMS increased by between 1 and 1.6 percentage points.
4.2 Cost effectiveness
4.2.1 The most recent evidence of cost effectiveness comes from models supplied by
4 manufacturers and 1 from the Assessment Group, including an addendum. The
manufacturer models show that PCIs with a BMS are cost effective compared
with PCIs without stents and also compared with CABG. However, these models
are relatively short-run, ranging from 6 months to 2 years. The manufacturers of
the Cypher and of the Taxus stents each provided a model which examined the
cost effectiveness of their own DES compared with the corresponding BMS. Each
of these models showed that the DES is cost effective compared with the
corresponding BMS. The Assessment Group's model showed that the Cypher and
Taxus stents, as a group, are cost effective compared with BMS.
PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents
4.2.2 For patients with moderate or severe angina, PCI has been shown to be a cost-
effective alternative to conventional medical treatment. Since the previous
appraisal in 2000 of PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents, several further
studies have demonstrated the cost effectiveness of stents in a number of
patient populations and clinical settings, including elective stenting and stenting

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32
--- Страница 15 ---
Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
immediately following an acute MI.
PCI with BMS versus CABG
4.2.3 Comparative data on PCI using BMS versus CABG are available for only 3 years of
follow-up. There are no data beyond 3 years and little data from years 2 to 3. The
best available data are up to 2 years. Long-term models are needed to determine
cost effectiveness because most patients who have stents fitted live longer than
5 years, and it is impossible to give a proper answer to the question of cost
effectiveness by taking a short-term perspective.
4.2.4 The Assessment Group's model extrapolates the results to 5 years based on the
currently available 3-year data. However, the extrapolation is very sensitive to the
functional form chosen for the survival curve of patients who have undergone
either stenting or CABG.
4.2.5 The benefits and disadvantages of PCIs using BMS compared with CABG, in
terms of quality-of-life differences, derive from stents being a less invasive
procedure on one hand but having higher rates of restenosis on the other.
Neither of these 2 effects, in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), has
been estimated to be very great, which means that if there was any appreciable
difference in mortality between the 2 therapies, this factor would determine
which of the therapies had the greater benefits. However, none of the meta-
analyses from the trials shows any mortality benefit from PCI with either BMS or
DES compared with CABG in the first 2 years. Hence, all the measurable benefits
from using stents rather than CABG derive from an increase in the quality of life.
Since stenting is considerably cheaper than CABG, under the 2-year models, it is
therefore more cost effective, and indeed, dominates CABG.
4.2.6 The Assessment Group's model, however, estimated a survival benefit for CABG
over PCI using BMS of the order of 0.05 QALYs per patient, after the model was
extrapolated to 5 years. This benefit would be enough to make CABG the
preferred technology (in terms of both clinical and cost effectiveness) for
patients who were candidates for both stents and CABG. The clinician consultees
to the appraisal process, however, vigorously challenged this, stating that
previous studies had not reached this conclusion.

BMS versus DES
4.2.7 The quality-of-life component of the QALY differences between BMS and DES is
small, because it relates only to the extent of the differences in restenosis rates.
No differences in mortality have been demonstrated. Thus, the greatest benefits
of DES over BMS will occur for categories of patients for whom the absolute
differences in restenosis rates are greatest.
4.2.8 The addendum to the Assessment Report showed that, for single-vessel disease,
PCI using a DES was estimated to be cost-saving compared with PCI using a BMS
at 12 months for patients with diabetes and long lesions; the estimated cost per
QALY for patients without diabetes and long lesions was £15,000 and, for all
patients with narrow vessels, it was £16,000. These estimates were derived from
patient-level data derived from the TAXUS II trial. For the total population of
patients with single-vessel disease, the cost per QALY was £94,000. This
estimate was derived from registry data.
4.2.9 These estimates are sensitive to 5 factors:
• the percentage point reduction in the risk of revascularisation
• the price differential between BMS and DES
• the proportion of repeat interventions needing CABG
• the disutility caused by recurrent symptoms
• the average waiting time for repeat intervention.
4.2.10 There are no RCT data for 2-vessel disease. The estimated incremental cost per
QALY for 2-vessel disease gained from PCI using a DES compared with PCI using
a BMS for all non-diabetic patients is £195,000. This estimate is derived from
registry data.
4.3 Consideration of the evidence
4.3.1 The Committee reviewed the evidence available on the clinical and cost
effectiveness of PCIs using a BMS and DES, having considered evidence on the

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32

Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
nature of the condition and the value placed by users on the benefits of BMS and
DES from clinical experts and those who represent patients with angina. It was
also mindful of the need to ensure that its advice took account of the efficient
use of NHS resources.
PCI with BMS versus PCI without stents
4.3.2 The Committee considered that no new evidence had been found since the
previous appraisal to change its view that where PCI is being undertaken, the use
of stents is likely to be both clinically and cost effective.
BMS versus DES
4.3.3 The Committee noted that there were no head-to-head trials of the sirolimus-
eluting Cypher stent and the paclitaxel-eluting Taxus stent, and the clinical
experts advised that there was no evidence that would allow them to favour 1 of
these drug-eluting agents over the other.
4.3.4 The Committee considered that, for single-vessel disease, restenosis rates were
in general low using a BMS in the majority of patients requiring PCI, and that,
therefore, the routine use of a DES was not justified. However, this was not the
case for patients presenting with either small-calibre arteries (less than 3 mm) or
long lesions (greater than 15 mm); in these patients, the risk of restenosis using a
BMS was considerably higher, and the absolute reduction in restenosis rates
would justify the use of a DES.
4.3.5 The Committee considered the risk factors predicting the likelihood of higher
rates of restenosis after the use of a BMS. It was persuaded that the main
determinants of risk were the target vessel calibre and the complexity of the
arterial lesion, in particular the length of the stenosis. It recognised that the
combination of small-vessel disease and long lesions was particularly prevalent in
patients with CAD who also had diabetes. Whilst, in general, patients with
diabetes have higher restenosis rates than those without diabetes following PCI
with a BMS, the Review Group's analysis indicated that these higher rates arise
predominantly from the fact that a much higher proportion of patients with

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32
--- Страница 18 ---
Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
diabetes needing PCI have disease of small-calibre arteries and long lesions than
is true for the general population of patients requiring PCI.
4.3.6 The Committee discussed how the RCTs comparing BMS with DES relate to
current clinical practice. In particular, in the trials, the decision to reintervene
following an initial PCI with stent procedure was often made on the basis of
protocol-driven angiographic examinations at certain fixed times (for example at
6 months), rather than in response to the recurrence of clinical symptoms. It is
likely that the trials would encourage reintervention that might not be required in
clinical practice, where routine re-angiography is not usual. Thus, the Committee
was aware that the difference in restenosis rates between BMS and DES
identified in the trials could overestimate the extent of the difference that would
actually be seen in clinical practice. The addendum to the Assessment Report
attempted to correct for this potential overestimate of the benefit of DES versus
BMS. The Committee decided that, whether or not the correction factor was
applied, the guidance in section 1 would not be materially affected.
4.3.7 The Committee considered PCI with a DES for more than 1 target vessel in a
person with symptomatic coronary disease. It was aware that the evidence from
the RCTs relates to the use of DES in single-vessel disease. However, the experts
indicated that treatment of more than 1 vessel in an individual patient during PCI
might be required. This is because, despite additional investigations, it is
frequently difficult to determine which of several vessels identified at
angiography is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The Committee
considered that the risk of a need for future intervention following an initial PCI is
likely to be dependent on the degree of stenosis of any of the affected vessels.
The appropriateness of a DES or BMS for each diseased artery in turn would
therefore depend on considering the artery's characteristics in isolation from
those of other diseased arteries. It was therefore persuaded that planned
treatment of more than 1 vessel in a single patient should be based on the
requirements laid out in the guidance for a single vessel.
4.3.8 The Committee discussed the use of DES with regard to coronary artery vein
grafts and for more complex situations such as bifurcation lesions, but noted that
there was no robust evidence in this area at present.
4.3.9 The Committee noted statements from some manufacturers that restenosis rates

conditions#notice-of-rights). 32

Guidance on the use of coronary artery stents (TA71)
using a BMS of recent design were low compared with those of other BMS, and
were comparable with those of the CE-marked DES. The cost-effectiveness
calculations were not based on evidence comparing these stents with other BMS
or with DES in head-to-head trials. The Committee considered that this evidence
was not sufficient to affect its recommendations in section 1. It would, however,
wish to include further evidence on new developments in BMS design as part of
the next review of the use of coronary stents.
PCI with BMS versus CABG
4.3.10 Having reviewed the Assessment Group's model and the submissions from
manufacturers, together with the views of cardiologist consultees, the Committee
concluded that the guidance offered in 2000 should be maintained. While it was
clear that models with outcomes up to 2 years favoured stents in terms of cost
effectiveness, the conclusions to be drawn from longer-term models depended
critically on whether a survival advantage accrues to CABG. The Committee
concluded that no convincing case had been made on this matter. Its
considerations ranged over what may happen to patients requiring 1 or other of
these procedures in different age ranges, and whether the conclusions about the
most appropriate procedure would be the same for younger patients (who are
more likely to need a repeat procedure) as for older ones. In none of the cases
considered was there sufficient evidence of effect to be able to reach any
conclusion.

5 Recommendations for further research
5.1 Ongoing trials for paclitaxel-eluting stents include TAXUS I (follow-up of a small
initial study of slow-release formulation versus BMS in patients with either
previously untreated lesions or restenosis), TAXUS II (follow-up of a larger study
of both slow- and moderate-release formulations versus BMS in patients with
previously untreated lesions), TAXUS IV (a large trial of slow-release formulation
versus BMS stratified by presence or absence of diabetes and by vessel
diameter), TAXUS V (focussing on small vessels, long lesions, bifurcations and in-
stent restenosis) and TAXUS VI (moderate release for long lesions). For sirolimus-
eluting stents, ongoing trials include RAVEL (small-diameter vessels), SIRIUS
(high risk for cardiovascular disease progression and restenosis due to the
diabetes, exposure to multiple stent implantation and use of overlapping stents)
and E-SIRIUS (previously untreated single vessels of diameter 2.5 to 3 mm and
for lesions between 15 and 32 mm in length); and FUTURE (previously untreated
vessels between 2.75 and 4 mm, less than 28 mm long) for everolimus-eluting
stents. REALITY, a head-to-head trial of the Cypher sirolimus DES and Taxus
paclitaxel DES, is under way.
5.2 Until now, trials have been restricted to single-artery studies for the sake of
simplicity and ease of interpretation. Extrapolation of results to more than 1 artery
critically depends on untested assumptions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
of the use of DES in more than 1 artery concurrently are therefore required, in
order to confirm or refute the appropriateness of the extrapolations used in the
modelling.
5.3 To compare long-term outcomes, particularly with respect to stents against
CABG, much longer trial follow-ups are required.
5.4 New BMS designs should be tested against current BMS and DES designs.
5.5 Head-to-head RCTs of those DES that have been CE marked and have been
shown to be clinically superior to the corresponding BMS are required.
5.6 Studies to determine whether diabetes is a risk factor for increased rate of
restenosis following PCI, independent of lesion length and artery calibre, are

6 Implications for the NHS
6.1 The financial impact of using DES depends on the proportion of stented arteries
that are narrow or contain long lesions offset against the increased capacity of
the system resulting from a decrease in procedures to manage restenosis.
Although the total number of arteries requiring a DES in the UK is unknown, it
could be as high as one-third of all stents. Based on this proportion, the
additional cost of DES without offsets would be between £6 and £7.2 million per
year, assuming the use of about 12,000 DES stents costing an additional £500 to
£600 each.
6.2 If the use of drug-eluting stents reduced the restenosis rate by about 10
percentage points, then the additional capacity generated could be used to
increase the number of new stent procedures. This would have the effect of
offsetting the cost of the BMS by about £4 million per year. Such cost savings,
however, will often only be realised in the form of additional capacity.

7 Implementation and audit
7.1 Clinicians carrying out PCIs should review their current practice and policies to
take account of the guidance set out in section 1.
7.2 Local guidelines, protocols or care pathways that refer to PCIs and/or stents
should incorporate the guidance.
7.3 To measure compliance locally with the guidance, the following criteria could be
used. Further details on suggestions for audit are presented in appendix C.
7.4 Stents are used routinely in PCIs carried out in patients with stable or unstable
angina or acute MI.
7.5 A Cypher or a Taxus stent is used in PCI for people with symptomatic CAD in
whom the target artery is less than 3 mm in calibre or in which the lesion to be
stented is longer than 15 mm, except if an individual has had an MI in the
preceding 24 hours or has angiographic evidence of thrombus in the target
artery. If more than 1 artery is to have a stent inserted, the same considerations
apply to each artery.
7.6 Local clinical audits on the care of patients with CAD also could include
measurement of compliance with national standards, including standards in the
National Service Framework for coronary heart disease.

Appendix C Detail on criteria for audit of
the use of coronary artery stents
Possible objectives for an audit
An audit could be carried out to ensure that stents are being used appropriately in patients
undergoing PCIs. Local clinical audits could also confirm that PCI is the clinically
appropriate procedure for patients included in the audit.
Possible patients to be included in the audit
An audit could include all patients having a PCI for stable or unstable angina, acute MI or
symptomatic CAD in a suitable time period, for example, 3 months.
Measures that could be used as a basis for audit
