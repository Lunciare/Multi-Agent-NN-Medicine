intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
This guidance replaces MTG10.
1 Recommendations
1.1 The case for adopting the Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield
Technology in the NHS is supported by the current evidence when it is used in
patients with complex giant or large intracranial aneurysms which are unsuitable
for surgery and being considered for stenting, and where large numbers of coils
would be needed during stent-assisted coiling.
1.2 The Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology is estimated to be
cost saving when compared with stent-assisted coiling, in patients with complex
giant or large intracranial aneurysms when the number of Pipeline embolisation
devices inserted does not exceed 2, and when treatment would otherwise require
the use of 34 or more coils combined with 1 stent for stent-assisted coiling. If 2
Pipeline embolisation devices are used the total procedure cost is estimated as
£37,625 compared with £38,320 for the use of 34 coils for stent-assisted coiling
(a saving of £695 using Pipeline embolisation device). [2019]
1.3 Clinicians should submit details of all patients being treated with the Pipeline Flex
embolisation device with Shield Technology to the UK Neurointerventional
Radiology Group audit database, to increase the evidence base and guide future
use of this technology.

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
2 The technology
Description of the technology
2.1 The Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology ('Pipeline';
Medtronic) is a self-expanding blood flow diverter that is placed across the neck
of an intracranial aneurysm. While blood flow through the parent vessel is
maintained via the device, flow within the aneurysm sac is disrupted, leading to
stagnation and eventual thrombosis formation. Pipeline provides a scaffold for
endothelial growth leading to the formation of a biological seal and exclusion of
the aneurysm from the circulation. [2019]
2.2 Pipeline is a braided, cobalt chromium and platinum stent-like device which is
loaded into and delivered via a microcatheter. It is manufactured in lengths of
10 mm to 35 mm and is available in different diameters from 2.5 mm to 5 mm (in
0.25 mm increments). Multiple devices can be used within each other and/or in
sequence to increase the overall length of the construct or to increase the metal
surface coverage within an aneurysm.
2.3 Pipeline is indicated for use in patients with unruptured, complex intracranial
aneurysms, specifically large and giant, wide-necked and fusiform aneurysms.
This is the group of patients covered by this guidance. Pipeline may also be used
in patients whose aneurysms are unsuitable for standard coiling and/or stenting
and for neurosurgical treatment; and in patients for whom previous coiling/
clipping procedures have failed.
2.4 The cost of Pipeline stated in the sponsor's submission is £10,171. These costs
have been updated in the latest revision of the cost model to £10,450. [2019]
2.5 The claimed benefits of Pipeline in the case for adoption presented by the
sponsor are:
• A higher rate of complete, permanent occlusion of large/giant intracranial
aneurysms compared with coiling and stent-assisted coiling, leading to
reduced rates of retreatment and a decreased risk of haemorrhage.

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
• Increased access to treatment for patients with complex intracranial
aneurysms. Pipeline offers a new option for treating patients with complex
intracranial aneurysms which are not suitable for stent-assisted coiling or
surgery, and patients for whom previous interventions have failed.
• Patients may experience a resolution of neurological symptoms as a result of
relieving pressure on surrounding areas of the brain caused by the mass
effect of aneurysms.
• Increased long-term vessel patency, preserving blood flow to distal tissues
supplied by the aneurysmal artery.
• The high rate of complete, permanent occlusion of the target aneurysm with
the possibility of reduced need for retreatment and an overall decrease in use
of NHS resources.
Current management
2.6 Current options for managing complex intracranial aneurysms include coiling,
often with concomitant use of stent placement (stent-assisted coiling),
neurosurgical clipping requiring craniotomy (with or without bypass procedures),
parent vessel occlusion (by open neurosurgery or by endovascular means) and
conservative management.

3 Clinical evidence
Summary of clinical evidence
3.1 Full details of all clinical outcomes considered by the committee are available in
the assessment report overview.
3.2 The key clinical outcomes for Pipeline presented in the decision problem are:
• successful device deployment
• successful occlusion of the aneurysm, with or without preservation of flow
through the parent vessel
• size of the aneurysm and its contained thrombus mass
• resolution of symptoms (including headache, diplopia, nystagmus or other
neurological dysfunction), relief of pain and quality of life outcomes
• resource use outcomes (for example, re-admission rates, repeat
interventions and duration of hospital stay)
• stroke related to device insertion (any cause, but particularly due to vessel
occlusion or bleeding)
• delayed parent vessel occlusion
• subarachnoid haemorrhage and/or other major bleeding events needing
admission to hospital
• neurovascular death
• device-related adverse events.
3.3 The sponsor identified 13 studies relevant to the scope, but because it judged
the quality of many of these to be poor and because of duplication in patient
reporting, the sponsor's submission presented detailed findings on a total of
139 patients from 2 studies, with a maximum follow-up of 2 years. The studies

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
were Pipeline for Intracranial Treatment of Aneurysms (PITA) and Pipeline for
Uncoilable or Failed aneurysms (PUFS).
3.4 Nelson et al. (2011) reported outcomes up to 2 years for the PITA study: a
prospective, multicentre single-arm feasibility study of 31 patients with 31
intracranial aneurysms that were small (under 10 mm [20 patients]), large (10 mm
to 25 mm [9 patients]) or giant (over 25 mm [2 patients]). An aneurysm neck
width of 4 mm or more was recorded in 22 patients (71%). In 12 patients (39%),
other interventions for the target aneurysm had failed.
3.5 A report to the FDA by the sponsor (FDA 2011) described the clinical evidence at
1 year from the PUFS study: an ongoing prospective, multicentre, single-arm
study of 108 patients with 110 intracranial aneurysms that were small (under
10 mm [1 patient]), large (10 mm to 25 mm [85 patients]) or giant (over 25 mm
[22 patients]). The mean aneurysm neck width was 8.8 mm. In 8 patients (7%),
other interventions for the target aneurysm had failed.
3.6 In its literature search, the external assessment centre found 3 case reports and 1
conference abstract of 96 patients in addition to the 13 studies identified by the
sponsor. It excluded 1 of the studies identified by the sponsor (Matouk et al.
2010) because it was outside the scope. The external assessment centre
therefore included a total of 16 studies with 380 patients in its assessment
report.
3.7 Across 13 studies with a total of 237 patients (239 complex intracranial
aneurysms), successful device placement was reported in 50% to 100% of
patients. In 8 of the 13 studies, successful device placement was reported in all
patients (25 in total; Fiorella et al. 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Hartmann et al.
2010; Kilsch et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2010; Sararols et al. 2011).
3.8 Nelson et al. (2011) reported clinical procedure success (defined as successful
placement of the device without death or ipsilateral stroke) in 94% (29 of 31) of
patients: the 2 failures were because of peri-procedural stroke. For patients in the
PUFS study, the primary effectiveness end point was complete occlusion of the
aneurysm and absence of parent vessel stenosis greater than 50% at 180 days.
The probability of exceeding the pre-determined 'success threshold' of 50% was
statistically significant (p<0.0001; FDA, 2011).

3.9 Major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death, as judged by the Clinical Events
Committee, was reported in 6% (6 of 107) of patients at 180 days in the PUFS
study (FDA 2011). Ipsilateral stroke was reported in 7% (2 of 31) of patients within
30 days in the PITA study (Nelson et al. 2011). Five other studies including a total
of 58 patients (68 complex intracranial aneurysms) reported a stroke rate of 0%
at follow-up ranging from 10 weeks to more than 52 weeks (Fiorella et al. 2009a,
2009b; Lylyk et al. 2009a; Klisch et al. 2011; Sararols et al. 2011).
3.10 In the PUFS study, 3 of the 6 patients who had a major ipsilateral stroke died
(timing of events not reported). Nelson et al. (2011) reported no deaths in the
PITA study.
3.11 Nelson et al. (2011) reported complete occlusion of the target aneurysm in 93%
(28 of 30) of patients at 180 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 77.9 to 99.2); it
was not possible to assess occlusion in 1 patient who had Pipeline surgically
removed and the parent vessel ligated. All patients who had complete occlusion
at 180 days also had complete occlusion at 2 years as assessed by either
catheter angiography or MRI.
3.12 Complete occlusion without major stenosis was reported in 74% (78 of 106) of
aneurysms at 180 days and 71% (75 of 106) of aneurysms at 1-year angiography
(FDA 2011). Eight studies with a total of 131 patients all reported occlusion rates
of 100% in patients assessed at follow-up ranging from 3 to 30 months
(Fiorella et al. 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Klisch et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2010;
Sararols et al. 2011; Szikora et al. 2010b). Occlusion rates of 93%, 89% and 69%
were reported by Lylyk et al. (2009a), Szikora et al. (2010a) and O'Kelly et al.
(2011) respectively (absolute figures not reported).
3.13 Nelson et al. (2011) reported that 10% (3 of 31) of patients, 1 of whom had
previously had a stroke, showed improvement in intracranial aneurysm-related
symptoms at 30 days. There was no deterioration in neurological status at
30 days in the 28 patients free of stroke. The FDA report (2011) described Rankin
scoring (a general measure of neurological function) for 104 patients. The scores
improved from baseline in 20% (21 of 104) of patients, remained unchanged in
67% (70 of 104) and deteriorated in 10% (10 of 104) at 180 days follow-up. There
was an improvement in visual field sensitivity (not otherwise described) from
baseline in 21% (19 of 89) of patients, no change in 73% (65 of 89) of patients

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
and deterioration in eye function in 6% (5 of 89) of patients at follow-up of
180 days (FDA 2011). Three case reports described complete resolution of
symptoms at follow-up ranging from 10 to 26 weeks (Fiorella et al. 2009a, 2009b;
Sararols et al. 2011). Szikora et al. (2010b) reported resolution of symptoms in
61% of patients at a mean follow-up of 26 weeks.
3.14 Studies of 96, 18, 8 and 5 patients reported subarachnoid haemorrhage after
surgery in 1%, 5%, 13% and 20% of patients respectively (absolute figures and
follow-up not reported; Hampton et al. 2011; Hartmann et al. 2010; O'Kelly et al.
2011, Szikora et al. 2010b).
Committee considerations
3.15 The committee was advised by the experts that Pipeline is currently considered
in some specialist units for patients who have symptoms caused by the mass
effect of aneurysms, or a high risk of future bleeding, who are considered fit for
general anaesthesia and who have an average life expectancy of at least 1 year.
3.16 The committee noted that Pipeline may be the only possible intervention for
some patients who have symptoms caused by the mass effect of aneurysms, or a
high risk of future bleeding, whose aneurysms are unsuitable for either stent-
assisted coiling or surgical treatment and for whom parent vessel occlusion would
result in stroke or death.
3.17 The committee considered that data from the studies described above provided
evidence for the efficacy of Pipeline in most patients. In the context of the high
risks posed to patients by untreated complex large or giant aneurysms the safety
profile was judged to be acceptable.
3.18 The committee noted that the effect of the device on symptoms or on the risk of
bleeding is subject to some delay.
3.19 The committee recognised that patient selection for treatment either by Pipeline
or by comparator interventions is complex, and needs to be carried out by an
experienced multidisciplinary team.

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
3.20 The committee noted that most of the clinical evidence came from the United
States, where patient selection for different types of endovascular interventions
may differ from the UK, in terms of the treatments selected for intracranial
aneurysms based on their size and shape.
3.21 The committee noted that the clinical evidence comparing the efficacy of Pipeline
with other interventions was very limited. This made evaluation difficult. The
committee recognised the difficulties in conducting comparative studies,
particularly randomised controlled trials, for large and giant complex intracranial
aneurysms.
3.22 The committee noted that both new studies and an extension of the PUFS study
are in progress.
3.23 The committee considered that data collection using a register would be an
important practical way of developing evidence to guide future practice, in
addition to the ongoing studies.

4 NHS considerations
System impact
4.1 No secondary treatments were required at 1-year follow-up among patients in the
PUFS study (FDA 2011). Need for retreatment was not reported in the PITA study
(Nelson et al. 2011). Need for retreatment was not reported in the other 14
studies included in the external assessment centre's assessment report.
Committee considerations
4.2 The committee noted that little evidence was available on the need for
retreatment following treatment with Pipeline.
4.3 The committee recognised that there are a small number of patients for whom
Pipeline offers the only possible means of treatment (an estimated 60 patients
per year in the UK). For these patients the potential benefits offered by Pipeline
are important, because they are at high risk of aneurysm rupture and because
their intracranial aneurysms are unsuitable for other treatments.

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
5 Cost considerations
Cost evidence
5.1 The sponsor submitted a de novo cost analysis for Pipeline for the treatment of
complex intracranial aneurysms. Full details of all cost evidence and modelling
considered by the committee are available in the assessment report overview.
5.2 The sponsor presented a decision tree (for the peri-procedural period) followed
by a Markov model (for long-term outcomes) to estimate the costs and
consequences associated with Pipeline against 5 comparator interventions:
stent-assisted coiling, neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent vessel
occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion and conservative management.
The patient population included those with unruptured large or giant intracranial
aneurysms as outlined in the scope, but did not include fusiform or wide-necked
aneurysms.
5.3 The decision-tree structure separated patients who had survived initial
treatment, based on a mortality rate for the procedure, into 1 of 3 occlusion
categories (complete occlusion, residual neck and residual aneurysm). For each
occlusion category, patients were tracked through 5 possible health states: 'no
complications', 'new non-fatal rupture', 'post rupture', 'fatal rupture' and 'dead (all
cause)'. It was assumed that transition probabilities for the health states would be
constant over time. The time horizon of the base-case analysis was 10 years.
5.4 An NHS and personal social services perspective was used. The cost analysis
included the costs associated with the duration of the procedure, staff time
(surgeon, radiologist, nurse, anaesthetist), hospital costs (neurology operating or
neurosurgical operating room, and recovery ward), imaging (angiography,
fluoroscopy or MRI), consumables, drugs; and for conservative management only,
long-term monitoring with annual MRI. The cost associated with stroke was
assumed to be representative of the cost of rupture. Costs applied to each type
of retreatment were assumed to be the same as the full cost if that treatment had
been used initially.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 27

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
5.5 The costs and consequences associated with adverse events were not included
in the base-case analysis because the sponsor considered there to be
insufficient reliable data for each treatment group. However, the sponsor did
include costs associated with mortality at 31 days, rupture and retreatment.
5.6 In the base case the number of Pipeline embolisation devices used was 1.46,
based on data submitted to the sponsor from use of the device in UK hospitals up
to August 2011. The number of coils used in the base case was 40 and was
derived from an estimate in an editorial review by Wehman in 2006. It was
assumed that 1 stent would be needed for each stent-assisted coiling
intervention.
5.7 The base case presented the total procedure costs over the 10-year time horizon
associated with Pipeline as £24,341. For the comparators, the total procedure
costs were £37,451 for stent-assisted coiling, £11,658 for neurosurgical clipping,
£16,893 for endovascular parent vessel occlusion, £11,654 for neurosurgical
parent vessel occlusion and £10,352 for conservative management. The only
intervention against which Pipeline was shown to be cost saving was stent-
assisted coiling, with a cost saving of £13,110 per patient.
5.8 Two scenario analyses were presented. One included costs associated with the
adverse events of subarachnoid haemorrhage related to the aneurysm,
thromboembolic stroke and intracranial haemorrhagic stroke remote from the
aneurysm using data from the PUFS study and data from Darsault et al. (2001) for
the comparators. The other scenario analysis restricted the time horizon to
6 months (short-term). Conservative management was excluded from the short-
term scenario because it does not have a 'peri-procedural' mortality rate.
5.9 In both scenario analyses Pipeline was shown to be cost saving only when
compared with stent-assisted coiling. When costs associated with adverse
events were included in the model, Pipeline remained a cost-saving intervention
compared with stent-assisted coiling, with an associated saving of £13,327. When
outcomes were restricted to the short term (6 months), Pipeline remained cost
saving compared with stent-assisted coiling (£10,316).
5.10 Sensitivity analyses carried out by the sponsor showed that the main factors
influencing the cost analysis were the number and cost of consumables, in

conditions#notice-of-rights). 27
--- Страница 15 ---
Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
particular the numbers of Pipeline embolisation devices and endovascular coils.
The sponsor carried out sensitivity analysis for the use of 1 to 3 Pipeline
embolisation devices and separately for 5 to 100 coils.
5.11 The number of Pipeline embolisation devices used in the base case was 1.46 per
patient. On receipt of more data from UK hospitals, the sponsor submitted a
revised number of 1.658 in October 2011. The external assessment centre
reviewed the data and concluded that when 1.658 Pipeline embolisation devices
were used, Pipeline was more costly compared with stent-assisted coiling if 22
coils were used (an estimated cost increase of £19), but cost saving when 23
coils were used. The cost saving when using 1.658 Pipeline embolisation devices
compared with stent-assisted coiling with 23 coils was estimated to be £588
(total procedure costs of £26,546 and £27,134 respectively). When 2 Pipeline
embolisation devices were used, Pipeline was more costly by an estimated £185
than stent-assisted coiling using 28 coils, but was less costly than stent-assisted
coiling when 29 coils were used. The cost saving when using 2 Pipeline
embolisation devices compared with stent-assisted coiling with 29 coils was
estimated to be £421 (total procedure costs of £30,354 and £30,775
respectively).
5.12 During consultation, expert advisers expressed doubts about 5 parameters in the
cost model: the cost of microcatheters; the use of a balloon in stent-assisted
coiling; drug costs; the procedure duration; and the cost of additional
endovascular equipment. Additional exploratory analyses were carried out by the
external assessment centre to examine the impact of changing these parameters,
in ways which the expert advisers suggested were more appropriate.
5.13 In the sponsor's economic model, the cost of microcatheters used in stent-
assisted coiling was comparable to the cost of a Marksman catheter (£1,030)
used to insert Pipeline. However, the expert advisers stated that cheaper
microcatheters (average cost £460.50) would be used for stent-assisted coiling
than for Pipeline in UK practice. The external assessment centre's exploratory
analyses demonstrated that reducing the cost of 2 microcatheters for stent-
assisted coiling from £1,030 to £460.50 reduced the total procedure cost for
stent-assisted coiling from £37,451 to £36,137.
5.14 The sponsor's economic modelling also assumed that a balloon is used in 50% of

conditions#notice-of-rights). 27
--- Страница 16 ---

intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
stent-assisted coiling procedures and is not used to insert Pipeline. However, the
expert advisers stated that use of a balloon is relatively uncommon in the UK for
stent-assisted coiling procedures. In the exploratory analyses carried out by the
external assessment centre, removing the cost of a balloon reduced the total
procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £36,137 to £35,725, while the total
procedure cost for Pipeline (with 2 devices) remained at £30,354.
5.15 The sponsor's economic model assumed different drug use for patients having
stent-assisted coiling and those having Pipeline (18,000 mg aspirin and 6,750 mg
clopidogrel compared with 25,000 mg aspirin and 13,500 mg clopidogrel
respectively). The expert advisers stated that in clinical practice drug use in the 2
groups is likely to be equal. The external assessment centre noted that in the
sponsor's economic model drug use was calculated from 2 non-comparative
studies, but that few published data are available on clinical use. The external
assessment centre stated that the low cost of these drugs means that relatively
small differences in drug use are unlikely to have a significant impact on the
overall procedure costs for stent-assisted coiling and Pipeline. In the absence of
a systematic review the external assessment centre stated that the drug costs
used in the model were appropriate.
5.16 In its exploratory analysis the external assessment centre identified 2 calculation
errors in the sponsor's economic model, both relating to the number of days of
drug therapy. The external assessment centre stated that correcting these
calculation errors made only a very small difference in the total procedure costs
for both Pipeline and stent-assisted coiling, reducing them from £30,354 to
£30,346 and £35,725 to £35,724 respectively.
5.17 In the sponsor's economic model, the average duration of the procedure (in
hours) and therefore the use of additional endovascular equipment were different
for stent-assisted coiling and insertion of Pipeline. The expert advisers stated
that the procedures are likely to take the same amount of time in clinical practice.
The external assessment centre noted that the time taken for stent-assisted
coiling was derived from 1 non-comparative study and the time for inserting
Pipeline from another. However the external assessment centre was not able to
judge which study was the best source for duration of procedure and no
systematic review was carried out. The external assessment centre stated that
because both studies were appropriately and accurately used in the model no

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
changes were justified with regard to procedure time for stent-assisted coiling or
Pipeline. The external assessment centre also noted that the sponsor included
the use of additional endovascular equipment in the model based on the duration
of procedure, but provided no justification for why it was included only for stent-
assisted coiling and not for Pipeline or the other comparators. Furthermore, there
was no justification for why the cost of additional equipment was only included in
calculating the retreatment cost but not the cost of the initial procedure. The
exploratory analyses demonstrated that removing the costs of additional
endovascular equipment from the model reduced the total procedure cost of
stent-assisted coiling from £35,724 to £35,693 while the total procedure cost for
Pipeline remained at £30,346.
Committee considerations
5.18 The committee considered the cost consequences of using Pipeline against 5
comparators – stent-assisted coiling, neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent
vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion and conservative
management.
5.19 The committee noted that in UK clinical practice, patients who might currently be
considered for Pipeline would be those for whom surgery would not be possible
and for whom stent-assisted coiling would be the only other potential
intervention. It therefore considered that comparison of costs with those for
stent-assisted coiling was of particular relevance. The committee noted that for
this cost comparison, the main drivers of cost were the numbers of Pipeline
embolisation devices used and the numbers of coils used during stent-assisted
coiling. The committee was given advice from the experts about whether 1 or 2
Pipeline embolisation devices should be used as the most typical number on
which to base its judgements about cost. It therefore considered the cost
modelling for a range of scenarios – with different numbers of Pipeline
embolisation devices. During its discussions the committee was informed both by
expert advisers and by data from the sponsor that 2 Pipeline embolisation
devices were likely to be needed for most patients treated in the UK for complex
giant or large aneurysms.
5.20 There was considerable uncertainty about the number of coils likely to be used

conditions#notice-of-rights). 27

Pipeline Flex embolisation device with Shield Technology for the treatment of complex
intracranial aneurysms (HTG287)
during stent-assisted coiling. The committee was advised that 40 coils was
probably an overestimate of the number needed for most complex aneurysms
and there were suggestions that about 25 to 30 coils might be more typical of the
number needed for aneurysms being considered for treatment using Pipeline. The
committee recognised that it is not possible to estimate accurately the number of
coils which will be required to treat an aneurysm during stent-assisted coiling, but
it was advised by experts that the number can usually be predicted with an
accuracy of plus or minus 6 coils.
5.21 The committee discussed a number of parameters in the sponsor's economic
model based on comments received during public consultation. As described in
sections 5.12 to 5.17, these included: the cost of microcatheters used for stent-
assisted coiling; balloon use in UK practice during stent-assisted coiling; drug
costs for patients having Pipeline and those having stent-assisted coiling; the
duration of the procedure and the use of additional endovascular equipment in
stent-assisted coiling. These parameters were examined in additional analyses by
the external assessment centre.
5.22 The committee considered that the costs for microcatheters used for stent-
assisted coiling in the sponsor's base-case analysis were overestimated. It
agreed with the views of the expert advisers that it was reasonable to use the
average cost of the microcatheters most commonly used in UK clinical practice.
This reduced the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £37,451 to
£36,137.
5.23 Based on expert advice, the committee accepted that the inclusion of balloon use
during stent-assisted coiling in the sponsor's base-case analysis was
inappropriate and that it was reasonable to adjust this cost to zero. This reduced
the total procedure cost for stent-assisted coiling from £36,137 to £35,725, while
the total procedure cost for Pipeline remained at £30,354.
5.24 The committee considered the drug costs presented in the sponsor's base-case
analysis. It noted the external assessment centre's view that few published data
are available on clinical use and that the low cost of these drugs and the
difference in drug use would not be likely to have any significant impact on the
overall procedure costs for either stent-assisted coiling or Pipeline. The
committee agreed that the drug cost in the sponsor's base-case analysis was

appropriate
5.25 The committee considered the average duration of the procedure presented in
the sponsor's base-case analysis. It noted the external assessment centre's view
that both studies were appropriately and accurately used in the model and that
therefore no changes were justified for the average duration of the procedure for
stent-assisted coiling or inserting Pipeline. The committee agreed that the
average duration of the procedure presented in the sponsor's base-case analysis
was appropriate.
5.26 The committee was advised by the experts that it was not appropriate to include
the cost for additional endovascular equipment for stent-assisted coiling only.
This was because the cost of endovascular equipment was likely to be the same
for Pipeline compared with stent-assisted coiling. The committee accepted the
views of the expert advisers that removing this cost from the model for stent-
assisted coiling was appropriate. This reduced the total procedure cost for stent-
assisted coiling from £35,724 (this cost takes account of the drug cost
calculation errors referred to in section 5.16) to £35,693 while the total procedure
cost for Pipeline remained at £30,346.
5.27 With these issues in mind, the committee considered a graph showing the costs
of Pipeline and of stent-assisted coiling using different numbers of Pipeline
embolisation devices and coils. This indicated that the total cost of treatment
using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices is greater than that of stent-assisted coiling
(using 1 stent) if 31 coils or fewer are used, but Pipeline is less costly if 32 or
more coils are needed. The cost saving associated with Pipeline compared with
stent-assisted coiling with 32 coils was estimated to be £492 (total costs of
£30,346 and £30,838 respectively).
5.28 The committee noted that using 2 Pipeline embolisation devices would incur a
higher total treatment cost than neurosurgical clipping, endovascular parent
vessel occlusion, neurosurgical parent vessel occlusion or conservative
management for patients in whom those other options were feasible.
5.29 For the guidance review, the external assessment centre revised the model to
reflect updated costs. The main parameter changes were costs associated with
staff, hospital imaging equipment, drugs, rupture and adverse event costs.

6 Conclusions
6.1 The committee concluded that current evidence supports the case for adoption
of Pipeline when it is used in highly selected patients with complex giant or large
intracranial aneurysms which are unsuitable for surgery and being considered for
stenting, when the number of Pipeline embolisation devices does not exceed 2
and when 32 or more coils and 1 stent would be needed during stent-assisted
coiling. For these patients use of Pipeline appears efficacious and is less costly
than stent-assisted coiling.
6.2 The committee noted that standard management of intracranial aneurysms varies
according to the size and type of aneurysm and the symptoms the patient
experiences. This may include conservative management, for example, in patients
whose complex giant or large intracranial aneurysms are unsuitable in size or
shape for stent-assisted coiling or surgery, and for whom parent vessel occlusion
would result in stroke or death. The recommendations in section 1 of the
guidance are based on circumstances in which Pipeline releases resources, and
were not framed on the basis of treating patients for whom there is no other
viable option apart from conservative management. The committee saw little
evidence in this patient group and this area of unmet clinical need would benefit
from further research.
