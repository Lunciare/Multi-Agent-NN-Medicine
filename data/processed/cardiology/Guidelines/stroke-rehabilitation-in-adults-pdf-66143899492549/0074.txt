that could reduce mortality, chest infections and improve oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD). Based on this limited amount of evidence and the committee's expert opinion, they agreed that 1 or more of these adaptations could be used to support safe swallowing. They also highlighted that, where needed, the use of oral medication should be reviewed and the formulation or route of administration could be changed so the person can continue with the medication. The committee noted that behavioural exercises and physical stimulation are effective in reducing mortality, chest infections and aspiration caused by OPD, and can help people to return to a normal diet. There was a substantial amount of evidence to support the use of behavioural exercises, but only a limited amount of evidence to support using physical stimulation.
