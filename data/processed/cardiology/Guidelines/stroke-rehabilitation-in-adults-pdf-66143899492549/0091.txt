was no cost effectiveness evidence and insufficient clinical evidence to recommend botulinum toxin A for spasticity of the lower limb. Only 1 published health economic analysis included a lower limb indication, but this only compared Botox and Dysport and therefore did not explore whether botulinum toxin A was cost effective compared to no treatment. Given the lack of high-quality economic evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of Botox, Dysport and Xeomin with each other and to usual care for focal spasticity, including in the lower limb. The committee looked at 3 forms of electrical stimulation therapy for focal spasticity: functional electrical stimulation (FES), NMES and transcutaneous electrical stimulations (TENS). All were found to reduce spasticity and improve the ability to use the affected limb when compared to usual care. NMES and TENS also showed benefits in comparison to sham or placebo treatment. However, improvements seen in the studies were modest and the benefits of these treatments were only reported during time periods of less than 6 months. There was insufficient data to recommend 1 treatment over another. The 3 treatments are currently available in the NHS and TENS is widely used
