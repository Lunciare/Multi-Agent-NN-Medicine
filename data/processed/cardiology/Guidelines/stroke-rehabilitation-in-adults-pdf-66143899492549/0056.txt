impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice or services. Transfer of care from hospital to community, including early supported discharge Recommendations 1.1.8 and 1.1.11 Why the committee made the recommendations Qualitative evidence showed that rehabilitation support after hospital is sometimes withdrawn after a set period, even when the person feels this is too early and that they need more rehabilitation. The committee recognised this can make some feel abandoned but also that therapists' time is limited and must be used effectively. Weighing up these factors, the committee agreed that care and rehabilitation should be continued after hospital as long as they help people meet their rehabilitation goals. This will ensure therapy is not withdrawn too soon for those who still need it. The 2013 guideline recommended early supported discharge for some people. For the 2023 update, the committee looked at new evidence which found the process: • had the clinically important benefit of reducing physical dependency (the need for support with activities at home such as transfers, mobility and washing) as well as length of hospital stay • either improved, or had no negative impact on, health-related quality of life
