people could walk faster and found it easier to complete daily tasks after attending group circuit training. Adverse events were noted in groups taking part in training with an educational element, but the committee noted that the events were unlikely to be related to the circuit training itself. Overall, the training was found to have potential benefits and there was no convincing evidence of it causing any harm. There was some inconsistency in results (which is probably because of the variation in programme content). Therefore, the committee agreed it could be considered as an option for some people if it included educational and peer support elements, rather than something offered to anyone able to walk with or without assistance after stroke. How the recommendation might affect practice There is variation in the availability of group circuit training across current practice, so additional resources (including staff training costs) may be needed to introduce it in some areas. The committee agreed that circuit training can be delivered by band 4 or 5 physiotherapists, as well as physiotherapy assistants, so would be unlikely to incur large additional costs. The educational requirement for this training may also impact on resources. Return to recommendation Mirror
