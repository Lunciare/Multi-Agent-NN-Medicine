Hearing assessments after stroke are not standardised and often do not include the use of a questionnaire, so this may lead to a change in practice. It is also possible that there will be an increase in audiology referrals.

There are different protocols available for this but the evidence did not compare these, so the committee did not specify which should be used. The type and frequency of mouth care varied across studies, but they all showed reductions in mortality in people who received a standardised oral hygiene regimen compared with those who received usual care. Some studies also found mouth care interventions reduced cases of pneumonia, gingivitis and oral infections. The evidence on frequency of mouth care was less clear although most studies used a twice-daily mouth care regimen, which
