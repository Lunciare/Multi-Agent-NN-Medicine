Stroke rehabilitation in adults

Modern stroke care starts immediately after the onset of stroke symptoms. Most acute care is delivered within stroke units as part of organised stroke services. Post-acute care can be delivered in secondary or primary care, often by teams working across different NHS trusts or other organisations. Within such services, specialist multidisciplinary teams of appropriately skilled professionals work together to deliver goal-directed rehabilitation with the aim of helping people to relearn any skills they may have lost, improve their quality of life and enable them to live as independently as possible.
