However, the committee were not convinced that the clinical benefits of using such devices outweighed those achieved by physiotherapy of similar intensity. The evidence also found robot-assisted arm training did not improve arm function or the ability to complete daily activities – improvements the committee agreed would be more important to people after stroke. The studies did not reveal any other benefits to using these devices, for example, in improving measures of quality of life or activities of daily living, or in the incidence of spasticity.
