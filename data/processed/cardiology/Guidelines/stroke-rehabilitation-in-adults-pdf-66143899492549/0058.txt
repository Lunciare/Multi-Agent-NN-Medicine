the person by providing new challenges. They found it made no difference to the intensity of the therapy on offer (when delivered appropriately). In light of all the evidence in favour of early supported discharge, the committee agreed to retain the 2013 recommendations. The committee also noted that the way early supported discharge is offered and organised can still vary between settings. The evidence also found that the level of coordination between services can affect outcomes. Better coordination between all services involved in the care of people after stroke led to reduced mortality and levels of physical dependency, when compared to usual care. Services that did not coordinate as well reported higher rates of mortality and no reduced levels of physical dependency, when compared to usual care. The qualitative evidence reviewed in the study also highlighted some factors that could improve coordination of care (such as having a dedicated care coordinator assigned to the individual), as well as factors that may encourage the use of early supported discharge. Many of these were already captured in the 2013 guideline but some important ones were not, so the committee agreed to list these factors in a new recommendation. How the recommendations might
