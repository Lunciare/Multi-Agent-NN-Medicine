The use of taping, NMES, intra-articular corticosteroid injections and nerve blocks helped reduce pain and led to improvements in shoulder function. The committee therefore agreed to include these as potential treatment options. How the recommendations might affect practice All the recommended interventions for shoulder pain, except NMES, are widely used in the NHS. NMES is just 1 of several treatment options and is unlikely to be needed by many people. The recommendations are therefore unlikely to lead to a major change in practice. Return to recommendations Spasticity Recommendations 1.15.1 to 1.15.8 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee agreed it was important to differentiate between generalised and focal spasticity (which affects a particular limb or part of a limb) because focal spasticity is more likely to improve with treatment aimed at a specific area of the body. Most of the available evidence was on focal spasticity, particularly of the upper limb. Spasticity can
