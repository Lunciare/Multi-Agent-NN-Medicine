recommendation Self-management interventions Why the committee made no recommendations The committee did not make any recommendations for self-management interventions, which focus on empowering the person after stroke to manage their own symptoms (for example through components like problem-solving, goal-setting, decision-making, self- monitoring or using coping strategies). This is because they were not found to be more clinically effective than other interventions. The evidence was supported by the committee's own experiences of self-management interventions, although some committee members did report having positive personal experiences of using them. The committee therefore agreed self-management interventions could still play a useful role in supporting the health of people after stroke but further studies were needed into their benefits, as well as effective components and optimal frequency. They made a recommendation for research on the clinical and cost effectiveness of self-management interventions for people after stroke. Community participation programmes Recommendation 1.17.6 Why the committee made the recommendation Community participation programmes can cover a wide range of interests and activities. The content of each programme and the degree to which healthcare professionals run or oversee them also varies. The evidence mainly looked at different types of group-based physical exercise, but some covered art or music activities.
