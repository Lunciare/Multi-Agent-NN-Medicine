The committee also agreed there was a need for more research into whether music therapy and interventions are cost effective and improve patient-centred outcomes (such as participation in everyday and social activities). Managing shoulder pain Recommendations 1.14.2 and 1.14.4 Why the committee made the recommendations The evidence on interventions for shoulder pain was limited because it did not explore the underlying causes of pain.

However, they also recognised this was often difficult to do in practice and so made recommendations for research to identify both the most useful tests to establish the causes of shoulder pain after stroke and how to manage shoulder pain depending on its cause. None of the interventions used in the studies were found to have a
