care interventions reduced cases of pneumonia, gingivitis and oral infections. The evidence on frequency of mouth care was less clear although most studies used a twice-daily mouth care regimen, which the NHS recommends for all people. The specific components of the mouth care regimen differed across studies, but none involved the use of a manual brush alone and most included an electric or battery-powered toothbrush and mouthwash. Oral gel with antibacterial or antifungal properties was also shown to help reduce mortality and occurrence of pneumonia in a study based in an NHS setting. Trained healthcare professionals supervised mouth care in all studies. Therefore, the committee agreed it should be delivered or supervised, when needed, by people with appropriate training and that this could include family members or carers. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current best practice. For some, these recommendations will not change current practice (for example, care for people who are able to follow a more intensive mouth care regimen). However, the level of care provided to people who find it difficult to follow a more intensive regimen is currently inconsistent, so these recommendations are likely to involve a change in practice in this area.
