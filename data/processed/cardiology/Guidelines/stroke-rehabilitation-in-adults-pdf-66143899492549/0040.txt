[2023] 1.15.8 Refer people after stroke to a specialist spasticity service if: • they have ongoing spasticity that has not responded to treatment • other treatments are not tolerated • the person has complex needs in relation to spasticity (for example, if the injection is for small muscles or treatment is needed for spasticity-related pain). [2023] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2023 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on spasticity. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review P: spasticity. 1.16 Self-care 1.16.1 Provide occupational therapy for people after stroke who are likely to benefit from it and to address difficulties with activities of daily living. Therapy may consist of restorative or compensatory strategies. • Restorative strategies may include: － encouraging people with hemisensory inattention (a difficulty in detecting or acting on information on 1 side of their personal space) to attend to the neglected side － encouraging people with arm weakness to use both arms － establishing a dressing routine for people with difficulties such as poor concentration, hemisensory inattention or dyspraxia
