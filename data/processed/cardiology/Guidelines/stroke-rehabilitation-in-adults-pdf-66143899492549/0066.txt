The committee agreed any of the 3 could be used to assess fatigue while the person was taking part in their rehabilitation programme and during their 6-month stroke review. They also made a recommendation for more research into the clinical and cost effectiveness of these 3 scales. The committee did not specify when the first assessment should take place as this could not be determined from the evidence they reviewed. However, they agreed it should not be done too quickly after the person's stroke since fatigue levels may be changing rapidly at that stage, but should be done soon enough to help plan ongoing rehabilitation. The timing will need to be determined on an individual basis. The committee was unable to recommend a specific tool to measure fatigue in people with communication difficulties because the evidence was inadequate. There was evidence for a vertical numeric rating scale that used a faces rating scale but this only examined 1 domain of fatigue. Therefore, the committee made
