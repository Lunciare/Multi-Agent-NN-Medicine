weeks, during the acute and subacute periods after stroke. Based on this and taking the evidence reviewed for the recommendations on intensity of stroke rehabilitation into account, the committee agreed that behavioural exercises should be offered for at least 5 days a week to maximise its benefits. However, they agreed that physical simulation should only be considered as an option for people with OPD because of the limited evidence available. On evaluating other treatments, the committee noted that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) improved quality of life, reduced dysphagia and chest infections, and helped people to return to a normal diet. The evidence on the effect of NMES on mortality was uncertain because of small trial sizes and short follow-up times. The committee noted that, while a clinically important harm was reported in the evidence, this was unlikely to be related to the use of NMES because the intervention was found to reduce dysphagia and chest infections, and it was unlikely that the intervention would cause death in another way. Taking into account the lack of quality-of-life data required to conduct health economic modelling, the potential high cost of the intervention, the size of the trials and the low quality of
