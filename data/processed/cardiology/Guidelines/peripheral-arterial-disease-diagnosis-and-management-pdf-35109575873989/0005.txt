Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

not exclude a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes based on a normal or raised ankle brachial pressure index alone. [2018] 1.3.5 Do not use pulse oximetry for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes. [2018] For a short explanation of why the committee made these 2018 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on diagnosis. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: determining diagnosis and severity of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes. 1.4 Imaging for revascularisation 1.4.1 Offer duplex ultrasound as first-line imaging to all people with peripheral arterial disease for whom revascularisation is being considered. [2012] 1.4.2 Offer contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography to people with peripheral arterial disease who need further imaging (after duplex ultrasound) before considering revascularisation. [2012] 1.4.3 Offer computed tomography angiography to people with peripheral arterial disease who need further imaging (after duplex ultrasound) if contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is contraindicated or not tolerated. [2012] 1.5 Management of intermittent claudication Supervised exercise programme 1.5.1 Offer a supervised exercise programme to all people with intermittent claudication. [2012] 1.5.2 Consider providing a supervised exercise programme for people with
