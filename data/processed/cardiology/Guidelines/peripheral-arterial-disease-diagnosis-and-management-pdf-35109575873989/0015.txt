Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

more expensive, and there is a lack of robust evidence on long-term effectiveness. A community-based randomised controlled trial is required to compare the long-term clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise programme and unsupervised exercise. The trial should enrol people with peripheral arterial disease-related claudication, but exclude those with previous endovascular or surgical interventions. The primary outcome measure should be maximal walking distance, with secondary outcome measures including quality of life, function, levels of uptake of exercise programmes and long-term engagement in physical activity.

Why this is important The evidence reviewed suggested that, among people with peripheral arterial disease, there is a lack of understanding of the causes of the disease, a lack of belief that lifestyle interventions will have a positive impact on disease outcomes, and unrealistic expectations of the outcome of surgical interventions. Much of the research has been conducted on the subpopulation of people with peripheral arterial disease who have been referred for surgical intervention, but little evidence is available
