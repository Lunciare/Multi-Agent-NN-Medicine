Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

[2012] 1.5.6 Use bare metal stents when stenting is used for treating people with intermittent claudication. [2012] Bypass surgery and graft types 1.5.7 Offer bypass surgery for treating people with severe lifestyle-limiting intermittent claudication only when: • angioplasty has been unsuccessful or is unsuitable and • imaging has confirmed that bypass surgery is appropriate for the person. [2012] 1.5.8 Use an autologous vein whenever possible for people with intermittent claudication having infra-inguinal bypass surgery. [2012] Pharmacological treatment 1.5.9 Consider naftidrofuryl oxalate for treating people with intermittent claudication, starting with the least costly preparation, only when: • supervised exercise has not led to satisfactory improvement and • the person prefers not to be referred for consideration of angioplasty or bypass surgery. Review progress after 3 to 6 months and discontinue naftidrofuryl oxalate if there has been no symptomatic benefit. [2012] Naftidrofuryl oxalate is recommended as an option in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease for whom vasodilator therapy is considered appropriate after taking into account other treatment options. For full details, see the guidance on naftidrofuryl oxalate (TA223, 2011). 1.5.10 Cilostazol, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate are not recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance
