Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

to use compression hosiery. [2012] 1.3.2 Assess people with suspected peripheral arterial disease by: • asking about the presence and severity of possible symptoms of intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia • examining the legs and feet for evidence of critical limb ischaemia, for example ulceration • examining the femoral, popliteal and foot pulses • measuring the ankle brachial pressure index (see recommendation 1.3.3). [2012] 1.3.3 Measure the ankle brachial pressure index in the following way: • The person should be resting and supine if possible. • Record systolic blood pressure with an appropriately sized cuff in both arms and in the posterior tibial, dorsalis pedis and, where possible, peroneal arteries. • Take measurements manually using a doppler probe of suitable frequency in preference to an automated system. • Document the nature of the doppler ultrasound signals in the foot arteries. • Calculate the index in each leg by dividing the highest ankle pressure by the highest arm pressure. [2012] Diagnosing peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes 1.3.4 Do not exclude a diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes based on a normal or raised ankle brachial pressure index alone. [2018] 1.3.5 Do not use pulse oximetry
