Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

leg because of either the pattern of their disease or other comorbidities. In this group the therapeutic options are pain control or primary amputation. Chemical lumbar sympathectomy, which involves the destruction of the lumbar sympathetic chain (usually the L2 and L3 ganglia), has been suggested to reduce pain and improve wound healing, and may prevent amputation in some patients. Initially achieved surgically, it is now most commonly performed using chemical agents such as phenol to destroy the lumbar sympathetic chain. Despite having been used for over 60 years, the role of chemical lumbar sympathectomy remains unclear. Improvement in skin blood flow and modification of pain perception control have been demonstrated, and this has prompted the use of chemical lumbar sympathectomy for treating a range of conditions such as regional pain syndrome, vasospastic conditions and critical limb ischaemia. However, in critical limb ischaemia the use of chemical lumbar sympathectomy varies widely between units in England, the mode of action and indications are unclear, and there is currently no randomised controlled trial evidence demonstrating its clinical value. Therefore a randomised control trial comparing chemical lumbar sympathectomy with other methods of pain relief is recommended. [2012] Rationale and impact Diagnosis Recommendations 1.3.4 and
