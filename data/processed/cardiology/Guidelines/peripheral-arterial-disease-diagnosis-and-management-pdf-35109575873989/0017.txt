Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

significant group of people with critical ischaemia caused by disease of the infra-geniculate vessels in which there is a potential for endovascular treatment. Infra-geniculate disease is more complex to treat by endovascular means, and the risks and benefits of different treatment options may differ from those for the more proximal vessels. A multicentre, randomised controlled trial with a full health economic analysis is required to address the optimum policy as regards the choice of method for angioplasty and stent placement for the infra-geniculate arteries. The primary endpoint should be amputation-free survival, with secondary endpoints including overall survival, re-intervention rates, health-related quality of life, healing of tissue loss, and relief of ischaemic pain. [2012] 8 Chemical sympathectomy for managing critical limb ischaemic pain What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of chemical sympathectomy in comparison with other methods of pain control for managing critical limb ischaemic pain? Why this is important Approximately 1 in 5 people with critical limb ischaemia cannot be offered procedures to improve the blood supply to their leg because of either the pattern of their disease or other comorbidities. In this group the therapeutic options are pain control or primary amputation. Chemical lumbar sympathectomy, which involves the
