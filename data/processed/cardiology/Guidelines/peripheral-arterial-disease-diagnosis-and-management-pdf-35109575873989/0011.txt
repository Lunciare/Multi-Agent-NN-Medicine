Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

with diabetes are at higher risk of cardiovascular events and foot problems such as diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage or degeneration), foot ulcer and limb loss. So it is important to have an effective test for diagnosing peripheral arterial disease in this group. At present there are only studies of very low quality (retrospective and prospective cross-sectional studies) containing small sample sizes. Diagnostic accuracy studies are needed to address this issue, ideally containing cost–utility analysis, comparing diagnostic tools with imaging. In order to explore the importance of early diagnosis, different clinical settings where diagnostic tests are performed should be explored. [2018] 2 Effectiveness of tools for establishing the severity of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes What is the most clinically and cost-effective tool for establishing the severity of peripheral arterial disease and the impact on mortality, morbidity and limb amputation in people with diabetes? Why this is important Limited evidence suggests that doppler ankle brachial pressure index, toe brachial index and oscillometric ankle brachial index accurately diagnose severity of peripheral arterial disease. However, further research is needed using a robust diagnostic study design (such as a randomised controlled trial) to explore the clinical and cost effectiveness of tools in
