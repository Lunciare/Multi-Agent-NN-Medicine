surgical interventions. Much of the research has been conducted on the subpopulation of people with peripheral arterial disease who have been referred for surgical intervention, but little evidence is available for the majority of people diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease in a primary care setting. Research is needed to further investigate attitudes and beliefs in relation to peripheral arterial disease, interventions that might influence these and how these may have an impact on behavioural changes in relation to risk factors for peripheral arterial disease, attitudes to intervention and clinical outcomes. [2012] 7 Primary versus secondary stenting for treating people with critical limb ischaemia caused by disease of the infra-geniculate arteries What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of selective stent placement compared with angioplasty plus primary stent placement for treating people with critical limb ischaemia caused by disease of the infra-geniculate arteries? Why this is important Studies comparing angioplasty plus selective stent placement with primary stent placement have been limited to the aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal segment. There is also a significant group of people with critical ischaemia caused by disease of the infra-geniculate vessels in which there is a potential for endovascular treatment. Infra-geniculate disease is more complex to treat
