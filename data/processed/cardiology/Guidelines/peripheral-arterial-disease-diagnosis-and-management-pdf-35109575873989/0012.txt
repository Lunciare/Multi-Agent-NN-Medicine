peripheral arterial disease. However, further research is needed using a robust diagnostic study design (such as a randomised controlled trial) to explore the clinical and cost effectiveness of tools in establishing the severity of disease and outcomes in people with diabetes. Studies should also explore the use of tools in different populations, such as those with neuropathy, and in different settings, for example, nursing homes, where access to services and diagnostic equipment may differ. [2018] 3 Inter- and intra-rater reliability of assessment tools in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes What is the inter- and intra-rater reliability of assessment tools in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people with diabetes? Why this is important Identifying peripheral arterial disease can be a challenge because diagnostic tests are conducted in a number of different settings by healthcare professionals with varying experience of using assessment tools. Data on inter- and intra-rater reliability of point-of-care assessment tools are needed to inform future recommendations for practice. The study should compare diagnostic tests with gold standard imaging. Different clinical and community settings, such as UK primary care setting, should also be taken into account.
