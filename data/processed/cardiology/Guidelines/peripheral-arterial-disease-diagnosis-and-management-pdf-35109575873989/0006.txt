Management of intermittent claudication Supervised exercise programme 1.5.1 Offer a supervised exercise programme to all people with intermittent claudication. [2012] 1.5.2 Consider providing a supervised exercise programme for people with intermittent claudication which involves: • 2 hours of supervised exercise a week for a 3-month period • encouraging people to exercise to the point of maximal pain. [2012] Angioplasty and stenting 1.5.3 Offer angioplasty for treating people with intermittent claudication only when: • advice on the benefits of modifying risk factors has been reinforced (see the section on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with peripheral arterial disease) and • a supervised exercise programme has not led to a satisfactory improvement in symptoms and • imaging has confirmed that angioplasty is suitable for the person. [2012] 1.5.4 Do not offer primary stent placement for treating people with intermittent claudication caused by aorto-iliac disease (except complete occlusion) or femoro-popliteal disease. [2012] 1.5.5 Consider primary stent placement for treating people with intermittent claudication caused by complete aorto-iliac occlusion (rather than stenosis). [2012] 1.5.6 Use bare metal stents when stenting is used for treating people with intermittent claudication. [2012] Bypass surgery and graft types 1.5.7 Offer bypass surgery for treating people with
