into account other treatment options. For full details, see the guidance on naftidrofuryl oxalate (TA223, 2011). 1.5.10 Cilostazol, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate are not recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance for treating intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease. For full details, see the guidance on cilostazol, pentoxifylline and inositol nicotinate (TA223, 2011). 1.6 Management of critical limb ischaemia 1.6.1 Ensure that all people with critical limb ischaemia are assessed by a vascular multidisciplinary team before treatment decisions are made. [2012] Revascularisation 1.6.2 Offer angioplasty or bypass surgery for treating people with critical limb ischaemia who require revascularisation, taking into account factors including: • comorbidities • pattern of disease • availability of a vein • patient preference. [2012] 1.6.3 Do not offer primary stent placement for treating people with critical limb ischaemia caused by aorto-iliac disease (except complete occlusion) or femoro-popliteal disease. [2012] 1.6.4 Consider primary stent placement for treating people with critical limb ischaemia caused by complete aorto-iliac occlusion (rather than stenosis). [2012] 1.6.5 Use bare metal stents when stenting is used for treating people with critical limb ischaemia. [2012] 1.6.6 Use an autologous vein whenever possible for people with critical limb ischaemia having infra-inguinal bypass surgery. [2012]
