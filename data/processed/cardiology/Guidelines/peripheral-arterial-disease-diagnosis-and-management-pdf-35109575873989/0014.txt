Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management

evidence-based, and serious concerns remain about the durability of angioplasty in this anatomical area. A multicentre, randomised controlled trial with a full health economic analysis is required to address this. The primary endpoint should be amputation-free survival, with secondary endpoints including overall survival, health-related quality of life, healing of tissue loss, and relief of ischaemic pain. [2012] 5 Supervised exercise programmes for treating people with intermittent claudication What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of supervised exercise programmes compared with unsupervised exercise for treating people with intermittent claudication, taking into account the effects on long-term outcomes and continuing levels of exercise? Why this is important Research has shown that taking part in exercise and physical activity can lead to improvements in symptoms in the short term for people with intermittent claudication. However, the benefits of exercise are quickly lost if it is not frequent and regular. Supervised exercise programmes have been shown to produce superior results when compared with advice to exercise (unsupervised) in the short term, but they are more expensive, and there is a lack of robust evidence on long-term effectiveness. A community-based randomised controlled trial is required to compare the long-term clinical and cost effectiveness of a
