complication rates. Why the committee made this recommendation Some people with PCS do not survive being taken off a cardiopulmonary bypass machine after cardiac surgery. Evidence from observational studies suggests some of these people would survive if VA ECMO were used, and some people may benefit more than others. But there is a lack of good quality evidence. VA ECMO is only suitable for a small number of people and is only available in a few hospitals. So, it would be difficult to do randomised controlled trials that include people with PCS. But other forms of data collection are possible. So, this procedure can be used in the NHS during the evidence generation period. 2 Information about the procedure 2.1 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used to manage postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock immediately after heart surgery, or to help separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. 2.2 In venoarterial ECMO, blood is taken from the venous system (usually from the femoral vein or the right atrium) and pumped through an oxygenator, where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. It is then returned to the arterial system, usually through the femoral or axillary artery or ascending aorta. People are usually given a continuous infusion
