1 Recommendation 1.1 Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) can be used in the NHS during the evidence generation period as an option to manage postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS) in adults. There must be enhanced informed consent and auditing of outcomes. What this means in practice There are uncertainties around the safety and efficacy of VA ECMO to manage PCS. It could be used if needed while more evidence is generated. After this, this guidance will be reviewed and the recommendations may change. Healthcare professionals do not have to offer this procedure and should discuss the available options with the person with PCS (and their family and carers as appropriate) before a joint decision is made, if possible.
