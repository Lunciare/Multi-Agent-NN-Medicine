VA ECMO for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock in adults

and carbon dioxide are exchanged. It is then returned to the arterial system, usually through the femoral or axillary artery or ascending aorta. People are usually given a continuous infusion of an anticoagulant, usually heparin, to prevent blood clotting in the extracorporeal system. For people with poor kidney function, a haemofiltration unit may be added to the circuit. 3 Committee discussion The condition 3.1 Postcardiotomy refers to the period immediately after open-heart surgery. Postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS) is a rare but life-threatening situation that happens when the efficiency of the heart as a pump is impaired and it is unable to meet the body's needs. This means a person may be unable to be separated from cardiopulmonary bypass after open-heart surgery. Persistent cardiogenic shock cannot be managed with medicines alone. Current practice 3.2 Treatment for PCS involves pharmacological treatments, including diuretics and inotropic agents, and mechanical circulatory support, including intra-aortic balloon pumps. Without using mechanical circulatory support, PCS has a very high risk of death, with mortality reported as high as 76%. Unmet need 3.3 VA ECMO is used to provide cardiac and respiratory support for people with PCS. Unlike a heart–lung (cardiopulmonary) bypass machine, it tends to be used
