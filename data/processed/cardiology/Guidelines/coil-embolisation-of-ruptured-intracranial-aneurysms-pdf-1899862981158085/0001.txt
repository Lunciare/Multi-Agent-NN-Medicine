Coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms

1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms appears adequate to support use of the procedure, provided that normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 1.2 The procedure should only be performed in specialist units with expertise in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Clear arrangements should be in place for the involvement of different clinical disciplines in treatment and follow-up. 1.3 Patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage should have rapid access to appropriate specialist care. Coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IPG106) 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 Intracranial aneurysms are small balloon-like dilated portions of blood vessels that may occasionally rupture, causing haemorrhage, stroke or death. Usually the cause is unknown but people with genetic causes of weak blood vessels are more likely to develop aneurysms. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms causes subarachnoid haemorrhage and has a poor prognosis. About 30% of people die within 24 hours and a further 25–30% die within 4 weeks. 2.1.2 The alternative treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysm involves open surgery to clip the aneurysm inside the skull. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 The coil technique involves approaching the aneurysm from inside
