Coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms

For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section. 2.3.2 The Specialist Advisors stated that, in the short term, the procedure is Coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (IPG106) more effective clinically than surgical clipping. However, the long-term durability of coil embolisation has not been established. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Complications associated with the procedure included perforation of the aneurysm, intracranial haematoma and re-bleeding. In a case series of 403 patients, aneurysm perforation was observed in 11 patients (3%) and cerebral clot embolisation in 10 patients (2%). Coil migration occurred in two patients (0.5%). For more details, refer to the Sources of evidence section. 2.4.2 The Specialist Advisors considered this procedure to be safer than surgical clipping. They stated that procedural mortality and stroke were the main adverse events. They also stated that there is a small risk of re- bleeding, and that this should be monitored over the long term. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 Currently, evidence on the procedure's long-term results is limited to a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. 3 Further information 3.1 This guidance relates to ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
