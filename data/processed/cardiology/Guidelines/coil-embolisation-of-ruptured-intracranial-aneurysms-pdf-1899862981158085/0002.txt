Coil embolisation of ruptured intracranial aneurysms

treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysm involves open surgery to clip the aneurysm inside the skull. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 The coil technique involves approaching the aneurysm from inside the diseased blood vessel, thereby avoiding the need to open the skull. A thin tube containing the coil on a guidewire is inserted into a large artery, usually in the groin, and passed up into the skull under radiological guidance. The coil is placed inside the aneurysm and detached from the guidewire. Once in position, it causes clotting and stops blood from entering the aneurysm. Multiple coils may be inserted into the aneurysm through the same tube until the aneurysm is filled with coils. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 Use of the procedure was supported by a high-quality randomised controlled trial. In the trial, 'dependency' reflected a moderate to severe disability as defined by the modified Rankin score. The trial showed a 7% absolute risk reduction in dependency or death for patients treated with coils compared with patients treated by surgical clipping.
