accident occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients, and stroke occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients during support time (mean 78 days). In a third series, a neurological event (not defined) occurred in 8% (1/13) of patients. 2.4.3 In a systematic review, significant haemorrhage was reported in between 10% (1/10) and 30% (6/20) of patients. Re-operation because of bleeding was required in 31% (4/13) of patients in one series. 2.4.4 Other complications reported during LVAD support were renal failure, respiratory failure and haemolysis. For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section. 2.4.5 The Specialist Advisers noted that adverse events relating to the procedure include bleeding, infection, device malfunction, haemolysis, peripheral ischaemia and perforation of a ventricle or the aorta. In addition, they noted that theoretical complications include device-related thrombosis and device-related strokes. 2.5 Other comments 2.5.1 This guidance refers to patients for whom other treatments such as intra-aortic balloon pumping would be ineffective, who are considered eligible for heart transplantation, or who have acute severe heart failure that is likely to be reversible (such as acute myocarditis). It was noted that other patients might potentially benefit from this procedure, such as patients who cannot be weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass
