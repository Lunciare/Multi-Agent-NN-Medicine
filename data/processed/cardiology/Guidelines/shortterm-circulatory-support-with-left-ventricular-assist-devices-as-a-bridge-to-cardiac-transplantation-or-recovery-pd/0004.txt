awaiting transplantation on LVAD support. 2.3.3 Of the total cases of bridge to recovery reported, 58% (7/12) of patients survived to final follow-up; successful explanation of the device or weaning from support was achieved in all these patients. For more details, refer to the 'Sources of evidence' section. 2.3.4 The Specialist Advisers commented that LVADs may improve quality of life and survival rates in patients with an otherwise fatal condition while waiting for transplantation. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 Definition of infection varied among the studies identified. In a case series documented in a systematic review, rates of infection during LVAD support ranging from 0% (0/10) to 100% (5/5) were reported. A non- randomised controlled trial noted infection in 8% (1/13) of patients during LVAD bridging, and one case series reported an infection rate of 18% (43/243). 2.4.2 Definitions of cerebral events varied between studies, which made interpretation difficult. Cerebral infarction causing stroke was found to have occurred in 21% (55/264) of patients in 1 series. In a second case series, cerebrovascular accident occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients, and stroke occurred in 5% (13/243) of patients during support time (mean 78 days). In a third series, a neurological event (not defined)
