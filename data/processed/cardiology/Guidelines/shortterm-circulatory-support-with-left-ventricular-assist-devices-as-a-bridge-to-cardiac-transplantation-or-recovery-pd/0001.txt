Short-term circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to cardiac

transplantation or recovery 1 Guidance 1.1 Limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of short-term circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or recovery appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for audit and clinical governance. 1.2 Clinicians should ensure that patients fully understand the high complication rates associated with this procedure and that the procedure is a temporary measure. In addition, use of NICE's information for the public is recommended. 1.3 Publication of further research will be useful, particularly on the use of this procedure in patients with cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 The management of patients with end-stage heart failure or acute heart failure from naturally reversible causes is challenging; it may involve combination medical therapy (including inotropic support), intra-aortic balloon pumping and heart transplantation. 2.1.2 Short-term circulatory support with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may be indicated for patients with end-stage heart failure (of any aetiology) who are awaiting a donor heart for transplantation, and for patients with a severe acute heart failure syndrome from which myocardial recovery is anticipated (such as
