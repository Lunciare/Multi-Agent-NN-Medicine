Efficacy 2.3.1 In the active arm of a non-randomised controlled study, 78% (32/41) of patients survived for a mean of 215 days with LVAD support. In another comparative study, 81% (13/16) of patients survived to transplant (duration of support not stated). One case series showed that at 30 days of bridging to transplantation with an LVAD, survival was 83%, falling to 19% after 24 months' support. 2.3.2 In a non-randomised controlled trial, post-transplant survival of patients bridged on LVAD support was 66% (21/32) at 41 months, compared with 67% (98/146) of patients at 36 months who had a transplant without circulatory support, although patients in the latter group were significantly older. One case series of 243 patients in whom LVADs were used to bridge to transplantation reported actuarial post-transplant survival of 91% at 1 year, 70% at 5 years and 40% at 10 years. Results from case series included in a systematic review showed that between 60% (12/20) and 83% (5/6) of patients survived to transplantation or were still alive awaiting transplantation on LVAD support. 2.3.3 Of the total cases of bridge to recovery reported, 58% (7/12) of patients survived to final follow-up; successful explanation of the device or weaning
