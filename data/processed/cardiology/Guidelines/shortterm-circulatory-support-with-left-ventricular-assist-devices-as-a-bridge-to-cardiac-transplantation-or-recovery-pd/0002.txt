Short-term circulatory support with left ventricular assist devices as a bridge to cardiac

failure (of any aetiology) who are awaiting a donor heart for transplantation, and for patients with a severe acute heart failure syndrome from which myocardial recovery is anticipated (such as acute myocarditis). An LVAD is sometimes used if weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiac surgery fails. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 A number of LVADs that increase cardiac output by providing mechanical support to the failing left ventricle are available. The choice of device depends on the patient's body size, the length of time support is required, the degree of support needed and the type of blood flow desired. 2.2.2 Implantation of an LVAD is done under general anaesthesia through a chest incision; surgery usually takes several hours. The inflow pipe of the LVAD is inserted into the left side of the heart, usually the left ventricle, and the outflow pipe is inserted into the systemic arterial system, usually the aorta. The LVAD pumps oxygenated blood from the failing left ventricle into the systemic arterial system under pressure. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 In the active arm of a non-randomised controlled study, 78% (32/41) of patients survived for a mean of 215 days with LVAD support. In another comparative study, 81%
