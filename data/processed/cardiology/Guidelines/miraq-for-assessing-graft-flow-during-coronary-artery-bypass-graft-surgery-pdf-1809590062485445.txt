MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
This guidance replaces MTG8.
1 Recommendations
1.1 The MiraQ system is recommended as a cost saving option for assessing graft
flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Why the committee made these recommendations
Clinical evidence shows that the MiraQ system is effective for assessing coronary artery
bypass grafts and allows for grafts to be revised during surgery. This may reduce the
frequency of graft occlusion and may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality.
The MiraQ system can lead to an estimated cost saving of £80.27 per person compared
with clinical assessment. [2022]

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
2 The technology
Description of the technology
2.1 The MiraQ cardiac system (MCQ0, Medistim ASA) uses ultrasound for the non-
invasive assessment of graft blood flow during coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG) surgery. It is intended for use in patients with coronary artery disease
who are having CABG surgery. It measures 3 parameters of transit time flow
(mean blood flow in ml/minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage) to
assess graft blood flow and check patency.
2.2 The MiraQ system measures transit time volume flow using specially designed
probes. A microcomputer with a 19-inch touch screen mounted on a moveable
trolley is used to control the probes and store their outputs.
2.3 The MiraQ system can use 2 types of probes to assess blood flow during CABG
procedures (the PS and PQ). These differ in the number of recommended reuses
and their method of sterilisation. Only the PS probe is considered in this
guidance, because the PQ probe needs ethylene oxide sterilisation, which is not
thought to be widely available in the NHS. The probes deliver a bidirectional
ultrasound beam across a target vessel and the system analyses the returning
signal to calculate the blood flow through the vessel at a default filter setting of
20 Hz. A real-time flow curve is displayed together with the mean blood flow in
ml/minute, pulsatility index and diastolic filling percentage. This information can
be used to determine whether flow through the graft and its anastomoses is
acceptable. If not, then the graft can be explored to detect imperfections and
revised as necessary to achieve acceptable blood flow.
2.4 The cost of the MiraQ system stated in the sponsor's submission includes
£32,000 for the VeriQ 2011 console, and £1,582 for each PS probe. These costs
were updated in the 2017 revision of the cost model to £34,000 for the cardiac
MCQ0 console and £1,481 for each probe. [2018] These costs were updated
again in the 2021 revision of the cost model, because the MiraQ console and PS
probe increased in price to £35,955 and £1,720, respectively. The annual
maintenance cost (assuming a 10-year life span) reduced from £1,800 to

£1,369.80. [2022]
2.5 The claimed benefits of the MiraQ system in the case for adoption presented by
the manufacturer are:
• improved outcomes of revascularisation procedures by reducing the risk of
early graft failure and adverse events
• reduced hospital stay for some patients by reducing the incidence of
complications during and after surgery
• reduced numbers of repeat procedures and treatments for postoperative
complications.
Current management
2.6 Coronary artery disease is a common cause of symptoms, disability and death. It
is caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to stenosis or occlusion of the coronary
arteries. NICE's guideline on stable angina recommends that revascularisation of
the blocked coronary arteries using CABG or percutaneous coronary
interventions should be considered in people whose symptoms are not
satisfactorily controlled by medical treatment.
2.7 CABG aims to bypass narrowed or blocked segments of the coronary arteries
using grafts. Grafts are usually constructed from lengths of the patient's own long
saphenous vein or their internal mammary artery, although other vessels are also
used.
2.8 Cardiac surgeons use a variety of techniques to avoid technical imperfections
during CABG, but assessment of graft flow is usually subjective. Techniques used
vary according to the graft used, the surgical technique, and the surgeon's
individual preference. They include the surgeon assessing resistance and
perfusion beyond a graft by flushing fluid through it before restoring flow, and
both observing and palpating grafts for pulsation when blood flow has been re-
established.
2.9 There are a number of methods for the objective assessment of the technical

results and of blood flow. Transoesophageal echocardiography evaluates heart
function after bypass by assessing regional left ventricular wall motion
abnormalities, which can be compared with preoperative regional left ventricular
function. Perioperative graft flow can be visualised in the operating theatre using
conventional angiography or using indocyanine green fluorescence. NICE has
produced interventional procedures guidance on intraoperative fluorescence
angiography for the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft. This guidance
states that current evidence suggests that the procedure is safe enough for
routine use in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency.

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
3 Clinical evidence
Summary of clinical evidence
3.1 The key clinical outcomes for the MiraQ system presented in the decision
problem were:
• incidence of graft failure
• time to graft failure
• peri and postoperative clinical events associated with graft failure (including
mortality)
• frequency of the need for graft revision and changes in VeriQ measurements
afterwards
• the need for repeat coronary revascularisation procedures
• long-term morbidity and mortality.
3.2 The evidence for the clinical effectiveness of the MiraQ system was based on 2
retrospective observational studies that examined surgical outcomes, and one
comparative study that compared parameter values from the VeriQ system
against another flowmeter. The studies were conducted in hospitals in Europe
and Canada; there were none in the UK. All patients in the studies were treated
by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
3.3 In a retrospective case study in Canada, Kieser et al. (2010) evaluated transit time
flow measurement with the VeriQ system to detect technical errors in CABGs
intra-operatively and to predict postoperative major adverse cardiac events. They
assessed 1,000 arterial grafts in 336 consecutive patients. Three parameters of
transit time flow (pulsatility index, flow and diastolic filling percentage) were
measured in 990 (99%) of the grafts. A pulsatility index value of less than 5 was
chosen as the principal measure of graft adequacy. In 82% of the patients (277 of
336), 93% of grafts (916 of 990) had a pulsatility index of less than or equal to 5.
The remaining 74 (7%) grafts (in 59 patients, 18%) had a pulsatility index of

greater than 5, but grafts were revised only when an abnormally high pulsatility
index was accompanied by other indications of graft malfunction (abnormal
electrocardiogram [ECG] changes, regional wall motion abnormality on
transoesophageal echocardiography or haemodynamic compromise). On this
basis, 20 grafts (in 14 patients, 4%) that were suspected to be problematic were
revised.
3.4 For analysis of the findings, patients were divided into 2 groups: the 277 (82%)
with at least one graft with a pulsatility index of less than 5, and 59 (18%) with at
least one graft with a pulsatility index of greater than 5. Major adverse cardiac
events (recurrent angina, perioperative myocardial infarction, postoperative
angioplasty, re-operation and/or perioperative death) occurred significantly more
often in patients with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (10 of 59, 17%) when
compared with patients with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (15 of 277, 5.4%,
p=0.005). Mortality following non-emergency surgery was significantly higher in
the patient group with a pulsatility index of greater than 5 (5 of 54, 9%) than in
the group with a pulsatility index of less than 5 (5 of 250, 2%, p=0.02).
3.5 Becit et al. (2007) evaluated the effect on the surgical results of CABG of
detecting graft dysfunction by intraoperative transit time flow measurement using
the VeriQ system in a case–control study in Turkey. A pulsatility index of greater
than 5 and diastolic filling percentage of less than 50% were used as the
indicators of inadequate flow. The study compared the surgical outcomes for 2
matched series of consecutive patients whose operations were performed by the
same surgeons. The study group (n=100) had transit time flow measurement
during surgery and the control group (n=100) did not. Three per cent (9 of 303)
of grafts in 9 (9%) patients in the study group were revised on the basis of
abnormal transit time measurements, and after revision all flow values and flow
patterns improved. No information was presented about graft revision in the
control group. The incidence of intra-aortic balloon pump insertion for low
cardiac output was significantly lower in the study group compared with the
control group (1 of 100 versus 7 of 100, p<0.05). Also, perioperative myocardial
infarction was significantly lower in the study group compared with the control
group (0 of 100 versus 5 of 100, p<0.05). There was no statistically significant
difference between the patient groups in intraoperative re-exploration for
bleeding or deep sternal infection.

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
3.6 Nordgaard et al. (2010) investigated the variation in pulsatility index
measurement between 2 different flowmeters (VeriQ and Transonic) and
examined whether increasing filtering of the flowmeter signals influenced flow
curves and pulsatility index. The VeriQ and Transonic flowmeters have default
filter settings of 20 Hz and 10 Hz respectively. Flow patterns in 19 patients
recorded simultaneously by both flowmeters during CABG surgery were
analysed. This showed that the VeriQ system provided systematically higher
pulsatility index values than the Transonic device (mean ± standard deviation
[SD]: 2.7±1.2 versus 1.8±0.6 respectively, p<0.001).
3.7 Clinical evidence was also available from 26 studies on predecessor devices of
the VeriQ system which were designed to evaluate the technical performance of
devices, to compare them against the other methods of graft flow assessment
such as intraoperative fluorescence imaging and postoperative X-ray
angiography; and to assess the predictive value of abnormal transit time flow
measurement on short and long-term clinical outcomes of CABG surgery. These
were evaluated by the external assessment centre and, on balance, their opinion
was that the studies showed that transit time flow measurements by the VeriQ
system predecessor devices predicted short-term graft failure following CABG
surgery and were easier to carry out than other methods. However, they also
thought that assessing graft flow with transit time flow measurement alone may
prompt unnecessary graft revision in some cases and there is inadequate
evidence about whether transit time flow measurement predicts long-term
patient survival.
Committee considerations
3.8 The committee recognised that graft dysfunction is a major determinant of
perioperative morbidity and mortality after CABG. It was advised that the majority
of graft failures in the perioperative period are due to technical imperfections
which, if recognised, might be corrected at the time of surgery.
3.9 The committee noted that perioperative myocardial infarction resulting from graft
failure may cause serious complications such as left ventricular dysfunction,
ventricular arrhythmias and haemodynamic instability, which can necessitate
prolonged intensive therapy unit stay. These complications may need

interventions such as intra-aortic balloon pumping, coronary angiography and
early reoperative CABG surgery. They may also lead to readmission to hospital.
3.10 The committee considered that the available evidence supported the claim that
transit time flow measured by the VeriQ system can identify grafts that have
reduced flow as a result of technical imperfections.
3.11 The committee recognised limitations in the available evidence. The main studies
were observational, with potential for bias. The study by Kieser et al. (2010)
investigated the VeriQ system on arterial grafts only, whereas in the NHS the
majority of CABGs are vein grafts. Nevertheless, it judged that there was
sufficient additional evidence relating to predecessor devices and sufficient
expert advice to support the expectation that routinely revising all appropriate
grafts on the basis of VeriQ measurements would result in reduced perioperative
graft occlusions and consequent complications.
3.12 The committee noted from the study by Nordgaard et al. (2010) that pulsatility
index values from the VeriQ system may differ from those of other machines and
are influenced by filter settings. However, these differences are systematic and
expected to be predictable.
3.13 The committee was advised that cardiac surgeons use a variety of methods to
minimise and detect technical imperfections during CABG surgery but these may
have limitations. On the basis of the evidence, it judged that the routine use of
VeriQ, as an adjunct to other methods of assessment such as transoesophageal
echocardiography, electrocardiography and clinical assessment, would be likely
to detect technical problems in some grafts that appear to be satisfactory on
clinical assessment alone.
3.14 The committee noted that recent joint guidelines on myocardial revascularisation
issued by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) have recommended graft
evaluation by objective methods before leaving the operating theatre after CABG
surgery. These guidelines refer to flow less than 20 ml/minute and a pulsatility
index of greater than 5 as predicting technically inadequate grafts that need
revision before leaving the operating theatre.

3.15 The committee recognised that the clinical outcomes of CABG surgery have
improved in the UK in the past 20 years and that complication rates are now very
low. However it was advised that there is still a perioperative graft occlusion rate
of 1% to 3%. The committee considered that the VeriQ system has potential to
reduce this graft occlusion rate and so further reduce morbidity and mortality
after CABG.

4 NHS considerations
System impact
4.1 Approximately 22,500 isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations
are performed in the UK each year. In addition, a substantial proportion of
patients having other cardiac surgery (for example, valve replacement surgery)
have concomitant CABG. Based on this large number of patients, any reduction in
graft occlusion rates by the MiraQ system during CABG surgery potentially offers
significant cost savings to the NHS.
4.2 The committee was informed that the MiraQ system is easy to use and does not
significantly increase operative time.
Committee considerations
4.3 As described in section 3, the committee judged that reduction in graft occlusion
rates by MiraQ assessment and appropriate revision at the time of surgery could
decrease complication rates. This could reduce the likelihood of subsequent
interventions, prolonged intensive therapy unit and hospital stay, and
readmission. Each of these reductions would result in significant resource
savings.

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
5 Cost considerations
Cost evidence
5.1 The economic evidence for the MiraQ system comprised a new cost analysis to
assess the cost savings to the NHS of introducing the MiraQ system for
assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery,
compared against clinical assessment.
5.2 In the base-case analysis, the equipment cost for the MiraQ system was about
£111 per procedure and the additional time for measuring flow in 3 grafts was
2.35 minutes. The equipment costs were based on the VeriQ 2011 console
(purchase cost £32,000 with an anticipated life span of 10 years) and an average
use of 1.7 probes per procedure (£1,582 per PS probe, which is recommended for
up to 30 uses). The costs per patient were based on the purchase cost of a
MiraQ system divided by 220 days' use per year over its life expectancy,
including annual maintenance costs. Annual maintenance costs are payable from
the end of year 2 at £1,800 per year. It was assumed that the annual maintenance
costs for the remaining 8 years would be averaged over the 10-year life
expectancy of the equipment. All time costs in the model were based on the
salaries of a CABG team comprising 2 cardiothoracic surgeons, 1 anaesthetist, 1
cardiac perfusionist and 2 cardiac nurses.
5.3 The cost model evaluated the cost savings of using the MiraQ system compared
with clinical assessment alone in assessing graft flow in all patients having CABG.
The outcomes considered in the model are complications associated with the
CABG surgery.
5.4 The consequences of using the MiraQ system were based on results from 2
studies (Kieser et al. [2010] and Becit et al. [2007]). In the base-case analysis,
use of the MiraQ system was associated with an increase of 6.6% in the graft
revision rate (a 2.3% increase in minor revisions and a 4.3% increase in major
revisions). Costs were based on the time taken by the CABG team to perform the
revisions. The cost of the time taken to perform a minor revision was estimated to
be £11, and for major revisions, £180.

MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
5.5 The perioperative events included in the cost analysis were: incidence of
postoperative myocardial infarction and the associated rehabilitation costs; use
of intra-aortic balloon pumping; incidence and treatment costs of intraoperative
re-exploration for bleeding; and incidence and treatment costs of deep sternal
infection. The rates of these events for CABG with and without the MiraQ system
were based on Becit et al. (2007). The base-case analysis compared a 0%
postoperative myocardial infarction rate for patients assessed clinically and with
VeriQ versus a 5% rate for patients who had clinical assessment alone. The
treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and associated
rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £1,667 per patient. The cost of
treatment by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,657 per
episode. The base-case analysis compared a 1% rate for intra-aortic balloon
pumping for patients assessed clinically and with VeriQ versus a 7% rate for
patients who had clinical assessment alone. There was no difference in the rate
of intraoperative re-exploration of bleeding and incidence of deep sternal
infection between the arms of the model. No adverse event costs as a result of
using the VeriQ system were included in the model because none have been
reported.
5.6 The cost saving associated with the MiraQ system in the base case was £115 per
patient based on purchase of a VeriQ 2011 console (£32,000), using a PS probe
(£1,582 for 30 uses), and annual maintenance costs (£1,800) payable at the end
of year 2.
5.7 The sensitivity analysis based on the parameters and ranges identified by the
manufacturer showed that estimates of cost saving for the MiraQ system are
robust. The key drivers of the cost saving were the reduction in the rate of
postoperative myocardial infarction and the reduction in use of intra-aortic
balloon pumping associated with the use of the MiraQ system. The highest cost
saving obtained in the sensitivity analysis was £323 per patient and was
associated with 0% use of intra-aortic balloon pumping in patients assessed with
the MiraQ system compared with a usage rate of 14% in patients assessed
without the MiraQ system. The lowest cost saving, of £38 per patient, was
obtained for a 2.5% postoperative myocardial infarction rate. The only case in
which use of the MiraQ system was not cost saving (when the cost per patient
was £45) was when there was no change in the usage rate of intra-aortic balloon
pumping in either arm of the model (3.5%). The external assessment centre

--- Страница 16 ---
MiraQ for assessing graft flow during coronary artery bypass graft surgery (HTG275)
advised that this is a pessimistic view and that the MiraQ system is likely to be
cost saving when used appropriately.
Committee considerations
5.8 The committee considered that the assumptions made in the cost model were
realistic and that the range of savings calculated for the use of MiraQ was likely
to be realised in practice.
5.9 The committee noted that the manufacturer's cost model did not include
potential cost savings from reductions in intensive therapy unit stay and reduced
readmission rates. The cost savings associated with the MiraQ system may
therefore have been underestimated.
5.10 The committee also noted that the manufacturer's estimated usage of the MiraQ
system at 1 patient per day for 220 days per year was likely to be conservative.
The committee was advised that on average 3 to 4 CABG operations are
performed per day in a cardiac operating theatre in the UK. Increased annual use
of a MiraQ system is expected to reduce the estimated equipment cost per
procedure because the capital cost of the VeriQ system will be divided across
more procedures.
5.11 The committee considered that the reductions in perioperative myocardial
infarction rate to zero and of intra-aortic balloon pump use from 7% to 1% when
using the MiraQ system compared with clinical assessment alone in the base
case were likely to be overestimates. This would tend to reduce the estimated
cost savings of the MiraQ system. However, the committee noted that sensitivity
analysis showed that if using the MiraQ system had no impact on the
postoperative myocardial infarction rate or led to only a small change in intra-
aortic balloon pumping rates (of less than 2%), the MiraQ system remained cost
saving compared with clinical assessment alone, resulting in a saving to the NHS.

2018 guidance review
5.12 For the guidance review, the external assessment centre (EAC) revised the model
to reflect 2017 costs (original guidance values are given in brackets). The main
parameter changes were the cost of the MiraQ console £34,000 (£32,000) and
probes £1,481 (£1,582) with 50 uses (30 uses). These costs resulted in a MiraQ
system cost of about £141 (£111) per procedure. The cost of the time taken to
perform a minor revision was estimated to be £24 (£11), and for major revisions,
£396 (£180). Treatment costs of postoperative myocardial infarction and
associated rehabilitation costs were estimated to be £2,031 (£1,667) per patient
and treatment cost by intra-aortic balloon pumping was estimated to be £2,574
(£2,657) per episode. Base-case results for the 2017 revised model shows the
cost saving associated with the MiraQ system was £141 (£115) per patient.
Further details of the 2017 revised model are in the revised model summary.
[2018]
2022 guidance review
5.13 For the 2022 guidance review, the EAC reviewed 87 studies that used the
Medistim device (MiraQ or previous equivalent versions). It found that most of the
evidence was based on single-arm studies with large in-between study
heterogeneity. There was, therefore, not enough high-quality evidence to justify
any changes to the guidance.
5.14 The EAC revised the model to reflect 2021 costs and changes to the cost of the
technology. This reduced the cost saving compared with clinical assessment
from £141 to £80.27. The EAC found that there was no justification for updating
the clinical parameters of the economic model. Further details of the revised
model are in the cost update in the review decision from June 2022. [2022]
