Your responsibility
This guidance represents the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the
evidence available. When exercising their judgement, healthcare professionals are
expected to take this guidance fully into account, and specifically any special
arrangements relating to the introduction of new interventional procedures. The guidance
does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with
the patient and/or guardian or carer.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Commissioners and/or providers have a responsibility to implement the guidance, in their
local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster good relations. Nothing in this
guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with
those duties. Providers should ensure that governance structures are in place to review,
authorise and monitor the introduction of new devices and procedures.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
This guidance replaces DG3.
1 Recommendations
1.1 New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery
CT750 HD and Somatom Definition Flash) are recommended as an option for
first-line imaging of the coronary arteries in people with suspected stable
coronary artery disease (with an estimated likelihood of coronary artery disease
of 10% to 29%) in whom imaging with earlier generation CT scanners is difficult.
1.2 New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery
CT750 HD and Somatom Definition Flash) are recommended as an option for
first-line evaluation of disease progression, to establish the need for
revascularisation, in people with known coronary artery disease in whom imaging
with earlier generation CT scanners is difficult. CT scanning might not be
necessary in situations in which immediate revascularisation is being considered.
1.3 Service providers, working with commissioners and cardiac networks, should
take into account the benefits of access to new generation cardiac CT scanners
for use in the circumstances described in 1.1 and 1.2. They should do this when
selecting CT scanners as part of medium-term asset planning.

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD

coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
2 The technologies
2.1 Aquilion ONE (Toshiba Medical Systems), Brilliance iCT (Philips Healthcare),
Discovery CT750 HD (GE Healthcare) and Somatom Definition Flash (Siemens AG
Healthcare) are new generation CT scanners that have a variety of
enhancements compared with earlier generation CT scanners. These
enhancements, which vary among the 4 scanners, may include better temporal
resolution, better spatial resolution and shorter acquisition times. It is claimed
that the new generation CT scanners can better detect coronary artery stenosis
in people with suspected or known coronary artery disease in whom imaging is
difficult with earlier generation CT scanners. The scope of the evaluation was
limited to these four new generation scanners that, although technically different,
were viewed as being broadly comparable for cardiac imaging. The acquisition
cost of these scanners varies depending on local discounts but estimates range
from £900,000 to £1.1 million.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
3 Clinical need and practice
The problem addressed
3.1 The primary focus of this evaluation is to assess the diagnostic accuracy, effect
on patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of specific new generation cardiac
CT scanners in:
• Adults (18 years or older) with suspected coronary artery disease in whom
imaging with earlier generation CT is difficult (see section 3.4) and with a
10% to 29% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease
• Adults (18 years or older) with known coronary artery disease in whom
imaging with earlier generation CT is difficult (see section 3.4) and in whom
revascularisation is being considered.
The condition
3.2 Coronary artery disease is characterised by narrowing of the coronary artery. It is
most commonly caused by atherosclerotic deposits of fibrous and fatty tissue,
leading to a reduction in blood flow to the heart, and angina. The NICE guideline
on recent-onset chest pain of cardiac origin defines significant coronary artery
disease as 70% or greater diameter stenosis of at least 1 major epicardial artery
segment or 50% or greater diameter stenosis in the left main coronary artery.
3.3 The NICE guideline on recent-onset chest pain, before the 2016 update,
recommended CT coronary angiography and invasive coronary angiography to
assess arteries and identify significant stenosis. The guideline recommended
using a 64-slice (or above) CT scanner in people with an estimated likelihood of
coronary artery disease of 10% to 29% and a calcium score of 1 to 400.
3.4 Conditions that make CT imaging difficult are:
• obesity

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
• high levels of coronary calcium (calcium score above 400)
• arrhythmias
• high heart rates that cannot be lowered pharmacologically (after consultation
with clinical experts, the definition of high heart rate was broadened from
over 70 beats per minute as stated in the scope, to over 65 beats per minute,
in order to avoid loss of potential data)
• stents
• previous bypass grafts.
Prevalence and risk
3.5 In the UK, an estimated 2.6 million people have coronary artery disease, with 2
million having symptoms of angina. In 2007, coronary artery disease was
estimated to have caused 91,000 deaths in the UK (approximately 19% of deaths
in men and 13% in women).
3.6 It was not possible to estimate the number of people with cardiac disease in
whom imaging would be difficult. However, a range of data sources can be used
to give an estimate of this population in whom coronary imaging would be
difficult. According to the Health Survey for England (2009), 22% of men and 24%
of women are obese. Hospital Episode Statistics show that there was a total of
313,765 unique patients with arrhythmias, stent implantations and bypass grafts
in England in the last 3 years. If the estimated number of people with a heart rate
of over 65 beats per minute and intolerance to beta blockers is included, the
number of people in England in whom imaging with earlier generation CT
scanners is difficult can be estimated to range from 10 million to 18 million.
The diagnostic and care pathways
3.7 The care pathway for this evaluation was taken from the NICE guideline on
recent-onset chest pain, before the 2016 update. The key elements (for the

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
imaging strategy) from the guideline's care pathway are as follows:
• People with chest pain who have an estimated likelihood of coronary artery
disease of 10% to 29% should be offered calcium scoring, followed by CT
coronary angiography if the calcium score is between 1 and 400. A calcium
score above 400 indicates that imaging using earlier generation CT scanners
would be difficult, and the guideline recommends invasive coronary
angiography if this is considered clinically appropriate.
• People with chest pain who have an estimated likelihood of coronary artery
disease of 30% to 60% should be offered non-invasive functional imaging for
myocardial ischaemia.
• People with chest pain who have an estimated likelihood of coronary artery
disease of 61% to 90% should be offered invasive coronary angiography if
clinically appropriate and if coronary revascularisation is being considered.
3.8 The key options for non-invasive functional imaging are:
• myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with single photon emission computed
tomography or
• stress echocardiography or
• first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion or
• magnetic resonance imaging for stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.
3.9 People diagnosed as having significant coronary artery disease should be initially
managed as having stable angina. Management of these people was assumed to
follow the recommendations from the NICE guideline on managing stable angina
when modelling patient outcomes and cost effectiveness.

coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
4 The diagnostic tests
The individual tests: Aquilion One, Brilliance iCT,
Discovery CT750 HD and Somatom Definition Flash
4.1 New generation cardiac CT scanners identified and included in this evaluation
have advanced technical features that address drawbacks associated with earlier
generation CT scanners. These drawbacks include spatial resolution, low contrast
detection, noise artefacts and higher levels of radiation. The scanners included in
this evaluation are Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD and
Somatom Definition Flash.
Aquilion ONE
4.2 The Aquilion ONE is a CT scanner with 320 × 0.5 mm detector rows giving z-axis
coverage of 160 mm. This specification allows the imaging of whole organs in a
single non-helical rotation, for example, an image of the heart can be captured
within a single heartbeat. As well as reducing the examination time, the radiation
and the contrast dose are also reduced.
Brilliance iCT
4.3 The Brilliance iCT is a CT scanner with 128 × 0.625 mm detector rows providing
total z-axis coverage of 80 mm. Each detector row is double sampled to increase
spatial resolution. It is claimed that it can capture an image of the heart in 2 heart
beats.
Discovery CT750 HD
4.4 The Discovery CT750 HD is a 64 × 0.625 mm detector dual-energy CT scanner. It
has a single X-ray source that switches between 2 energy levels, allowing 2 data

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
sets – high energy and low energy – to be acquired simultaneously. It uses a
Gemstone detector that contributes to high image quality, and a prospectively
gated axial scanning technique called SnapShot Pulse, which allows a complete
picture of the heart to be captured in 3 or 4 'snapshots' taken at precise table
positions and timed to correspond to a specific phase of the cardiac cycle.
Somatom Definition Flash
4.5 The Somatom Definition Flash is a second-generation 64 × 0.6 mm detector dual-
source CT scanner designed to provide high resolution images at a fast scanning
speed with low-dose radiation. It has 2 X-ray tubes and 2 detector arrays
mounted at 95° to each other. It has a maximum scan speed of 458 mm/s. Fast
acquisition times may be of benefit for use with people who cannot remain still or
who have difficulty holding their breath. The scanner also uses different
strategies to reduce the radiation dose associated with imaging.
The comparator: invasive coronary angiography
4.6 Because earlier generation CT scanners are not considered viable for imaging
some people (see section 3.4), and it is this population that is of interest, the
comparator is invasive coronary angiography. Invasive coronary angiography
uses a contrast dye and X-rays to provide anatomical information about the
degree of stenosis in the coronary arteries. A catheter is generally inserted into
an artery in the groin or wrist and is moved up the aorta and into the coronary
arteries. Once in place, the dye is injected through the catheter, and a rapid
series of X-ray images is taken to show how the dye moves through the branches
of the coronary arteries. Narrowing of the arteries will show up on the X-ray
images.
4.7 Invasive coronary angiography is considered the reference standard for providing
anatomical information and defining the site and severity of coronary artery
lesions. Some rare but serious complications include death, myocardial infarction,
cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, vascular complications, allergic reaction to
contrast media, haemodynamic complications and perforation of the heart
chamber.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
5 Outcomes
The diagnostics advisory committee (section 8) considered evidence from a number of
sources (section 9).
How outcomes were assessed
5.1 The assessment consisted of a systematic review of the evidence on clinical
effectiveness for new generation cardiac CT scanners in people with known and
suspected coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult.
5.2 All studies included in the systematic review reported test accuracy data for
people in whom imaging is difficult. Results were summarised by patient group
(obese, high heart rate, high coronary calcium score and so on) and further
stratified by unit of analysis (patient, artery, or arterial segment). For all included
studies, the absolute numbers of true positive, false negative, false positive and
true negative test results, as well as sensitivity and specificity values, with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), were presented.
5.3 Modelling was undertaken to assess final patient outcomes and cost
effectiveness. Diagnostic strategies themselves do not have direct implications
for health-related quality of life. Therefore, a linked evidence approach to
modelling was used to link intermediate outcomes (diagnostic accuracy of the
tests) to treatment outcomes and hence quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains.
Assessment of test accuracy
5.4 Based on the data from the included studies, the external assessment group was
able to deduce true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative rates
for new generation cardiac CT scanners compared with invasive coronary
angiography. Sensitivities and specificities were computed from meta-analysis (a
bivariate summary receiver operating curve [SROC] model). When the bivariate
model could not be fitted because of the small number of relatively homogenous
studies involved, the DerSimonian and Laird method for meta-analysis was used.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
Per-patient summary estimates were also used when possible. A summary of the
data on the test performance of the scanners among the patient groups in whom
imaging is difficult is given below. In all cases the studies were quite consistent
and inter-study heterogeneity was low to moderate.
People with obesity
5.5 One study involving 125 participants reported 543 per segment data on the
performance of new generation cardiac CT scanners in detecting coronary artery
disease in people with obesity. Obesity was defined as having a body mass index
(BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or above. The index test was Somatom Definition (a model
predating the Somatom Definition Flash) and the reference test was invasive
coronary angiography. The sensitivity was 90.4% (95% CI 83.8 to 94.9) and the
specificity was found to be 92.1% (95% CI 89.1 to 94.5).
People with high levels of coronary calcium
5.6 Four studies reported on the performance of new generation cardiac CT
scanners in detecting coronary artery disease in people with high levels of
coronary calcium. The high calcium score threshold was set to above 400. Data
were derived from 1,304 segments in 91 participants. The index test was
Somatom Definition and the reference test was invasive coronary angiography.
The sensitivity was 92.7% (95% CI 88.3 to 95.6) and the specificity was 90.6%
(95% CI 80.6 to 95.8%).
People with arrhythmia
5.7 Five studies reported on the performance of new generation cardiac CT scanners
in detecting coronary artery disease in people with arrhythmia. Data for 126
patients and 1,526 segments were obtained from the studies. For the patient
data, sensitivity was 97.7% (95% CI 88.0 to 99.9) and specificity was 81.7% (95%
CI 71.6 to 89.4). For the segment data, sensitivity was 87.4% (95% CI 68.3 to
95.7) and specificity was 96.0% (95% CI 91.2 to 98.2).

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
People with a high heart rate
5.8 Eight studies in total reported 24 data sets on the performance of new
generation cardiac CT scanners in detecting coronary artery disease in people
with a high heart rate. Five studies with 462 participants reported per-patient
data. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, derived from these data
using a bivariate model, were 97.7% (95% CI 93.2 to 99.3) and 86.3% (95% CI
80.2 to 90.7) respectively. Four studies reported data for 664 arteries. The
pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, derived from this data using a
bivariate model, were 93.7% (95% CI 87.8 to 96.9) and 92.4% (95% CI 83.3 to
96.8) respectively. All 8 studies reported accuracy data by arterial segment
(8,133 segments). The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, derived
from these data using a bivariate model, were 92.7% (95% CI 89.3 to 95.1) and
95.7% (95% CI 92.8 to 97.4) respectively. All 8 studies used a threshold of vessel
narrowing of at least 50% to define significant stenosis.
5.9 Beta-blockers are normally prescribed to slow the heart rate for people with
heart rates too high for scanning. Some people with high heart rates are
intolerant to beta-blockers, which makes it difficult to image them with earlier
generation CT scanners. However, no studies were identified on the accuracy of
new generation cardiac CT scanners for the detection of coronary artery disease
in people who are intolerant to beta-blockers.
People with previous stent implants
5.10 Seven studies reported 10 data sets describing the accuracy of new generation
cardiac CT scanners for the detection of coronary artery disease in people with
previous stent implantation. Four studies reported per-patient data for 233
participants. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 96.0% (95%
CI 88.8 to 99.2) and 81.6% (95% CI 74.7 to 87.3) respectively. Six studies reported
accuracy data by stent or stented lesion (n=582). The pooled estimates of
sensitivity and specificity were 93.6% (95% CI 86.1 to 97.2) and 91.0% (95% CI
87.3 to 93.7) respectively.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
Clinical outcomes
5.11 The modelling comprised 5 sub-models based on existing models to estimate the
clinical outcomes of using new generation cardiac CT scanners. QALYs and costs
in all 5 models were calculated and discounted at a rate of 3.5% for benefits and
costs. These models are described below.
Diagnostic model
5.12 A diagnostic model was used to estimate the initial outcomes of treatment and
initial diagnosis. This model was created through extending and linking the 5 sub-
models. The primary measures of benefit used in this analysis were:
• the complication rate for invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation
(myocardial infarction and stroke)
• the benefits associated with reduction in the incidence of cancer as a result
of reduction in radiation dose
• morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease.
5.13 Using invasive coronary angiography as a comparator, three diagnostic strategies
were evaluated. These strategies were:
• Invasive coronary angiography only: people in whom imaging is difficult had
invasive coronary angiography only, which was assumed to be perfectly
accurate.
• New generation cardiac CT scanner only: people in whom imaging is difficult
had a new generation cardiac CT scan only; the accuracy of the scan was
based on invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard.
• New generation cardiac CT scan plus invasive coronary angiography: cardiac
CT was performed on everyone in whom imaging is difficult, and those with a
positive scan then had invasive coronary angiography. No false positives
could occur with this strategy because invasive coronary angiography was
assumed to have perfect specificity.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
5.14 The clinical outcomes assessed for people with coronary artery disease were
mortality, morbidity and the percentage of correct diagnostic classifications (true
positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) associated with each of
the 3 strategies.
Healthy population model
5.15 Using life tables, a healthy population model that only applied to people without
coronary artery disease (true negatives and false positives) was used to predict
mortality on the assumption that people with true negative and false positive test
results do not differ from the average UK population.
EUROPA model
5.16 The EUROPA model modelled the progression of stable coronary artery disease
by predicting cardiovascular events and mortality. Health-related quality of life
estimates were assigned to each Markov state based on age, gender, baseline
Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification and whether the person had
undergone treatment.
Stroke model
5.17 The costs and outcomes of people who experienced a stroke because of initial
invasive coronary angiography or revascularisation were modelled with a
mortality model. Mortality rates were based on UK life tables and a relative risk of
2.5 to reflect the increased risk of mortality after a stroke.
York radiation model
5.18 The York Radiation Model estimated the impact of imaging in terms of radiation
dose on cancer morbidity and mortality. This model was used as there is no
direct evidence on radiation dose effects in the populations included in the
scope.

and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
Cost and cost effectiveness
5.19 The models described above were also used to estimate the costs of the
diagnostic tests and treatments people received for their initial conditions, and
any subsequent related conditions that developed. Although there is some
variation in the costs of the new generation cardiac CT scanners, the models
assumed that each scanner cost £1 million.
5.20 The comparator, invasive coronary angiography, was presumed to be perfectly
accurate (a gold standard) and, despite a known increase in complication rate
compared with CT, generated more QALY gains than CT. It was also more
expensive than imaging with a new generation cardiac CT scanner. The
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of invasive angiography when
compared with new generation cardiac CT is significantly greater than the NICE
cost-effectiveness threshold.
5.21 In people with suspected coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult, the
health economic analysis showed that, given a threshold of £20,000 per QALY
gained, using new generation cardiac CT scanners instead of invasive coronary
angiography is cost effective. The 'new generation CT scanner only' strategy was
the most cost-effective strategy. The 'new generation CT scan plus invasive
coronary angiography for those with positive CT scans' strategy delivered very
small additional QALYS per patient (0.002) at a cost of £142. The ICER was
£71,000 per QALY gained compared to the 'new generation CT scanner only'
strategy. Similarly, relative to the 'new generation CT scanner only' strategy,
'invasive coronary angiography alone' also delivered a very small number of
additional QALYS per patient (0.009) at a cost of £726 (ICER of £80,667 per
QALY gained).
5.22 In people with known coronary artery disease who are difficult to image, the most
cost-effective strategy was 'new generation cardiac CT scan plus invasive
coronary angiography' for those with positive CT scans. This strategy dominated
(more effective and less costly) the 'invasive coronary angiography only' strategy,
generating more QALYs per patient (0.022) at reduced cost. The 'new generation
cardiac CT scan plus invasive coronary angiography' strategy was the most
preferred strategy for this cohort. Although it generated a very small reduction in
QALYs per patient (0.001), it yielded a relatively large reduction in cost (£443)

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
6 Considerations
6.1 The scope assumed that Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD and
Somatom Definition Flash provided broadly similar benefits for people in whom
imaging is difficult. The assessment was carried out on this basis. The committee
considered comments on the diagnostics assessment report from stakeholders
about the equivalence of the 4 scanners. The committee heard that the scanners
use different technologies to gain image improvement and dose reduction, and
that the different approaches may provide differential benefits depending on the
reasons for imaging being difficult. For the purposes of this assessment, the
committee considered that it was reasonable to assume that each of the devices
was capable of providing adequate imaging for all groups of people in whom
imaging is difficult. Moreover, the committee concluded that many people have
combinations of conditions that lead to imaging difficulties and, therefore, it
would not be optimal to specify use of any 1 particular device.
6.2 Of the 24 test accuracy studies included in the diagnostics assessment report, 3
studies did not specify the model of the scanner used, 1 study used Somatom
Definition Flash, 1 used Aquilion ONE and 19 used Somatom Definition (a model
predating the Somatom Definition Flash). The manufacturer of the Discovery
CT750 HD confirmed the CT750 HD had been used in a study in which the details
of the scanner were not provided. Although test accuracy data exist for all of the
systems considered, most studies did not stratify outcome reporting for the
difficult-to-image subsets and thus the data could not be used in the
assessment. The assessment was based on the 24 studies with stratified data.
The committee concluded that the evidence base for these technologies
provided it with sufficient certainty for it to formulate recommendations.
However, the committee considered it important that manufacturers make
available specific test accuracy data stratified by important patient subgroups
and noted that the current lack of such data made it difficult to make
recommendations. The committee noted that it would only make
recommendations on the scanners included in the scope, although evidence from
scanners other than the 4 being evaluated was included in the assessment.
6.3 The committee discussed the extent to which the usable test accuracy studies,
particularly the studies of the older Somatom model, could be generalised across

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
scanners. The committee heard from the external assessment group that
statistical tests of the test accuracy results of the different scanners showed the
results were not heterogeneous and thus could be combined, and the committee
accepted this explanation.
6.4 The committee concluded that even though no usable data were available for
Brilliance iCT, and one study each was available for Aquilion ONE, Discovery
CT750 HD and Somatom Definition Flash, nevertheless it was reasonable for the
committee to make recommendations that applied to all 4 of the assessed
scanners.
6.5 The committee considered whether all relevant studies had been included in the
assessment. In response to comments from representatives of manufacturers
about the inclusion of relevant studies, the external assessment group confirmed
that the literature search was designed to be very sensitive and to maximise
identification of papers containing test accuracy data for the groups of patients
included in the scope. In addition, all manufacturers had been asked to provide
relevant data. Unfortunately, most of the data provided by manufacturers could
not be included because it did not contain test accuracy results stratified for the
relevant populations for the assessment.
6.6 The committee acknowledged that the reference standard, invasive coronary
angiography, although not 100% accurate in clinical practice, is an accepted
reference standard for assessment of anatomic coronary disease. The high
accuracy of CT when compared with angiography, coupled with the known
inaccuracies of angiography, imply that CT may be even more effective and cost
effective than the assessment indicated because it may be more accurate, and
angiography less accurate, than modelled.
6.7 The committee acknowledged that from a patient perspective, a non-invasive
cardiac diagnostic test is more appealing than invasive coronary angiography
because of the greater morbidity and mortality risks associated with
angiography. The external assessment group informed the committee that the
modelling had reflected this preference to some extent, because it included the
increased morbidity and mortality resulting from invasive procedures as well as
their associated costs. CT was found to be more cost effective than angiography
because of the lower risk of these outcomes and the reduced costs associated

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
with CT (reduced imaging costs and reduced downstream healthcare costs from
dealing with complications), even though angiography had been assumed to be
the more accurate test.
6.8 The committee considered how using new generation cardiac CT scanners for
evaluating people with suspected coronary artery disease would fit in the context
of the NICE guideline on recent-onset chest pain. The committee concluded that
the evidence presented indicated that new generation cardiac CT was more cost
effective for people in whom imaging is difficult than proceeding directly to
invasive angiography. The committee noted that earlier generation CT scanners
used for people in whom imaging is not difficult are even less expensive and have
similar risks and benefits than the new generation scanners. CT could be more
cost effective than angiography for all people presenting with chest pain and a
pre-test likelihood of 10% to 29% of coronary artery disease.
6.9 The NICE guideline on recent-onset chest pain, before the 2016 update,
recommended calcium scoring to assess patients with an estimated likelihood of
coronary artery disease of 10% to 29%, and varied its further imaging
recommendations based on the calcium level. The value of calcium scoring was
outside the scope of this evaluation and, thus, not explored further by the
committee.
6.10 The committee considered whether angiography after CT was needed for people
with positive CT scans. The analysis showed that CT alone was more cost
effective than CT with angiography for people with suspected coronary artery
disease, but CT alone was not more cost effective for people with known
coronary artery disease. For both groups, CT followed by invasive coronary
angiography for those with positive CT scans was more cost effective than
invasive coronary angiography alone.
6.11 The committee was informed that, in current practice, people who are expected
to have revascularisation would usually have angiography either before or as a
part of treatment, but that the rate of elective angiography was dropping. The
committee also heard that with time and additional clinician experience with CT
angiography, it was likely that follow-up angiography solely for diagnostic
purposes would become less frequent. A negative CT scan result would be
sufficient to avoid angiography and often low-risk patients with a negative scan

New generation cardiac CT scanners (Aquilion ONE, Brilliance iCT, Discovery CT750 HD
and Somatom Definition Flash) for cardiac imaging in people with suspected or known
coronary artery disease in whom imaging is difficult with earlier generation CT scanners
could be discharged from specialty care immediately. The committee heard that if
a CT scan result shows moderate stenosis (40% to 60%), then the patient usually
proceeds to functional imaging, whereas for severe stenosis (80%), the patient
would be offered invasive coronary angiography. The committee was advised
that having the option to diagnose with CT before proceeding to functional
imaging and/or invasive coronary angiography would not affect the throughput of
a cardiology department.
6.12 The committee considered whether it was appropriate to recommend CT
scanning for people with known coronary artery disease in whom imaging was
not difficult. However, evidence for this population had not been examined and
no analysis had been undertaken.
6.13 The committee also considered whether it was appropriate to recommend CT
scanning for people with suspected coronary artery disease who had prior
likelihoods of coronary artery disease higher than 10 to 29%. The sensitivity
analysis had shown that the use of new generation CT scanning is within NICE's
standard levels of cost effectiveness compared with angiography for people in
whom imaging is difficult and who have moderately higher than 29% pre-test
probabilities of coronary artery disease. The committee heard that immediate
revascularisation was no longer considered the preferred practice in this
population. However, because data for this population had not been examined, it
was not possible to make a recommendation.
6.14 The committee concluded that, based on the results of the assessment carried
out by the external assessment group, new generation cardiac CT scanners
should be recommended for:
• first-line imaging of coronary arteries in people with suspected stable
coronary artery disease whose estimated likelihood of coronary artery
disease is 10% to 29%, and
• first-line evaluation of disease progression in people with known coronary
artery disease in whom imaging is difficult.
6.15 The committee was informed that there are currently up to 40 new generation
cardiac CT scanners being used in the NHS in England. The committee
considered that its recommendations would help optimise the use of the

scanners that are currently in operation. The committee acknowledged that the
impact of its recommendations would support the further introduction of new
generation cardiac CT scanners in the NHS over the next few years.
6.16 The committee considered if there were any specific equalities issues that would
be relevant to this assessment, but none were raised.

7 Recommendations for further research
The diagnostics advisory committee has not made specific recommendations for further
research. Nevertheless, the committee recognised that there is uncertainty about a
number of issues relating to the new generation cardiac CT scanners for the assessed
population (for example, test accuracy in people with obesity and people with very high
calcium scores) and that there is concern that angiography was not an accurate gold
standard.
