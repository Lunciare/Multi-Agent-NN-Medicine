ESC Clinical Consensus Statement on Mental Health and Cardiovascular Disease:

also increase the risks or worsen each other. It is important that your healthcare professional assesses both your mental health and cardiovascular health status to see if you need help. If they do not ask about your emotions, prompt them or talk to them about your feelings. Integrated care – different professionals in the Psycho-Cardio team working together with you – is the best way for managing CVD and mental health conditions, with care stepped up or down as needed. The ACTIVE principles can help the Psycho-Cardio team deliver effective integrated care. Not all mental health conditions or heart conditions are permanent, but some are. Optimal care might involve medicines, but other techniques, such as mindfulness training or cognitive behavioural therapies, work too. Both CVD and mental health conditions can have an impact on carers or family members and it is important that they receive support if needed.
