Screening usually means answering a few simple questions to work out how you are feeling and to check if you need a more detailed assessment or support from a specialist clinician. If no one asks you about your feelings or emotions, please talk to your healthcare professional about how you feel. Ask for support to find other sources of help Even if screening turns out to be normal, it is important to know that support is available from other sources. Psychological interventions are types of therapies that work on the mind and behaviour: • Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy that helps you understand and change how you think and act. CBT can help you cope with the negative thoughts and behaviours that contribute to the mental health condition • Psycho-education involves learning about your emotions, thoughts, behaviours and how your brain works. It can help you to better understand yourself and to cope with an illness, your sense of the future and your treatment • Mindfulness-based techniques
