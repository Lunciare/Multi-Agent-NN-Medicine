Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

that that the difference between apixaban and warfarin was not statistically significant for these groups. The hazard ratios for stroke and systemic embolism in the groups of patients who received 5 mg and 2.5 mg apixaban were also both below 1 (the hazard ratios for CHADS score 2 subgroups and for the groups of patients who received 5 mg and 2.5 mg apixaban are commercial-in-confidence). The manufacturer also presented data for subgroups based on INR (international normalised ratio) control using quartiles of centre time in therapeutic range (less than 58.0%, 58.0% to 65.7%, 65.7% to 72.2% and more than 72.2%). A centre's time in therapeutic range was calculated as the median of individual time in therapeutic ranges among the centre's patients on warfarin. The manufacturer reported that the benefits of apixaban over warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism were Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) consistent (HR <1) regardless of INR control (centre time in therapeutic range <58.0% [HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.06], centre time in therapeutic range 58.0% to 65.7% [HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.15], centre time in therapeutic range 65.7% to 72.2% [HR 0.79, 95%
