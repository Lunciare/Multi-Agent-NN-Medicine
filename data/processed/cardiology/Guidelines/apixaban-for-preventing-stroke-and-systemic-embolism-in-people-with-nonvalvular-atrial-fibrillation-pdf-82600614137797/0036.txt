the ARISTOTLE population. The Committee noted the potential differences between the trial population and people treated for atrial fibrillation in the UK but concluded that the characteristics of the people who participated in ARISTOTLE were broadly generalisable to the UK population. 4.4 The Committee considered the results of the ARISTOTLE trial. It noted that apixaban was more effective than warfarin in reducing the primary efficacy outcome of all stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic), and systemic embolism. The Committee noted that the primary efficacy outcome was a composite of the effectiveness outcomes (ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism) and a bleeding outcome (haemorrhagic stroke). The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that there is debate about the primary outcomes to use in trials of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, but that it is common to use composite outcomes, such as the primary efficacy outcome in ARISTOTLE. The Committee considered the individual components of the composite outcome. It heard from the clinical specialists that once an embolus leaves the heart it is a matter of chance whether it flows to the brain, resulting in ischaemic stroke, or to the rest of the body, causing systemic embolism. The proportion of each was therefore not a treatment
