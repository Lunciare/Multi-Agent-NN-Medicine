Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

powered to demonstrate superiority across subgroups. The Committee concluded that the evidence from subgroups based on centre time in therapeutic range was not sufficiently robust to use to formulate guidance based on an individual's time in therapeutic range. 4.7 The Committee considered the adverse events reported in ARISTOTLE. The Committee noted that for the primary safety outcome of major bleeding (using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition), treatment with apixaban resulted in fewer bleeding events than warfarin, including a reduced rate of intracranial bleeding. The Committee recognised that this has a high mortality rate and a large impact on a person's quality of life, and is the most feared bleeding outcome for people taking any type of anticoagulant. The Committee noted however that there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of gastrointestinal bleeding between apixaban and warfarin. The Committee concluded that apixaban resulted in fewer bleeds than warfarin and it recognised the particular importance of the effects of apixaban in reducing the risk of intracranial bleeding for people with atrial fibrillation when compared with warfarin.
