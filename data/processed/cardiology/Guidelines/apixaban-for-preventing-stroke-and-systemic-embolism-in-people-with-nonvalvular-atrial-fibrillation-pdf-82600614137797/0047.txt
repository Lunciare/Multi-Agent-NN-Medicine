ARISTOTLE had not assessed health-related quality of life and that the utility values used in the manufacturer's model were identified through a systematic review. The Committee questioned whether the manufacturer's assumption of a permanent utility decrement following a myocardial infarction was appropriate. However, it accepted the views of the clinical specialists that disutility following a myocardial infarction would not be expected to change substantially after 6 months. The Committee concluded that the utilities used in Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) the model were appropriate. 4.13 The Committee considered the costs used in the model. It noted that the estimates for stroke and systemic embolism were based on a cohort study of a population living in the Oxford area of the UK and that the costs for ischaemic stroke were lower than those for haemorrhagic stroke. The Committee questioned whether the study had been able to estimate haemorrhagic stroke costs accurately given the lower incidence of this event than ischaemic stroke in the population, and whether the higher haemorrhagic stroke costs assumed in the model could have driven the cost-effectiveness results. The Committee heard from the ERG that the haemorrhagic stroke costs
