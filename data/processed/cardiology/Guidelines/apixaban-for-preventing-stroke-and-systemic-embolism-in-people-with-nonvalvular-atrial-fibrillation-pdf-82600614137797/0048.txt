the population, and whether the higher haemorrhagic stroke costs assumed in the model could have driven the cost-effectiveness results. The Committee heard from the ERG that the haemorrhagic stroke costs were consistent with those used in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban and that, as a small proportion of people had a haemorrhagic stroke in the model, other factors such as discontinuation rates drove the cost- effectiveness results to a greater extent than the cost of haemorrhagic stroke. The Committee also noted that an INR monitoring cost of £248 was assumed by the manufacturer, and that this was consistent with the monitoring costs used in NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dabigatran etexilate (and was updated for inflation). The Committee concluded that the costs used in the model were appropriate. 4.14 The Committee considered the results of the economic model. It noted that the manufacturer's base-case deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for apixaban compared with warfarin were £11,000 and £16,900 per QALY gained respectively, and that the ERG's revised deterministic base case, (see section 3.30) resulted in an ICER of £12,800 per QALY gained. The Committee noted that only one of the sensitivity analyses performed by the ERG (in
