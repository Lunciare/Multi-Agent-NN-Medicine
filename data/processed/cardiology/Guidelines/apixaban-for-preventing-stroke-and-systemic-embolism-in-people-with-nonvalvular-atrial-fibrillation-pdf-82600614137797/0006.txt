embolism HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.75, p=0.70). The rates of myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, were lower with apixaban than warfarin, but were not statistically significant (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17, p=0.37, and HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.10, p=0.63 respectively). Apixaban was associated with fewer all-cause deaths than warfarin, which was of borderline statistical significance (3.52% and 3.94% respectively [HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99, p=0.047]). 3.4 The manufacturer presented results for the primary efficacy outcomes for 21 pre- specified subgroups in ARISTOTLE including subgroups broken down by baseline risk of stroke or systemic embolism (grouped by CHADS scores of 1 or less; 2 2; and 3 or more). ARISTOTLE was not statistically powered to demonstrate superiority in subgroup analyses. The hazard ratios for apixaban relative to warfarin for stroke and systemic embolism in the 3 stroke risk subgroups were consistently less than 1, but the confidence intervals of the CHADS ≤1 and 2 2 groups crossed 1, meaning that that the difference between apixaban and warfarin was not statistically significant for these groups. The hazard ratios for stroke and systemic embolism in the groups of patients who received
