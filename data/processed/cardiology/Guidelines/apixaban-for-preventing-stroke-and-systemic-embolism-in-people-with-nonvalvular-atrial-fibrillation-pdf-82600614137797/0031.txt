Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

independent of treatment increased the ICER of apixaban compared with warfarin to £12,277 per QALY gained, whereas assuming bleed type was independent of treatment decreased this ICER to £9,771 per QALY gained. When all of the amendments were combined to form the ERG's revised base case, this resulted in an ICER for apixaban compared with warfarin of £12,757 per QALY Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) gained. This represented an incremental cost of £1,823 compared with warfarin for an additional 0.14 QALY. 3.31 The ERG carried out 3 further exploratory analyses that were not included in its revised base case. These were: • Age adjustment of event risks for people on second-line therapy, using the same risk adjustment factors as for people receiving first-line therapy. Dabigatran blend and rivaroxaban continued to be extendedly dominated by apixaban. The ICER for apixaban compared with warfarin fell slightly from the manufacturer's base case of £11,008 to £10,779 per QALY gained. • Removal of treatment-related disutility. Dabigatran blend and rivaroxaban continued to be extendedly dominated by apixaban but the ICER for apixaban compared with warfarin increased from £11,008 to £14,530 per QALY gained. • Changes to
