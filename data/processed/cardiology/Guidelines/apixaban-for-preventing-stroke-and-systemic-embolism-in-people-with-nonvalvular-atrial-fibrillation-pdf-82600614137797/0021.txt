that presented EQ-5D data in a population with atrial fibrillation and 3 studies that reported EQ-5D values for a variety of chronic conditions after controlling for comorbidities were included. As there were some health states for which a utility value had not been identified, studies of a population with atrial fibrillation that reported utilities elicited by methods other than the EQ-5D were screened, and data from a further 8 studies were included. One further study was identified from the reference list from the submissions for: • NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation and • NICE's technology appraisal guidance on rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation. 3.19 The manufacturer used unit costs taken from NHS reference costs 2010 to 2011 where possible. If available, Healthcare Resource Group codes specified in the costing report for atrial fibrillation from NICE's previous guideline on atrial Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) fibrillation (now replaced by NICE's guideline on atrial fibrillation) were used.
