Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

arm was 62.2% (the median was 66%) and asked the clinical specialists whether this was representative of what would be achieved in clinical practice in the UK. The Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) clinical specialists explained that there is variation in time in therapeutic range achieved between centres. One clinical specialist quoted a benchmarking study using a computerised dose adjustment system in which a mean time in therapeutic range of over 70% was achieved. Another clinical specialist stated that the time in therapeutic range observed in ARISTOTLE reflected what is generally seen in the UK, not what is observed in centres achieving the best time in therapeutic range, and that centres should aim for a time in therapeutic range for each individual of 70% and above. One clinical specialist also highlighted that in their experience people treated for atrial fibrillation tended to be older and more likely to be on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), which can impact on bleeding complications, than the ARISTOTLE population. The Committee noted the potential differences between the trial population and people treated for atrial fibrillation in the UK but concluded that the characteristics of the people
