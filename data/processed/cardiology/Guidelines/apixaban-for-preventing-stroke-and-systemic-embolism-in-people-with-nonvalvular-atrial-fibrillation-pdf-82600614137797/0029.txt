or CHADS score in the 2 manufacturer's model, but it accepted that adjusting for characteristics in Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) second-line treatment may be beyond the reasonable scope of a Markov model. 3.27 The ERG commented that utilities were not age adjusted in the manufacturer's model, meaning that a person's quality of life would be affected by events experienced but not by increasing age. The ERG considered that the assumption of equivalent disutility between the apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran may not be robust but that any resultant bias was likely to be against apixaban. 3.28 The ERG noted that the acute cost of systemic embolism in the manufacturer's model (£4,077.98) was approximately double the acute costs used in the submissions for NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran £2,772 [fatal and non-fatal acute costs]) and NICE's technology appraisal guidance on rivaroxaban (rivaroxaban £1,658). These submissions had used NHS reference costs. 3.29 For its revised base case the ERG changed some of the assumptions used in the manufacturer's model. The ERG assumed that other-cause mortality, stroke severity and bleed type were independent of the type of anticoagulant treatment received. The
