In addition, in the incremental analysis dabigatran 110 mg twice daily was dominated by the dabigatran blend and the dabigatran blend and rivaroxaban were extendedly dominated by apixaban. However, the Committee was concerned that there was considerable uncertainty about the relative treatment effects and cost effectiveness of apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran arising from differences in the baseline characteristics of the people included in the trials and the relative treatment effects attributed to the individual anticoagulants that informed the network meta-analysis. The Committee concluded that there was insufficient evidence to distinguish between the cost effectiveness of apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban at this time. 4.16 Finally, the Committee concluded that the decision about whether to start treatment with apixaban should be made after an informed discussion between the clinician and the person about the risks and benefits of apixaban compared with warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.
