difference between apixaban and warfarin was not statistically significant (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15, p=0.37). There were similar proportions of patients who experienced adverse events with apixaban (81.5%) and warfarin (83.1%) and a lower proportion of patients who experienced bleeding adverse events with apixaban (25.2%) compared with warfarin (32.7%). Serious adverse events occurred in 35.0% of patients treated with apixaban and 36.5% of patients treated with warfarin. Fewer patients stopped the study drug in the apixaban group than the warfarin group (25.3% compared with 27.5% respectively, p=0.001); 7.6% of patients in the apixaban arm and 8.4% of patients in the warfarin arm stopped treatment because of an adverse event. The safety of apixaban was maintained across patients at different levels of stroke risk, regardless of warfarin control (time in therapeutic range) and in patients who needed dose reduction. 3.6 The primary objective of AVERROES was to determine if apixaban was superior to aspirin for preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism in adults with at least 1 risk factor for stroke in whom vitamin K antagonists were unsuitable. In the intention-to-treat population apixaban reduced the rate of stroke and systemic embolism compared with aspirin over a
