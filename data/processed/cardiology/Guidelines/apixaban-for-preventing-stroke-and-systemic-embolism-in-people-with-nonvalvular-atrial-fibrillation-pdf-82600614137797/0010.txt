1 risk factor for stroke in whom vitamin K antagonists were unsuitable. In the intention-to-treat population apixaban reduced the rate of stroke and systemic embolism compared with aspirin over a mean follow-up of 1.1 years (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.62, p<0.001). The rates of disabling or fatal stroke were also lower in patients who received apixaban compared with patients who received aspirin (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.65). When considered as a Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) separate outcome apixaban reduced the rates of ischaemic stroke compared with aspirin (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55) but did not statistically significantly reduce the rates of haemorrhagic stroke (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.88, p=0.45). Apixaban was associated with a higher rate of all bleeding than aspirin (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53) and of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.78). Although apixaban was associated with higher rates of major bleeding than aspirin, this was not statistically significant (HR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.45, p=0.07). 3.7 No head-to-head data were available for apixaban compared with dabigatran etexilate (hereafter referred
