CI 0.56 to 1.06], centre time in therapeutic range 58.0% to 65.7% [HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.15], centre time in therapeutic range 65.7% to 72.2% [HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.13], centre time in therapeutic range greater than 72.2% [HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26]). 3.5 The adverse events and safety analyses were reported for the on-treatment population in ARISTOTLE (all patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication). Apixaban was superior to warfarin for the primary safety outcome of time from first dose of study drug to first occurrence of confirmed International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80; p<0.001). Apixaban resulted in significantly fewer bleeding events than warfarin for all of the major bleed types (intracranial major bleeding HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.58; other location major bleeding HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93) and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events reported by the manufacturer apart from major gastrointestinal bleeding, for which the difference between apixaban and warfarin was not statistically significant (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15, p=0.37). There were similar proportions of patients who experienced adverse events with apixaban (81.5%)
