Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

systemic embolism compared with aspirin and an increased rate of bleeding events overall, but not an increased rate of major bleeds. 4.10 The Committee discussed the indirect clinical-effectiveness evidence for apixaban compared with dabigatran (both the 110 mg twice daily dose and 150 mg twice daily dose) and rivaroxaban. The Committee noted that the manufacturer presented 2 network meta-analyses for vitamin K antagonist- suitable and -unsuitable populations (which included aspirin) respectively. The Committee noted that the ERG considered the second meta-analysis to be flawed as there were no specific data available for rivaroxaban or dabigatran for a warfarin-unsuitable population and the network meta-analysis included a mixed population including people for whom warfarin was suitable and unsuitable. The Committee considered that only the first network meta-analysis, relating to the warfarin-suitable population, was appropriate to the decision problem. The Committee noted that the population in the study comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin (ROCKET-AF) had a higher mean baseline CHADS score than the 2 population in the study comparing dabigatran with warfarin (RE-LY) or ARISTOTLE. The Committee additionally noted that the mean time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arm was lower in ROCKET-AF than in RE-LY or ARISTOTLE. The Committee considered that the
