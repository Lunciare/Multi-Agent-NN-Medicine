Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

chance whether it flows to the brain, resulting in ischaemic stroke, or to the rest of the body, causing systemic embolism. The proportion of each was therefore not a treatment effect. The Committee also heard from the clinical specialists that a particular benefit conferred by the new anticoagulants compared with warfarin was the reduction in haemorrhagic strokes. This was also shown in the ARISTOTLE trial, in which there was a statistically significant reduction in haemorrhagic stroke with apixaban compared with warfarin, whereas for the other individual components of the composite end points (ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism) there was no statistically significant difference. The Committee concluded that apixaban was more clinically effective than warfarin Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) for the primary efficacy outcome of reducing stroke and systemic embolism. 4.5 The Committee considered the results of the manufacturer's subgroup analyses from ARISTOTLE. It noted that the subgroup analysis by CHADS score comprised 2 3 groups: people with a CHADS score of 1 or less, people with a CHADS score of 2 2 2 and people with a CHADS score of 3 or over. The Committee was aware that 2 the
