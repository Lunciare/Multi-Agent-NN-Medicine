and these were now alternative treatments to warfarin. The Committee heard from the clinical specialists that aspirin is a less effective treatment than the anticoagulants but is still being prescribed for some people with atrial fibrillation despite publication of NICE's technology appraisal guidance on dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban. The Committee further heard that although AVERROES was a useful trial, the population for whom warfarin was unsuitable was very mixed, including people for whom warfarin was clinically unsuitable and those who were unwilling to take it. The Committee noted that the ERG did not consider that AVERROES met the inclusion criteria for this appraisal and had focused its critique on ARISTOTLE.

However, it noted with interest that the evidence presented in AVERROES showed that apixaban was associated with a reduced rate of stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin and an increased rate of bleeding events overall, but not an increased rate of major bleeds. 4.10 The Committee discussed the indirect clinical-effectiveness evidence for
