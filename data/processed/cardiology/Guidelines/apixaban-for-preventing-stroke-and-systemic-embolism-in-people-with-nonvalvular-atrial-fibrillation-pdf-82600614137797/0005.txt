Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

score of 2 or more. 2 3.3 In the intention-to-treat population, apixaban met non-inferiority criteria using a non-inferiority margin of 1.38, over a median follow-up of 1.8 years. Apixaban was Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) associated with a significantly lower rate of stroke and systemic embolism than warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.95, p=0.01). The rate of fatal or disabling stroke was significantly lower in the apixaban group than the warfarin group (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94). When the outcomes included in the composite primary outcome (ischaemic or uncertain type, haemorrhagic stroke and systemic embolism) were analysed separately, apixaban was associated with a significant reduction in haemorrhagic stroke compared with warfarin (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75), but the decrease for apixaban compared with warfarin in ischaemic or uncertain type stroke or systemic embolism was not statistically significant (ischaemic or uncertain type stroke HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13, p=0.42; systemic embolism HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.75, p=0.70). The rates of myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, were lower with apixaban than warfarin, but were not
