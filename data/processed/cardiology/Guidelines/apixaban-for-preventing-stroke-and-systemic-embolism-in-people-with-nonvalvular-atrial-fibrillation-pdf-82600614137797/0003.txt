review of this submission by the Evidence Review Group (ERG). 3.1 The main clinical effectiveness evidence for apixaban came from 2 international, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials, which had investigated apixaban. ARISTOTLE (n=18,201) compared apixaban (5 mg twice daily; 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) with warfarin (in patients with an international normalised ratio [INR] target range of 2.0 to 3.0). AVERROES (n=5,598) compared apixaban (5 mg twice daily; 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) with aspirin (81 mg to 324 mg once daily) in people 50 years or older with atrial fibrillation and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke for whom treatment with warfarin had failed, or for whom warfarin was unsuitable or who were unwilling to take warfarin. 3.2 The primary objective of ARISTOTLE was to determine if apixaban was non- inferior to warfarin for the combined end point of stroke and systemic embolism. Stroke included both ischaemic stroke, caused by embolism from the heart, and haemorrhagic stroke, which can be a complication of anticoagulant treatment (although it may also occur spontaneously or as a result of secondary haemorrhage into an ischaemic stroke). ARISTOTLE included adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter
