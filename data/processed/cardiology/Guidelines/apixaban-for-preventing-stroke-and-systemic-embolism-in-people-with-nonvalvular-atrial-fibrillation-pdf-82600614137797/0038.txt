of 1 or less, people with a CHADS score of 2 2 2 and people with a CHADS score of 3 or over. The Committee was aware that 2 the ERG had concerns that because people with CHADS scores of 3 to 6 had 2 been grouped together, it was not possible to comment on potential variation in treatment effect for these subgroups. The Committee concluded that there was no biologically plausible reason to indicate that the relative treatment effect would be dependent on baseline risk and that the mean CHADS score of 2.1 in 2 the trial was a reasonable reflection of the UK population currently on anticoagulant therapy. 4.6 The Committee noted that the manufacturer presented data for subgroups based on INR control using quartiles of centre time in therapeutic range. It further noted that there was a numerically lower rate of stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban compared with warfarin in all analyses broken down by centre time in therapeutic range, but that ARISTOTLE was not statistically powered to demonstrate superiority across subgroups. The Committee concluded that the evidence from subgroups based on centre time in therapeutic range was not sufficiently robust to use to formulate guidance
