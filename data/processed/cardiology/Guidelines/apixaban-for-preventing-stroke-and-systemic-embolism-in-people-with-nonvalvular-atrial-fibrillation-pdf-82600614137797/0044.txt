Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

ARISTOTLE. The Committee additionally noted that the mean time in therapeutic range in the warfarin arm was lower in ROCKET-AF than in RE-LY or ARISTOTLE. The Committee considered that the differences in baseline characteristics between the study populations meant that there was uncertainty surrounding the results of the network meta-analysis. The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis did not detect any difference between apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran in the rate of stroke or systemic embolism; showed a lower rate of all bleeding outcomes with apixaban compared with rivaroxaban and of all bleeding outcomes except intracranial haemorrhage and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (which was not measured in RE-LY) compared with dabigatran 150 mg; a lower rate of 'any bleeding' compared with dabigatran 110 mg; and a lower rate of myocardial infarction with apixaban compared with dabigatran (both doses). The Committee noted that the network meta-analysis had shown broadly similar outcomes and some differences between apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, but because of differences in the trial populations the results of the network meta-analysis should be viewed with caution. It also noted that some of the Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) criteria in the
