Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial

or haemorrhagic stroke was treatment specific (see section 3.13). In a previous appraisal the Committee had heard from experts that it was plausible and that there is evidence that strokes on warfarin were likely to be more severe than on dabigatran, but the clinical specialists for the appraisal of apixaban did not put forward any evidence that this had been substantiated and were of the opinion that at least for the newer agents, there was no biologically plausible reason or evidence that the severity of strokes would differ between apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran. The Committee concluded that although the general modelling approach was appropriate, weaknesses included the assumption that whether a person experienced an ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism was treatment related, and that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the assumption in the model that the severity of an ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke was dependent on the specific anticoagulant agent they had received. 4.12 The Committee considered the utility values used in the model. The Committee noted that ARISTOTLE had not assessed health-related quality of life and that the utility values used in the manufacturer's model were identified through a systematic review. The Committee questioned whether the manufacturer's
