bleeding than aspirin, this was not statistically significant (HR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.45, p=0.07). 3.7 No head-to-head data were available for apixaban compared with dabigatran etexilate (hereafter referred to as dabigatran) or rivaroxaban. The manufacturer used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo stimulation in WinBUGS to conduct 2 network meta-analyses using a fixed-effect model. The first meta-analysis included patients for whom vitamin K antagonist treatment was suitable and it compared apixaban, warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. The second meta- analysis was intended to assess a population of patients for whom vitamin K antagonists were unsuitable, comparing apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and aspirin. 3.8 The first meta-analysis included ARISTOTLE, RE-LY and ROCKET-AF trials. RE-LY compared dabigatran (150 mg and 110 mg twice daily) with warfarin. ROCKET-AF compared rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) with warfarin. There were differences between the trials of apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban: ARISTOTLE and ROCKET-AF were double-blind, double-dummy trials, whereas RE-LY was an open-label trial; the population in ROCKET-AF had a higher stroke or systemic embolism risk at baseline (baseline CHADS of 3.6 [ROCKET-AF], 2 2.1 [ARISTOTLE], 2.1 [RE-LY]) and the mean percentage time in therapeutic range was lower in ROCKET-AF (55%) than in ARISTOTLE (62%) and RE-LY
