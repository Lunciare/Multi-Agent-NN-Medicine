meta-analysis should be viewed with caution. It also noted that some of the Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (TA275) criteria in the network meta-analysis were in fact not a direct treatment effect, such as the proportion of ischaemic stroke compared with systemic embolism, and evidence was lacking that the severity of an ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke was treatment specific for the new agents. The Committee concluded that the network meta-analysis results should be interpreted in the light of these uncertainties and were not sufficiently robust to reliably differentiate between apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran. 4.11 The Committee considered the manufacturer's economic model and the exploratory analyses performed by the ERG. It agreed with the ERG that the general modelling approach was reasonable and consistent with other analyses of atrial fibrillation treatments. The Committee noted the discussion on the proportion of ischaemic stroke compared with systemic embolism being unrelated to the treatment (see section 4.4). It also questioned whether the severity of an ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke was treatment specific (see section 3.13). In a previous appraisal the Committee had heard from experts that it was plausible and that there is evidence that strokes
