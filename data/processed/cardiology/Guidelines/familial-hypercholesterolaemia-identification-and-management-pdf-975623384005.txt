Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
This guideline is the basis of QS41.
Overview
This guideline covers identifying and managing familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), a
specific type of high cholesterol that runs in the family, in children, young people and
adults. It aims to help identify people at increased risk of coronary heart disease as a
result of having FH.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Commissioners and providers
• Children, young people and adults, and their families and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Case finding and diagnosis
See also the section on information needs and support.
1.1.1 Suspect familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) as a possible diagnosis in adults
with:
• a total cholesterol level greater than 7.5 mmol/l or
• a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event
before 60 years in an index individual or first-degree relative). [2008,
amended 2019]
1.1.2 Systematically search primary care records for people:
• younger than 30 years, with a total cholesterol concentration greater than
7.5 mmol/l and
• 30 years or older, with a total cholesterol concentration greater than
9.0 mmol/l
as these are the people who are at highest risk of FH. [2017]
1.1.3 For people with a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
(an event before 60 years in an index individual or first-degree relative), but
whose total cholesterol is unknown, offer to measure their total cholesterol.
[2017]
1.1.4 Healthcare professionals should exclude secondary causes of
hypercholesterolaemia before a diagnosis of FH is considered. [2008]
1.1.5 Use the Simon Broome criteria (see appendix F of the full guideline) or Dutch
Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria to make a clinical diagnosis of FH in primary
care settings. This should be done by a healthcare professional competent in
using the criteria. [2017]
1.1.6 Refer the person to an FH specialist service for DNA testing if they meet the
Simon Broome criteria for possible or definite FH, or they have a DLCN score
greater than 5. [2017]
1.1.7 Healthcare professionals should be aware that the absence of clinical signs (for
example, tendon xanthomata) in adults and children and young people does not
exclude a diagnosis of FH. [2008]
1.1.8 Healthcare professionals should consider a clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH
in adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration greater
than 13 mmol/l and in children and young people with an LDL-C concentration
greater than 11 mmol/l. All people with a clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH
should be offered referral to a specialist centre. [2008]
1.1.9 To confirm a diagnosis of FH, healthcare professionals should undertake
2 measurements of LDL-C concentration because biological and analytical
variability occurs. [2008]
1.1.10 When considering a diagnosis of FH, healthcare professionals with expertise in
FH should use standardised pedigree terminology to document, when possible, at
least a three-generation pedigree. This should include relatives' age of onset of
coronary heart disease, lipid concentrations and smoking history. For deceased
relatives, the age and cause of death, and smoking history should be
documented. If possible, the index individual should verify this information with
other family members. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
1.1.11 Ultrasonography of the Achilles tendon is not recommended in the diagnosis of
FH. [2008]
1.1.12 Coronary heart disease risk estimation tools, such as QRISK2 and those based on
the Framingham algorithm, should not be used because people with FH are
already at a high risk of premature coronary heart disease. [2008, amended
2017]
1.1.13 Inform all people who have an identified mutation diagnostic of FH that they have
an unequivocal diagnosis of FH even if their LDL-C concentration does not meet
the diagnostic criteria (see recommendation 1.1.5). [2008, amended 2017]
1.1.14 In a family where a DNA mutation is identified, not all family members may have
inherited the mutation. When DNA testing has excluded FH in a member of a
family, healthcare professionals should manage the person's coronary heart
disease risk as in the general population (see NICE's guideline on cardiovascular
disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification). [2008]
1.1.15 In children aged 0 to 10 years at risk of FH because of 1 affected parent, offer a
DNA test at the earliest opportunity. If testing of a child at risk has not been
undertaken by the age of 10 years, offer an additional opportunity for a DNA test.
[2017]
1.1.16 In children at risk of homozygous FH because of 2 affected parents or because of
the presence of clinical signs, for example, cutaneous lipid deposits
(xanthomata), LDL-C concentration should be measured before the age of
5 years or at the earliest opportunity thereafter. If the LDL-C concentration is
greater than 11 mmol/l then a clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH should be
considered. [2008]
1.2 Identifying people with FH using cascade testing
1.2.1 Carry out cascade testing using DNA testing to identify affected first- and
second- and, when possible, third-degree biological relatives of people with a
genetic diagnosis of FH. [2017]

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 8 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
1.2.2 Healthcare professionals should offer all people with FH a referral to a specialist
with expertise in FH for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of cascade
testing. [2008]
1.2.3 Healthcare professionals with expertise in FH should explain what is meant by
cascade testing, and discuss its implications with all people with FH. [2008]
1.2.4 Healthcare professionals should be aware of the latest guidance on data
protection when undertaking cascade testing. [2008]
1.3 Management
1.3.1 Drug treatment
Adults
Recommendations 1.3.1.4 to 1.3.1.9 have been adapted from NICE's technology
appraisal guidance on ezetimibe for treating primary (heterozygous-familial and non-
familial) hypercholesterolaemia.
1.3.1.1 When offering lipid-modifying drug therapy to adults with FH, healthcare
professionals should inform the person that this treatment should be lifelong.
[2008].
1.3.1.2 Offer a high-intensity statin with the lowest acquisition cost as the initial
treatment for all adults with FH and aim for at least a 50% reduction in LDL-C
concentration from the baseline measurement. [2017]
1.3.1.3 The dose of statin should be increased to the maximum licensed or tolerated
dose to achieve a recommended reduction in LDL-C concentration of greater
than 50% from baseline (that is, LDL-C concentration before treatment). [2008]
1.3.1.4 Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary
heterozygous-familial hypercholesterolaemia in adults in whom initial statin

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 9 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
therapy is contraindicated. [2016]
1.3.1.5 Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary
heterozygous-familial hypercholesterolaemia in adults who cannot tolerate statin
therapy (as defined in recommendation 1.3.1.9). [2016]
1.3.1.6 Ezetimibe, co-administered with initial statin therapy, is recommended as an
option for treating primary (heterozygous-familial) hypercholesterolaemia in
adults who have started statin therapy when:
• serum total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration is not
appropriately controlled (as defined in recommendation 1.3.1.8) either after
appropriate dose titration of initial statin therapy or because dose titration is
limited by intolerance to the initial statin therapy (as defined in
recommendation 1.3.1.9) and
• a change from initial statin therapy to an alternative statin is being
considered. [2016]
1.3.1.7 When prescribing ezetimibe co-administered with a statin, ezetimibe should be
prescribed on the basis of lowest acquisition cost. [2016]
1.3.1.8 For the purposes of this guidance, appropriate control of cholesterol
concentrations should be based on individualised risk assessment according to
national guidance on managing cardiovascular disease in the relevant
populations. [2016]
1.3.1.9 For the purposes of this guidance, intolerance to initial statin therapy is defined
as the presence of clinically significant adverse effects that represent an
unacceptable risk to the patient or that may reduce compliance with therapy.
[2016]
1.3.1.10 Prescribing of drug therapy for adults with homozygous FH should be undertaken
within a specialist centre. [2008]
1.3.1.11 Healthcare professionals should offer adults with FH a referral to a specialist with
expertise in FH if treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of a high-intensity
statin and ezetimibe does not achieve a recommended reduction in LDL-C

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 10 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
concentration of greater than 50% from baseline (that is, LDL-C concentration
before treatment). [2008]
1.3.1.12 Healthcare professionals should offer adults with FH a referral to a specialist with
expertise in FH for consideration for further treatment if they are assessed to be
at very high risk of a coronary event, that is, if they have any of the following.
• Established coronary heart disease.
• A family history of premature coronary heart disease.
• Two or more other cardiovascular risk factors (for example, they are male,
they smoke, or they have hypertension or diabetes). [2008]
1.3.1.13 For recommendations on managing primary heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolaemia in people whose LDL-C levels are not adequately
controlled despite maximal tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, see the NICE
technology appraisal guidance on alirocumab and evolocumab. [2017]
1.3.1.14 Adults with FH with intolerance or contraindications to statins or ezetimibe
should be offered a referral to a specialist with expertise in FH for consideration
for treatment with either a bile acid sequestrant (resin) or a fibrate to reduce their
LDL-C concentration. [2008, amended 2017]
1.3.1.15 The decision to offer treatment with a bile acid sequestrant (resin) or a fibrate in
addition to initial statin therapy should be taken by a specialist with expertise in
FH. [2008, amended 2017]
1.3.1.16 Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when adding a fibrate to a
statin because of the risk of muscle-related side effects (including
rhabdomyolysis). Gemfibrozil and statins should not be used together. [2008,
amended 2017]
Children and young people
1.3.1.17 Healthcare professionals should offer all children and young people diagnosed
with, or being investigated for, a diagnosis of FH a referral to a specialist with

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
expertise in FH in children and young people. This should be in an appropriate
child and young person-focused setting that meets the standards within the
National service framework for children, young people and maternity services.
[2008]
1.3.1.18 Lipid-modifying drug therapy for a child or young person with FH should usually
be considered by the age of 10 years. The decision to defer or offer lipid-
modifying drug therapy for a child or young person should take into account:
• their age
• the age of onset of coronary heart disease within the family, and
• the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, including their LDL-C
concentration. [2008]
1.3.1.19 When offering lipid-modifying drug therapy for children or young people,
healthcare professionals should inform the child or young person and their parent
or carer that this treatment should be lifelong. [2008]
1.3.1.20 Offer statins to children with FH by the age of 10 years or at the earliest
opportunity thereafter. [2017]
1.3.1.21 For children and young people with FH, consider a statin that is licensed for use
in the appropriate age group. [2017]
1.3.1.22 Statin therapy for children and young people should be initiated by a healthcare
professional with expertise in treating children and young people with FH, and in
a child-focused setting. [2008, amended 2017]
1.3.1.23 Statin therapy for children and young people with FH should usually be
prescribed at the doses specified in the 'British national formulary (BNF) for
children'. [2008]
1.3.1.24 In exceptional instances, for example, when there is a family history of coronary
heart disease in early adulthood, healthcare professionals with expertise in FH in
children and young people should consider offering:
• a higher dose of statin than is licensed for use in the appropriate age group

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
and/or
• more than 1 lipid-modifying drug therapy and/or
• lipid-modifying drug therapy before the age of 10 years. [2008]
1.3.1.25 In children and young people with homozygous FH, LDL-C concentration may be
lowered by lipid-modifying drug therapy and this should be considered before
LDL apheresis (see the section on specialist treatment). [2008]
1.3.1.26 In children and young people with FH who are intolerant of statins, healthcare
professionals should consider offering other lipid-modifying drug therapies
capable of reducing LDL-C concentration (such as bile acid sequestrants [resins],
fibrates or ezetimibe). [2008]
1.3.1.27 Routine monitoring of growth and pubertal development in children and young
people with FH is recommended. [2008]
Adults and children and young people
1.3.1.28 Decisions about the choice of treatment should be made following discussion
with the adult or child and young person and their parent or carer, and be
informed by consideration of concomitant medication, comorbidities, safety and
tolerability. [2008]
1.3.1.29 Healthcare professionals should consider offering fat-soluble vitamin (vitamins A,
D and K) and folic acid supplementation for adults or children and young people
with FH who are receiving long-term treatment with bile acid sequestrants
(resins). [2008]
1.3.1.30 Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH a referral to a specialist
with expertise in FH if they are experiencing side effects that compromise
concordance with lipid-modifying drug therapy. [2008]
1.3.1.31 When the decision has been made to offer adults or children and young people
with FH treatment with a statin, baseline liver and muscle enzymes (including
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 12 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 13 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
transaminases and creatine kinase, respectively) should be measured before
initiation of therapy. However, people with raised liver or muscle enzymes should
not routinely be excluded from statin therapy. [2008]
1.3.1.32 Routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not recommended in asymptomatic
adults or children and young people with FH who are receiving treatment with a
statin. [2008]
1.3.2 Lifestyle interventions
1.3.2.1 Healthcare professionals should regard lifestyle advice as a component of
medical management, and not as a substitute for lipid-modifying drug therapy.
[2008]
Diet
1.3.2.2 All people with FH should be offered individualised nutritional advice from a
healthcare professional with specific expertise in nutrition. [2008]
1.3.2.3 People with FH should be advised to consume a diet in which:
• total fat intake is 30% or less of total energy intake
• saturated fats are 10% or less of total energy intake
• intake of dietary cholesterol is less than 300 mg/day
• saturated fats are replaced by increasing the intake of monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats.
It may be helpful to suggest they look at NHS Live Well for further practical
advice. [2008]
1.3.2.4 Healthcare professionals should advise people with FH to eat at least 5 portions
of fruit and vegetables a day, in line with national guidance for the general
population. Examples of what constitutes a portion can be found at NHS Live

Well. [2008]
1.3.2.5 Healthcare professionals should advise people with FH to consume at least
2 portions of fish a week (1 of which should be oily fish). Pregnant women with
FH should be advised to limit their oily fish to 2 portions a week. Further
information and advice on healthy cooking methods can be found at NHS Live
Well. [2008]
1.3.2.6 Healthcare professionals should advise people with FH that if they wish to
consume food products containing stanols and sterols these need to be taken
consistently to be effective. [2008]
1.3.2.7 People with FH should not routinely be recommended to take omega-3 fatty acid
supplements. For people with FH who have already had a myocardial infarction
(MI), refer to the NICE guideline on acute coronary syndromes. [2008]
Physical activity
1.3.2.8 Healthcare professionals should advise people with FH to undertake physical
activity in line with national guidance for the general population (see the UK Chief
Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines for more information). [2008]
1.3.2.9 Healthcare professionals should encourage people who are unable to perform
moderate-intensity physical activity because of comorbidity, medical conditions
or personal circumstances to exercise at their maximum safe capacity (see the
UK Chief Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines for more information).
[2008]
1.3.2.10 Recommended types of physical activity include those that can be incorporated
into everyday life, such as brisk walking, using stairs and cycling (see the UK
Chief Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines for more information). [2008]
Weight management
1.3.2.11 Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH who are overweight or

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 15 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
obese appropriate advice and support to achieve and maintain a healthy weight
in line with NICE's guideline on overweight and obesity management. [2008]
Alcohol consumption
1.3.2.12 As for the general population, alcohol consumption for adult men with FH should
be limited to up to 3 to 4 units a day, and for adult women with FH up to 2 to
3 units of alcohol a day. Binge drinking should be avoided. Further information
can be found at NHS Live Well. [2008]
Smoking advice
1.3.2.13 People with FH, especially children, who do not smoke should be strongly
discouraged from starting because of their already greatly increased risk of
coronary heart disease. [2008]
1.3.2.14 People with FH who smoke should be advised that, because of their already
greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease, they should stop. [2008]
1.3.2.15 Healthcare professionals should offer people who want to stop smoking support
and advice, and referral to an intensive support service, in line with NICE
guidance on smoking cessation. [2008]
1.3.2.16 People with FH who are unwilling or unable to accept a referral to an intensive
support service should be offered pharmacotherapy in line with NICE guidance
on nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion, and varenicline. See NICE
guidance on smoking cessation, including NICE's technology appraisal guidance
on varenicline for smoking cessation. [2008]
1.3.3 Specialist treatment
LDL-lowering apheresis
1.3.3.1 Healthcare professionals should consider offering LDL apheresis for the
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 15 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 16 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
treatment of adults and children and young people with homozygous FH (see
recommendations 1.1.8 and 1.1.16). The timing of initiation of LDL apheresis should
depend on factors such as the person's response to lipid-modifying drug therapy
and presence of coronary heart disease. [2008]
1.3.3.2 In exceptional instances (such as when there is progressive, symptomatic
coronary heart disease, despite maximal tolerated lipid-modifying drug therapy
and optimal medical and surgical therapy), healthcare professionals should
consider offering LDL apheresis for the treatment of people with heterozygous
FH. This should take place in a specialist centre on a case-by-case basis and
data recorded in an appropriate registry. [2008]
1.3.3.3 Healthcare professionals should recommend arterio-venous fistulae as the
preferred method of access for people with FH who are offered treatment with
LDL apheresis. People should be counselled about possible benefits and
complications of this procedure. [2008]
1.3.3.4 Routine monitoring of the person's iron status should be carried out and iron
supplementation initiated as required for people with FH who are receiving
treatment with LDL apheresis. [2008]
1.3.3.5 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should not be used in people
with FH who are being treated with LDL apheresis. Instead, ACE inhibitors should
be substituted with angiotensin-receptor blocking agents. [2008]
1.3.3.6 People with FH who are receiving blood pressure-lowering drug therapy should
have this reviewed and considered for discontinuation on the morning of the day
of LDL apheresis. [2008]
1.3.3.7 People with FH who are taking warfarin should have this discontinued
approximately 4 days before LDL apheresis and substituted with low molecular
weight heparin. [2008]
1.3.3.8 People with FH who are receiving anti-platelet therapy should have this
continued if they are receiving treatment with LDL apheresis. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
Liver transplantation
1.3.3.9 Healthcare professionals should consider offering liver transplantation as an
option for the treatment of people with homozygous FH after treatment with
lipid-modifying drug therapy and LDL apheresis. [2008]
1.3.3.10 The decision to refer for liver transplantation should take place in partnership
with the patient and/or their relatives in an appropriate specialist setting,
following a discussion of the benefits and potential harms of undertaking or
declining transplantation. [2008]
1.4 Information needs and support
1.4.1 General information and support
1.4.1.1 During the assessment and communication of familial risk, people should receive
clear and appropriate educational information about FH, the process of family
testing, DNA testing and the measurement of LDL-C concentration. [2008]
1.4.1.2 A healthcare professional with expertise in FH should provide information to
people with FH on their specific level of risk of coronary heart disease, its
implications for them and their families, lifestyle advice and treatment options.
[2008]
1.4.1.3 Healthcare professionals with expertise in FH should encourage people with FH
to contact their relatives to inform them of their potential risk and so that
cascade testing can take place. [2008]
1.4.1.4 When considering cascade testing, a healthcare professional with expertise in FH
should offer to facilitate the sharing of information about FH with family
members. [2008]
1.4.1.5 Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH and their families written
advice and information about patient support groups. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
1.4.2 Information and counselling on contraception for women
and girls with FH
1.4.2.1 When lipid-modifying drug therapy is first considered for women and girls, the
risks for future pregnancy and the fetus while taking lipid-modifying drug therapy
should be discussed. This discussion should be revisited at least annually. [2008]
1.4.2.2 Healthcare professionals should give women and girls with FH specific
information tailored to their needs and should offer a choice of effective
contraceptive methods. [2008]
1.4.2.3 Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are not generally contraindicated for
women and girls being treated with lipid-modifying drug therapy. However,
because there is a potential small increased risk of cardiovascular events with the
use of COCs, healthcare professionals should consider other forms of
contraception. Prescribers should refer to the summary of product characteristics
of COCs and the relevant lipid-modifying drugs for their specific
contraindications. [2008]
1.4.3 Information for pregnant women with FH
1.4.3.1 Healthcare professionals should be aware that, in general, there is no reason to
advise against pregnancy or breastfeeding in women with FH. [2008]
1.4.3.2 Healthcare professionals should advise women with FH that lipid-modifying drug
therapy should not be taken if they are planning to conceive or during pregnancy,
because of the potential risk of fetal abnormality. Women should be advised that
lipid-modifying drug therapy should be stopped 3 months before they attempt to
conceive. [2008]
1.4.3.3 Women with FH who conceive while taking statins or other systemically absorbed
lipid-modifying drug therapy should be advised to stop treatment immediately
and they should be offered an urgent referral to an obstetrician for a fetal
assessment. Women should be fully informed about the nature and purpose of
the assessment. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
1.4.3.4 Women with FH who have conceived while taking statins or other systemically
absorbed lipid-modifying drug therapy and have had a fetal assessment should
be given time, opportunity and full information to consider their options (including
the advantages and disadvantages) of continuing with their pregnancy. [2008]
1.4.3.5 Shared-care arrangements, to include expertise in cardiology and obstetrics,
should be made for women with FH who are considering pregnancy or are
pregnant. Such care should include an assessment of coronary heart disease risk,
particularly to exclude aortic stenosis. This is essential for women with
homozygous FH. [2008]
1.4.3.6 Serum cholesterol concentrations should not be measured routinely during
pregnancy. [2008]
1.4.3.7 Women with FH who are pregnant should be advised on the potential risks and
benefits of re-starting lipid-modifying drug therapy for the mother and breastfed
infant. Resins are the only lipid-modifying drug therapy that should be considered
during lactation. [2008]
1.5 Ongoing assessment and monitoring
1.5.1 Review
1.5.1.1 All people with FH should be offered a regular structured review that is carried
out at least annually. [2008]
1.5.1.2 A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should be considered for adults with FH.
[2008]
1.5.1.3 Healthcare professionals should record the progress of cascade testing among
the relatives of a person with FH as part of the structured review. This should
include at least the first- and second-degree relatives- and, when possible, third-
degree biological relatives. If there are still relatives who have not been tested,
further action should be discussed. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
1.5.1.4 Healthcare professionals should update the family pedigree of a person with FH
and note any changes in the coronary heart disease status of their relatives as
part of the structured review. This should include at least the first- and second-
and, when possible, third-degree biological relatives. [2008]
1.5.1.5 Structured review should include assessment of any symptoms of coronary heart
disease and smoking status, a fasting lipid profile, and discussion about
concordance with medication, possible side effects of treatment the patient may
be experiencing, and any changes in lifestyle or lipid-modifying drug therapy that
may be required to achieve the recommended LDL-C concentration (see the
section on management). [2008]
1.5.2 Referral for evaluation of coronary heart disease
1.5.2.1 Healthcare professionals should offer people with FH an urgent referral to a
specialist with expertise in cardiology for evaluation if they have symptoms or
signs of possible coronary heart disease which are not immediately life-
threatening. A low threshold for referral is recommended. [2008]
1.5.2.2 A person with FH with symptoms or signs of possible coronary heart disease
which are immediately life-threatening (for example, acute coronary syndrome)
should be referred to hospital as an emergency in line with advice for the general
population. [2008]
1.5.2.3 Healthcare professionals should consider offering people with FH a referral for
evaluation of coronary heart disease if they have a family history of coronary
heart disease in early adulthood, or 2 or more other cardiovascular risk factors
(for example, they are male, they smoke, or they have hypertension or diabetes).
[2008]
1.5.2.4 Upon diagnosis, healthcare professionals should offer all adults and children and
young people with homozygous FH a referral for an evaluation of coronary heart
disease. [2008]
1.5.2.5 In asymptomatic children and young people with heterozygous FH, evaluation of
coronary heart disease is unlikely to detect clinically significant disease and

referral should not be routinely offered. [2008]
Terms used in this guideline
Adults with FH
For the purposes of this guideline, 'adults' includes all persons with familial
hypercholesterolaemia (FH; heterozygous or homozygous) who are 16 years and older.
Cascade testing
Cascade testing is a mechanism for identifying people at risk of a genetic condition by a
process of family tracing. For FH, the test employed is a DNA test where a disease-
causing mutation has been identified in the index individual or proband.
Children and young people
For the purposes of this guideline, 'children' refers to persons younger than 10 years;
'young people' refers to persons from 10 years of age up to the age of 15 years. The
definitions used here are not prescriptive and healthcare professionals are expected to
exercise their judgement and consider the wishes of the patients, and their families or
carers when interpreting these terms in individual instances.
Child-focused setting
Child-focused refers to valuing the child's view and validating their voice in making
decisions impacting their lives. A child-focused facility or space is one designed from the
viewpoint of the service recipients.
Coronary heart disease
An event is defined as angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, need for
coronary artery bypass grafting, need for percutaneous coronary intervention or definite
coronary artery disease on coronary angiography.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria or score
A method of assessing whether a person has FH. It is based on personal and family
medical history, clinical signs, LDL-C concentration and DNA testing. A score is attributed
to each component; the higher the score, the higher the likelihood of the person having
FH.
Family history
The structure and relationships within the family that relates information about diseases in
family members.
First-degree relative
A person's biological parents, brothers and sisters, and children.
Heterozygous FH
High LDL-C concentration in the blood caused by an inherited mutation from 1 parent only.
People with FH are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
High-intensity statin
The following doses for statins are high intensity, based on the percentage reduction in
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol they can produce:
• atorvastatin: 20 mg to 80 mg
• rosuvastatin: 10 mg to 40 mg
Homozygous FH
Very high LDL-C concentration in the blood caused by an inherited mutation from both
parents. When a person inherits exactly the same affected gene from both parents this is
called truly 'homozygous' FH. When the mutations in the LDL receptor gene (or equivalent)
are different, this state is called 'compound heterozygous'. In general, the overall effect in
both states is similar, in that LDL-C concentrations are very high. Both groups of patients
have the same clinical pattern and high risk of cardiovascular disease.

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 23 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
For clinical purposes, both homozygous FH and compound heterozygous FH can be
regarded as behaving in a similar manner. Therefore, for the purposes of this guideline the
term 'homozygous FH' is used to also encompass compound heterozygous FH.
Index individual (synonymous with 'proband')
The original patient who is the starting point for follow-up of other members of a family
when investigating for possible causative genetic factors of the presenting condition.
Lipid measurements, concentrations and levels
These terms refer to the measurement of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C. LDL-C is not usually measured directly
but calculated from the TC, TGs and HDL-C, ideally using a fasting sample.
Such tests are usually done in a clinical biochemistry laboratory.
Mutation
An identified change in the DNA sequence of a gene that is predicted to damage the
normal function of the gene and so cause disease.
Pedigree
A method of characterising the relatives of an index individual or case and their family
relationship as well as problems or illnesses within the family. This information, often
represented graphically as a family tree, facilitates analysis of inheritance patterns. Study
of a trait or disease begins with the affected person (the index individual). The pedigree is
drawn as the relatives are described. One begins with the siblings of the index individual
and proceeds to the parents; relatives of the parents, including brothers, sisters, nephews,
nieces, grandparents, and so on. At least 3 generations are usually included. Illnesses,
hospitalisations, causes of death, miscarriages, abortions, congenital anomalies, and any
other unusual features are recorded.
Premature coronary heart disease
For the purpose of this guideline, this refers to a coronary event that has occurred before

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 24 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
60 years of age in an index individual or first-degree relative.
Proband
The affected (index) individual through whom a family with a genetic disorder is
ascertained.
Second-degree relative
A person's biological grandparent, grandchild, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, half-sister or
half-brother.
Secondary causes of hypercholesterolaemia
Causes of hyperlipidaemia other than familial, including uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
obesity, excess alcohol consumption, untreated hypothyroidism and some medications, for
example, thiazide diuretics and ciclosporin.
Specialist centre
The definition of a specialist centre is not rigid and is based on a combination of patient
treatment services, numbers and ages of people attending there, the presence of a multi-
disciplinary team (which may include, for example, physicians, lipidologists, specialist
nurses, pharmacists and dietitians), the ability to manage the more unusual manifestations
of the condition and the additional functions such as research, education and standard
setting. Care is supervised by expert healthcare professionals but shared with local
hospitals and primary care teams. Although details of the model may vary between
patients and areas, the key is that specialist supervision oversees local provision with the
patient seen at diagnosis for initial assessment and then at least annually for review.
Tendon xanthomata
A clinically detectable nodularity and/or thickening of the tendons caused by infiltration
with lipid-laden histiocytes (macrophages in connective tissue).
A distinctive feature of FH that most frequently affects the Achilles tendons but can also
involve tendons on the back of the hands, elbows and knees.

Third-degree biological relative
A person's biological great grandparent, great grandchild, great aunt, great uncle, first
cousin, grandnephew or grandniece.
Urgent referral
For the purposes of this guideline, urgent referral is as soon as possible with a maximum of
14 days.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
Recommendations for research
The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.
As part of the 2017 update, the standing committee made research recommendations on
using different thresholds of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration in
primary care case finding and on long-term monitoring of sub-clinical atherosclerosis in
children with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) who are treated with statins (see below).
The committee also made 3 other research recommendations, on secondary care case
finding, cascade testing and the use of clinical scoring criteria. One research
recommendation on identification using clinical registers was removed. Details can be
found in the evidence reviews.
1 Using different thresholds of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in primary
care case finding
What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using different thresholds of LDL-C
concentration in primary care case finding?
Why this is important
The clinical community recognises that FH is underdiagnosed, with prevalence more likely
to be approximately 1 in 250 rather than the widely cited 1 in 500. Searching electronic
primary care databases is an effective way of identifying people with FH. One of the ways
in which people are identified through electronic primary care database searching is to
search using total cholesterol or LDL-C concentration. Currently, the entire evidence base
for identifying cohorts of people with FH through primary care case finding uses a total
cholesterol concentration cut-off of 9.3 mmol/l. This is a very high concentration and
anecdotal evidence suggests that this identifies older people but may miss younger
people with FH. This could lead to missed opportunities to identify and treat people with
FH at an earlier age. Research is needed to identify whether using different total
cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations to identify people with FH through primary care
database searching affects the diagnostic yield of FH. Additionally, there is a lack of data
on the ethnicity, age and triglyceride concentration of people with FH identified through

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 27 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
primary care database searching. These should be included as outcomes in future
research. [2017]
2 Long-term monitoring of sub-clinical
atherosclerosis in children with FH who are treated
with statin therapy
What are the long-term effects of statin therapy on sub-clinical atherosclerosis in children
with FH who are treated with statin therapy?
Why this is important
Although statins are increasing in use, there is still a lack of data on the long-term effects
of statins in children. It is particularly important to determine any long-term adverse
effects of statin treatment in a population with FH, as people generally take statins for the
rest of their lives once treatment starts. [2017]
3 Lipid-modifying drug therapy in children
What is the clinical effectiveness and safety of differing doses of lipid-modifying therapy in
children with FH?
Why this is important
There have been no published studies to establish target serum LDL-C concentration in
treated children with FH receiving lipid-modifying drug therapy. Treatment is
recommended from 10 years onwards; however, this lack of data prevents a
recommendation regarding the aim of pharmacological treatment on serum LDL-C
concentrations.
Research (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) should assess the evidence of end-organ
involvement (for example, carotid intima medial thickness [IMT]) to determine at which age
abnormalities can first be seen in children. The aim would be to identify a threshold effect,
with an LDL-C concentration below which carotid IMT is normal and where thickening is
absent, and above which it is abnormal and where thickening is observed. Outcomes
should include fasting serum total and LDL-C concentration, carotid artery IMT, and

growth and pubertal development. [2008]
4 LDL apheresis for people with heterozygous FH
What are the appropriate indications, effectiveness and safety of LDL apheresis in people
with heterozygous FH?
Why this is important
There is limited evidence to inform specific indications for LDL apheresis in people with
heterozygous FH. In addition, there is limited published evidence on the cardiovascular
outcome of such patients treated with LDL apheresis.
Evidence on the value of investigations (various measures of vascular status, considered
to reflect the extent or activity of atherosclerotic vascular disease of the coronary arteries)
in predicting outcome from LDL apheresis should ideally be based on evidence from
randomised controlled trials with clinical outcomes. It is difficult to identify a suitable
alternative treatment because LDL apheresis is generally only considered in people for
whom no other treatment is available. One comparator may be novel therapies with
antisense oligonucleotides (ApoB).
A national register should be established for all people with FH who are referred for and/or
are undergoing LDL apheresis. Data should be collected on the natural history of FH and
the temporal relationship of clinical and vascular features in relation to treatments and
other parameters. [2008]
5 Pregnancy in women with FH
What are the implications of FH for the safety of a mother during pregnancy and what are
the risks of fetal malformations attributable to pharmacological therapies?
Why this is important
There is little information on the outcomes of pregnancy in women with FH. A small
number of conflicting studies have suggested a small increase in fetal abnormalities if the
mother has taken statins during the first trimester, but there are not sufficient data to
provide an accurate estimate of the level of risk. There is also limited information on the

conditions#notice-of-rights). 33
--- Страница 29 ---
Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
risk of pregnancy (including cardiac death) in a woman with FH.
Data on the incidence of cardiac problems in pregnancy and incidence of fetal
malformation would inform future recommendations. This could reduce uncertainty for
women, and help to identify risks during the pregnancy that could be better managed. The
only feasible research method to address these questions is an observational longitudinal
study following women with FH and other women (not diagnosed with FH) using statins
through their pregnancies using a national register. [2008]
6 Cardiovascular evaluation for people with FH
What is the utility of routine cardiovascular evaluation for asymptomatic people with FH?
Why this is important
Because of their inherent high risk of developing premature coronary heart disease, a low
threshold of suspicion for coronary disease is recommended for people with FH. Routine
monitoring to detect sub-clinical atherosclerosis should be non-invasive, sensitive,
specific and cost effective. Research to assess the prevalence of both asymptomatic
coronary and non-coronary atherosclerosis in people with definite heterozygous FH is
required.
As well as exercise, electrocardiogram (ECG) testing followed by stress echocardiography
before possible angiography in people with an abnormal exercise test and ankle brachial
pressure measures, research should include MRI in addition to other modalities such as
carotid IMT and coronary calcification. Outcomes should include changes in exercise ECG
or ankle brachial pressure testing, IMT or calcification over time.
Consideration should also be given to the feasibility of conducting a long-term randomised
trial to compare the differences in morbidity or mortality attributable to early diagnosis
using routine monitoring or symptom-based investigation. [2008]

Familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification and management (CG71)
Context
In some people, a high cholesterol concentration in the blood is caused by an inherited
genetic defect known as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). A raised cholesterol
concentration in the blood is present from birth and may lead to early development of
atherosclerotic disease like coronary heart disease. The disease shows an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance, being transmitted from generation to generation in such a
way that siblings and children of a person with FH have a 50% risk of inheriting FH.
Most people with FH have inherited a defective gene for FH from only 1 parent and are
therefore heterozygous. Rarely, a person will inherit a genetic defect from both parents
and will have homozygous FH or compound heterozygous FH, which will be collectively
termed homozygous FH for the purpose of this guideline.
The prevalence of heterozygous FH in the UK population is estimated to be somewhere
between 1 in 250 and 1 in 500, which means that between approximately 130,000 and
260,000 people are affected. The elevated serum cholesterol concentration that
characterises heterozygous FH leads to a greater than 50% risk of coronary heart disease
in men by the age of 50 years and at least 30% in women by the age of 60 years.
Homozygous FH is rare, with symptoms appearing in childhood, and is associated with
early death from coronary heart disease. Homozygous FH has an incidence of
approximately 1 case per 1 million.
The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product
characteristics to inform their decisions for individual patients.
In 2017, the areas on case finding, diagnosis and pharmacological monotherapy (statin
versus placebo) were updated. Since the original guideline was published in 2008,
cascade testing may now be more cost effective, and DNA diagnosis technology has
changed greatly. In addition, more evidence has been identified on the use of high-
intensity statins, and on the safety profile of statins in children and young people.

Update information
October 2019: Recommendation 1.1.1 was amended to be clearer about when to suspect
familial hypercholesterolaemia.
November 2017: We reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on case
finding, diagnosis and statin monotherapy. These recommendations are marked [2017].
We also made some changes without an evidence review:
• Some wording was updated to emphasise that familial hypercholesterolaemia should
be thought about as a potential diagnosis.
• A clarification was added about the QRISK2 score.
• Nicotinic acid was removed from the recommendations.
• Recommendations on statins were updated.
• A new recommendation cross-referring to the NICE technology appraisal guidance on
alirocumab and evolocumab was added to section 1.3.1.
These recommendations are marked [2008, amended 2017].
Recommendations marked [2016] last had an evidence review in 2016, and those marked
[2008] last had an evidence review in 2008. In some cases, minor changes have been
made to the wording to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the
meaning.
July 2016: Recommendations 1.3.1.4 to 1.3.1.9 have been replaced and are adapted from
NICE technology appraisal guidance on ezetimibe for treating primary heterozygous-
familial and non-familial hypercholesterolaemia. TA385 has replaced TA132, the original
source for these recommendations. They have been changed to remove reference to non-
familial hypercholesterolaemia, which TA385 also covers.
Minor changes since publication

and obesity management.
September 2023: We updated the definition of high-intensity statin.
November 2020: Recommendations 1.3.2.8 to 1.3.2.10 were amended to direct readers to
the 2019 UK Chief Medical Officers' physical activity guidelines, and the original
recommendation 1.3.2.11 was removed as it is now covered by the changes made to
recommendation 1.3.2.8. Footnotes were incorporated into the text to improve
accessibility.
December 2017: The definition of high-intensity statin was amended.
