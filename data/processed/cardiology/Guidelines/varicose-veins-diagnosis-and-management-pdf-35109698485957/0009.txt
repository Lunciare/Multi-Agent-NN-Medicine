Varicose veins: diagnosis and management

with varicose veins at CEAP (Clinical, etiological, anatomical and pathophysiological) stage C2 or C3, what are the factors that influence progression of the disease to CEAP stages C5 or C6? Why this is important The evidence review for the guideline showed a lack of high-quality evidence on the progression of varicose veins from CEAP stage C2 or C3 to more serious varicose veins disease. A large, observational, prospective cohort study, similar to the Framingham or Bonn veins studies, should be undertaken. The study should recruit patients with C2 and C3 disease and follow the progress of their disease for 5 years. Consideration should be given to including a genetic component in the study because genetic factors have not been studied on a large scale. The results of such a study should help to more accurately identify which patients are at risk of developing more serious disease so that interventions can be offered at an early stage to those who will benefit most. 2 Compression as a management option What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of compression hosiery versus no compression for the management of symptomatic varicose veins? Why this is important Compression hosiery is widely used as first-line treatment
