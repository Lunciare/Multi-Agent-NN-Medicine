and itching). Assessment and treatment in a vascular service Assessment • Use duplex ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis of varicose veins and the extent of truncal reflux, and to plan treatment for people with suspected primary or recurrent varicose veins. Interventional treatment • For people with confirmed varicose veins and truncal reflux: • Offer endothermal ablation (see the NICE interventional procedures guidance on radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins and endovenous laser treatment of the long saphenous vein). • If endothermal ablation is unsuitable, offer ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (see the NICE interventional procedures guidance on ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins). • If ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is unsuitable, offer surgery. If incompetent varicose tributaries are to be treated, consider treating them at the same time. Non-interventional treatment • Do not offer compression hosiery to treat varicose veins unless interventional treatment is unsuitable. Recommendations The following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full guideline gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance. People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.
