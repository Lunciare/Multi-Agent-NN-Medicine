Interventional treatment 1.3.2 For people with confirmed varicose veins and truncal reflux: • Offer endothermal ablation (see NICE's interventional procedures guidance on radiofrequency ablation of varicose veins and endovenous laser treatment of the long saphenous vein). • If endothermal ablation is unsuitable, offer ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (see NICE's interventional procedures guidance on ultrasound- guided foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins). • If ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is unsuitable, offer surgery. If incompetent varicose tributaries are to be treated, consider treating them at the same time. 1.3.3 If offering compression bandaging or hosiery
