The previous version of the quality standard for chronic heart failure in adults is available as a pdf. Quality statement 1: N-terminal pro-B- type natriuretic peptide measurement Quality statement Adults presenting in primary care with suspected heart failure have their N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measured. [2023] Rationale N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement in primary care can confirm whether heart failure is likely when it is suspected and there is no existing diagnosis of heart failure. People can then be referred for specialist assessment and echocardiography, begin appropriate treatment at an earlier point in their illness, and lower their risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Process Proportion of adults diagnosed with heart failure by specialist assessment and echocardiography who had NT-proBNP measured before diagnosis. Numerator – the number in the denominator who had NT-proBNP measured before diagnosis. Denominator – the number of adults diagnosed with
