heart failure with reduced ejection fraction that are prescribed an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. Numerator – the number in the denominator that are prescribed an ACE inhibitor, beta- blocker, MRA and SGLT2 inhibitor. Denominator – the number of adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Data source: No routinely collected national data on general practice prescribing is available for all medicines in this treatment combination, but may be collected locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example from patient records. Data on prescribing of ACE inhibitors (or ARNIs or ARBs, beta-blockers, MRAs and SGLT2 inhibitors) on discharge from hospital is available from the National Heart Failure Audit. The uptake of MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors and ARNIs in general practice prescribing for people with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction will need to be undertaken at a local level using any data available. This could include electronic medical records. Outcome a) Hospital admissions due to heart failure. Data source: The National Heart Failure Audit contains data on hospital admission rates for heart failure. b) Mortality due to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Data source: No routinely collected national data for this measure has been
