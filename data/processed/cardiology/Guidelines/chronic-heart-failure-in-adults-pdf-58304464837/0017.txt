Chronic heart failure in adults

guidance 679 (2021), recommendations 1.1 and 1.2 • Empagliflozin for treating chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. NICE technology appraisal guidance 773 (2022), recommendations 1.1 and 1.2 Definitions of terms used in this quality statement Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Heart failure with an ejection fraction below 40%. [NICE's guideline on chronic heart failure in adults] Appropriate medication ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, MRAs and SGLT2 inhibitors are of proven benefit for people with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and NICE recommends them as first-line treatment. ARNIs licensed for heart failure should be considered as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor for people on the maximum tolerated dose of each of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, MRAs and SGLT2 inhibitors who continue to have symptoms of heart failure, and for people with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who have symptoms of intolerance to ACE inhibitors (other than angioedema). Primary care prescribers should consider seeking advice from a heart failure specialist before starting someone on a angiotensin receptor- neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). ARBs licensed for heart failure should be considered for people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, and should be considered for people who have symptoms of intolerance
