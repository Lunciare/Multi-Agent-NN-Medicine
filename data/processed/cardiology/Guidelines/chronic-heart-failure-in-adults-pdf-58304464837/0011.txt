with newly diagnosed and pre-existing chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction receive all appropriate medication at optimal tolerated doses. [2011, updated 2025] Rationale It is important that all adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are given all appropriate medications at an optimal tolerated dose to best manage their condition and provide the best outcome. Adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be offered the following treatment combination to reduce the likelihood of related hospitalisation and mortality: • angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor － or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) － or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) • beta-blocker • mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) • sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. People's medical history, findings from their clinical assessment, their frailty status, prognosis and preferences should be used when making decisions about these medicines. They should have regular checks to monitor any side effects, until optimal tolerated doses are reached. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured, and can be adapted and used flexibly. Process a) Proportion of adults with chronic heart
