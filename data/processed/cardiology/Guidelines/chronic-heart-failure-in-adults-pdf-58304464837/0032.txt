needs. [Adapted from NICE's guideline on chronic heart failure in adults, recommendation 1.11.1] Equality and diversity considerations A programme of cardiac rehabilitation should be accessible for all adults with chronic heart failure, including those who may be housebound or in a nursing home. A range of formats (for example, online, in person) and settings (at home, in the community or in the hospital) should be provided so that everyone has their needs met. When conducting cardiac rehabilitation in the community or in hospital, measures such as providing transport for people to attend sessions and holding the sessions in different locations should be considered. Cardiac rehabilitation should be held in buildings that have access for disabled people. Healthcare professionals should take into account the communication needs of people with chronic heart failure, including those with cognitive impairment, when delivering cardiac rehabilitation. All information should be culturally appropriate, and accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and to people who do not speak or read English. If needed, people should have access to an interpreter or advocate as set out in NICE's guideline on advocacy services for adults with health and social care needs. Update information
