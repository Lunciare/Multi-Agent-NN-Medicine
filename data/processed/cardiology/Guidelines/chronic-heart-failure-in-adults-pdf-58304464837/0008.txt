for heart failure. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (such as secondary care) ensure that systems such as referral pathways, as well as appropriate equipment and staff training, are in place for adults with suspected heart failure to have an echocardiogram and be seen by a specialist concurrently within 2 or 6 weeks of referral based on their levels of NT-proBNP. Healthcare professionals (such as consultant cardiologists) ensure that adults with suspected heart failure have an echocardiogram and specialist assessment within 2 or 6 weeks of referral based on their levels of NT-proBNP. Commissioners (integrated care systems) ensure that they commission services in which adults with suspected heart failure have an echocardiogram and specialist assessment concurrently within 2 or 6 weeks of referral based on their levels of NT-proBNP. Adults with suspected heart failure who have been referred for diagnosis have a test called an echocardiogram and are seen by a heart specialist at the same time. This should happen within 2 weeks of being referred by their GP if a blood test shows very high levels of a substance (called an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) that suggests they may have heart failure needing urgent treatment.
