Data source: No routinely collected data for this measure has been identified. Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare provider organisations, for example from service pathways or protocols. Process a) Proportion of adults with very high levels of NT-proBNP, who have been referred for diagnosis, who have transthoracic echocardiography and specialist assessment within 2 weeks of referral. Numerator – the number in the denominator who have transthoracic echocardiography and specialist assessment within 2 weeks of referral. Denominator – the number of adults with very high levels of NT-proBNP who have been referred for diagnosis. Data source: No routinely collected national data
