[Adapted from NICE's clinical knowledge summary on chronic heart failure] Quality statement 2: Specialist assessment Quality statement Adults with suspected heart failure have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within 2 weeks of referral if they have a very high N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, or 6 weeks if they have a high NT-proBNP level. [2011, updated 2023] Rationale Adults who have high (between 400 and 2,000 ng/litre) or very high levels (over 2,000 ng/ litre) of NT-proBNP have a higher likelihood of heart failure and a poorer prognosis. Having transthoracic echocardiography concurrently with specialist assessment to confirm heart failure classification within 2 or 6 weeks of referral can help to ensure that the person is started on appropriate treatment to manage their condition. Quality measures The following measures can be used to assess the quality
