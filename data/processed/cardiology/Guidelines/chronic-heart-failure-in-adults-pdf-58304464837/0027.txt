care • symptoms to look out for in case of deterioration • a process for any subsequent access to the specialist heart failure multidisciplinary team if needed • contact details for: － a named healthcare coordinator (usually a specialist heart failure nurse) － alternative local heart failure specialist care providers, for urgent care or review • additional sources of information for people with heart failure. For people taking amiodarone the review should include liver and thyroid function tests, and a review of side effects. For people with a cardioverter defibrillator, the review should consider benefits and potential harms of it remaining active. More detailed monitoring should be provided if the person has significant comorbidity or if their condition has deteriorated since the previous review. Monitoring serum potassium is particularly important if a person is taking digoxin or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. People with heart failure who wish to be involved in the monitoring of their condition should be provided with sufficient education and support to do this, with clear guidelines as to what to do in the event of deterioration.
