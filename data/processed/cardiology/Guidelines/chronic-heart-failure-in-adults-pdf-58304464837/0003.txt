assessment and echocardiography who had NT-proBNP measured before diagnosis. Numerator – the number in the denominator who had NT-proBNP measured before diagnosis. Denominator – the number of adults diagnosed with heart failure by specialist assessment and echocardiography. Data source: No routinely collected national data for this measure has been identified. Data can be collected from information recorded locally by healthcare professionals and provider organisations, for example from patient records. Outcome Hospital admissions due to heart failure. Data source: The National Heart Failure Audit contains data on hospital admission rates for heart failure. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (primary care) ensure that systems are in place to measure NT-proBNP when heart failure is suspected in adults. Healthcare professionals (such as GPs and practice nurses) ensure that when they suspect heart failure in adults, they arrange or carry out NT-proBNP measurement. Commissioners (integrated care systems) ensure that NT-proBNP testing is available in primary care settings. Adults with suspected heart failure have a blood test by their GP or practice nurse to find out how well their heart is working.
