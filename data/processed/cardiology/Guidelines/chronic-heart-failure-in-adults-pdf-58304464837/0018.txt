inhibitor (ARNI). ARBs licensed for heart failure should be considered for people with angioedema after taking an ACE inhibitor, and should be considered for people who have symptoms of intolerance of ACE inhibitors and ARNIs. Other specialist treatments may also be appropriate for some people and should be initiated by a heart failure specialist with access to a multidisciplinary heart failure team or after seeking specialist advice. These treatments include ivabradine, hydralazine in combination with nitrate (especially if the person is of African or Caribbean family origin and has moderate to severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) and digoxin. People's medical history, findings from their clinical assessment, their frailty status, prognosis and preferences should be used when deciding: • which specific medicines and medicine combinations to use • the order and timing for introducing each medicine • the initial dose of each medicine and any subsequent dose increments • when and how to optimise the dose of each medicine.
