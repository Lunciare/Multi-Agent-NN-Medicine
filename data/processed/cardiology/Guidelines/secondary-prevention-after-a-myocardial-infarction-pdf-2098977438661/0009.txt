of GP services. Data source: Local data collection. What the quality statement means for different audiences Service providers (secondary and tertiary care services) ensure that adults discharged from hospital after an MI have the results of investigations and a plan for future treatment and monitoring shared with their GP. Healthcare professionals include the results of investigations and a plan for future treatment and monitoring in the GP discharge summary for adults discharged from hospital after an MI. Commissioners commission services that provide GP discharge summaries for adults discharged from hospital after an MI. The GP discharge summaries should include the results of investigations and a plan for future treatment and monitoring. Adults who are admitted to hospital with a heart attack have a letter sent to their GP, which includes the results of any tests and a plan for treatment and monitoring in the future. This helps to make sure that people get the right treatment after they leave hospital and start a programme to improve their long-term health (cardiac rehabilitation) as soon as possible.
