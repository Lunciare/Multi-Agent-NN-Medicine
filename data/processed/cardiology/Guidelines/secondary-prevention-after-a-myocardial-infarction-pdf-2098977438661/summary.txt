Quality statement Adults admitted to hospital with a myocardial infarction (MI) have an assessment of left ventricular function before discharge. Rationale After an MI, some people have heart failure because of damage to heart muscle and impaired contraction of the left ventricle. This is known as left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). The effectiveness of drug treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists and beta-blockers depends on left ventricular function. The assessment of left ventricular function after an MI informs the type, titration and duration of drug treatment and the type of cardiac rehabilitation that is appropriate. To improve the clinical effectiveness of treatment and to ensure patient safety, this assessment should be done before discharge from hospital.
