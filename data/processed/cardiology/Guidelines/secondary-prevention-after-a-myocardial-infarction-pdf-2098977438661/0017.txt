at home, in the community or in a hospital setting. Commissioners commission cardiac rehabilitation services that have the capacity and expertise to provide programmes during and outside working hours and the choice of undertaking the programme at home, in the community or in a hospital setting. Adults referred to a cardiac rehabilitation programme can choose a programme in the daytime or outside working hours, at a hospital, in the local area or at home. Having a choice of time and place means that they are more likely to be able to take part in a programme.
