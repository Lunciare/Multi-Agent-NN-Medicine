Cyanoacrylate glue occlusion for varicose veins

radiofrequency ablation and endovenous laser ablation therapy), foam sclerotherapy, mechanochemical ablation and surgery (usually stripping and ligation of the great and small saphenous veins, and phlebectomies). The procedure 2.3 Cyanoacrylate glue occlusion for varicose veins aims to close the veins by adherence then fibrosis of the lumen, without the need for tumescent anaesthesia and with reduced need for postoperative compression therapy. 2.4 The procedure is done using local anaesthesia. An introducer sheath is inserted into the distal great saphenous vein and, using ultrasound guidance, a delivery catheter is advanced into position before the saphenofemoral junction. The proximal vein is compressed, and medical glue is delivered in measured doses through the tip of the catheter to seal the vein. 2.5 This is repeated at different positions as the catheter is withdrawn, using ultrasound imaging to monitor the procedure. The procedure may also be done in a similar way for the small saphenous vein. 3 Committee considerations The evidence 3.1 NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure. This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from 14 sources, which was discussed by the committee. The evidence included 2
