Endovascular closure of atrial septal defect

1 Guidance 1.1 Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of endovascular closure of atrial septal defect appears adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that the normal arrangements are in place for consent, audit and clinical governance. 1.2 The procedure should be performed in units where there are arrangements for cardiac surgical support in the event of complications. 1.3 The National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research runs the UK Central Cardiac Audit Database (UKCCAD) and clinicians are encouraged to enter all patients into this database. 2 The procedure 2.1 Indications 2.1.1 An atrial septal defect is the persistence of a hole (the foramen ovale) in the wall (septum) between the right atrium and left atrium of the heart. The foramen ovale usually closes spontaneously after birth; an atrial septal defect is present when this closure does not occur. In the most common type, called an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, the septum between the atria fails to form properly during foetal development, resulting in a permanent hole. An atrial septal defect allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, thereby increasing the flow of blood to the lungs. This is known as a
