Endovascular closure of atrial septal defect

making a small incision in the groin to introduce a guidewire and delivery sheath into the femoral vein. An occluder device is then introduced through the delivery sheath on a semi-rigid cable and expanded within the atrial septal defect to close it. Echocardiography and fluoroscopic guidance are used to determine the size and position of the defect and to place the occlude device. A balloon may be used to measure the diameter of the defect. Patients can usually go home the next day. Small residual shunts after the procedure often resolve as endothelial tissue grows over and around the device. The claimed advantages compared with open surgery are shorter hospital stay, earlier return to normal activities and fewer complications. 2.3 Efficacy 2.3.1 Three non-randomised controlled studies reported successful closure rates immediately after the endovascular procedure of 96% (423 out of 442), 98% (60 out of 61) and 97% (28 out of 29), compared with rates of 100% (154 out of 154), 98% (60 out of 61) and 100% (64 out of 64), respectively, for conventional surgery. A large case series of 3,460 patients reported that 97% (3,301 out of 3,391) of atrial septal defects were successfully closed immediately after the
