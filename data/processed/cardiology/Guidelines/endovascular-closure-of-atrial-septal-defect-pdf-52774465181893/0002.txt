An atrial septal defect allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, thereby increasing the flow of blood to the lungs. This is known as a shunt. Patients with atrial septal defects are usually asymptomatic through infancy and childhood. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations and syncope can occur and increasing age carries a higher risk of stroke. Some patients may develop congestive heart failure. 2.1.2 Not all atrial septal defects require treatment, but it is generally agreed that larger defects and those associated with either symptoms or significant enlargement of the heart should be closed electively. Conventional surgery for atrial septal defect is performed through an incision in the front of the chest. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, the right atrium is opened to gain access to the interatrial septum. The defect is then repaired using a patch or stitches. Patients usually stay in hospital for several days after the operation. 2.2 Outline of the procedure 2.2.1 Endovascular closure of an atrial septal defect involves making a small incision in the groin to introduce a guidewire and delivery sheath into the femoral vein. An occluder device is then introduced through the delivery sheath on a
