of 64), respectively, for conventional surgery. A large case series of 3,460 patients reported that 97% (3,301 out of 3,391) of atrial septal defects were successfully closed immediately after the procedure. Of the 4% (147 out of 3,460) of patients followed up for 2 years in this study, all maintained successful closure. A further case series reported that 1% (4 out of 314) of patients had a significant residual shunt immediately after the procedure and 93% (99 out of 107) of patients had a successful closure 1 year after the procedure. For more details, see the overview. 2.3.2 The Specialist Advisors noted that a small proportion of patients might be left with a residual shunt. 2.4 Safety 2.4.1 The reported complication rates were low. They included malpositioning of the device, requiring endovascular or surgical retrieval 1% (6 out of 417) to 5% (16 out of 334); arrhythmia 0.4% (2 out of 459) to 5% (3 out of 61); embolisation of the device 0.4% (14 out of 3,460) to 4% (14 out of 334); thrombus formation 0.4% (1 out of 258) to 3% (1 out of 37); brachial plexus injury 3% (1 out of 39); right iliac vein dissection 0.6% (1
