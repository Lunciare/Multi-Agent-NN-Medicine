Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
This guideline is the basis of QS100.
Overview
This guideline covers the risk of early death from heart disease and other smoking-related
illnesses. It aims to reduce the number of people who are disadvantaged dying
prematurely by ensuring people have better access to flexible, well-coordinated treatment
and support.
Who is it for?
• Health and social care practitioners
• Organisations planning, providing or supporting services that support disadvantaged
people
• Adults with a high risk of heart disease (including smokers and people with high
cholesterol), their families and carers and the general public

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
Introduction
The Department of Health (DH) asked NICE to produce public health guidance on what
works in driving down population mortality rates in disadvantaged areas, where risk of
early death is higher than average, with particular reference to proactive case finding and
retention and access to services.
The recommendations have been developed for smoking cessation services and the
provision of statins. Although the referral specified a focus on people in disadvantaged
areas, the recommendations are relevant for all those who are disadvantaged, regardless
of where they live.
The guidance is for NHS and other professionals who have a direct or indirect role in, and
responsibility for, services aimed at people who are disadvantaged. This includes those
working in local authorities and the wider public, voluntary and community sectors. It may
also be of interest to members of the public.
NICE guidance on community engagement, behaviour change, smoking cessation, statins
and lipid modification complements and supports this guidance.
The Public Health Interventions Advisory Committee (PHIAC) has considered the reviews
of the evidence, a mapping review, an economic appraisal, stakeholder comments and the
results of fieldwork in developing these recommendations.
Details of PHIAC membership are given in appendix A. The methods used to develop the
guidance are summarised in appendix B. Supporting documents used in the preparation of
this document are listed in appendix E. Full details of the evidence collated, including
fieldwork data and activities and stakeholder comments, are available on the NICE
website, along with a list of the stakeholders involved and the supporting process and
methods manuals.

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
This guideline constitutes NICE's formal guidance on what works in finding and supporting
those most at risk of early death and improving their access to services.
The evidence statements that underpin the recommendations are listed in appendix C.
Definitions
Definitions of adults who are disadvantaged and of what constitutes a disadvantaged area
and a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), along with a brief explanation of why
there was a focus on smoking cessation and statin interventions.
• Adults who are disadvantaged include (but are not limited to):
－ those on a low income (or who are members of a low-income family)
－ those on benefits
－ those living in public or social housing
－ some members of black and minority ethnic groups
－ those with a mental health problem
－ those with a learning disability
－ those who are institutionalised (including those serving a custodial sentence)

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
－ those who are homeless.
• Local agencies (such as local authorities and primary care trusts [PCTs]) define
disadvantaged areas in a variety of ways. An example is the Index of Multiple
Deprivation 2007 (ID 2007). This combines indicators on economic, social and housing
issues to produce a single deprivation score.
• According to NICE guidance, if someone has a 20% or higher risk of a first
cardiovascular event in the next 10 years, they are deemed at high risk of CVD (see
NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including
lipid modification).
Smoking cessation and statins
Smoking cessation and statin interventions were used as the basis of the
recommendations because:
• Methods of identifying and supporting adults and improving their access to services
need to be assessed using interventions which have already been established as
effective and cost effective. Smoking cessation services and the provision of statins
are both generally agreed to be effective and cost effective.
• Epidemiological data show a clear socioeconomic gradient for smoking and CVD.
Tackling smoking and providing statins, as recommended, should make a significant
contribution to reducing health inequalities.
This guidance should be used alongside NICE's guideline on tobacco: preventing uptake,
promoting quitting and treating dependence and the recommendations on statins and lipid
modification therapy in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease.
Cost effectiveness
Smoking cessation interventions are generally cost effective, irrespective of the target
audience, the methods used to identify and recruit adults or the type of service offered. It
is also cost effective to identify adults in secondary care who are disadvantaged and need
statins (and then prescribe these drugs). In primary care, the cost effectiveness of
identifying people at risk of CVD and providing them with statins is determined by the
number at risk of CVD in the baseline population. (The more people at risk, the more cost
effective it becomes to identify them and provide them with statins.)

(PH15)
Tackling health inequalities
Health inequalities are so deeply entrenched that providing disadvantaged groups or areas
with better services – and better access to those services – can only be one element of a
broader strategy to address the distribution of the wider determinants of health. All
activities need to be developed and sustained on a long-term basis.
The recommendations focus on system and structural changes to ensure effective clinical
and public health practice can take place. This requires a comprehensive approach at all
levels of the health system (for example, involving both practitioners and commissioners)
and in partnership with others in the wider public, community and voluntary sectors. The
recommendations are not aimed at clinical practice itself as the relevant advice is found in
other NICE guidance.
Effective implementation of the recommendations will require:
• an appropriate infrastructure and resources for commissioners, planners and service
providers
• policy initiatives which prioritise health inequalities and ensure action to tackle them
are included in PCT plans and local area agreements.
Recommendation 1: identifying adults at risk
Who is the target population?
Adults who are disadvantaged:
• who smoke and/or
• who are eligible for statins and/or
• who are at high risk of CVD due to other factors.
Who should take action?
Service providers and commissioners (for example, general practices, PCTs, community
services, local authorities and others with a remit for tackling health inequalities).

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
What action should they take?
• Primary care professionals should use a range of methods to identify adults who are
disadvantaged and at high risk of premature death from CVD. These include:
－ primary care and general practice registers (for example, to identify adults who
smoke; who are from particular minority ethnic groups; or who have family
members who have had premature coronary heart disease)
－ primary care appointments (for example, during routine visits and screening)
－ systematic searches in pre-identified areas or with specific populations (for
example, using direct mail or telephone)
－ analyses of quality outcomes framework (QOF) data.
• Those working with communities should use a range of methods to identify adults who
are disadvantaged and at high risk of CVD. Methods to use include:
－ health sessions run at a range of community and public sites, including post
offices, charity shops, supermarkets, community pharmacies, homeless centres,
workplaces, prisons and long-stay psychiatric institutions. (Lifestyle factors such
as smoking or other indicators, such as blood pressure, could be used to identify
those at risk)
－ culturally sensitive education sessions that include a CVD risk assessment and
which take place in black and minority ethnic community settings (including places
of worship)
－ outreach activities provided by community health workers (including health
trainers).
• Service providers should monitor these methods and adjust them according to local
needs.
• Service providers should encourage everyone who is disadvantaged to register with a
general practice.

Recommendation 2: improving services for adults
and retaining them
Who is the target population?
Adults who are disadvantaged:
• who smoke and/or
• who are eligible for statins and/or
• who are at high risk of CVD due to other factors.
Who should take action?
Service providers (for example, PCTs, general practices, community services, local
authorities and other organisations with a remit for tackling health inequalities).
What action should they take?
• Provide flexible, coordinated services that meet the needs of individuals who are
disadvantaged. For example, this could include providing drop-in or community-based
services, outreach and out-of-hours services, advice and help in the workplace and
single-sex sessions.
• Involve people who are disadvantaged in the planning and development of services.
Seek feedback from the target groups on whether the services are accessible,
appropriate and meeting their needs.
• Gain the trust of adults who are disadvantaged. Offer them proactive support. This
could include helplines, brochures and invitations to attend services. It could also
include providing GPs with postal prompts to remind them to monitor people who are
disadvantaged and who have had an acute coronary event.
• Develop and deliver non-judgemental programmes to tackle social and psychological
barriers to change. These should be tailored to people's needs. For example, they
could make use of social marketing techniques. (Social marketing involves using
marketing and related techniques to achieve specific behavioural goals.)

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55
--- Страница 12 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
• Ensure services are sensitive to culture, gender and age. For example, provide multi-
lingual literature in a culturally acceptable style and involve community, religious and
lay groups in its production. Where appropriate, offer translation and interpretation
facilities. Promote services using culturally relevant local and national media, as well as
representatives of different ethnic groups. Consider providing information in video or
web-based format.
• Provide services in places that are easily accessible to people who are disadvantaged
(such as community pharmacies and shopping centres) and at times to suit them.
• Provide support to ensure people who are disadvantaged can attend appointments
(for example, this may include help with transport, postal prompts and offering home
visits).
• Encourage and support people who are disadvantaged to follow the treatment that
they have agreed to. For example, encourage them to use self-management
techniques (based on an individual assessment) to solve problems and set goals. It
could also involve providing vouchers for treatments (such as nicotine replacement
therapy [NRT]). (For recommendations on the principles of behaviour change, see
NICE's guideline on behaviour change: general approaches).
• Routinely search GP databases (and other electronic medical records) to generate lists
of patients who have not collected repeat prescriptions or attended follow-up
appointments. Make contact with them.
• Address factors that prevent people who are disadvantaged from using services (for
example, they may have a fear of failure or of being judged, or they might not know
what services and treatments are available).
• Support the development and implementation of regional and national strategies to
tackle health inequalities by delivering local activities which are proven to be effective.
• Use health equity audits to determine if services are reaching people who are
disadvantaged and whether they are effective. (For example, by matching the
postcodes of service users to deprivation indicators and smoking prevalence.) Health
equity audits typically consist of 6 steps: 1. agreeing partners and issues for the audit;
2. undertaking an equity profile; 3. identifying high-impact local action to narrow key
inequities identified; 4. agreeing priorities for action; 5. securing changes in
investment; and service delivery; 6. Reviewing progress and assessing impact
(Department of Health 'Health equity audit: a self-assessment tool').

Recommendation 3: system incentives
Who is the target population?
Service providers (for example, PCTs, community services, local authorities and others
with a remit for tackling health inequalities) and practice-based commissioning (PBC)
groups.
Who should take action?
Policy makers, planners and commissioners.
What action should they take?
• Support and sustain activities aimed at improving the health of people who are
disadvantaged by:
－ using relevant indicators to measure progress and compare performance across
areas or organisations
－ ensuring, wherever possible, that all targets aim to tackle health inequalities – and
do not increase them
－ ensuring exception-reporting does not increase health inequalities: PCTs should
be provided with additional levers and tools to monitor and benchmark exception-
reporting and to reduce persistent rates of exception coding
－ considering the provision of comparative performance data to encourage
providers to meet targets
－ using local enhanced services to encourage providers and practitioners to identify
and continue to support those who are at risk of premature death from CVD and
other smoking-related diseases.
• Provide incentives for local projects that improve the health of people who are
disadvantaged, specifically those who smoke or are at high risk of CVD from other
causes or are eligible for statins. Ensure the projects are evaluated and, if effective,
ensure they continue.

Recommendation 4: partnership working
Who is the target population?
Adults who are disadvantaged:
• who smoke and/or
• who are eligible for statins and/or
• who are at high risk of CVD due to other factors.
Who should take action?
Planners, commissioners and service providers with a remit for tackling health inequalities.
This includes PCTs, general practices, community services, PBC groups, local strategic
partnerships, local authorities (including education and social services), the criminal
justice system and members of the voluntary and business sectors.
What action should they take?
• Develop and sustain partnerships with professionals and community workers who are
in contact with people who are disadvantaged. Use joint strategic needs assessments,
local area agreements, local strategic partnerships, the GP contract, world class
commissioning and other mechanisms. (For recommendations on community
engagement, see NICE's guideline on community engagement: improving health and
wellbeing and reducing health inequalities.)
• Establish relationships between primary care practitioners and the community to
understand how best to identify and help adults who are disadvantaged to adopt
healthier lifestyles. For example, they should jointly determine how best to support
health initiatives delivered as part of a local neighbourhood renewal strategy.
• Establish relationships with secondary care professionals (for example, those working
in respiratory medicine and CVD clinics) to help identify patients at high risk of further
cardiovascular events. Offer these patients support or refer them on, where
appropriate.
• Develop and maintain a database of local initiatives that aim to reduce health

(PH15)
inequalities by improving the health of people who are disadvantaged.
• Develop and sustain local and national networks for sharing local experiences. Ensure
mechanisms are in place to evaluate and learn from these activities on a continuing,
systematic basis.
• Ensure those working in the healthcare, community and voluntary sectors coordinate
their efforts to identify people who need help.
Recommendation 5: training and capacity
Who is the target population?
Service providers (for example, general practices, PCTs, local authorities, community and
lay workers and others with a remit for tackling health inequalities).
Who should take action?
Commissioners and service providers (for example, PCTs, community services, local
authorities and others with a remit for tackling health inequalities).
What action should they take?
• Ensure there are enough practitioners with the necessary skills to help people who are
disadvantaged to adopt healthier lifestyles. (For examples of the skills needed, see
NICE's guideline on tobacco: preventing uptake, promoting quitting and treating
dependence, and the Health Development Agency's 'Standard for training in smoking
cessation treatments' or updated versions of this.)
• Ensure practitioners have the skills to identify people who are disadvantaged and can
develop services to meet their needs. (For a set of generic principles to use when
planning and delivering activities aimed at changing health-related behaviour, see
NICE's guideline on behaviour change: general approaches. For advice on getting
communities involved, see NICE's guideline on community engagement: improving
health and wellbeing and reducing health inequalities.)
• Ensure service providers and practitioners have the ability to make services
responsive to the needs of people who are disadvantaged. For example, they should

be able to compare service provision with need, access, use and outcome using health
equity audits. (For examples of the training and skills needed, refer to national
organisations such as the Faculty of Public Health, British Psychological Society, Skills
for Health and the Institute of Environmental Health.)

Public health need and practice
People who enjoy a lifetime of advantage are likely to live longer, healthier lives than those
who experience disadvantage (Graham and Power 2004; Kawachi and Kennedy 1997;
Wilkinson 1996). Yet despite increased prosperity and reductions in mortality among some
population groups, cardiovascular disease (CVD), other smoking-related diseases and
smoking are still more prevalent among lower socioeconomic and certain ethnic groups
compared with the general population.
Since 1995 to 1997, circulatory diseases have become more prevalent, in relative terms,
among disadvantaged groups. For example, in 2004 to 2006, 44 more people per 100,000
(aged under 75) died from circulatory disease in the most deprived fifth of local authority
districts than in the least deprived areas. In relative terms, this means the death rate from
circulatory disease was 71% higher in the most deprived areas compared with the least
deprived areas (DH 2008a).
Since 1998 there has been no significant change in smoking prevalence among adults in
manual groups compared to non-manual groups in absolute terms (and some signs of a
widening in the gap in relative terms). In 2006 in Britain, smoking prevalence was twice as
high among unskilled workers than among professionals (33% and 16% respectively among
routine-and-manual and managerial-and-professional groups respectively [Office for
National Statistics 2007]).
Factors linked to health inequalities
Factors such as poor living conditions, lower educational achievement and behaviours
which damage health (such as smoking) lead to a greater than average risk of premature
death, greater morbidity and lower life expectancy People in lower socioeconomic groups
are more likely to adopt behaviours that may damage their health (Graham and Power
2004; Kawachi and Kennedy 1997; Wilkinson 1996).
As a result, there is a steep social class gradient for many different conditions that affect
health (DH 2008a). For example, the death rate from coronary heart disease (CHD) is
3 times higher among unskilled workers than among professionals. Similarly, deaths from
lung cancer are 4 times higher among unskilled male manual workers of working age than
among professional men (reflecting the fact that smoking is much more common among

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55

(PH15)
male manual workers than their professional counterparts; Twigg et al. 2004).
Tackling health inequalities
Government policy encourages PCTs, local authorities and others to identify and target
groups and neighbourhoods where health – and the use of health services – is worst. For
example:
• 'Health inequalities – progress and next steps' (DH 2008b) sets out how the
government intends to invest in programmes that have proved a success to achieve its
2010 health inequalities targets. Beyond 2010, it plans to develop new goals,
structures and systems to support delivery and sustain the improvements that have
been achieved.
• The latest comprehensive spending review (HM Government 2007) makes reducing
health inequalities a priority, as does the operating framework for the NHS in 2008/09
(DH 2007a). It has also been made a priority in NHS planning guidance for the 3 years
until 2011 (DH 2008c).
• The document 'PSA delivery agreement 18: promote better health and wellbeing for all'
reaffirms the government's commitment to reduce (by 2010) the social class gap in
infant mortality and the life expectancy gap (including mortalities from CVD and
cancer) between the most deprived areas and the rest of the population. (The most
deprived areas are defined as the Spearhead group of local authority and PCT areas.)
It also reaffirms its commitment to reduce smoking prevalence among 'routine' and
manual groups (HM Government 2007).
• The cancer reform strategy (DH 2007b) makes reducing the social class differential in
the prevalence of cancer a priority. It highlights action to prevent cancer, particularly
by reducing smoking among the population.
• From 2008, new statutory requirements arising from the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007 underpin local partnership working, particularly
between local authorities and PCTs (UK Parliament 2007). For example, local
authorities and PCTs must carry out a joint strategic needs assessment for their area
and agree joint local area agreement (LAA) targets (Department for Communities and
Local Government 2007). These new requirements are a feature of national
performance management and should create a more supportive environment for the
NHS. They support the NHS strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity from cancer,

(PH15)
CVD and other smoking-related diseases and the white paper 'Pharmacy in England'.
(The latter wants to see pharmacists' providing a range of smoking cessation services
(DH 2008d).
Challenges to preventing cancer and CVD
Helping people to stop smoking and the provision of statins are 2 of the most widely used
interventions to prevent cancer and CVD. Both have been shown to be effective and cost
effective generally – and both have considerable potential to reduce premature mortality
rates among people who are disadvantaged (Raw et al. 2001; Ward et al. 2007). However,
numerous factors prevent them from being fully effective including: lack of available,
appropriate and accessible primary care services; the reluctance of many people within
vulnerable or at-risk communities to use health services or to follow agreed treatment (DH
1999; Dixon 2000).
Finding effective ways of identifying at-risk or vulnerable groups, tailoring services to
make them accessible and keeping people in the system ('client retention') are still key
challenges. For example, simply improving services does not guarantee that they will be
used by those most in need of them. Nor will it necessarily increase the number of people
who follow treatments they have agreed to.

Considerations
PHIAC took account of a number of factors and issues in making the recommendations.
• PHIAC considers a cross-government approach is required to tackle health inequalities
and that high quality public services can make an important contribution. Although
relatively narrow in scope, PHIAC considers that the interventions in this guidance will
make a contribution to reducing health inequalities, particularly if set within wider
health promoting policies (such as tobacco control and healthy eating).
• The prevalence of diseases with a strong socioeconomic gradient may vary from one
location to another. PHIAC recognises that people who are disadvantaged
(specifically, those with a higher-than-average risk of premature death from smoking-
related diseases and cardiovascular disease [CVD] from other causes) are not
necessarily located in areas defined as disadvantaged. The guidance, therefore, is
applicable to these people – regardless of where they live.
• PHIAC is mindful that a lack of resources (within the NHS and other sectors) has
sometimes confounded attempts to address health inequalities. Adequate resources
(financial, time, equipment and people) need to be deployed effectively to meet the
needs of people who are disadvantaged.
• People who are disadvantaged face social and economic issues that may adversely
affect their ability to respond to the treatments or advice on offer.
• Few, if any, studies in the effectiveness reviews focused primarily on reducing health
inequalities. Studies that did include relevant variables were not usually large enough
to analyse outcomes in relation to different subgroups. As a result, it's unclear from
these studies which methods are most effective at reaching people or groups that are
disadvantaged. Smoking cessation and the provision of statins (both generally agreed
to be effective interventions) provide clear pointers on how to meet the needs of
people who are disadvantaged. They also form a key part of the government's
approach to tackling health inequalities.
• PHIAC would like to encourage research trials that are large enough to assess the
impact of interventions on different subgroups. This is especially important where the
topic is known to have a clear socioeconomic gradient or affects some ethnic groups
more than others (for example, smoking and heart disease).

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
• Given the paucity of evidence on how to identify and support people who are
disadvantaged, PHIAC felt it was important not to be prescriptive but to encourage
innovation. It believes local people and services should be given the support they
need to develop a range of approaches to tackling health inequalities. New
approaches must be evaluated to build the evidence base on how best to reach,
engage and improve the health of people who are disadvantaged.
• There is sometimes a mismatch between policy direction and service targets. For
instance, the targets for NHS Stop Smoking Services do not focus on the most hard-
to-reach groups, despite the thrust of stated policy.
• PHIAC stressed that the quality and outcomes framework (QOF) needs to be modified
to give GPs a greater incentive to find and treat those who are disadvantaged and at
greatest risk of premature death from preventable conditions. GPs could play an
important role in tackling such health inequalities and PHIAC considers that financial
incentives would help. In the meantime, the Committee believes joint working with the
voluntary and community sectors is needed to identify individuals who are not
registered with a general practice. Similarly, joint working is needed to identify those
who have been missed as a result of exception reporting.
• The mapping review identified a wide range of activities aimed at both people who are
disadvantaged and at disadvantaged areas. These activities appear to operate as
discrete and specific projects. It is important to find ways to include these activities in
mainstream services so that they are not treated as additional activities or exceptions
to the general rule.
• PHIAC considers that evaluation (including evaluation of the impact of services on
different subgroups) should be an integral part of new policies and services.
• The recommendations made in this guidance aim to support and complement other
initiatives to reduce premature mortality. Of particular relevance is the coordinated
vascular disease control programme commissioned by the UK National Screening
Committee. This is set out in the UK National Screening Committee's handbook for
vascular risk assessment, risk reduction and risk management. The aim is to identify
and reduce the risk of CVD in the general population. Also of relevance is the
Department of Health's vascular checks programme, announced in January 2008. This
focuses on everyone aged between 40 and 74.

(PH15)
Recommendations for research
PHIAC recommends that the following research questions should be addressed in order to
the improve the evidence relating to finding, supporting and retaining those most at risk of
premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other smoking-related diseases
and improving their access to services. It notes that 'effectiveness' in this context relates
not only to the size of the effect, but also to the cost effectiveness, duration of effect and
harmful/negative effects.
1 Proactive case-finding and retention and access
to services
Can the research on proactive case-finding and retention and access to services in
relation to smoking cessation and the provision of statins be applied to other services
aimed at the reduction of premature mortality amongst disadvantaged people? If so, to
what extent?
2 Incentives
What factors influence the acceptability and effectiveness of incentives to identify, engage
and retain people within the health system? Does the use of incentives lead to any
adverse consequences? If so, why and under what circumstances?
3 Expansion of small-scale interventions
Do cost-effective, small-scale interventions remain cost effective when they are
expanded? If so, what is the best way to expand them?
4 Level and nature of disadvantage of the target
population
To what extent, if any, does the level and nature of disadvantage of the target population
affect the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions?

Appendix B: Summary of the methods
used to develop this guidance
Introduction
The reports of the reviews and economic appraisal include full details of the methods used
to select the evidence (including search strategies), assess its quality and summarise it.
The minutes of the PHIAC meetings provide further detail about the Committee's
interpretation of the evidence and development of the recommendations.
All supporting documents are listed in appendix E.
Key questions
The key questions were established as part of the scope. They formed the starting point
for the reviews of evidence and facilitated the development of recommendations by
PHIAC. The 2 overarching questions focused on:
• the use of statins to combat cardiovascular disease (CVD)
• smoking cessation activities.
Statins
• What are the most effective and cost-effective methods of identifying and supporting
people at increased risk of developing CVD, or who already have CVD?
－ What are the most effective and cost-effective methods of improving access to
services, under what circumstances, for whom and when?
－ What type of support is most effective for different groups, under what
circumstances and when?
－ Is there a trade-off between equity and efficiency?

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
Smoking cessation
• What are the most effective and cost-effective methods of identifying and supporting
people aged 16 years and over who want to stop smoking, in particular, pregnant
women, manual workers and those from disadvantaged backgrounds?
－ What are the most effective and cost-effective methods of improving access to
services, under what circumstances, for whom and when?
－ What type of support is most effective for different groups, under what
circumstances and when?
－ Is there a trade-off between equity and efficiency?
Reviewing the evidence of effectiveness
Two reviews of effectiveness were conducted.
Identifying the evidence
The following databases were searched (from 1995 to 2007):
• AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine)
• ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts)
• British Nursing Index
• CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature)
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails
• Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)
• Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE)
• EMBASE
• EPPI Centre Databases
• HMIC (Health Management Information Consortium – comprises King's Fund and DH-
Data databases)

--- Страница 34 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
• MEDLINE
• PsychINFO
• SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe)
• Social Policy and Practice
• Sociological Abstracts
Other relevant databases (including sources of grey literature) were also searched, along
with references from included studies. The following websites were searched:
• Community Development Xchange
• Department of Health coronary heart disease policy section
• European directory of good practices to reduce health inequalities
• NHS networks
• World Health Organization (WHO) Health Evidence Network.
In addition, information was sought from experts.
Selection criteria
Studies of primary and secondary prevention activities were included in the effectiveness
reviews if they aimed to:
• find and then support adults at increased risk of developing (or with established) CHD
(coronary heart disease; note, the statins search included CVD)
• provide adults at increased risk of developing (or with established) CHD with support
services – or improved access to those services (note, the statins search included
CVD)
• find and help people who smoke (aged 16 years and over) to stop or reduce the habit
• provide people who smoke (aged 16 years and over) with smoking cessation services
– or improve their access to those services.
Studies were excluded if the interventions:

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55
--- Страница 35 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
• did not aim to reduce or eliminate premature deaths from CHD or other smoking-
related causes
• tackled the wider determinants of health inequalities (for example, using macro-level
policies to tackle poverty and economic disadvantage).
Quality appraisal
Included papers were assessed for methodological rigour and quality using the NICE
methodology checklist, as set out in the NICE technical manual 'Methods for development
of NICE public health guidance'. Each study was described by study type and graded (++,
+, -) to reflect the risk of potential bias arising from its design and execution.
Study type
• Meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or RCTs
(including cluster RCTs).
• Systematic reviews of, or individual, non-randomised controlled trials, case-control
studies, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, interrupted time
series (ITS) studies, correlation studies.
• Non-analytical studies (for example, case reports, case series).
• Expert opinion, formal consensus.
Study quality
++ All or most criteria have been fulfilled. Where they have not been fulfilled the
conclusions are thought very unlikely to alter.
+ Some criteria fulfilled. Those criteria that have not been fulfilled or not adequately
described are thought unlikely to alter the conclusions.
- Few or no criteria fulfilled. The conclusions of the study are thought likely or very likely to
alter.

Summarising the evidence and making evidence statements
The review data was summarised in evidence tables (see the full evidence reviews).
The findings from the reviews were synthesised and used as the basis for a number of
evidence statements relating to each key question. The evidence statements reflect the
strength (quantity, type and quality) of evidence and its applicability to the populations
and settings in the scope.
Study of current practice
The mapping review aimed to identify and describe smoking cessation interventions and
the provision of statins in disadvantaged areas and among disadvantaged individuals. It
looked at:
• ways of reaching people who need this type of support (proactive case finding)
• how to encourage those people to keep in touch with services (retention)
• service accessibility.
Projects and interventions were identified via:
• telephone interviews
• documentary analysis
• questionnaires
• scanning of selected conference archives and databases (where these were available
online).
Work was carried out in 2 phases over a 3-month period. In phase one, semi-structured
telephone interviews were carried out with a wide range of national and regional
organisations to identify local contacts, interventions and approaches. Selected
conference archives and project databases were also scanned. In phase 2, interventions
were identified through questionnaires completed by local stakeholders and by analysing
local documents. Full details are in the supporting evidence documents.

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
Economic appraisal
The economic appraisal consisted of a review of economic evaluations, 4 cost-
effectiveness reports and a supplementary cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost-
effectiveness reports covered:
• Statins: 1 report focused on disadvantaged people, the other looked at the general
population. They focused on how to: identify people at risk, improve or increase their
access to services, ensure people who require treatment stay in the system and
adhere to the treatment protocol.
• Smoking cessation: 1 report focused on disadvantaged people, the other looked at the
general population. They focused on how to: identify people at risk, improve or
increase their access to services, ensure people who require treatment stay in the
system and adhere to the treatment protocol.
Review of economic evaluations
The review was conducted using the databases listed for the effectiveness reviews and
the following economic databases:
• Econlit
• Health Economic Evaluation Database (HEED)
• NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED).
The small number of studies involved and the difficulties involved in making direct
comparisons across studies (for instance, due to lack of information on the base year used
to estimate prices) meant that it was not possible to undertake a quantitative synthesis of
the results.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
An economic model was constructed to incorporate data from the reviews of effectiveness
and cost effectiveness. The approach was applied to all 4 cost-effectiveness reports. The
results are reported in:
• 'Economic analysis of interventions to improve the use of statins interventions in the

(PH15)
general population.'
• 'Economic analysis of interventions to improve the use of statins in disadvantaged
populations.'
• 'Economic analysis of interventions to improve the use of smoking cessation
interventions in the general population.'
• 'Economic analysis of interventions to improve the use of smoking cessation
interventions in disadvantaged populations.'
An additional, supplementary economic analysis was undertaken to answer a number of
questions posed by PHIAC.
See the economic analysis reports.
Fieldwork
Fieldwork was carried out to evaluate the relevance and usefulness of NICE guidance for
practitioners and the feasibility of implementation. It was conducted with practitioners and
commissioners who are involved in smoking cessation services and statin provision.
Participants included: strategic health authority directors, primary care trust directors of
public health and public health teams, commissioning managers and performance
managers, GPs and primary care nurses. They also included community pharmacists,
health trainers and managers and representatives from other public and voluntary
organisations, including New Deal for Communities.
The fieldwork comprised:
A qualitative study involving a range of different professionals across 4 locations
(Coventry, Liverpool, London and Northampton) carried out by Dr Foster Intelligence. The
main issues arising from this study are set out in appendix C under fieldwork findings. See
the full fieldwork report 'Reducing the rate of premature deaths from CVD and other
smoking-related diseases: finding and supporting those most at risk and improving access
to services'.
How PHIAC formulated the recommendations
At its meetings in November 2007 and March 2008 PHIAC considered the evidence of
© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 38 of
conditions#notice-of-rights). 55
--- Страница 39 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
effectiveness and cost effectiveness to determine:
• whether there was sufficient evidence (in terms of quantity, quality and applicability)
to form a judgement
• whether, on balance, the evidence demonstrates that the intervention is effective or
ineffective, or whether it is equivocal
• where there is an effect, the typical size of effect.
PHIAC developed draft recommendations through informal consensus, based on the
following criteria.
• Strength (quality and quantity) of evidence of effectiveness and its applicability to the
populations/settings referred to in the scope.
• Effect size and potential impact on population health and/or reducing inequalities in
health.
• Cost effectiveness (for the NHS and other public sector organisations).
• Balance of risks and benefits.
• Ease of implementation and the anticipated extent of change in practice that would be
required.
Where possible, recommendations were linked to an evidence statement(s) (see
appendix C for details). Where a recommendation was inferred from the evidence, this was
indicated by the reference 'IDE' (inference derived from the evidence).
The draft guidance, including the recommendations, was released for consultation in April
2008. At its meeting in June 2008, PHIAC considered comments from stakeholders and
the results from fieldwork and amended the guidance. The guidance was signed off by the
NICE Guidance Executive in July 2008.

Appendix C: The evidence
This appendix lists evidence statements provided by 2 reviews and links them to the
relevant recommendations (see appendix B for the key to study types and quality
assessments). The evidence statements are presented here without references – these
can be found in the full review (see appendix E for details). It also sets out a brief summary
of findings from the economic appraisal.
The 2 reviews of effectiveness are:
• 'The effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions to reduce the rates of
premature death in disadvantaged areas through proactive case finding, retention and
access to services.'
• 'The use of statins: proactive case finding, retention and improving access to services
in disadvantaged areas'.
Evidence statement '1SM' indicates that the linked statement is numbered '1' in the review
'The effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions to reduce the rates of premature
death in disadvantaged areas through proactive case finding, retention and access to
services'. Evidence statement '1ST' indicates that the linked statement is numbered '1' in
the review 'The use of statins: proactive case finding, retention and improving access to
services in disadvantaged areas'. 'MR' is used to indicate that supporting evidence on
current practice can be found in the mapping review.
As noted in appendix B, study quality provides an overall indication of how well a study
was conducted to minimise the likelihood of bias. For example, a quality rating of '++'
indicates minimal likelihood of bias, whereas a rating of '-'' indicates a significant likelihood
of bias. Some of the studies that informed the evidence statements below were rated '-',
due to poor methodology. However, this quality rating does not always apply to the way
the studies actually identified, supported and improved individuals' access to services –
the areas under investigation for this guidance.
See the evidence reviews and economic appraisal for details. Where a recommendation is
not directly taken from the evidence statements, but is inferred from the evidence, this is
indicated by 'IDE' (inference derived from the evidence) below.

Evidence statements
Evidence statement 1SM
Evidence from 1 UK observational study (++) suggests that the QOF component of the
2004 GP contract may have continued, rather than reversed, differences in the quality of
care delivered between primary care practices in deprived and less deprived areas.
Evidence from another UK observational study (++) suggests that the new GP contract
has resulted in an improvement in the recording of smoking status and the recording of the
delivery of brief cessation advice in primary care, but not the prescribing of smoking
cessation medication.
As these studies took place within UK primary care, they are directly relevant to the
review.
Evidence statement 2SM
One cluster RCT in the UK (++) found that proactively identifying smokers through primary
care records was feasible, and providing these smokers with brief advice and referral to

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
NHS Stop Smoking Services increased contact with services and quit attempts but did not
increase rates of cessation.
One observational study (-), 1 descriptive study (-), 1 cluster-controlled trial (+) and 1 RCT
(+) conducted in the USA demonstrate that proactively identifying smokers in a number of
ways, for example, through primary care, using a screening tool, or through cold calling, is
possible and that these provide effective ways of recruiting smokers to cessation
interventions. One observational study in Sweden (+) demonstrates that direct mailing to
smoking mothers can be successful in increasing both participation in smoking cessation
programmes and quit rates. One study took place within English primary care and it is
directly applicable to the review. The remainder took place in the USA and may have
limited applicability. Only 1 (American) study focused upon disadvantaged individuals and
therefore the applicability of this evidence to target populations for this review may be
limited.
Evidence statement 3SM
Two observational studies (both [++]) demonstrate that the NHS Stop Smoking Services
have been effective in reaching smokers living in disadvantaged areas of England. As both
took place in England and are focused on disadvantaged individuals, they are directly
applicable to the review.
Evidence statement 4SM
Two studies provide evidence to suggest that barriers such as fear of being judged, fear of
failure and lack of knowledge need to be tackled in order to motivate smokers from lower
socioeconomic groups to access cessation services. Interventions need to be multi-
dimensional in order to tackle social and psychological barriers to quitting as well as
dealing with the physiological addiction. (Two UK-based studies, 1 involving focus groups
[++] and 1 involving interviews [++]). As both these studies took place with disadvantaged
smokers in the UK, they are directly relevant to this review.
Evidence statement 5SM
Evidence from 4 studies suggests that social marketing has a role to play in delivering
client-centred approaches to smoking cessation to disadvantaged individuals. (One UK-
based observational study [-], 1 international RCT [+], 1 international population-based
study [+] and 1 international controlled-before-and-after study [-]). One of these studies

--- Страница 43 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
took place with disadvantaged smokers in the UK and is directly relevant to the review.
Three took place in the USA and may have limited applicability to this review.
Evidence statement 6SM
One UK-based (+) study suggests that including lay people or community members as
advisers may form an important part of a successful smoking cessation intervention
targeted at a specific group, in particular, if the service is tailored to their specific needs
and allows them to explore smoking in the context of relevant issues in their lives. This
study took place with smokers in the UK and is relevant to this review.
Evidence statement 7SM
Two American studies suggest the need to test existing cessation interventions to
determine their suitability for the specific group, to receive feedback from that group and
to make amendments to any aspects that are unsuitable. In order for the client group to
benefit, the intervention must fit their level of need and understanding, and be suitably
accessible. (One USA-based RCT [++], and 1 USA-based cohort study [-].)
Evidence statement 8SM
There is evidence from a number of studies that training pharmacists to deliver smoking
cessation interventions is important and that pharmacies may be a valuable means of
reaching disadvantaged individuals and increasing their smoking cessation rates (1 UK
systematic review comprising 2 RCTs and 3 non-randomised experimental studies [++],
1 UK observational study with interviews [++] and 1 international pilot study [+]). Two
studies took place within the UK and are directly applicable to the review. One took place
in the USA and so may have limited applicability to this review.
Evidence statement 9SM
There is evidence from 3 reviews that training dental professionals to deliver smoking
cessation interventions is important, and that this setting has the potential to reach large
numbers of smokers and increase cessation rates (1 international systematic review
comprising 6 RCTs [-], 1 UK review of mixed-study designs [-] and 1 international review of
7 RCTs [+]). One study took place within the UK and is directly applicable to the review.
Two studies took place in the USA and so may have limited applicability to this review.
There is limited reference to disadvantaged individuals in any of the reviews and therefore

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
the applicability of this evidence to target populations for this review may be limited.
Evidence Statement 10SM
Three studies provide some evidence of the potential benefit of drop-in or rolling,
community-based sessions to reach smokers and increase cessation rates: 2 UK-based
studies involving face-to-face interviews (both [-]) and 1 UK-based observational study (-
). All studies took place within the UK and are directly applicable to the review.
Evidence Statement 11SM
One cohort study (+) provides evidence of the potential benefits of locating smoking
cessation services in the workplace of manual groups to increase cessation rates. This
study took place in the USA and so may have limited applicability to this review but does
have potential implications for the UK population.
Evidence Statement 13SM
One RCT in the UK (++) with coronary heart disease (CHD) patients randomised to nurse-
run clinics or controls found little evidence of a change in smoking behaviour. Two RCTs in
the UK (+) and (-) exploring smoking cessation interventions at routine cervical screening
appointments found some evidence that brief interventions change the motivation or
intention to quit smoking. One international RCT (+) examined the recruitment of women
smokers attending a child's paediatric appointment into a smoking cessation intervention
and found some evidence of an impact on quitting smoking. One international RCT (+) and
1 observational study using face-to-face interviews (+) investigated the use of cellular
phones for smoking cessation in HIV-positive patients and showed a potential benefit for
using this method of support. One US cohort study (+) provided preliminary evidence that
offering a reduction programme could reach and influence more smokers than a
programme just offering cessation. Three studies were carried out in the UK and are
directly applicable to the target population, but they did not examine disadvantaged
individuals separately. Four studies were carried out in the US and so may have limited
applicability to this review.
Evidence Statement 14SM
Two UK surveys (1 telephone [+] and 1 internet [+]) and 1 descriptive and audit survey (-)
carried out in the UK provide evidence of pregnant smokers' perceptions of barriers to

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55
--- Страница 45 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
using smoking cessation support. Barriers include, among others: unsatisfactory
information, lack of integration of cessation into routine antenatal care, lack of enthusiasm
or empathy from health professionals and lack of short-term support. One RCT in the UK
(+) of motivational interviewing with pregnant smokers and 2 international RCTs, 1 of a
brief versus more intensive intervention (++) and 1 of proactive telephone support (-)
provide little evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions. One US descriptive
study (-) described the reach of a multifaceted pregnancy campaign but reported no
outcomes. The UK studies are directly applicable to the target population, although only
1 of these focused on pregnant smokers in disadvantaged areas.
Evidence Statement 1ST
There is evidence from 3 case studies suggesting interventions inviting specific
populations (South Asians, homeless people or patients with psychosis) to attend risk
screening at their GP practice or primary care clinic may identify a number of people at risk
of coronary heart disease (outcomes reported in 2 case studies [+], [-]). However, it is
difficult to draw firm conclusions on how well such interventions are attended due to poor
reporting of participation rates (outcomes reported in 3 case studies: 2 [+] and 1 [-]).
Evidence Statement 2ST
There is evidence from 1 small case study (+) that screening long-term psychiatric hospital
patients can identify previously undetected CHD. Screening 64 patients identified 1 new
case of established CHD and 22 previously undetected test abnormalities. Participation in
the intervention was high (66%) but only a small proportion consented to having blood
tests.
Evidence Statement 3ST
There is evidence from 1 RCT (+) that in an area of deprivation, postal prompts to patients
and their GPs following an acute coronary event, improves monitoring of the patient's risk
and the likelihood of the patient having at least 1 consultation with their GP or nurse.
Evidence Statement 4ST
There is evidence from 1 case study (+) to suggest that, in an area of deprivation, a project
funding a nurse and exercise worker to develop practice nurse and GP skills in identifying
and monitoring patients and facilitate the provision of exercise facilities for CHD patients,

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55
--- Страница 46 ---
Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
may lead to a small improvement in cholesterol testing of patients. 72.5% of control
patients reported receiving cholesterol tests in the past year compared to 77.8% of the
intervention group, p=0.002. No differences were seen in blood pressure measurement.
Evidence Statement 5ST
There is weak quality evidence from 2 case studies (both [-]) to suggest that offering
cardiovascular risk assessment opportunistically to African-Caribbean general practice
patients, or patients from a range of socioeconomic categories, may identify a number of
people at risk of CHD. However, the interventions require further research using well-
conducted studies before firm conclusions can be made.
Evidence Statement 7ST
There is evidence from 3 studies to suggest that workplace cardiovascular screening
provided in schools or businesses in multi-ethnic, low-income areas (CBA [-], case study
[-]), or for factory workers (case study [+]) is moderately well attended. Results suggest
that a number of participants were identified for referral to a physician for follow-up
(outcome reported in 2 studies: CBA [-], case study [-]). No firm conclusions can be made
on patients' completion of follow-up as this was only reported in 1 poor quality study (case
study [-]).
Evidence Statement 9ST
Evidence from 1 UK case study (-) evaluating the establishment of a health screening clinic
in a prison indicated a moderate 35% voluntary uptake by the inmates. There were active
interventions following the screening for 87 (34%) inmates and 13 (32%) staff screened.
These ranged from simple anti-smoking and dietary advice to more formal medical
interventions to manage raised blood pressure and cholesterol. Uptake data should be
viewed cautiously, as the number of potential participants was not reported.
Evidence Statement 10ST
Two case studies suggest that offering blood pressure measurements at community sites
in areas of deprivation can identify a number of people with elevated blood pressure. No
firm conclusion can be made on participation rates as these were not reported in the
studies. One UK case study (+) found 221 people out of 758 first-time users of self-
reading sphygmomanometers placed in public sites had elevated blood pressure

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
measurements. No firm conclusions can be made regarding physician follow-up as the
researchers were unable to contact all of these people. One US RCT (+) providing blood
pressure measurements at a range of community sites identified 31.4% with elevated
blood pressure and 10.7% with severely elevated blood pressure. Transferability and cost
effectiveness of such interventions requires further study.
Evidence Statement 11ST
There is evidence from 2 case studies evaluating phase 1 (+) and phase 2 (-) of the Well-
Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN)
programme to suggest that adding cardiovascular screening to state breast and cervical
cancer screening programmes reaches financially disadvantaged and minority ethnic
women and identifies a number at risk of CHD. No conclusions can be made on
participation rates or physician referrals as these outcomes have not been reported.
Applicability and transferability of these programmes to a UK setting requires further
study.
Evidence Statement 12ST
Evidence from 3 studies (2 case studies [+] and 1 uncontrolled before- and-after study
[+]) suggests that culturally sensitive education sessions that include an element of
cardiovascular risk assessment may be effective in the identification of at-risk individuals.
Two moderate-quality studies evaluated educational interventions in black and minority
community groups (+) and Turkish immigrants at a mosque (+) offering blood pressure
measurements. Participation with blood pressure measurements were high, and revealed a
number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension or with elevated blood pressure
readings. Evidence from 1 case study (-) in which health checks were conducted before
and after a church-based educational intervention with predominantly black participants
should be viewed more cautiously owing to concerns of transferability and applicability.
Evidence Statement 13ST
Evidence from 1 qualitative study (++) of service users with severe mental illness (SMI),
and primary care staff and community mental health teams, indicate a range of perceived
obstacles to CHD screening. These include: lack of appropriate resources in existing
services; anticipation of low uptake rates by patients with SMI; perceived difficulty in
making lifestyle changes among people with SMI; patients dislike having blood tests; and
lack of funding for CHD screening services or it not being seen as a priority by trust

(PH15)
management. There was some disagreement about the best way to deliver appropriate
care, and the authors concluded that increased risk of CHD associated with SMI and
antipsychotic medications requires flexible solutions with clear lines of responsibility for
assessing, communicating and managing CHD risks.
Evidence Statement 14ST
There is a paucity of good quality research on the effectiveness of pharmacist
interventions to improve compliance with lipid-lowering therapy, particularly in
disadvantaged individuals. Results from the 4 studies identified (2 RCTs [-, -] 1 UCBA
[uncontrolled before and after study] [-] and 1 observational study [-]) should be viewed
with caution owing to poor methodological quality and doubts about applicability to
disadvantaged individuals.
Evidence Statement 15ST
Evidence from 1 low-quality RCT (-) suggests that telephone reminders and postcards to
reinforce messages about coronary risk reduction does not produce significant
improvements in short-term compliance in patients prescribed pravastatin treatment.
Results should be viewed with caution as the poor-quality study is likely to be highly
biased and may not be applicable to disadvantaged individuals.
Evidence Statement 16ST
Well-conducted research examining patient education to improve compliance with lipid-
lowering therapy is required before firm conclusions can be made regarding its
effectiveness, particularly in disadvantaged individuals. Evidence from 1 uncontrolled
before-and-after study (+) of nurse-led education in heart failure patients suggested there
was no significant difference in self-reported compliance at 1 year. One RCT (-) of a
pharmacy intervention including patient education for heart failure patients found a
significant difference in compliance at 2 and 6 months, but not at 12 months. Applicability
of the studies may be limited as the medication prescribed was not specified.
Evidence Statement 18ST
Well-conducted research is required examining the effectiveness of improving retention of
patients at risk of or with CHD within services. Evidence from the 1 systematic review
identified (+) highlights the dearth of literature reporting the evaluation of simple

conditions#notice-of-rights). 55

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
interventions aimed at improving adherence to cardiac rehabilitation for all patients or
specific groups of patients. The systematic review identified few studies of sufficient
quality to enable the recommendation of specific methods to improve adherence to
outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The most promising approach was the use of self-
management techniques based around individualised assessment, problem solving, goal
setting and follow up. This was most likely to be effective in improving specific aspects of
rehabilitation, including diet and exercise.
Evidence Statement 19ST
Evidence from 1 systematic review (+) highlighted the need for trials of interventions
applicable to all patients and targeting specific under-represented groups. The review
revealed some evidence to support the use of approaches aimed at motivating patients,
regular support and practice assistance from trained lay volunteers and a multifaceted
approach for the coordination of transfer of care from hospital to general practice.
Applicability and transferability of these programmes to disadvantaged populations
requires further study.
Evidence Statement 20ST
Evidence from 3 studies indicated the importance of providing additional staff resources
to encourage or support the uptake of services by people living in socially deprived areas.
One US moderate-quality RCT (+) in a predominantly black population from a low-income
area found improved uptake of services with a tracking and outreach intervention, where
community health workers supported patients in completing referral to their physician for
high blood pressure. Evidence from 1 non-comparative UK case study (+) indicates that
additional resources for tertiary cardiology may have reduced socioeconomic inequities in
angiography without being specifically targeted at the needier, more deprived groups, but
the impact on revascularisation equity is not yet clear. Evidence from 1 UK case study (-)
suggested that a project funding 1 nurse and 1 exercise worker to support GP practices in
a socially deprived area increased the practices' provision of cardiac rehabilitation services
such as exercise programmes, psychological and social support and dietary advice.
Project nurses worked directly with practice nurses and GPs to develop their skills in
identifying and monitoring patients with CHD, giving lifestyle advice and ensuring optimum
medication regimes. An exercise worker worked with practices and the community to
identify and facilitate the provision of exercise resources suitable for CHD patients.

(PH15)
Evidence Statement 22ST
A number of barriers and enablers to accessing services were identified in 5 qualitative
studies involving people from socially deprived areas ([++], [+, +, +] [-]). Common themes
were a lack of understanding of services and treatments and the need for flexible services;
the inconvenient timing of appointments and the lack of transport were both cited as
barriers; with the latter overcome by the provision of home visits. Personal factors, such as
the need to minimise the severity of their illness, taking a 'cope and don't fuss' approach
and fear of blame were also reported as barriers. The absence of cardiac rehabilitation
services and long waiting lists was also noted and, for some patients, a reluctance to
attend group care ([++], [+, +], [-]). Healthcare providers agreed on the need to expand
cardiac rehabilitation services to reach out into communities and that the expansion would
need to take place in the community (+).
Evidence Statement 23ST
A number of barriers and enablers to accessing services were identified in 5 qualitative
studies involving Asian populations ([++], [+, +, +]) and African-Caribbean populations (+).
Among Asian populations, a range of religious and cultural issues were identified including
female inhibitions, religious practices, family commitments and influence and
'inappropriate' topics. The need for flexibility in the timing of services was highlighted and
sensitivity in planning activities around religious events was viewed positively. Patients'
lack of understanding of services and treatment was suggested as a barrier to access,
including low levels of education and misunderstanding of western medicine, and lack of
knowledge on what services were available and how to apply. Communication and
language barriers were also perceived. A 'cope and don't fuss' approach among African-
Caribbean hypertensive patients was a reported barrier to accessing services (+).
Evidence Statement 24ST
One qualitative study of cardiac rehabilitation coordinators in Scotland (+) found that age
was widely perceived to influence access to services, both during initial assessment and in
assessments for exercise components. Focus groups revealed that staff appeared to have
knowledge of the benefits for older people but that scarcity of resources prevented them
offering more accessible and appropriate services.

(PH15)
Mapping review
Brown et al. (2007) Guidance for the NHS and other sectors on interventions that reduce
the rates of premature death in disadvantaged areas: proactive case finding and retention
and improving access to services.
Cost-effectiveness evidence
Smoking cessation
The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of smoking cessation interventions for
disadvantaged groups is low or very low. It is rarely likely to exceed £6,000.
Statins
Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD; that is, after a CVD event) among a
disadvantaged population costs an estimated £4,000 per QALY gained (£3,100 per QALY
for finding the person and £900 per QALY for treating them with statins). Therefore, it is
cost effective.
Whether or not it is cost effective to provide statins to prevent a first occurrence of CVD
among a disadvantaged population depends on the number of people at risk in the
baseline population. Data from a USA study of financially disadvantaged women aged
40 to 64 who enrolled in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program
was analysed. The analysis found that it is cost effective if more than 14% of the
population is at risk. For example, when 40% were at risk of CVD, primary prevention was
estimated to cost £8,500 per QALY gained (£4,900 per QALY for finding the person and
£3,600 per QALY for treating them). This compared with about £125,600 when only 1.6%
were at risk (£122,000 per QALY for finding them and £3,600 per QALY for treating them).
Fieldwork findings
Fieldwork aimed to test the relevance, usefulness and the feasibility of implementing the
recommendations and the findings were considered by PHIAC in developing the final
recommendations. For details, go to the fieldwork section in appendix B and 'Reducing the
rate of premature deaths from CVD and other smoking-related diseases: finding and
supporting those most at risk and improving access to services'.

Cardiovascular disease: identifying and supporting people most at risk of dying early
(PH15)
Fieldwork participants who work with adults who are disadvantaged (in particular, those
who smoke and/or are eligible for statins and/or are at high risk of CVD due to other
factors) were very positive about the recommendations. Some said they will support work
already being carried out in this area.
Participants felt that incentives had a role to play in helping to encourage people who are
disadvantaged to attend NHS services and complete treatment. However, they felt that
the use of incentives should be driven by national policy.
Overall, the lists of 'target populations' and 'who should take action' were seen as
appropriate, although participants believed it would be helpful to include commissioners in
the latter. Highlighting who should have overall responsibility for a recommendation would
also aid implementation, they said.
Participants highlighted training, long-term funding, partnership working and cultural
sensitivity as key issues that needed addressing for successful implementation of the
recommendations.

(PH15)
Appendix D: Gaps in the evidence
PHIAC identified a number of gaps in the evidence relating to the interventions under
examination, based on an assessment of the evidence. These gaps are set out below.
1. Interventions that aim to find and treat those most at risk of premature death (and
improve their access to services) have rarely been assessed in terms of effectiveness and
cost effectiveness.
2. Most studies focus on small scale, local interventions that reflect local context and
priorities (for example, drop-in centres for smoking cessation). There is a lack of evidence
on the impact of such interventions delivered on a large-scale.
3. There is a lack of evidence on interventions which primarily aim to retain people at risk
of specific conditions within the health system, both generally and in relation to
characteristics such as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and gender.
4. There is a lack of evidence on whether addressing the barriers to service use results in
more people using a service.
5. There is a lack of evidence on the impact that combined macro- and micro-level
interventions can have on reducing health inequalities and the relative contribution that
components at each level make.
6. There is a lack of evidence on the incremental effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
adapting interventions to meet the needs of disadvantaged individuals.
7. There is a lack of UK evidence on the effectiveness of using incentives to increase the
number of people who both use services and complete their treatment.
