Acute heart failure (QS103)
Quality statement 1: Single measurement
of natriuretic peptide
Quality statement
Adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have a single
measurement of natriuretic peptide.
Rationale
Natriuretic peptide testing (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) is an important tool for rapidly assessing adults
presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure. It can be used to rule out a
diagnosis of heart failure or to see if further investigation with echocardiography is
needed. It can save time and distress for the adult presenting with new suspected acute
heart failure.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.
Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that adults presenting to hospital with new
suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide.
Data source: Local data collection.
Process
a) Proportion of adults presenting to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure who
have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide.

Acute heart failure (QS103)
What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (cardiac service providers) ensure that adults presenting to hospital
with new suspected acute heart failure have a single measurement of natriuretic peptide
that is undertaken by the cardiac team to rule out a diagnosis of heart failure. Also,
hospitals in England to which people may present with suspected acute heart failure
ensure they use appropriate assay thresholds of plasma BNP less than 100 ng/litre and
plasma NT-proBNP less than 300 ng/litre.
Healthcare professionals ensure that adults with new suspected acute heart failure have a
single measurement of natriuretic peptide on presentation to hospital to rule out a
diagnosis of heart failure.
Commissioners ensure that adults with new suspected acute heart failure have a single
measurement of natriuretic peptide on presentation to hospital to rule out a diagnosis of
heart failure.
Adults presenting at hospital with new suspected acute heart failure have their
natriuretic peptide (also known as BNP or NT-proBNP) level in their blood measured. This
test is a quick way for doctors to find out whether the person is likely to have heart failure
or if they need further assessment to see if their symptoms are caused by something else.
Source guidance
Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management. NICE guideline CG187 (2014),
recommendation 1.2.2 (key priority for implementation)
Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
Natriuretic peptide
A protein substance secreted by the wall of the heart when it is stretched or under
increased pressure. It has several forms and its level can be raised in a number of
conditions, including heart failure. A normal natriuretic peptide level means that heart
failure is unlikely, and its measurement can be used to exclude a diagnosis of heart failure.

Quality statement 2: Transthoracic
doppler 2D echocardiography
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic
peptide levels have a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of
admission.
Rationale
Performing a transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram within 48 hours of hospital
admission for adults with new suspected acute heart failure and raised natriuretic peptide
levels will enable earlier diagnosis and appropriate management in terms of
pharmacological treatment, location of care and relevant input from the specialist heart
failure team.

recommendations 1.2.3 (key priority for implementation) and 1.2.4 (key priority for
implementation)
Definition of terms used in this quality statement
Transthoracic doppler 2D echocardiogram
An echocardiogram is a test that uses ultrasound waves to measure the pumping action
and structure of the heart, including the heart valves. A probe is moved over the surface of
the chest and picks up echoes of sound (similar to an ultrasound scan used in pregnancy),
which are shown as a picture on a screen.

Acute heart failure (QS103)
Quality statement 3: Organisation of care
– early specialist input
Quality statement
Adults admitted to hospital with acute heart failure have input within 24 hours of
admission from a dedicated specialist heart failure team.
Rationale
A dedicated specialist heart failure team with early involvement is important for
cost-effective care. It can also positively contribute to rapid diagnosis, reduced
readmissions and better quality of life. Ongoing input of the dedicated specialist heart
failure team will also help to ensure appropriate care and make subsequent readmission
less likely.
Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured,
and can be adapted and used flexibly.

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details about our standing
committees. Information about the topic experts invited to join the standing members is
available from the webpage for this quality standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.

Acute heart failure (QS103)
adults with acute heart failure is essential. Treatment, care and support, and the
information given about it, should be culturally appropriate. It should also be accessible to
people with additional needs such as physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and to
people who do not speak or read English. Adults with acute heart failure should have
access to an interpreter or advocate if needed.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
