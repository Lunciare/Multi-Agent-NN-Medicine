KEYWORDS: atrial, fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, committee, people, risk, evidence, recommendations, ablation, anticoagulation, stroke, treatment, bleeding, control, practice

assessment 1.2.4 Discuss the results of the assessments of stroke and bleeding risk with the person taking into account their specific characteristics, for example comorbidities, and their individual preferences. For further guidance, see the section on enabling patients to actively participate in their care in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services. [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on bleeding risk. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E and F: risk stratification tools for predicting bleeding in people with atrial fibrillation. 1.3 Assessment of cardiac function 1.3.1 Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in people with atrial fibrillation: • for whom a baseline echocardiogram is important for long-term management • for whom a rhythm-control strategy that includes cardioversion (electrical or pharmacological) is being considered • in whom there is a high risk or a suspicion of underlying structural or functional heart disease (such as heart failure or heart murmur) that influences their subsequent management (for example, choice of antiarrhythmic drug) • in whom refinement of clinical risk stratification for antithrombotic therapy is needed (see section
