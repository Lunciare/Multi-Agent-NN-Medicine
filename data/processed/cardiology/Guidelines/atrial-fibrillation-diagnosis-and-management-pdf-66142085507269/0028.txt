7 days, usually within 48 hours, without any treatment. Recommendations for research As part of the 2021 update, the guideline committee made 4 new research recommendations (marked [2021]). Research recommendations retained from the 2014 guideline are labelled [2014]. Key recommendations for research 1 Tests to diagnose persistent atrial fibrillation What is the diagnostic accuracy of key index tests (such as the KardiaMobile heart monitor (AliveCor), MyDiagnostik, Microlife BP monitors, iPhone plethysmography and pulse palpation) compared with the gold standard of 12-lead ECG in people with risk factors for or symptoms of atrial fibrillation? [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale on detection and diagnosis. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: accuracy of tests for detection. 2 Tests to diagnose paroxysmal atrial fibrillation What is the diagnostic accuracy of key index tests compared with the gold standard of prolonged ambulatory monitoring in people suspected of having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation? [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the rationale on detection and diagnosis.
