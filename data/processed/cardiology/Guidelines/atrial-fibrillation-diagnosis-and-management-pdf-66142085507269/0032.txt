accuracy. The committee made a research recommendation on tests to diagnose paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current good practice and are unlikely to have an impact on practice. Return to recommendations Stroke risk Recommendation 1.2.1 Why the committee made the recommendations The committee decided to prioritise identifying people above or below a certain risk threshold (discrimination) in its interpretation of the evidence rather than estimating a person's risk of stroke in absolute terms. The evidence suggested that a score of 2 or more is the ideal threshold for the CHA DS -VASC in terms of indicating the need for anticoagulation. (Men with a 2 2 CHA DS -VASc score of 1 were regarded as being at intermediate risk, and a group in 2 2 whom anticoagulation should also be considered.) The evidence showed that this threshold of 2 or more offered a good combination of high sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.23). The high sensitivity means that the tool would correctly identify almost everyone who would later have a stroke if they did not receive anticoagulants. Importantly, this will allow them to be prescribed anticoagulants to reduce their risk of stroke. The adequate
