affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on left atrial ablation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review J1: ablation, evidence review J2: ablation network meta-analysis and evidence review J3: ablation cost-effectiveness analysis. Preventing recurrence after ablation 1.7.22 Consider antiarrhythmic drug treatment for 3 months after left atrial ablation to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation, taking into account the person's preferences, and the risks and potential benefits. [2021] 1.7.23 Reassess the need for antiarrhythmic drug treatment at 3 months after left atrial ablation. [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on preventing recurrence after ablation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review K: antiarrhythmic drugs after ablation. Pace and ablate strategy 1.7.24 Consider pacing and atrioventricular node ablation for people with permanent atrial fibrillation with symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction thought to be caused by high ventricular rates. [2014] 1.7.25 When considering pacing and atrioventricular node ablation, reassess symptoms and the consequent need for ablation after pacing has been carried out and drug treatment further optimised. [2014] 1.7.26 Consider left
