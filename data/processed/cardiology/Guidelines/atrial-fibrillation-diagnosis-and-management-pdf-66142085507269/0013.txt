not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to people with atrial fibrillation. [2014] Review of people with atrial fibrillation 1.6.15 For people who are not taking an anticoagulant, review stroke risk when they reach age 65 or if they develop any of the following at any age: • diabetes • heart failure • peripheral arterial disease • coronary heart disease • stroke, transient ischaemic attack or systemic thromboembolism. [2014] 1.6.16 For people who are not taking an anticoagulant because of bleeding risk or other factors, review stroke and bleeding risks annually, and ensure that all reviews and decisions are documented. [2014] 1.6.17 For people who are taking an anticoagulant, review the need for anticoagulation and the quality of anticoagulation (taking into account MHRA advice on direct- acting oral anticoagulants about bleeding risk and the need to monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment) at least annually, or more frequently if clinically relevant events occur affecting anticoagulation or bleeding risk. [2014] Left atrial appendage occlusion 1.6.18 Consider left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) if anticoagulation is contraindicated or not tolerated and discuss the benefits and risks of LAAO with the person.
