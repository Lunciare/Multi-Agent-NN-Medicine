Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

suitable based on clinical judgement. [2014] 1.7.2 Offer either a standard beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol) or a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) as initial rate-control monotherapy to people with atrial fibrillation unless the person has the features described in recommendation 1.7.4. Base the choice of drug on the person's symptoms, heart rate, comorbidities and preferences. [2021] In April 2021, this was an off-label use of diltiazem. See NICE's information on prescribing medicines. 1.7.3 For people with atrial fibrillation and concomitant heart failure, follow the recommendations on the use of beta-blockers and avoiding calcium-channel blockers in NICE's guideline on chronic heart failure. [2021] 1.7.4 Consider digoxin monotherapy for initial rate control for people with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if: • the person does no or very little physical exercise or • other rate-limiting drug options are ruled out because of comorbidities or the person's preferences. [2021] 1.7.5 If monotherapy does not control the person's symptoms, and if continuing symptoms are thought to be caused by poor ventricular rate control, consider combination therapy with any 2 of the following: • a beta-blocker • diltiazem • digoxin. [2021] In April 2021, this was an off-label use of diltiazem. See
