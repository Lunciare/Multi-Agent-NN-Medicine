there is some variation, the committee agreed that good current practice is for patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs up to ablation to continue them for 3 months after ablation and reassess the need for drug treatment after this time. How the recommendations might affect practice There is some variation in current practice. Practice is likely to change in some centres both in prescribing and in the need for a more formal reassessment of treatment at 3 months. The impact on use of antiarrhythmic drugs is difficult to predict, but there may be an increase from current levels. Increased resources may be needed for reassessment, but it is anticipated that this could be performed at routine follow-up appointments with a cardiologist. Return to recommendations Rate and rhythm control for people presenting acutely Recommendation 1.8.3 Why the committee made the recommendation The committee agreed that the evidence was too limited in quality and quantity to be able to specify a preferred rate-control drug for acute atrial fibrillation. Although there was some evidence that amiodarone was better than digoxin for rate control, the committee had concerns about the quality of the evidence and the short timeframe used in 1 study, which it agreed could
