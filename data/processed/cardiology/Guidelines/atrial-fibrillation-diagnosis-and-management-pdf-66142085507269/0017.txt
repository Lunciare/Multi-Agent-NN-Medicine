to people with known ischaemic or structural heart disease. [2014] 1.7.10 If drug treatment for long-term rhythm control is needed, consider a standard beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol) as first-line treatment unless there are contraindications. [2014] 1.7.11 If beta-blockers are contraindicated or unsuccessful, assess the suitability of alternative drugs for rhythm control, taking comorbidities into account. [2014] 1.7.12 Dronedarone is recommended in NICE technology appraisal guidance as a second-line treatment option for long-term rhythm control in some people after successful cardioversion. For full details, see the guidance on dronedarone (TA197, 2012). [2014] 1.7.13 Consider amiodarone for people with left ventricular impairment or heart failure. [2014] 1.7.14 In people with infrequent paroxysms and few symptoms, or if symptoms are induced by known precipitants (such as alcohol, caffeine), a 'no drug treatment' strategy or a 'pill-in-the-pocket' strategy (in which antiarrhythmic drugs are taken only when an episode starts) should be considered and discussed with the person. [2006] 1.7.15 In people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a 'pill-in-the-pocket' strategy should be considered for those who: • have no history of left ventricular dysfunction, or valvular or ischaemic heart disease and • have a history of infrequent symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial
