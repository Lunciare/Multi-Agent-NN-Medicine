[2006] Left atrial ablation 1.7.19 If drug treatment is unsuccessful, unsuitable or not tolerated in people with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation: • consider radiofrequency point-by-point ablation or • if radiofrequency point-by-point ablation is assessed as being unsuitable, consider cryoballoon ablation or laser balloon ablation. [2021] 1.7.20 When considering left atrial ablation, discuss the risks and benefits and take into account the person's preferences. In particular, explain that the procedure is not always effective and that the resolution of symptoms may not be long-lasting. [2021] 1.7.21 Consider left atrial surgical ablation at the same time as other cardiothoracic surgery for people with symptomatic atrial fibrillation.
