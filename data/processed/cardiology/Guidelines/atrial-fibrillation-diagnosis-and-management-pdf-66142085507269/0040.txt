benefits of changing medication, the person's time in therapeutic range and the person's preferences should be explored at their next routine appointment. The committee agreed that the existing thresholds for the CHA DS -VASc score threshold 2 2 for anticoagulation are in line with current practice. Although bleeding risk scores may occasionally be used as a reason not to offer anticoagulation, the committee agreed that they should typically be used as a prompt to identify and manage modifiable risk factors for bleeding rather than as a reason for not offering anticoagulation in people at increased risk. The committee discussed that when anticoagulation is not given because of bleeding risk, people should have regular review and reconsideration for treatment. The committee were concerned that anticoagulation is sometimes not recommended for people at risk of falls and for older people, even though age is factored into the bleeding risk score and falls are rarely a cause of major haemorrhage. Age was therefore added to the previous recommendation on people at risk of falls to ensure that anticoagulation is offered in this population when needed. The benefits and harms should be discussed with the person. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations
