are at increased risk of fluid overload. Radiofrequency multi-electrode was not included as an alternative due to its lower efficacy relative to cryoballoon and laser ablation and concerns about a higher risk of stroke. There was limited evidence for ablation in people with persistent atrial fibrillation. Despite this, the committee decided that the evidence, combined with their experience and knowledge (also noting the Packer et al. CABANA randomized clinical trial, 2019, which contained a mixed population of people with persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) was sufficient to support ablation as an option to be considered for those with persistent symptoms that are not alleviated by, or who cannot have, antiarrhythmic drugs. The committee agreed that ablation can be effective in people with persistent atrial fibrillation, and that this population might have as much to gain from ablation as people with paroxysmal symptoms. The committee agreed that the cost-effectiveness analyses of different types of ablation in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could also be applied to this population. The committee emphasised the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of catheter ablation with the person, in particular the risk of adverse events. The discussion should also include that, in the experience of the
