Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

a suspicion of atrial fibrillation. This includes people presenting with any of the following: • breathlessness • palpitations • syncope or dizziness • chest discomfort • stroke or transient ischaemic attack. [2006] 1.1.2 Perform a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to make a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation if an irregular pulse is detected in people with suspected atrial fibrillation with or without symptoms. [2021] 1.1.3 In people with suspected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undetected by 12-lead ECG recording: • use a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor if asymptomatic episodes are suspected or symptomatic episodes are less than 24 hours apart • use an ambulatory ECG monitor, event recorder or other ECG technology for a period appropriate to detect atrial fibrillation if symptomatic episodes are more than 24 hours apart. [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2021 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on detection and diagnosis. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: effectiveness of tests for detection and evidence review B: accuracy of tests for detection. 1.2 Assessment of stroke and bleeding risks Stroke risk 1.2.1 Use the CHA DS -VASc stroke risk score
