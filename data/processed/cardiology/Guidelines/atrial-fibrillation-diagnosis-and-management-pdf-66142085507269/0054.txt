the same time. How the recommendations might affect practice Rhythm control for the treatment of new-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery is current practice and amiodarone is most commonly used. This can still be considered, but there may be a reduction in the use of rhythm control in this population and an increase in the use of rate-control drugs instead. Return to recommendations Stopping anticoagulation Recommendations 1.11.1 and 1.11.2 Why the committee made the recommendations There was limited evidence on whether to continue anticoagulation or to stop it and switch to aspirin after successful treatment of atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation. The committee agreed that the evidence was insufficient and that there was too much uncertainty in the results to make a recommendation based on the evidence. The committee therefore developed research recommendations on stopping anticoagulation after ablation and stopping anticoagulation after resolution of postoperative atrial fibrillation to encourage further research. The committee was concerned about the potential withdrawal of anticoagulation in people who had not had ablation or cardiac surgery for atrial fibrillation, but in whom sinus rhythm is now present and atrial fibrillation is no longer detectable. In particular, the committee noted that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is not
