people whose atrial fibrillation has resolved. 5 Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with atrial fibrillation What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy compared with usual care for people with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation? [2014] Other recommendations for research 6 Rate-control drug treatment for people aged 75 and over with atrial fibrillation What is the comparative effectiveness of the 3 main drug classes used for rate control (beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers and digoxin) in people aged 75 and over with atrial fibrillation in controlling symptoms, improving quality of life and reducing morbidity and mortality? [2014] 7 Stroke risk assessment Can routine data from UK primary care databases clarify stroke risk in people with atrial fibrillation according to baseline risk factors and treatment? [2014] Rationale and impact These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might affect practice. Detection and diagnosis Recommendations 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 Why the committee made the recommendations The evidence did not support changing the recommended diagnostic tests to either replace 12-lead ECG as the test to confirm persistent atrial fibrillation or replace pulse palpation as the initial step for persistent atrial fibrillation in a 2-step strategy.
