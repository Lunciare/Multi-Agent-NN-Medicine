list of criteria, including reduced haemoglobin, reduced haematocrit and history of anaemia. We deleted a paragraph of text from the rationale and impact section for recommendation 1.8.3 that was included incorrectly. April 2021: We have reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on diagnosis and assessment, assessment of stroke and bleeding risks, preventing stroke, rate and rhythm control, preventing recurrence, and preventing and managing postoperative atrial fibrillation. These recommendations are marked [2021]. Recommendations marked [2014] and [2006] last had an evidence review in 2014 and 2006 respectively. In some cases, minor changes have been made to the wording for clarity and to bring the language and style up to date, without changing the meaning. Minor changes since publication March 2025: We replaced technology appraisal guidance recommendations with links to the relevant guidance in the sections on direct-acting oral anticoagulant treatment options and antiarrhythmic drug therapy. August 2023: As part of our work to make our guidance more useful and usable, we are testing out some changes to improve the way we present our guidance.
