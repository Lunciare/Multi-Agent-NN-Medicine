KEYWORDS: atrial, fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, committee, people, risk, evidence, recommendations, ablation, anticoagulation, stroke, treatment, bleeding, control, practice

stop anticoagulation on a reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk using CHA DS -VASc and ORBIT and a discussion of the person's 2 2 preferences. [2021] For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on stopping anticoagulation. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review H: discontinuing anticoagulation in people whose atrial fibrillation has resolved. Terms used in this guideline This section defines terms that have been used in a particular way for this guideline. People with atrial fibrillation presenting acutely People presenting with atrial fibrillation of definite recent onset or with destabilisation of existing atrial fibrillation. This does not include people with atrial fibrillation that has been discovered incidentally, for example through pulse palpitation before routine blood pressure measurement. Pill-in-the-pocket strategy The person self-manages paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by taking antiarrhythmic drugs only when an episode of atrial fibrillation starts. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation Episodes of atrial fibrillation that stop within 7 days, usually within 48 hours, without any treatment. Recommendations for research As part of the 2021 update, the guideline committee made 4 new research recommendations (marked [2021]). Research recommendations
