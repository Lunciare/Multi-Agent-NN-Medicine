of discussing the risks and benefits of catheter ablation with the person, in particular the risk of adverse events. The discussion should also include that, in the experience of the committee, the effects of ablation may not be long term. How the recommendations might affect practice The committee noted that the recommendations are likely to reinforce current practice. Ablation is carried out in a relatively restricted population (approximately 1% to 2% of all people with atrial fibrillation currently have ablation) and is usually reserved for people in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have failed. The recommendation is likely to lead to a change in the types of ablation offered, with more people receiving radiofrequency point-by-point ablation and fewer having other catheter ablation techniques. Return to recommendations Preventing recurrence after ablation Recommendations 1.7.22 and 1.7.23 Why the committee made the recommendations Most of the evidence on preventing recurrence after ablation was for amiodarone. The evidence suggested that amiodarone may reduce recurrence of atrial fibrillation after ablation. However, there was evidence of an increased risk of hospitalisation and the committee noted the known side effects of amiodarone, which, although rare, can be severe and life-threatening. There was a lack of evidence for other antiarrhythmic
