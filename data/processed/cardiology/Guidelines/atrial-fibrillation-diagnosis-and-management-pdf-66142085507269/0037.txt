Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

committee concluded that this change is one that is worth making. One potential concern discussed by the committee is that ORBIT does not include all of the modifiable risk factors included in HAS-BLED so does not serve as a reminder of these to clinicians. However, the committee considered that fully investigating modifiable risk factors is established clinical practice, regardless of the tool used. Another potential challenge is that ORBIT is not the recommended bleeding risk tool for other conditions (such as venous thromboembolism). Therefore, an initial transition period may be needed for training and education in both primary and secondary care while healthcare professionals become familiar with the tool. This will have a resource impact, although it will be time limited. The committee also noted that use of the ORBIT tool, and access to online versions, is straightforward. Finally, the committee also discussed that, unlike HAS-BLED, ORBIT is not embedded in GP systems, which may cause some initial practical difficulties. However, because this will involve changes to centralised software, it is thought that it will be straightforward to implement and ORBIT will quickly be included in GP systems. Neither tool is included in hospital systems although both are widely available
