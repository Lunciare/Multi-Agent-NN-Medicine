Neither tool is included in hospital systems although both are widely available on smartphone apps.

An economic model also showed that they offered a better balance of benefits to costs than warfarin. There were no studies directly comparing the direct-acting anticoagulants head-to-head but indirect comparisons based on the clinical evidence showed that the different direct-acting oral anticoagulants offered different benefits depending on the outcome considered. When all these outcomes were combined in the cost-effectiveness analysis, apixaban was the most clinically effective and cost-effective anticoagulant based on UK drug tariff prices at the time. However, the committee had concerns over the lack of head-to-head comparisons, differences in the study populations and uncertainties in the economic model. Based on the evidence and their experience, the committee decided not to recommend one direct-acting oral anticoagulant over the others, but instead to emphasise that treatment should be tailored to
