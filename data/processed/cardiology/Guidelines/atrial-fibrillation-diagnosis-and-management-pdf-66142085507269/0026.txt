[2021] 1.10.6 If a rhythm-control strategy is chosen, reassess the need for antiarrhythmic drug treatment at a suitable time point (usually at around 6 weeks). [2021] Atrial fibrillation after non-cardiothoracic surgery 1.10.7 Manage postoperative atrial fibrillation after non-cardiothoracic surgery in the same way as for new-onset atrial fibrillation with any other cause. [2006, amended 2014] Antithrombotic therapy for postoperative atrial fibrillation 1.10.8 In the prophylaxis and management of postoperative atrial fibrillation, use appropriate antithrombotic therapy and correct identifiable causes (such as electrolyte imbalance or hypoxia). [2006, amended 2014] For a short explanation of why the committee made the 2021 recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on managing atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review L: treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery. 1.11 Stopping anticoagulation 1.11.1 In people with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, do not stop anticoagulation solely because atrial fibrillation is no longer detectable. [2021] 1.11.2 Base decisions to stop anticoagulation on a reassessment of stroke and bleeding risk using CHA DS -VASc and ORBIT and a discussion of the person's 2 2 preferences.
