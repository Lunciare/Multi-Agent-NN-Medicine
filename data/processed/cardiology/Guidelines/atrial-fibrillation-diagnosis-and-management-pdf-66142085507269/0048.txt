risk of hospitalisation and the committee noted the known side effects of amiodarone, which, although rare, can be severe and life-threatening. There was a lack of evidence for other antiarrhythmic drugs and there were no comparisons between different antiarrhythmic drugs. Therefore, the committee agreed that there was too much uncertainty to recommend one specific antiarrhythmic drug over others. In addition, the studies often made no distinction between people who had been on antiarrhythmic drugs up to ablation and those who had not. There is variation in current practice on whether people who were not previously taking antiarrhythmic drugs should start them after ablation to reduce recurrence. However, the evidence did not support making separate recommendations to clarify this. The committee decided that antiarrhythmic drug treatment should be considered after ablation, but only after discussion with the person, taking into account their preferences for treatment and the potential individual risks and benefits. In particular, the committee noted that people should fully understand the potential adverse events associated with these drugs. While there is some variation, the committee agreed that good current practice is for patients taking antiarrhythmic drugs up to ablation to continue them for 3 months after ablation and reassess
