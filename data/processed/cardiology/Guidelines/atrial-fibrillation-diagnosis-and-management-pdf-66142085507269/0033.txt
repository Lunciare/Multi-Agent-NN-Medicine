Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

everyone who would later have a stroke if they did not receive anticoagulants. Importantly, this will allow them to be prescribed anticoagulants to reduce their risk of stroke. The adequate specificity means that 23% of the people who would not later have a stroke (even when not taking anticoagulants) would be correctly identified as not needing anticoagulation. This would prevent these people from having adverse events from anticoagulants. It also means that 77% of people who would not later have a stroke (without anticoagulation) would be wrongly identified as needing anticoagulation. However, this was thought to be acceptable given the perceived lesser harms from unnecessarily giving anticoagulants compared with not giving anticoagulants to people who need them, together with the inevitable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The ATRIA stroke risk score was shown to have better overall accuracy, but although it had better specificity than CHA DS -VASc (fewer false-positive results) it had lower sensitivity, 2 2 meaning that more people at risk would be missed (more false-negative results) compared with the CHA DS -VASc score. As already suggested, sensitivity was agreed by the 2 2 committee to be more important than specificity because the risks of unnecessary anticoagulation are
