Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

the guidance on: • edoxaban (TA355, 2021) • apixaban (TA275, 2021) • rivaroxaban (TA256, 2021) • dabigatran etexilate (TA249, 2021). For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on stroke prevention. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review G1: anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in people with atrial fibrillation and evidence review G2: anticoagulant therapy health economics analysis. Assessing anticoagulation control with vitamin K antagonists 1.6.10 Calculate the person's time in therapeutic range (TTR) at each visit. When calculating TTR: • use a validated method of measurement such as the Rosendaal method for computer-assisted dosing or proportion of tests in range for manual dosing • exclude measurements taken during the first 6 weeks of treatment • calculate TTR over a maintenance period of at least 6 months. [2014] 1.6.11 Reassess anticoagulation for a person whose anticoagulation is poorly controlled shown by any of the following: • 2 INR values higher than 5 or 1 INR value higher than 8 within the past 6 months • 2 INR values less than 1.5 within the past 6 months • TTR less
