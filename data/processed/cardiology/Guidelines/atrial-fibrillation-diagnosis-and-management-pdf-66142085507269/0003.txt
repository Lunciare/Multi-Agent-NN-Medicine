Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

tests for detection and evidence review B: accuracy of tests for detection. 1.2 Assessment of stroke and bleeding risks Stroke risk 1.2.1 Use the CHA DS -VASc stroke risk score to assess stroke risk in people with any 2 2 of the following: • symptomatic or asymptomatic paroxysmal, persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation • atrial flutter • a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus rhythm or catheter ablation. [2021] See the section on review of people with atrial fibrillation for advice on reassessment of stroke risk. For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on stroke risk. Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review C and D: tools to predict stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. Bleeding risk 1.2.2 Assess the risk of bleeding when: • considering starting anticoagulation in people with atrial fibrillation and • reviewing people already taking anticoagulation. Use the ORBIT bleeding risk score because evidence shows that it has a higher accuracy in predicting absolute bleeding risk than other bleeding risk tools. Accurate knowledge of bleeding risk supports shared decision making
