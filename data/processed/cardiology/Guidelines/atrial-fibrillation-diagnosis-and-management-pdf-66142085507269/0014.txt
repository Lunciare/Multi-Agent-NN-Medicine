appendage occlusion (LAAO) if anticoagulation is contraindicated or not tolerated and discuss the benefits and risks of LAAO with the person. For more information see NICE's interventional procedure guidance on percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage in non-valvular atrial fibrillation for the prevention of thromboembolism. [2014] 1.6.19 Do not offer LAAO as an alternative to anticoagulation unless anticoagulation is contraindicated or not tolerated. [2014] 1.7 Rate and rhythm control This section covers rate and rhythm control in non-acute settings. See section 1.8 for rate and rhythm control for people presenting acutely (either new onset or destabilisation of existing atrial fibrillation). Rate control 1.7.1 Offer rate control as the first-line treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation except in people: • whose atrial fibrillation has a reversible cause • who have heart failure thought to be primarily caused by atrial fibrillation • with new-onset atrial fibrillation • with atrial flutter whose condition is considered suitable for an ablation strategy to restore sinus rhythm • for whom a rhythm-control strategy would be more suitable based on clinical judgement. [2014] 1.7.2 Offer either a standard beta-blocker (that is, a beta-blocker other than sotalol) or a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) as initial rate-control
