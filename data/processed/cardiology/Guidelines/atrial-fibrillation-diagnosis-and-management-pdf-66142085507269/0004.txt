Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

risk score because evidence shows that it has a higher accuracy in predicting absolute bleeding risk than other bleeding risk tools. Accurate knowledge of bleeding risk supports shared decision making and has practical benefits, for example, increasing patient confidence and willingness to accept treatment when risk is low and prompting discussion of risk reduction when risk is high. Although ORBIT is the best tool for this purpose, other bleeding risk tools may need to be used until it is embedded in clinical pathways and electronic systems. [2021] 1.2.3 Offer monitoring and support to modify risk factors for bleeding, including: • uncontrolled hypertension (see NICE's guideline on hypertension in adults) • poor control of international normalised ratio (INR) in patients on vitamin K antagonists • concurrent medication, including antiplatelets, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) • harmful alcohol consumption (see NICE's guideline on alcohol-use disorders: diagnosis, assessment and management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence) • reversible causes of anaemia.
