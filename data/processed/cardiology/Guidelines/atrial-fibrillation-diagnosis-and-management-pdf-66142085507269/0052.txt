affect practice The committee agreed that the recommendation would not constitute a change in practice, and that there would not be a resource impact on the NHS. Return to recommendations Managing atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery Recommendations 1.10.5 and 1.10.6 Why the committee made the recommendations The evidence on managing postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery in people without pre-existing atrial fibrillation was limited – many of the studies reviewed were old and included small numbers of participants. There were few studies comparing drug classes, and the committee agreed that they could not recommend a particular class of drugs based on such limited evidence. One larger study comparing mixed rate control and rhythm control with a potassium-channel blocker (amiodarone) with or without rate control suggested little difference between the 2 groups. Based on this evidence and their experience, the committee decided that rhythm control could be considered but that the evidence no longer supported the stronger recommendation included in the 2014 guideline. The committee noted that postoperative atrial fibrillation often resolves naturally, meaning that rate control rather than rhythm control may be a suitable option for some people. Reducing the emphasis on rhythm-control strategies will allow rate-control strategies to be
