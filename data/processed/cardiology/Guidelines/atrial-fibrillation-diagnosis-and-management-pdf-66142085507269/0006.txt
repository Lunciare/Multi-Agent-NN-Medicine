failure or heart murmur) that influences their subsequent management (for example, choice of antiarrhythmic drug) • in whom refinement of clinical risk stratification for antithrombotic therapy is needed (see section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and section 1.6 on stroke prevention). [2006, amended 2014] 1.3.2 Do not routinely perform TTE solely for the purpose of further stroke risk stratification in people with atrial fibrillation for whom the need to start anticoagulation therapy has already been agreed on appropriate clinical criteria (see section 1.2 on assessment of stroke and bleeding risks and section 1.6 on stroke prevention). [2006, amended 2014] 1.3.3 Perform transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) in people with atrial fibrillation: • when TTE demonstrates an abnormality (such as valvular heart disease) that warrants further specific assessment • in whom TTE is technically difficult and/or of questionable quality and when there is a need to exclude cardiac abnormalities • for whom TOE-guided cardioversion is being considered. [2006] 1.4 Personalised package of care and information 1.4.1 Offer people with atrial fibrillation a personalised package of care. Ensure that the package of care is documented and delivered, and that it covers: • stroke awareness and measures to prevent stroke • rate
