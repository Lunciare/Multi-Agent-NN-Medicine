Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management

with increased mortality. Men are more commonly affected than women and the prevalence increases with age and in underlying heart disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Atrial fibrillation is typically detected as an irregular pulse or an irregular rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG). This may be an incidental finding or may arise while investigating symptoms suggestive of the disease. Because atrial fibrillation can be intermittent, detection and diagnosis may be challenging. The aim of treatment is to prevent complications, particularly stroke, and alleviate symptoms. Drug treatments include anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke and antiarrhythmics to restore or maintain the normal heart rhythm or to slow the heart rate in people who remain in atrial fibrillation. Non-pharmacological management includes electrical cardioversion, which may be used to 'shock' the heart back to its normal rhythm, and catheter or surgical ablation to create lesions to stop the triggers that cause atrial fibrillation. These procedures can markedly reduce the symptom burden when drug therapy is ineffective or not tolerated. This update focuses on areas of new evidence and changing practice since the 2014 NICE guideline. These include methods of identifying atrial fibrillation; assessing stroke and bleeding risk; antithrombotic agents; ablation strategies; preventing recurrence;
