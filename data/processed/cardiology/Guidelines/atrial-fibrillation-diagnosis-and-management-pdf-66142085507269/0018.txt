considered for those who: • have no history of left ventricular dysfunction, or valvular or ischaemic heart disease and • have a history of infrequent symptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and • have a systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg and a resting heart rate above 70 bpm and • are able to understand how to, and when to, take the medication. [2006] Cardioversion 1.7.16 For people having cardioversion for atrial fibrillation that has persisted for longer than 48 hours, offer electrical (rather than pharmacological) cardioversion. [2014] 1.7.17 Consider amiodarone therapy starting 4 weeks before and continuing for up to 12 months after electrical cardioversion to maintain sinus rhythm, and discuss the benefits and risks of amiodarone with the person. [2014] 1.7.18 For people with atrial fibrillation of greater than 48 hours' duration, in whom elective cardioversion is indicated: • both transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)-guided cardioversion and conventional cardioversion should be considered equally effective • a TOE-guided cardioversion strategy should be considered: － if experienced staff and appropriate facilities are available and － if a minimal period of precardioversion anticoagulation is indicated due to the person's choice or bleeding risks.
