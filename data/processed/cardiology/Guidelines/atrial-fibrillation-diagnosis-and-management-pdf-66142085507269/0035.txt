who should have anticoagulation. Instead, the tool should be used to provide accurate knowledge of absolute bleeding risk, which can support discussions between the person and their healthcare professional about bleeding risk modification and appropriate levels of vigilance. They therefore agreed that accurately estimating absolute risk (calibration) is more important than identifying a risk threshold for anticoagulation (discrimination) when choosing between different bleeding risk tools. The committee focused on calibration data for the tools with the most evidence: ORBIT, HAS-BLED and ATRIA. The calibration evidence clearly suggested that ORBIT was more accurate than HAS-BLED and ATRIA at predicting absolute risk of major bleeding, both for people using vitamin K antagonists and those using direct-acting oral anticoagulants. Importantly, ORBIT was better calibrated at all levels of major bleeding risk, including higher levels. ORBIT was also better at predicting absolute risk of intracranial haemorrhage. The discrimination data showed little difference between tools in predicting major bleeding, with some outcome measures showing no difference and others showing a slight benefit for either ORBIT or HAS-BLED. Evidence showed that ORBIT had a significantly higher specificity and a slighter lower sensitivity than the other tools, but the committee agreed that the lower sensitivity would not
