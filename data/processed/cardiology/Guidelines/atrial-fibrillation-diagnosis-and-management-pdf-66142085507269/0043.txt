There was a lack of evidence on long-term rate control, and the committee were aware of numerous serious side effects associated with the long-term use of amiodarone (including thyroid, lung and nerve damage), many of which are irreversible. The committee noted that although the most common side effects were less severe, the occurrence of severe side effects was unpredictable and long-term rate control with amiodarone should be avoided. Amiodarone should only be used as an interim therapy, for example while waiting for cardioversion, and would not usually be taken for longer than 12 months. How the recommendations might affect practice The recommendations reflect current practice. Digoxin monotherapy may now be an option in non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if comorbidities or patient preferences limit other rate-control drug choices. However, the committee agreed that this already happens in practice. Return to recommendations Left atrial ablation Recommendations 1.7.19 to 1.7.20 Why the committee made the recommendations Ablation may be a treatment option if antiarrhythmic drug treatment has not been successful or is not tolerated. The committee reviewed new clinical and health economic evidence for the different types of ablation for
