not fully capture differences in resource use between the different techniques. However, despite further analysis to adjust costs and account for this, radiofrequency point-by-point ablation remained the most cost-effective option, and other catheter ablation techniques are therefore unlikely to provide a cost-effective use of NHS resources. Based on the economic model results the committee agreed that radiofrequency point-by-point ablation should be considered in people with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation if drug treatment is unsuccessful, unsuitable or not tolerated. The committee noted that cryoballoon and laser ablation may be more suitable for some patients because they can sometimes be carried out without general anaesthesia, and cryoballoon ablation may be quicker to perform, with same-day discharge more likely. There is also an increased risk of fluid overload from saline irrigated radiofrequency ablation. They decided that either cryoballoon or laser ablation could be considered if radiofrequency point-by-point ablation is not suitable; for example, if a short procedure time is a priority or for people with a recent history of decompensated heart failure who are at increased risk of fluid overload. Radiofrequency multi-electrode was not included as an alternative due to its lower efficacy relative to cryoballoon and laser ablation and concerns about a
