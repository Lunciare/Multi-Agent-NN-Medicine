and any other official recommendations or guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health pro-
fessionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines and Focused Updates fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation of
preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC Guidelines and Focused Updates do not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or necessary,
the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC Guidelines and Focused Updates exempt health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommenda-
tions or guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and
professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations relating to drugs and medical devices at the time of prescription.
