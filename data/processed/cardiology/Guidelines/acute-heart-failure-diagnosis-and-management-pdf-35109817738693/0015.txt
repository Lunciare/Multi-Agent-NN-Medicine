Intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation In people with acute heart failure and hypoperfusion syndrome, is the use of intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation pump (IABP) better than the use of intravenous inotropes? Why this is important A randomised controlled trial should be conducted in people with decompensated heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion comparing the use of IABP with the use of inotropes/vasopressors. This would determine which strategy is more clinically and cost effective in this cohort. IABP is used in the hospital setting as an adjuvant in people with critical coronary ischaemia and in people with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. It has also been used in people who develop cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is uncertain whether it can provide clinical benefit in the critically unwell patients with acute heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and systemic hypoperfusion. 4 Ultrafiltration In people with decompensated heart failure, fluid congestion and diuretic resistance, does Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management (CG187) ultrafiltration lead to more rapid and effective decongestion compared with continuing diuretic treatment? Why this is important A randomised controlled trial should be undertaken to determine whether ultrafiltration is more clinically and
