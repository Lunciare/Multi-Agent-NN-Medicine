persistent congestion, does the addition of a thiazide diuretic to standard therapy lead to greater diuresis compared with adding placebo to standard therapy? Acute heart failure: diagnosis and management (CG187) Why this is important A randomised controlled trial should be conducted to investigate whether the addition of a thiazide diuretic to standard therapy leads to more clinically and cost effective decongestion in people admitted to hospital for treatment of decompensated heart failure. One of the most common and difficult to manage problems arising during the initial treatment of people with acute heart failure is an inadequate response to intravenous diuretic therapy. This frequently leads to a prolonged inpatient stay and is associated with higher inpatient mortality and higher post-discharge mortality and re-admission rates. The best treatment for this problem is unknown. However, there is some inconsistent and non-robust evidence that addition of a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (metolazone) may be beneficial. The proposed study would aim to resolve this uncertainty and guide the management of a difficult clinical problem. 3 Intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation In people with acute heart failure and hypoperfusion syndrome, is the use of intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation pump (IABP) better than the use of intravenous inotropes? Why this
