Narrow complex
tachycardia; it recurs after
adenosine. What should we
do now?
A 50-something male presented with palpitations. He had a
fever and hypotension (BP 80/40). His volume status was low
by ultrasound (flat IVC), and he had good LV function. He had
no B lines. He had a history atrial fibrillaton and ablation, but
has been in sinus rhythm recently. IV fluids were given, and
because of his heart rate of 190 bpm, this ECG was recorded:
Heart rate 156. What do you think?
There is a narrow complex tachycardia without P waves (you
must look carefully for P waves!! Especially in a patient with
fever (thus, supraventricular tachycardia, or SVT). It could be
Atrial flutter, AVNRT, AVRT (WPW), or atrial tachycardia.
There are no flutter wavies. It is not irregularly irregular, so it

is NOT atrial fibrillation. It is however, regularly irregular, as

there are 2 different RR intervals (and each with its own
voltage amplitude!). One RR interval is 360 ms, the other is
400 ms. I donʼt see any P-wave or even retrograde P-waves,
and sinus tach at 190 would be very unusual for a 50-
something.
An aside, not critical to management: The differing RR
intervals suggests PSVT (paroxysmal SVT) due to AVNRT
with triple AV nodal pathways. See this amazing case of
dual AV nodal pathways in addition to a 3rd pathway which
is an accessory pathway (WPW) and an explanation and
diagram of what it means. All AVNRT has 2 pathways, one
fast and one slow. In this case, in order to have 2 different
speeds, and since there is no accessory pathway, the third
pathway is within the AV node. There is likely one fast
pathway and 2 slow ones. See this article:Typical
Atrioventricular Nodal Re-Entry Tachycardia Masquerading
as Atrial Fibrillation.
What would you do?
Adenosine is a good choice, and so is electricity. Electricity
requires deep sedation, which takes more time than
adenosine, so I would start with adenosine.
The providers gave adenosine. It converted to sinus rhythm,
and then rapidly reverted to the above rhythm.
What would you do now?
Because it reverted, there is no point in giving a treatment
that only lasts seconds, as it will just revert AGAIN. This
means that neither electricity nor adenosine will result in
sustained sinus rhythm.
The providers tried adenosine 2 more times, and each time
the rhythm converted to sinus then reverted to SVT. They
then tried electrical cardioversion (this is pointless!). Both
times it converted then reverted. Cardiology was consulted
and they recommended amiodarone bolus and drip. This had
no effect.
The patient remained hypotensive after fluids.
I came on duty in the ED at this point in time. My practice is
that, when SVT reverts, I first make certain that the K and Mg
are replenished and if this does not prevent reversion, and if
there is good LV function, then I want to give an AV nodal
blocker that will persist (adenosine and electricity are both
gone quickly). That means a calcium channel blocker
(verapamil or diltiazem). When I first started EM, there was

no adenosine and we always gave verapamil for SVT. It works
and the data shows it is pretty safe (a meta-analysis with 4%
hypotension vs. 1% with adenosine).
Only give a calcium channel blocker if LV function is good!! They
diminish contractility and can lead to shock in a patient with poor LV
function.
The patient was already on amiodarone drip and bolus. So I
suggested we first try electrical cardioversion to see if the
amiodarone would keep the patient in sinus. The patient
converted to sinus and again reverted within seconds to SVT.
So we stopped the amiodarone. We started a phenylephrine
infusion for the hypotension prior to giving a calcium channel
blocker which could exacerbate hypotension. We used
phenylephrine in order to avoid the beta stimulation of
norepinephrine – beta stimulation could make it more difficult
to control SVT). After the BP increased to 105/70, we gave a
diltiazem bolus (not verapamil only because we do not stock
it in the ED) and there was immediate and sustained
conversion to sinus rhythm.
= = Sin=Sinus rhythm at a rate of 66.
A diltiazem infusion was also started.
A Chest X-ray confirmed pneumonia. The patient remained
hypotensive. Notice there is absence of appropriate reflex
sinus tachcardia, as one would both desire (in order to
improve cardiac output) and expect (as happens is sepsis
with hypotension). This relative sinus bradycardiais of
course due to the diltiazem, which slows the sinus rate.
Because of this, the patient continued to require
phenylephrine for blood pressure support.
The patient ultimately did well.
Here are some guidelines for SVT management. Then see the
other cases below:

Todayʼs case by Dr. Smith highlights a series of important
points regarding assessment and management of reentry
SVT (SupraVentricular Tachycardia) rhythms. These points
include the following:
The history may be insightful. The patient in todayʼs
case had AFib in the past — that was successfully
ablated. As noted by Romero et al (Heart Rhythm
4(11):1637-1646, 2017) — Catheter ablation of AFib may
predispose to the subsequent development of a reentry
SVT rhythm (ie, AVNRT, AVRT) by altering conduction
pathway properties, thereby potentially facilitating
development and maintenance of a reentry circuit.
Itʼs EASY to overlook the underlying pattern of todayʼs
rhythm. For example, when you first saw todayʼs rhythm —
Did YOU think the rhythm was regular?
As per Dr. Smith — Todayʼs rhythm is not regular. Instead
— there is a regular irregularity, in the form of a
repetitive pattern in which slightly longer R-R intervals
alternate with slightly shorter R-R intervals (ie, R-R
intervals inFigure-1that begin with even-numbered
beats are slightly longer than R-R intervals beginning
with odd-numbered beats).
Even without calipers — this irregular irreglarity can be
appreciated if you focus for a moment on the long lead II
rhythm strip that appears below the 12-lead ECG in
Figure-1.
Recognition that this narrow complex (therefore
supraventricular)tachycardia has a repetitive pattern —
immediatelly limits the differentialdiagnosis by ruling
out sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.
AFlutter and ATach are also unlikely — since although
Wenckebach conduction may be associated with these 2
SVT rhythms, the subtle every-other-beat variation in R-
R interval at the rapid rate seen in Figure-1 is much more
typical of a reentry SVT (either AVNRT or AVRT).

Is there Atrial Activity?
Normal sinus P waves are clearly absent in Figure-1.
However, there is beat-to-beat variation in the ST
segments that to me suggests that there may be some
form of atrial activity hidden within.
I thought a pattern of alternate beat ST segment
variation was best suggested in lead V3 (within the
BLUE rectangle in Figure-1) — albeit this pattern is not
consistently seen in other leads.
In addition to this hint of retrograde atrial conduction —
there appears to be electricalalternansin a number of
leads in Figure-1 (ie, alternate beat variation in QRS
morphologyseen best in lead V3— but also consistenly
seen in leads II,aVF; and in V4,V5,V6 in the form of
alternating QRS amplitude).
As I review in detail in theNovember 28, 2022 post of
Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog (in My Comment at the bottom of
the page) — the presence of electrical alternans
increases the likelihood of a reentrySVT rhythm.
= = =
The Mechanism of Todayʼs Rhythm
Why then do we see alternating R-R intervals in todayʼs
reentry SVT?

Against Wenckebach conduction is the lack of a
dropped beat.
Instead — I suspect the presence of dual AV Nodal
pathways, each with its own speed of retrograde
conduction is the reason for persistence of alternating
R-R intervals in todayʼs rhythm.
The theoretical laddergram I propose in my above
Figure-1 illustrates one pathway with slightly slower
retrograde conduction (PURPLE broken lines) alternating
with a second pathway with slightly faster retrograde
conduction (RED broken lines).

KEY Points in Management:
Dr. Smithʼs above discussion highlights the relevance of
recognizing that todayʼs rhythm is indeed a reentry SVT.
Adenosine was given — and promptly converted the
SVT (as it almost always does for reentry SVT rhythms).
Sometimes this is all that is needed. However, in todayʼs
case — the rhythm promptly reverted to the reentry SVT.
The immediate conversion of todayʼs rhythm after the
initial dose of Adenosine strongly supports the premise
that the rhythm is a reentry SVT (AVNRT or AVRT).
Rapid reversion back to the reentry SVT tells us that
neither repeat Adenosine doses nor cardioversion will
succeed in maintaining sinus rhythm. Instead — a
longer-acting drug ( = IV Diltiazem in todayʼs case) will
be needed to maintain sinus rhythm.
PEARL: Remember to always record a long lead rhythm strip
for the 60-to-90 seconds after giving Adenosine! This is
because things happen quickly after you give Adenosine —
and it is EASY to miss the important fact that the Adenosine
did its job and converted the rhythm to sinus unless you have
a hard copy recording that you can look at.
Otherwise, all the “action” will be over in seconds and
you may easily miss the momentary conversion to sinus
rhythm because your eyes were on the patient.
The moment we see that Adenosine did its job — but
that the patient immediately reverted back to the SVT —
we know itʼs time to stop giving Adenosine, and instead
use a long-acting agent.
