Case Summary

A man in his 60s presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. He had prior ECGs on file and no immediate instability at triage. An initial ECG was obtained and interpreted as “no STEMI”, with the patient subsequently returned to the waiting room.

Shortly thereafter, the patient suffered a ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest in the waiting area.

Initial Triage ECG

Sinus rhythm

Marked left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)

Very high voltage QRS complexes

In lateral leads V5–V6:

Upright, enlarged T waves

Concordant ST segment and T wave

Terminal QRS distortion (tall R wave without S wave)

Without prior ECGs for comparison, the findings were judged non-diagnostic.
AI (Queen of Hearts) also labeled the ECG as not specific for OMI.

Critical Error

The ECG was not compared side-by-side with prior tracings.

Comparison With Prior ECGs

When compared with ECGs from:

6 days prior

2 months prior

…the triage ECG showed clear new ST–T changes in the lateral leads that were absent previously.

👉 In a patient with acute chest pain, these new changes are diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion (OMI) until proven otherwise.

Despite this:

The ECG was interpreted as “no significant change”

No cath lab activation

Patient was sent back to the waiting room

Cardiac Arrest and Post-ROSC ECG

While waiting, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation and required defibrillation, achieving ROSC.

Approximately 5 minutes after ROSC, a repeat ECG showed:

Obvious anterolateral OMI

Clear STEMI criteria

Marked evolution of ischemic changes

This ECG finally triggered urgent intervention.

Angiography Findings

Total proximal LAD occlusion

Successful stent placement

Notable observation:

After LAD occlusion, S-wave amplitude in V2–V3 decreased

This explains why severe LVH and acute STEMI rarely coexist clearly on ECG — ischemia often reduces precordial voltage

Hospital Course

Peak troponin I >25,000 ng/L

Initial echocardiogram:

EF 15%

Severe global hypokinesis

Akinesis of multiple territories

Prior echo (3 months earlier): EF 40%, mild global hypokinesis

Important Insight

The initial severe LV dysfunction was largely due to myocardial stunning, not permanent necrosis.

Over the following weeks:

EF recovered from 15% → ~40%

Had the patient not arrested, he likely would have remained in the waiting room long enough to sustain irreversible transmural infarction with permanent severe heart failure.

Key Learning Points

LVH makes ischemia harder to recognize, but does not excuse missing it

In chest pain patients:

Rule out OMI, do not rule it in

Side-by-side ECG comparison is essential

LV “strain” causes:

ST depression / flattening in lateral leads

NOT convex ST elevation

Concordant ST elevation in LVH is highly suspicious

When in doubt:

Repeat ECGs every 15 minutes

Consider half-standard voltage ECG to reduce QRS overlap

Cardiac arrest, paradoxically, saved this patient’s myocardium

Bottom Line

This case illustrates how acute coronary occlusion can be missed in the presence of LVH, and how failure to compare ECGs led to delayed diagnosis. The patient was “fortunate” to suffer a cardiac arrest because it forced recognition of a diagnostic ECG that had already been present — allowing myocardial salvage that otherwise would have been lost.
