Case Setup

AVNRT is the first thought because it’s common, but 118 bpm is slow for typical AVNRT (often ~140–280). Another view: JT fits the slower rate better, but true junctional tachycardia is rare in adults. Ken Grauer’s position: the RP′ interval is relatively long (retrograde P waves occur past mid-ST segment) → favors orthodromic AVRT over AVNRT and over adult JT (which usually has a shorter RP′, when retrograde P waves are visible). Bottom-line diagnostic reality: you often cannot know with absolute certainty from a single ECG snapshot, but the rhythm is best characterized as a regular SVT with 1:1 retrograde P waves (short-RP SVT). Behavioral Clues That Help Distinguish Mechanism (when available) Onset Reentry (AVNRT/AVRT): often abrupt onset, triggered by PAC/PVC Automatic (some AT, JT): “warm-up” period (gradual acceleration) Regularity Reentry: highly regular Automatic: more variability / slight irregularity Termination Reentry: terminates when circuit interrupted (often abruptly) Automatic: may slow/stop as focus loses dominance Patient context JT is mostly pediatric; adult “junctional” rhythms often reflect “something else” (illness, drugs, electrolytes, postop state, etc.) ED Management (What to do) Primary diagnostic–therapeutic maneuver: Adenosine AVNRT / AVRT: usually terminates with adenosine (conversion to sinus rhythm) Automatic atrial tachycardia: adenosine may cause transient
