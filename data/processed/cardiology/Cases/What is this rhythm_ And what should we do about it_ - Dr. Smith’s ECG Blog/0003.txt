Case Setup
KEYWORDS: waves, tachycardia, avnrt, adenosine, automatic, atrial, retrograde, retrograde waves, junctional, slow, svt, avrt, junctional tachycardia, reentry, usually

postop state, etc.) ED Management (What to do) Primary diagnostic–therapeutic maneuver: Adenosine AVNRT / AVRT: usually terminates with adenosine (conversion to sinus rhythm) Automatic atrial tachycardia: adenosine may cause transient AV block revealing atrial activity (P waves continue), no conversion Junctional tachycardia (automatic): typically does not terminate with adenosine → if no termination, consider JT/automatic mechanism and search for underlying cause (myocarditis, infection, meds/drugs, electrolytes, etc.) Practical ED takeaway in this case: treat as SVT and try adenosine; use the response to refine diagnosis and next steps.
