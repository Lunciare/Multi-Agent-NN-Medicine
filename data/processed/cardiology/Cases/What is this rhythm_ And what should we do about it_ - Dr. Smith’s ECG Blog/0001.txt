Case Setup

ECG presented without patient information. Task: identify the rhythm and decide what to do in the ED. Core ECG Description Regular narrow-complex tachycardia at ~118 bpm Normal axis No sinus P waves (no upright P in lead II) Atrial activity is present but subtle: Negative P waves in inferior leads (hidden in ST segments) Small upright P waves in V1 (high-frequency “sharper” than T waves) Retrograde atrial activation: wavefront travels inferior → superior RP interval ~120 ms → short-RP tachycardia Retrograde P waves show constant RP′ interval and are 1:1 related to the preceding QRS Differential Diagnosis (Short-RP SVT with retrograde P waves) Low atrial tachycardia (possibly with long PR / 1° AV block) Junctional tachycardia (JT) (automatic focus at AV junction) Orthodromic AVRT (reentry via AV node down, accessory pathway back) Slow–fast AVNRT (most common SVT mechanism; usually faster rates, but can be slower) Fast–slow AVNRT is unlikely because that is typically a long-RP tachycardia (P wave appears just before QRS). Key Interpretation Debate in the Case One view: AVNRT is the first thought because it’s common, but 118 bpm is slow for typical AVNRT (often ~140–280). Another view: JT fits the slower rate better, but true junctional tachycardia
