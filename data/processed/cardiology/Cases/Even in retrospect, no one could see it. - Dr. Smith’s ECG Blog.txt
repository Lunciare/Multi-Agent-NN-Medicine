Steve Smith onMarch 27, 2025
Even in retrospect, no one
could see it.
This was sent to me by a former resident who is outstanding at
reading ECGs for OMI.
“Hi Steve wonder what you think of this ecg in a 60 yo woman w cp,
known CAD”
Presentation ECG (ECG 1):
 
Here is her previous from one week prior when she presented with
heart failure and trops were “negative” (ECG 2):
My response: “They both look like active ischemia. The top one

(ECG 1) looks like “precordial swirl“, which is LAD Occlusion. The
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/even-in-retrospect-no-one-could-see-it/ 1/11
previous ECG also shows active ischemia.”
The Queen of Hearts diagnosed “Subendocardial Ischemia“
More explanation: Both have some lateral precordial ST depression
which looks like subendocardial ischemia. However, the presentation
ECG (ECG 1) has large, bulky T-waves. By itself, it is very concerning
for LAD Occlusion with Precordial Swirl morphology, but especially
when comparing to the old one, those features of hyperacute T-
waves really stand out.
He stated later that he gave her 1 sublingual NTG and her pain went
down to 1/10. He did not repeat an ECG.
His response:
“Yeah, thatʼs what I was afraid of. This is a retrospective ask because
with the most recent ECG (ECG 1), I admitted her with new Chest Pain
and a modest troponin elevation that I thought was progression of
bad multi-vessel disease but she ultimately proved to have acute
LAD occlusion that didnʼt go to Cath for almost 24 hrs and Iʼm kicking
myself.
Smith: In other words, he saw it in retrospect.
“That is what I was worried about in retrospect. Big MI. They stopped trending
trop at 5000 ng/L of hs trop I. EF 20% down from 50%.”
“And… they hit the carotid trying to place an Impella, caused a big hematoma
where she had precipitous airway occlusion. Just awful all around. I’ll check for
updates and other ekgs when I log in later today.”
Post cath ekg here. She’s in impella dependent cardiogenic shock w new renal
failure.
Now there is a new intraventricular conduction defect (IVCD) that is
very much like true Left Bundle (LBBB).
It is Smith Modified Sgarbossa Negative, but that is because the
damage is done.
Smith: “Sorry about all that.”
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/even-in-retrospect-no-one-could-see-it/ 2/11
Former Resident: “Yeah. Me too. Appreciate your feedback. I couldnʼt
get anyone else to agree with me on the OMI findings even in
retrospect and it was driving me crazy.”
Smith: In other words, no one else could see the OMI, even in
retrospect. I could see it because Pendell and I have described and
coined the term “Precordial Swirl”. We have a paper In Press at the
Journal of Electrocardiology that defines it based on a lot of data.
The Queen of Hearts did not diagnose OMI, but she did see
ischemia.
Refractory ischemia needs the cath lab emergently.
When can you say that the ischemia has resolved and the patient
does not need emergent angiography?
Both:
1) Pain is resolved completely
2) ST depression is competely resolved
In this case, the pain was still 1/10. He told me that he did not see any
inpatient notes about the presence or absence of pain. He did not
get a repeat ECG after the NTG.
SUMMARY: This devastating OMI could have been reperfused
quickly if the presence of refractory pain had been acted upon,
regardless of the ECG. Troponin was elevated and pain was
refractory. Why was it not acted upon? I canʼt say I know for
certain. This former resident is one of the smartest and most diligent
I have ever known, but the pressure to not activate the cath lab
because of a possible false positive activation is intense.
It is better to have a false positive activation than it is to have a
disaster like this, and all members of the team should be
encouraged to support taking the patient for angiogram when there
is any doubt!!

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (3/27/2025):
===================================
Today’s case by Dr. Smith is subtle — and EASY to overlook because of
how abnormal this patient’s previous ECG is.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/even-in-retrospect-no-one-could-see-it/ 3/11
This 60-year old woman clearly presented to the ED as a higher-
risk patient — given her history of known coronary disease, now
with new chest pain.
To facilitate comparison in Figure-1 — I’ve put today’s initial ECG
(TOP tracing) — together with this patient’s previous ECG from 1
week earlier (LOWER tracing). Of note — Troponin was normal at
the time ECG #2 was recorded, so there was no acute infarction in
association with this tracing.
PEARL: The KEY for assessing serial tracings is to systematically
compare ECG findings by going lead-by-lead. It does not matter if you
look first at the previous tracing or at the most current tracing — as long
as you then systematically compare one lead in one of the tracings with
the same lead in the next tracing — and then repeat this process for each
of the 12 leads in both tracings.
The Clinical Reality: If you do not keep both tracings close to each
other as you go lead-by-lead comparing ECG findings —
You will miss subtle abnormalities. I believe this was the problem in
today’s case.
The previous ECG is very abnormal …
Letʼs begin with ECG #2 — which is the previous tracing that
was recorded ~1 week earlier at the time of a heart failure
exacerbation.
The rhythm in ECG #2 is sinus at ~75/minute, with several early
beats. The PR interval is normal — the QRS is narrow — and the
QTc may be borderline prolonged.
There is marked left axis, consistent with LAHB
(Left Anterior HemiBlock).
Voltage criteria for LVH are satisfied (R wave in lead aVL ≥12 mm).
There is poor R wave progression with delayed transition (The R
wave does not get taller than the S wave is deep until between
leads V5-to-V6).
Regarding ST-T wave findings — There is fairly diffuse ST
segment flattening with slight depression in multiple leads — with
ST coving and slight elevation in lead aVR.
Impression: Although the downsloping ST depression in high
lateral leads I and aVL could reflect LV “strain” — the overall picture
in this tracing is that of DSE (Diffuse Subendocardial Ischemia).
That said — We are told that Troponins were negative at the time
this ECG was recorded. So, while ECG #2 may be indicative of
significant (even multi-vessel) coronary disease — it
is not diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion.

Figure-1: Comparison between the first 2 ECGs in today’s case.
Why an Acute Event was Not Diagnosed in ECG #1:
Note that both the frontal plane axis and precordial lead QRS morphology
for the 2 tracings in Figure-1 are very similar (with the exception of
predominant positivity for the QRS in lead V6 of ECG #2 — whereas
transition never occurs in ECG #1). As a result of this similarity in axis and
overall QRS morphology — any slight changes in ST-T wave morphology
are likely to be “real”.
What differences do YOU see between the 2 tracings?
ANSWER:
The heart rate is somewhat faster in ECG #1. Once again there are some
early beats that appear to be supraventricular.
The most concerning difference in ST-T wave morphology
between ECG #1 and ECG #2 — is seen within the RED rectangle.
In this patient with new CP (Chest Pain) — Isn’t it much easier to
appreciate the taller T waves in leads V1,V2,V3 with these 2 ECGs
placed next to each other?
Other changes are more subtle.
I thought the ST-T waves in each of the 4 leads highlighted by BLUE
arrows looked more acute (ie, with more angled and deeper ST
depression).
Lead aVR shows more ST elevation.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/even-in-retrospect-no-one-could-see-it/ 5/11
Impression: As per Dr. Smith — New ST elevation in anterior leads V1,V2
— with more ST depression in lateral chest lead V6 — is consistent
with precordial swirl (See the October 15, 2022 post — for multiple
examples of Swirl — and My Comment at the bottom of the page for
qualitative summary of ST-T wave changes with this entity). The increased
ST depression in multiple leads in ECG #2, with more ST elevation in aVR
— is consistent with severe underlying coronary disease
with worsening ischemia.
Isn’t it much easier to recognize subtle-but-important
differences between 2 serial tracings by putting both ECGs next to
each other, and then going lead-by-lead in your assessment?
