A 60-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease presented with new chest pain. The case ECG was sent to Dr. Smith by a former resident who is highly skilled at ECG interpretation for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).

Presentation ECG (ECG #1)

The initial ECG showed:

Lateral precordial ST depression

Large, bulky T-waves in the anterior precordial leads

Overall appearance concerning for active ischemia

By itself, the ECG could be interpreted as subendocardial ischemia. However, the anterior T-waves were disproportionately large and bulky, raising concern for acute LAD occlusion, particularly a pattern known as precordial swirl.

Prior ECG (ECG #2, one week earlier)

A comparison ECG from one week earlier was available. At that time:

The patient presented with heart failure

Troponins were negative

ECG demonstrated:

Sinus rhythm ~75 bpm

Left anterior fascicular block

Voltage criteria for LVH

Poor R-wave progression

Diffuse ST flattening and mild ST depression

ST elevation in aVR

This ECG was consistent with diffuse subendocardial ischemia (DSE) in the setting of severe multivessel coronary disease, but not acute coronary occlusion.

Critical Comparison (ECG #1 vs ECG #2)

When the two ECGs are placed side-by-side and compared lead-by-lead, several important differences become apparent:

Heart rate was faster in ECG #1

Anterior leads V1–V3 showed clearly taller T-waves

ST depression appeared deeper and more acute in multiple leads

ST elevation in aVR was more pronounced

Loss of R-wave progression was worse in ECG #1

These changes, in the context of new chest pain, were consistent with precordial swirl, a subtle ECG pattern associated with acute LAD occlusion, even when classic ST-elevation criteria are not met.

Clinical Course

The treating physician administered one sublingual nitroglycerin, after which the patient’s pain improved from severe to 1/10, but did not fully resolve. No repeat ECG was obtained.

The patient was admitted with the working diagnosis of progression of chronic multivessel disease and modest troponin elevation. She ultimately proved to have acute LAD occlusion, but did not undergo catheterization for almost 24 hours.

Outcomes:

Large anterior myocardial infarction

Troponin I peaked above 5000 ng/L

Left ventricular ejection fraction dropped from 50% to 20%

Post-cath ECG showed a new intraventricular conduction defect resembling LBBB

The ECG was Smith-modified Sgarbossa negative, reflecting completed myocardial injury

The patient developed cardiogenic shock, required Impella support, and suffered acute renal failure

During Impella placement, the carotid artery was inadvertently cannulated, causing a large hematoma and airway compromise

Key Insight

Even in retrospect, multiple clinicians could not see the OMI, despite the devastating outcome. Recognition was possible only because the concept of precordial swirl had been previously described and studied.

The Queen of Hearts AI did not diagnose OMI, but did identify ischemia. Importantly, refractory ischemia requires emergent angiography, even if OMI is not explicitly diagnosed.

When Is Emergent Angiography NOT Required?

Ischemia can be considered resolved only if both conditions are met:

Chest pain is completely resolved

ST depression is completely resolved

In this case:

Pain persisted at 1/10

ST depression was still present

No repeat ECG was obtained to document resolution

Summary and Learning Points

Refractory chest pain + ischemic ECG = emergent cath, regardless of whether classic OMI criteria are met

Subtle ECG patterns like precordial swirl can represent acute LAD occlusion

Comparing ECGs side-by-side, lead-by-lead is essential

Troponin elevation confirms injury but should not delay action

Fear of false-positive cath lab activation can lead to catastrophic outcomes

It is far better to activate unnecessarily than to miss an occlusive MI

This case illustrates how subtle, under-recognized ECG patterns combined with persistent symptoms can represent true coronary occlusion, even when most observers — including experts — fail to recognize it in real time.
