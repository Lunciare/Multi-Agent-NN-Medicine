Everyone sees ST
depression, but what does it
mean?
Written by Willy Frick
A man in his 70s with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus
presented with chest pain which awoke him from sleep around
midnight. He described it as substernal, non-radiating, 7 out of 10
intensity. His ECG obtained around 4 AM is shown.

I texted this ECG to Dr. Smith without any information and he
immediately replied: “combination of precordial swirl and South
African Flag sign, with Swirl predominating. Occlusion proximal to
septal perforator AND first Diagonal.”
The Queen of Hearts easily diagnoses OMI. Her confidence is 0.99,
almost maximal. In particular, we see:
Precordial swirl
STE and hyperacute T waves (HATW) in V1, V2
Reciprocal STD in the lateral precordium, V4-6
(Most of) South African Flag
STE and HATW in aVL and V2 (less apparent in lead I)
Reciprocal STD in III
This is diagnostic for LAD OMI involving the septal perforators
(precordial swirl) and major diagonal (South African Flag). This
patient should be taken for immediate angiogram.
The ECG was interpreted as showing “mild ST depressions in leads II,
III, aVF, V4, V5, V6.” The patient received aspirin 325 mg and
nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual. According to documentation, his pain
resolved (but there was no short interval repeat ECG to assure
normalization). First troponin I (cTnI) was 0.049 ng/mL (ref: < 0.033
ng/mL).
The next update in the chart is at 8:10 AM, when repeat cTnI was
3.788 ng/mL, already a sizable infarct. After this resulted, repeat ECG
was obtained:

Compared to the first, there is obvious improvement, but it is not
normal and one must wonder whether there could be ongoing
ischemia. The admitting service described the ECG as having “ST
depressions in II, III, aVF, V4-V6,” and documented that his pain was
significantly improved to 2/10 and resolved during the interview.
PAUSE
Two thoughts:
First, there either is ischemic chest pain, or there is not. “Nearly
gone” means unresolved. To use an analogy, would you be happy to
drink water with nearly all the sewage filtered out?
Second, when evaluating a patient with ischemic chest pain, it is the
clinicianʼs job to elicit symptoms. The specific questions we ask
encourage various responses. If you tell the patient “This nitro should
help with the pain…Are you feeling better?” they might give you
reassurance.
When I treat patients with suspected ACS, I tell them: “Your
symptoms are critically important to me. If you feel absolutely normal,
we can safely wait until the morning. On the other hand, if you have
ANY chest discomfort [or whatever symptom the patient was
experiencing] I need to know immediately. Please tell me or tell your
nurse, because that would be an emergency.”
Back to the case:
The patient was started on continuous heparin infusion and taken for
echocardiogram. Apical views are shown below, first 4 chamber, then
2 chamber, then 3 chamber.

The apex is akinetic. It almost looks like takotsubo except we know
from ECG and history that it is LAD OMI. The LVEF is ~45% Around
this time, the patient was evaluated by the cardiology consult service.
The consult note describes the ECG as showing “STD in the
inferolateral leads,” making this the third interpretation to overlook
diagnostic STE and HATW in V1, V2, and aVL.
The patient was taken for cath. I have included the RAO cranial and
RAO caudal projections here. Have a look at them and see if you can
figure out the diagnosis before watching the video that follows where
I explain. As always, you can read more in the angiography guide.

Color scheme for cath films by Willy Frick.
The angiogram shows exactly what the ECG predicted: LAD occlusion
involving the septal perforators and the major diagonal vessel. This is
considered a type 2 MI since it is not due to atherosclerotic plaque
disruption.
At around 12:30 PM, the patient received intracoronary nitrogylcerin
with resolution of vasospasm. Repeat cTnI was still rising when last
checked, 6.607 ng/mL.
Discussion:
Cases like this should infuse us with humility. Documentation said the
patientʼs chest pain resolved after NTG, but the next note said he had
only “2/10 pain.” By the time he got to cath 8 hours after his first
diagnostic ECG, his LAD remained severely spastic with very poor
flow. If the first ECG had been a STEMI, he would likely have been
treated emergently. But instead, it was the red-headed stepchild,
NSTEMI. And this turned into another case of supervised, in-hospital
anterior wall infarction. Cases like this make it hard to feel
comfortable delaying intervention due to symptom improvement. If
the patient comes in with ACS symptoms and ECG showing OMI —
just get them to the lab.

This also brings up the general topic of non-atherosclerotic causes of
myocardial ischemia and infarction. JACC published an elegant trial
called CorMicA, in which investigators took patients with angina and
no obstructive coronary disease (also called ANOCA or angina with
non-obstructive coronary arteries) and performed comprehensive
coronary evaluation with vasospasm provocation testing and
microvascular evaluation. The patients were then randomized to
routine care (in which the treating clinician was blinded to the results
of the comprehensive assessment) vs stratified medical therapy
according to the results of the invasive diagnostic procedure.
CorMicA, JACC 2018
Patients in the intervention arm had significant improvement in
symptoms (the primary endpoint) and quality of life. In addition,
patients in the control arm were 12.5 times more likely to have a
missed diagnosis!
Patients with vasospasm should be strongly supported in their efforts
to quit smoking which is a known risk factor for vasospasm. In
addition, they should receive calcium channel blockers and long-
acting nitrates to prevent recurrent spasm.
Learning points:
It is your job to ELICIT symptoms of refractory ischemia. Delay
intervention at your own peril.
“Much better” is not the same as “completely resolved”
Coronary vasospasm classically occurs in the middle of the
night or early morning
Help patients quit smoking, and treat with calcium channel
blockers and long acting nitrates

===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (3/30/2025):
===================================
As per Dr. Frick — “Today’s case should infuse us with humility” — as
there are many aspects of this patient’s care that could have (and should
have) been improved. Filling us with humility is the frequency with which
cardiac catheterization (as it is currently performed in most institutions)
fails to identify all-too-many patients with a significant component
of either microvascular and/or vasospastic angina (Results cited in Dr.
Frick’s above discussion, taken from the CorMicA Trial by Ford et al:
JACC, 2018).
The problem is not simple — as these non-atherosclerotic causes of
CP (Chest Pain) run the gamut of symptomatology — and may be
seen either in patients with pure coronary spasm — or — in patients
with variable degrees of underlying atherosclerotic disease, upon
which either a microvascular or vasospastic component
is superimposed in any one or more of the major coronary
branches (Matta et al — J Interv Cardiol, 2020 — and — Slavich
and Patel — Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc, 2016).
And then there is the issue of MINOCA (Acute MI in patients with
Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries) — which is estimated to occur
in ~10% of patients initially diagnosed as having a STEMI or
NSTEMI — in which microvascular and vasospastic angina are just
2 of the potential causes of an MI for which there is no evidence for
a “culprit” vessel (See My Comments in the June 5,
2024 post — and the December 19, 2023 post).
The above said — I focus My Comment today on aspects
associated with this patient’s presentation and his initial ECG.
To facilitate comparison of today’s initial ECG with
the repeat ECG — I’ve put both tracings side-by-side
in Figure-1.
QUESTION:
How to decide IF (and When) cardiac cath is indicated?

Figure-1: Comparison between the first 2 ECGs in today’s case.
A Simplified Approach:When to Cath?
Cardiac cath was not performed in todayʼs case for a full 8
hours after the initial ECG was recorded. As emphasized by
Dr. Frick — this delay was entirely unnecessary, since the
initial ECG was diagnostic of acute LAD
occlusion until proven otherwise!
Identification of the primary problem in todayʼs case ( =
coronary spasm) could not be diagnosed until cardiac
cath was performed. But the cause of todayʼs symptoms
and ECG changes is not the main issue here. Instead —
the principal issue is whether and if so, whencardiac
cath should be performed in a patient such as the 70-
something year old man in todayʼs case who presented
to the ED for severe new-onset CP that awakened him
from a sound sleep at 4:00 am.
The Answer to the above clinical question should be simple:
IF the initial ECG of a patient with new-onset CP is
clearly abnormal (and clearly suggestive of an ongoing
acute cardiac event) — then nothing else can possibly
negate the indication for prompt cardiac catheterization.
By “clearly abnormal” — this does not mean an ECG that
satisfies millimeter-based criteria for a STEMI. This is
because at least 30% of acute OMIs do not initially
meet STEMI criteria — and many of these acute
coronary occlusions that eventually do satisfy STEMI
criteria, only do so after many hours of delay (Ricci,
Smith, et al — Ann Emerg Med 85(4): 330-340, 2024).
Although an elevated initial Troponin level may confirm
acute infarction in progress — this initial Troponin level
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/everyone-sees-st-depression-but-what-2/ 9/16
--- Страница 10 ---
22/01/2026, 15:27 Everyone sees ST depression, but what does it mean? - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
is not a part of the initial decision-making process IF the
initial ECG is clearly abnormal. This is because the initial
Troponin level may be normal in as many as 25% of
patients who present with a STEMI(Wereski, Smith et al
— JAMA Cardio 5(11):1302-1304, 2020). Therefore, if
the initial ECG is clearly abnormal — the decision of
whether or not to perform prompt cath remains the
same regardless of whether or not the initial Troponin is
normal or elevated (since a normal initial Troponin in
no way rules out an acute event).
And although repeat ECGs may demonstrate ongoing
evolution of acute infarction — Waiting so that you can
repeat the ECG should not be a part of the initial
decision-making process IF the initial ECG is clearly
abnormal. This is because no matter what a repeat ECG
shows (ie, worsening — improvement — or no change
at all) — IF in a patient with new-onset CP
the initial ECG is clearly abnormal — Waiting only
delays the indication for prompt cath that has already
been established (and waiting only means that more
potentially salvageable myocardium will needlessly be
lost).
The Initial ECG in Todayʼs CASE:
As per Dr. Frick — todayʼs initial ECG is clearly
abnormal (TOP tracing in Figure-1):
In todayʼs patient who presents with severe new-
onset CP — my “eye” was immediately drawn to the 2
leads within the RED rectangles. In view of the small S
wave in Lead V1 (ie, There is no LVH) — there simply
should not be the ST segment straightening and the
amount of J-point ST elevation that we see in ECG #1.
In this context — the T wave in neighboringlead V2 is
also disproportionately tall. An additional subtle-but-
real finding is the presence of a small initial q wave that
precedes the small r wave in lead V2 (within the dotted
BLUE circle).
The BLUE arrow in neighboring lead V3 highlights loss
of the small amount of gently upsloping ST elevation that
is normally seen in lead V3. This is followed by 1-to-2+
mm of flat or downsloping ST depression in lateral
chest leads V4,V5,V6.
The other RED rectangle highlights lead aVL — that
manifests ST segment coving with >1 mm of ST
elevation. This ST elevation in lead aVL is complemented
by clearly abnormal reciprocal ST depression in each of
the inferior leads.

BOTTOM Line:Nothing else is needed in todayʼs case to
establish the need for prompt cath as soon as this can
be accomplished.
The Repeat ECG in Todayʼs CASE:
4 hours later — a repeatECG was obtained (ECG #2 in
Figure-1). That said — multiple concerns relate to this repeat
ECG.
The patient was given sublingual NTG after ECG #1 was
recorded — which chart records indicate resulted
in “resolution of the patientʼs CP”. As soon as the
patientʼs CP was resolved — the repeat ECG should
have been recorded. Instead — no ECG was repeated
until 4 hours later, and only then because an elevated
Troponin value returned from the lab.
With acute ongoing infarction — the initial ECG should
be repeated within nomore than 15-20 minutes after the
initial ECG.
As per Dr. Frick — 2/10 CP (as was noted at the time
ECG #2 was recorded) is not the same as 0/10 CP.
Rather than description of ECG #2 as having “ST
depression in leads II,III,aVF; V4-V6” as was written by
the admitting service— there have
been “dynamic” ECG changes that become obvious by
the side-by-side comparison of ECG #1 and ECG #2
afforded in Figure-1(ie, in the form of deflation of the ST
elevation in leads aVL and V1, and deflation of the
hyperacute T waves in leads V2,V3). There has also
been evolution of reperfusion T waves in leads III,aVF;
and in leads V3-thru-V6.
BOTTOM Line: Demonstration of these “dynamic” ST-T
wave changes in association with the reduction in CP
severity — confirms an ongoing acute event until proven
otherwise. That said — the indication for prompt cath
had already been firmly established 4 hours earlier at
the time the initial ECG was done.
