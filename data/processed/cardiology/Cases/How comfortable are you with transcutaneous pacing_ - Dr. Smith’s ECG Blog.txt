How comfortable are you
with transcutaneous
pacing?
 
Written by Willy Frick
A woman in her 70s is hospitalized with undifferentiated shock after
being found down at home. Her family had not heard from her and
called EMS. Paramedics found her bradycardic, hypotensive, and
tachypneic. She was resuscitated and admitted to ICU for presumed
sepsis.
Several days into hospitalization, she continued to have occasional
episodes of sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia with periods of
Mobitz I AV block and 2:1 block. Her clinical team initiated
transcutaneous pacing. Here is her cardiac telemetry. (Note: these
are three consecutive strips of lead V1 from top to bottom.)
Do you notice any problems?
Here is the exact same strip, with the arterial pressure waveform
included:

See if you can figure out what the problem is.
Hint: What does the arterial waveform correspond to on the ECG?
The problem here is complete failure to capture. The amount of
current delivered is not above the minimum threshold required to
cause myocardial contraction. The patient is getting some electrical
stimulation, but nothing useful is happening.
The transcutaneous pads are delivering shocks at a rate of 70 per
minute. You can see the purple lines (correctly) interpreted by the
telemetry software as pacing spikes. And you can see a sharp
deflection in the ECG from pacing artifact. The mistake here is
thinking that the sharp pacer artifact deflection is a QRS complex. In
fact, the only QRS complexes here are the patientʼs own native
rhythm!
Here is the same image with orange arrows pointing out the patientʼs
native P waves and blue arrows pointing out the patientʼs native QRS
complexes. (Dotted lines indicated buried waveforms).

Now it becomes apparent that the arterial tracing corresponds
exactly to the native QRS complex, and has no relationship at all to
the pacing spikes. This patient is getting painful electrical shocks at a
rate of 70 per minute which is providing no benefit whatsoever.
Meanwhile, the patientʼs native rhythm is sinus bradycardia with
adequate perfusion.
There may be some blocked P waves in there, it is hard to be sure
with all the pacer artifact. The patient did have Mobitz I AV block both
before and after this.
Here is where the pacing pads were turned on. Notice that the native
QRS continues on unaffected by the pacing spikes.
Fortunately, this patient did not actually need any pacing. In fact, later
on the patientʼs native rhythm was actually faster than the pacing
efforts.
Cardiology turned the transcutaneous pacer pads off and
recommended observation only. It is extremely lucky for this patient
that she did not actually need any pacing. If she had needed pacing,
she would have died.
So, how do you confirm that there is true capture of myocardium if
you need to perform transcutaneous pacing?
If you have an arterial line already, you should see the heart
beat with every pacing impulse.
If you do not have an arterial line, use bedside ultrasound to
verify myocardial contractility corresponds to pacing.
If you donʼt have ultrasound (but you should), then palpate a
pulse! This can be harder than it sounds. Transcutaneous
pacing will also capture skeletal muscle causing twitching. Your
best bet is a femoral artery. And to be clear: It is completely
safe to touch a patient who is being transcutaneously paced. I
have done it many times.
Pacing can be painful even if not capturing.

When in doubt crank the output all the way up. The dial will
usually be labeled “OUTPUT,” and the units will be mA.
Learning points:
Do not confuse pacing artifact with myocardial capture
Confirm capture by inspection of arterial line or palpation of a
pulse
When in doubt, crank the output
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (12/24/2024):
===================================
Clinical implications of the content in today’s post by Dr. Frick cannot be
overstated — TCP (TransCutaneous Pacing) can either be lifesaving or
producing of the opposite effect if basic troubleshooting measures are not
attended to.
In an effort to reinforce these measures presented by Dr. Frick in his
above discussion — I’ve reproduced the following Section from my
ACLS-2013-ePub.
Pacing CAVEATS: Is there Capture?
Effective TCP capture can be obtained in many (not all) patients. That
said — there are pitfalls inherent in the process of
determining IF effective electrical and mechanical capture are occurring.
Consider the 4 rhythm strips shown in Figure-1:
QUESTIONS:
Is there effective capture for rhythm strips A,B,C and D
in Figure-1?
— How can you tell? Clinically — What should you do?

Figure-1: Pacing caveats. Is there effective capture for rhythm strips
A,B,C,D? (adapted from Grauer K: ACLS-2013-ePub — Section 15,
KG/EKG Press).
=================================
ANSWER to Panel A:
The underlying cardiac rhythm in Panel A is asystole. Pacer
spikes are seen at a rate of 75/minute (occurring every 4th
large box) — but there is no sign of capture.
Suggested Approach:Increase current (gradually from
~50ma up to a max of 200 ma); correct other factors
(ie,acidosis, hypoxemia). Treat asystole.
ANSWER to Panel B:
The pacer rate is ~100/minute. There is
now electrical capture of every-other-beat in Panel B (as
evidenced by a wide QRS complex with broad T wave
occurring after every-other pacing spike).
Suggested Approach:Since there nowissign of
ventricular capture (at least for every-other pacing
spike) — increasing current further will hopefully result
in capture of every spike. Increase current (up to a max
of 200 ma); correct other factors (ie,acidosis,
hypoxemia).
ANSWER to Panel C:
Each pacer spike in Panel C now captures the ventricles by
the end of this rhythm strip (evidenced by a wide QRS
complex after each spike, followed by a broad, oppositely
directed T wave).

Suggested Approach:Look for objective signs to
confirm that pacing is working clinically (ie, Check for
pulseand BP; pulse ox pleth wave; andET CO2 readings
that should improve if the pacemaker is truly effective).
ANSWER to Panel D:
The rhythm in Panel D shows a regularly-occurring negative
deflection after each pacing spike. That said — We suspect
this may be pacer artifact and not indicative of true
ventricular capture because there is no broad T wave (as
there should be if this was paced! ).
Comment: Verifying thattrueventricular capture has
occurred with external pacing is at times easier said
than done. Reasons for this include theindirect nature of
external pacinganda tendency forelectricalartifact to
be produced by the electrical activity generated from
the pacemaker.
Electrical artifact is usually “blocked out” from the ECG
monitor (by integrated pacemaker software that
eliminates a 40-to-80 msec. period that occurs just
after the pacer spike from the ECG recording). BUT on
occasion — a portion of this electrical artifact may
persist beyond the “blockout” period. When this
happens – the electrical artifact that regularly appears
on the ECG monitor at fixed interval immediately
following each pacer spike may “masquerade”as
ventricular capture. It is importantnotto be fooled into
thinking these“phantom”QRS complexes represent
true capture.
Suggested Approach: In addition to awareness of this
phenomenon — You can verify that ventricular capture
hastruly occurred by:
BeingSUREthe QRS after each pacing spike
iswideandhas a tallbroadT wave. (In contrast — the
QRS ofelectrical artifactis narrow and doesnothave
any T wave! ).
Palpating a pulse with each paced complex (and being
certain not to confuse wishful thinking from pacer-
generated muscle twitching as a “pulse” ).
Checking for other evidence of perfusion (Can you get a
BP? Is there now a pulse ox pleth wave? —and — Does
ET CO2 increase as it should if the pacer is truly
effective?)
