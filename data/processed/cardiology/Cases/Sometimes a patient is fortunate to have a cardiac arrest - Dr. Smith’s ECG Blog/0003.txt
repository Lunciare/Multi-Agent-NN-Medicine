Case Summary

~40% Had the patient not arrested, he likely would have remained in the waiting room long enough to sustain irreversible transmural infarction with permanent severe heart failure. Key Learning Points LVH makes ischemia harder to recognize, but does not excuse missing it In chest pain patients: Rule out OMI, do not rule it in Side-by-side ECG comparison is essential LV “strain” causes: ST depression / flattening in lateral leads NOT convex ST elevation Concordant ST elevation in LVH is highly suspicious When in doubt: Repeat ECGs every 15 minutes Consider half-standard voltage ECG to reduce QRS overlap Cardiac arrest, paradoxically, saved this patient’s myocardium Bottom Line This case illustrates how acute coronary occlusion can be missed in the presence of LVH, and how failure to compare ECGs led to delayed diagnosis. The patient was “fortunate” to suffer a cardiac arrest because it forced recognition of a diagnostic ECG that had already been present — allowing myocardial salvage that otherwise would have been lost.
