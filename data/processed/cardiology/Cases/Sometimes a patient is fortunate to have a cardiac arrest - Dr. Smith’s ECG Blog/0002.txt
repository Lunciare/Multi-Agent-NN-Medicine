pain, these new changes are diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion (OMI) until proven otherwise. Despite this: The ECG was interpreted as “no significant change” No cath lab activation Patient was sent back to the waiting room Cardiac Arrest and Post-ROSC ECG While waiting, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation and required defibrillation, achieving ROSC. Approximately 5 minutes after ROSC, a repeat ECG showed: Obvious anterolateral OMI Clear STEMI criteria Marked evolution of ischemic changes This ECG finally triggered urgent intervention. Angiography Findings Total proximal LAD occlusion Successful stent placement Notable observation: After LAD occlusion, S-wave amplitude in V2–V3 decreased This explains why severe LVH and acute STEMI rarely coexist clearly on ECG — ischemia often reduces precordial voltage Hospital Course Peak troponin I >25,000 ng/L Initial echocardiogram: EF 15% Severe global hypokinesis Akinesis of multiple territories Prior echo (3 months earlier): EF 40%, mild global hypokinesis Important Insight The initial severe LV dysfunction was largely due to myocardial stunning, not permanent necrosis. Over the following weeks: EF recovered from 15% → ~40% Had the patient not arrested, he likely would have remained in the waiting room long enough to sustain irreversible transmural infarction with permanent severe heart failure.
