Case Summary

A man in his 60s presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain. He had prior ECGs on file and no immediate instability at triage. An initial ECG was obtained and interpreted as “no STEMI”, with the patient subsequently returned to the waiting room. Shortly thereafter, the patient suffered a ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest in the waiting area. Initial Triage ECG Sinus rhythm Marked left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) Very high voltage QRS complexes In lateral leads V5–V6: Upright, enlarged T waves Concordant ST segment and T wave Terminal QRS distortion (tall R wave without S wave) Without prior ECGs for comparison, the findings were judged non-diagnostic. AI (Queen of Hearts) also labeled the ECG as not specific for OMI. Critical Error The ECG was not compared side-by-side with prior tracings. Comparison With Prior ECGs When compared with ECGs from: 6 days prior 2 months prior …the triage ECG showed clear new ST–T changes in the lateral leads that were absent previously. 👉 In a patient with acute chest pain, these new changes are diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion (OMI) until proven otherwise. Despite this: The ECG was interpreted as “no significant change” No cath lab activation Patient was
