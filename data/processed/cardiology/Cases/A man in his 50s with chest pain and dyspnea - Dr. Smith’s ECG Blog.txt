A man in his 50s with chest
pain and dyspnea
A man in his 50s had chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS
arrived and recorded this ECG.
What do you think?
There is sinus rhythm with preexcitation causing abnormal
QRS complexes, and consequently, abnormal repolarization.
There is concordant STE in V2-V5, however this is something
I have observed occasionally in WPW. The T waves are not
hyperacute. I would favor WPW causing a STEMI mimic
pattern, but it could be baseline WPW with superimposed
anterior acute transmural injury.
Zoll interpretation on EMS monitor included “***STEMI***”

The cath lab activation was cancelled after discovering the
patient had a known history of WPW and a prior ECG was
available:
Troponins were negative.
No other dangerous cause of symptoms was discovered and
the patient did well.
