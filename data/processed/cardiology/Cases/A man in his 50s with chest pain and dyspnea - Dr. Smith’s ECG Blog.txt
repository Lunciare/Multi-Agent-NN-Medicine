A man in his 50s with chest
pain and dyspnea
A man in his 50s had chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS
arrived and recorded this ECG.
What do you think?
There is sinus rhythm with preexcitation causing abnormal
QRS complexes, and consequently, abnormal repolarization.
There is concordant STE in V2-V5, however this is something
I have observed occasionally in WPW. The T waves are not
hyperacute. I would favor WPW causing a STEMI mimic
pattern, but it could be baseline WPW with superimposed
anterior acute transmural injury.
Zoll interpretation on EMS monitor included “***STEMI***”

The cath lab activation was cancelled after discovering the
patient had a known history of WPW and a prior ECG was
available:
Troponins were negative.
No other dangerous cause of symptoms was discovered and
the patient did well.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(11/28/2025):
The incidence of WPW (Wolff-Parkinson White) Syndrome is
~2/1,000 in the general population (Chhabra et al —
StatPearls, 2023). This means that although this syndrome is
not overly common — it occurs often enough to ensure that
every health care provider who deals with ECGs will at least
occasionally encounter this syndrome. There are 2 principal
reasons why familiarity with this syndrome is especially
important for emergency providers:
Reason #1: WPW is often associated with cardiac
arrhythmias — due in large part to availability of an AP
(Accessory Pathway) that
facilitates reentry tachycardias and exceedingly rapid
conduction with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
Fortunately, the vast majority of patients with WPW have
an excellent long-term prognosis — and, the overall
incidence of sudden death with this syndrome is
extremely low. That said, WPW-related arrhythmias can
be potentially life-threatening — because extremely
rapid rates (over 250/minute) may be attained if a
patient with WPW develops AFib or AFlutter. These
excessively rapid rates can precipitate deterioration of
the rhythm to VFib.
Reason #2: WPW is often thought of as the “Great
Mimic”of other conditions. The presence of QRS
widening with resultant secondary repolarization
changes in the ST-T wave may produce an ECG picture
that simulates RBBB, LBBB, IVCD, LVH,
RVH, and/or myocardial infarction or ischemia.

Todayʼs Initial ECG:
Todayʼs case by Dr. Meyers addresses Reason #2:
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced and labeled
todayʼs initial ECG, and compare this tracing to another
example of WPW previously published in Dr. Smithʼs
ECG Blog.
As per Dr. Meyers — todayʼs initial ECG shows the 3
components of WPW: i) Sinus rhythm with a short PR
interval (RED arrow upright P wave in lead II) — ii)
Delta waves (BLUE arrows showing some of thedelta
waves on the 2 tracings in Figure-1) — and, iii) QRS
widening.
The concern with todayʼs initial ECG(Top tracing in
Figure-1) — is the abnormal ST elevation in multiple
chest leads (RED dotted linesin leads V2,3,4). Even
though R wave amplitude is clearly cut off in leads V2-
thru-V5of this pre-hospital tracing (dotted BLUE lines in
these leads, as well as in lead II) — this concordant ST
elevation in the above chest leads would not normally be
expected given the entirely positive QRS complexes in
these leads.
BOTTOM Line: Dr. Meyers appropriately concluded that
although WPW with a “STEMI-mimic pattern” seemed
the most probable explanation — that it was impossible
on the basis of this single ECG to rule out anterior
infarction superimposed on a WPW baseline tracing.
Fortunately, a prior ECG was found on todayʼs patient
that confirmed that there were no acute changes
compared to this patientʼs baseline ECG.
= = =
What about the Bottom ECG in Figure-1?
By way of comparison — I added another example of WPW
from Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog (this being the 2nd ECG from Case
#5 in the March 1, 2012 post — in which this patient was
awakened from sleep by new-onset chest pain).
Once again — there is sinus rhythm with a shortened PR
interval (best seen in the chest leads) — QRS widening
— and multiple delta waves (some of which Iʼve
highlighted with BLUE arrows in this 2012 tracing).
Once again — there is a completely positive QRS
complex in lead V2 with concordant ST elevation in this
lead (RED dotted line in V2).
What else do YOU see in Figure-1from this 2012 ECG?

Figure-1: Comparison between the initial ECG in todayʼs case
— with an ECG from Case #5 in the March 1, 2012 post in Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog.

ANSWER (What else in this 2012 ECG?)
My “eye” was drawn to the following additional findings:
In addition to the ST elevation in lead V2 — the upright T
wave in this lead is huge with respect to the QRS in V2.
There is also ST elevation in lead V1.
The shape of the depressed ST segment in lead V3(and
to a lesser extent, also in lead V4) — is flat and “shelf-
like” (similar in shape and location to the ST depression
we see with posterior OMI).
The concordant T wave inversion in lead III looks
“bulkier” than what I would normally expect.
“My Take” — Itʼs hard to make “rules” regarding what the ST-
T waves “should look like” in a patient with WPW — because
almost anything might be possible as a result of altered
depolarization that occurs with activation of the ventricles via
travel over an accessory pathway.
The above said — I look for ST-T wave changes that
shouldnʼt be there. By this I mean that even with WPW
— I would not expect there to be such “shelf-like” ST
depression as we seen in lead V3 (and by extension
— in lead V4). Similarly — the concordant ST elevation
in lead V2 would not normally be expected, especially in

association with such a disproportionately enlarged T
wave in this lead.
This said — it will often not be easy to assess the ECG of
a patient with WPW who presents with new chest pain.
In such cases — verification of our suspicion by: i)
Looking for a prior ECG on the patient; — ii) Doing a
couple of serial ECGs to see if there are “dynamic”
changes; — iii) Checking at least 2 Troponins; — and,
iv) Doing a bedside Echo (ideally while the patient is
still having chest pain — looking for a localized wall
motion abnormality) — are prudent actions that will
hopefully confirm the diagnosis.
Follow-Up.: The patient in this Case #5 from 2012 was
found to have acute occlusion of the 1st Diagonal branch
of the LAD on cardiac catheterization.
= = =
Final Pointers:
Take another LOOK at Figure-1. Note in todayʼs initial
ECG — that lead V1 lacks a short PR interval and lacks a
delta wave, with a QRS that for all the world looks like
RBBB.
Note in the 2012 tracing — that lead II also lacks a delta
wave and has a normal PR interval. It would be easy to
miss the WPW if one only used lead II for assessment of
the rhythm.
Delta waves are not always seen in all 12 leads of a
patient with WPW. While delta waves are seen in almost
all leads for the 2 tracings in Figure-1 — they are lacking
in lead V1 (Top ECG) and in lead II (Bottom ECG) despite
leads II and V1 normally being the best leads for
assessing atrial activity, and therefore the PR interval.
