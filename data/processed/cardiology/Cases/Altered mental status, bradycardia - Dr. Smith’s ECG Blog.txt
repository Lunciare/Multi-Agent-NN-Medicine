Altered mental status,
bradycardia
caretaker called 911 for altered mental status. He was lethargic and
slow to respond to questions. He was found to be hypotensive with
systolic pressures in the 70s and 80s. An EKG was recorded:
What do you think?
This EKG shows the same 2.5 seconds as recorded by all 12
leads, so it is not ideal for rhythm analysis. However, there are
visible upright P waves in front of each QRS complex in
inferior leads, which are about 1.28 seconds apart. In other
words, there is sinus bradycardia at a rate of about 47 bpm.
In this clinical context, this EKG is also perfectly consistent
with a certain pathology which can be easily and quickly
confirmed and addressed by any emergency medical staff:
Hypothermia.

Patients with hypothermia typically develop EKG changes like 
sinus bradycardia or bradyarrhythmias, J waves or Osborn
 1/11
waves, and a prolonged QT interval. The severity of these
findings correlate with the patientʼs core temperature.
Hypothermia is classified as either mild, moderate, or severe:
Mild: 32°C-35°C (89.6°F-95°F)
Moderate: 29°C-32°C (84.2°F-89.6°F)
Severe: <29°C (84.2°F)
Patients with severe hypothermia can develop
pathognomonic EKGs with massive Osborn waves, long QT
intervals, and bradycardia.
See this post:
What is this ECG finding? Do you understand it before
you hear the clinical context?
And this post:
Massive Osborn Waves of Severe Hypothermia (23.6 C),
with Cardiac Echo
The EKG in patients with moderate hypothermia may show
more subtle changes, but rapid identification of these
changes in the right clinical context can accelerate therapy to
restore a normal core temperature.
The EKG in todayʼs case shows sinus bradycardia with
Osborn waves in lateral precordial leads, an ST-T morphology
characteristic of hypothermia (an Osborn wave at a similar
height to the T wave, with a concave ST segment between
them) and QT interval prolongation (See Ken Grauerʼs
comment for more details on QTc calculation).
See this post, with a very similar ST-T morphology to todayʼs
case:
Altered Mental Status, Bradycardia

Case Continued:
Paramedics noticed that the patient felt cold. They recorded a temperature which
 2/11
simply read “low” (below 33.9°C or 93°F, the bottom limit of
reporting for their thermometer). The patient arrived to the
emergency room where a rectal temperature was recorded at
29.2°C (84.5°F). He also had this EKG recorded:
The findings here are similar to those in the prehospital strip.
There is also a more pronounced shiver artifact, which is
commonly observed in EKGs recorded on patients with
hypothermia.
The patient was externally re-warmed in the ED with a Bair
HuggerⓇ. He was admitted to the hospital for sepsis and his
temperature returned to normal the next day. There was no
EKG recorded after temperature correction. A repeat EKG
after temperature correction would likely have shown
correction of the ST-T abnormalities, disappearance of the
Osborn waves, shortening of the QT interval, and a faster
heart rate.

Accidental Hypothermia In The Emergency Department
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (4/25/2025):
===================================
Most cases of hypothermia are obvious: For example — A
patient is “found” outside, exposed to the elements in a cold
weather setting. But this is not the only clinical presentation we
see for hypothermia.
My introduction to how subtle the presentation of
hypothermia can sometimes be, was during my early days
as hospital Attending — when a patient who had been on
our hospital Service for several days, was found one
 3/11
morning by nursing staff to be unresponsive. The patient
was cool (not cold) to the touch, and was not shivering. It
turns out that the patient had developed septicemia from an
occult infection.
Lack of a fever — and stable medical condition in a warm
hospital bed initially fooled the in-patient team, with
our warm-weather Florida location accounting for limited
experience by housestaff with hypothermic patients.
Moral of My Story: Whereas experienced emergency providers
are well familiar with hypothermia as a potential manifestation
of septicemia — it is easy to overlook a sudden, gradual
reduction in body temperature in a poorly responsive, non-
shivering patient.
Hypothermia may occur in warm-weather locations during
warm-weather months.
Older, less responsive patients, especially those with
multiple co-morbidities, whose temperature regulatory
mechanisms are often compromised — are especially
susceptible to hypothermia.
Hypothermia may be a sign of sepsis. Fever often develops
in such patients once the hypothermia is corrected. Check
the patient’s temperature.
NOTE: The “telltale” shivering of hypothermia may be
absent in poorly nourished, compromised patients, and in
those with endocrinopathy (Nice review by Duong & Patel
— StatPearls, 2024).
ECG Findings with Hypothermia:
We’ve periodically reviewed the ECG
findings of hypothermia (ie, among other posts, in My Comment
in the February 2, 2024 post — in which we illustrate what could
be the largest Osborn Waves that you have seen).
In addition to Osborn waves — other commonly associated
ECG features with Hypothermia include: i) Bradycardia
(which may be marked); ii) Atrial fibrillation or other
arrhythmias (including VFib); iii) Artifact (from baseline
undulations resulting from associated shivering); iv) QTc
prolongation (which may be marked); v) ST elevation in
multiple leads; and, vi) Brugada phenocopy.
Today’s Initial ECG:
For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced today’s initial ECG.
 4/11
PEARL: It’s important to appreciate that there
are many different display formats for ECG recordings. As
noted by Hans Helseth — the display format in today’s initial
tracing shows the same 2 beats in each 2.5 second
recording for each of the 4 sets of 3 leads.
Thus, we only see 2 beats in this entire ECG.
The 2 beats that we see in Figure-1 — do appear to be
sinus-conducted (since in lead II, we see an upright P wave
with fixed PR interval). That said — Because the
same single R-R interval is present in each of these 12
leads, we have no idea if the rhythm is a regular sinus
bradycardia at ~47/minute — or — if there is irregularity with
a significant increase in heart rate elsewhere on the tracing.
In a word — We can do no more than guess what the
rhythm in this initial tracing is.
Figure-1: Today’s initial ECG (showing use of our QTc calculator).
Otherwise in Figure-1:
There is relatively low voltage (almost a null vector in
lead I ). The PR interval for the 2 beats that we see is
normal — and the QRS is narrow. But the QTc (ie, the QT
intervalcorrected for the slow heart rate) is prolonged.
As shown in Figure-2 — Weʼve added a QTc
Calculator to the lower line of the TabMenu that
appears at the top of every page of Dr. Smithʼs ECG
Blog. Especially given the challenge of reliably
determining the QTc interval with slow rhythms —
entering the heart rate (47/minute) and the QT
interval that you measure (580 msec.) — instantly
yields 5 estimates for the QTc. While there is some
variation in these estimated QTc values (depending on
the specific method used) — agreement is excellent
in Figure-1 for confirming moderate QTc prolongation in
todayʼs initial ECG (average QTc ~535 msec.)
 5/11
The frontal plane axis is vertical but normal.
ST-T waves in Figure-1 show nonspecific flattening.
Osborn Waves are present (RED arrows) — but are
subtle, limited to 2 leads, and would be easy to overlook
if not attentive to the ECG findings of hypothermia.
Concluding Thoughts:
The etiology of this patientʼs hypothermia was septicemia.
Because of the patients poorly responsive state, and a
lack of shivering at the time the paramedics arrived — a
high index of suspicion for septicemia was needed to
expedite diagnosis. Taking the temperature was
confirmatory.
The patientʼs initial ECG is consistent with the diagnosis
of moderate hypothermia (ie, apparent bradycardia —
prolonged QTc — subtle Osborn waves).
That said — I thought ECG findings on the initial tracing
were more modest than I would normally expect in a
patient with an initial rectal temperature of 29.2°C =
84.5°F (? initial core temperature?). I find it instructive
that even with this low of an initial temperature — ST-T
waves only showed nonspecific flattening — shiver
artifact was absent (it became readily apparent on the
repeat ECG in the ED) — and Osborn waves were tiny
and only seen in 2 leads.
Apparently — no ECG was repeated after the patientʼs
temperature was corrected. The ECG of a hypothermic
patient may mask underlying ECG abnormalities. For this
reason — Always repeat the ECG after correcting
hypothermia.
