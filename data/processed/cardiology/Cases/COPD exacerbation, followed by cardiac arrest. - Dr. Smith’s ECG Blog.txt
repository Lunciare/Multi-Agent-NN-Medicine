COPD exacerbation,
followed by cardiac arrest.
An elderly woman called 911 for SOB. She had a history of
COPD. On arrival, she was cyanotic and had increased work
of breathing. En route to the hospital, she had a bradycardic
arrest.
She had ROSC, and a Bedside echo showed a large RV
and very small LV. The providers made a provisional
diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based on this clinical
presentation.
Here is the first ECG:

What do you think?
There is atrial fibrillation. There is RBBB with right axis
deviation (deep S-wave in I, with R/S ratio < 1), including a

amplitude in right precordial leads is very large. I saw this on
the EKG system before I ever knew about the case and
thought that this was likely right ventricular hypertrophy
(RVH)
Continue:
She arrested again and was given tPA for presumed
pulmonary embolism. She was also put on ECMO.
She had another ECG recorded:
Screenshot
The RBBB is no longer present, as the QRS duration is less
than 120 ms. More importantly, the Rʼ-wave in V1 is not at all
wide. But it does have a lot of amplitude! The right axis
deviation is again present (deep S-wave in lead I), and it
cannot be blamed on RBBB. There is a large R-wave in V1;
R/S ratio is > 1. This is diagnostic of RVH (right ventricular
hypertrophy).
There is also of course much diffuse ST depression,
diagnostic of diffuse subenocardial ischemia, which is typical
of a post-ROSC heart.
A CT scan was done and did not show pulmonary embolism.
Troponin I rose to greater than 60,000 ng/L. Angiogram was
negative.
Formal echo showed severe RV hypertrophy.
The providers never recognized the ECG findings, which are
very specific for RVH.
Recognizing RVH probably would not have changed the
management of this patient, since there could be
superimposed pulmonary embolism. But, in many cases, it is
very helpful to recognize RVH. This patient has COPD, which
causes cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension. People
with RVH are at extremely high risk of cardiac arrest

especially when hypoxic or hypotensive. The arrest is
completely compatible with RVH + severe COPD
exacerbation. Knowing that could have an effect on the
decision to give thrombolytics.
RVH is rarely recognized on the ECG. The ECG is VERY
useful for the differentiatial diagnosis of a large RV on
bedside ultrasound, between PE and RVH, as PE shows only
acute right heart strain, and RVH has a large R-wave in V1. (V1
is placed directly over the RV; it is only enlarged with
chronic RVH, not with acute right heart strain).
I once watched a lecture by one of the nationʼs experts in RV
Failure, Susan Wilcox. She presented a number of cases of
RV Failure that went undiagnosed. In every case for which
she showed the ECG (as I remember, it was 4 cases), the ECG
showed RVH, but Dr. Wilcox had not been aware of it. I
contacted her about this in order to call her attention to it, and
she had indeed not been aware of it. She was very gracious
and appreciative to learn about it.
See these other cases of RVH:

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (1/4/2026):
Todayʼs case highlights this point by Dr. Smith:
The ECG diagnosis of RVH is often difficult to make —
and simply not thought of. As a result — it gets
overlooked, which all-too-often has unfortunate
clinical implications.
= = =
RVH is Often Overlooked …
Iʼve reviewed “My Take” on why the ECG diagnosis of RVH is
so often overlooked on a number of occasions (See the
February 12, 2023 post) — not the least of which are:
i) That our “medical eye” is used to looking for LVH,
which in adults is so much more common than RVH; —
and,
ii) In order for the anatomically smaller and much
thinner RV to become hypertrophied enough in an adult
to sufficiently overcome the predominance of LV
electrical forces — RVH with cor pulmonale will usually
have progressed to a very advanced stage (which is
very different than the process for developing RVH in
young children with congenital heart disease — in whom
RVHis a common finding that is much more easily
apparent on ECG).
= = =
RVH Diagnosis is Complicated by RBBB …
The ECG diagnosis of RVH becomes even more challenging in
the presence of complete RBBB (Right Bundle Branch Block).
This is because the criterion of a predominant R wave in lead
V1 is electrically counterbalanced by the conduction defect of
RBBB, in which an anatomically much smaller RV may
produce a deceptively tall ECG waveform (ie, R wave in lead
V1) when the RV is left depolarizing by itselfafter LV
depolarization has finished (which is what occurs with RBBB).
The ECG criterion that I have most commonly seen cited
for diagnosis of RVH when there is also complete RBBB
— is an Rʼ in lead V1 ≥10-15 mm. In my experience over a
period of decades, of looking for RVH in association with
RBBB (using Echo correlation as my “gold” standard) —
this Rʼ amplitude criterion in lead V1 is associated with a
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/copd-exacerbation-followed-by-cardiac-arrest/ 4/12

considerable number of false positives and false
negatives.
Looking for RVH on ECG in patients with incomplete
RBBB (which I define as an rbbb pattern with a QRS
duration of <0.11 second) — is easier, because
significant increased amplitude for the Rʼ wave in lead V1
(ie, greater than 5-10 mm) — is more specific for RVH
when there is incomplete RBBB, because the RV is not
depolarizing unopposed by LV forces to nearly the same
extent as it is when there is complete RBBB.
The presence of RAD (Right Axis Deviation), in which
there is a predominant S wave in lead I — is much more
supportive of true RVH in association with incomplete
RBBB than it is with complete RBBB (Simply stated — a
wide terminal S wave in lead I is expected as an
essential part of RBBB criteria — because this finding
primarily reflects terminal unopposed RV depolarization
and not RV size).
= = =
Application to Todayʼs ECGs …
With the above as background — I found assessment of
todayʼs 2 ECGs to be fascinating. For clarity and ease of
comparison — Iʼve reproduced and labeled these 2 tracings in
Figure-1.
As per Dr. Smith — the rhythm in ECG #1 is relatively
rapid and irregularly irregular without P waves = AFib
with a somewhat increased ventricular response
(average rate a bit over ~110/minute).
Complete RBBB is diagnosed in ECG #1 by the widened (
= 0.12 second in this tracing) QRS duration with
predominant R wave in lead V1 + wide terminal S wave in
lateral lead I (this S wave in lead I not being deep
enough to qualify for LPHB).
The presence of AFib negates our potential use of
finding RAA as a supportive criterion for RVH (For review
of my approach to the ECG diagnosis of RAA, as well as
LAA — CLICK HERE).
However — in the setting of RBBB, the loss of the initial
positive r wave deflection, to form a qR pattern in Lead
V1 suggests there is pulmonaryhypertension!(See my
Figure-2 in My Comment at the bottom of the page in
the February 12, 2023 post for illustrated discussion of
why this is so).
I thought the tiny, multiphasic QRS complex in lead V2
looked “out-of-place” in the context of the appearance
of the remaining chest leads in ECG #1(most probably
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/copd-exacerbation-followed-by-cardiac-arrest/ 5/12

22/01/2026, 15:16 COPD exacerbation, followed by cardiac arrest. - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
the result of inaccurate lead placement — be this due to
the patientʼs female gender or advanced COPD
anatomy).
R wave amplitude is huge in lead V3 — and certainly
could reflect marked RVH (although Iʼm unaware of any
ECG criteria for RVH that are based on R wave
amplitude in lead V3).
Finally — I interpreted the diffuse and marked ST-T wave
depression that is maximal in the inferior and anterior
leads, as potentially consistent with RV “strain”(albeit
difficult to distinguish RV “strain” from the effect that
new, fairly fast AFib might have on ST-T waves).
BOTTOM Line: RVH in an adult is a difficult diagnosis to make
based solely on ECG. It is especially difficult to diagnose in
association with complete RBBB (and especially when there
most probably is an error in chest lead placement).
The above said — this patientʼs known history of COPD,
now with acute dyspnea, cyanosis and bradycardic
arrest clearly predisposes her to RVH — especially with
the ECG finding of a qR pattern in V1( = the above
observations all supportive of the clinical concept that
RVH on ECG is a “detective diagnosis” — not to be
made based on any single ECG finding — but rather
dependent on clinical context in association with all ECG
findingsfound on the tracing).
I thought ECG #1 could clearly be consistent with acute
PE — as new AFib is a not uncommon arrhythmia in this
situation, especially in a longterm COPD patient
predisposed to preexisting RVH.
Bedside Echo quickly confirmed the ECG impression of
RVH (albeit with a very small LV). Subsequent chest CT
confirmed there was no acute PE.

case.

Todayʼs Repeat ECG …
The repeat ECG in todayʼs case was obtained following ROSC
after a 2nd cardiopulmonary arrest (with ECG #2 recorded
after this patient was placed on ECMO). Other clinical details
are not temporally correlated — leaving us to wonder about
reasons for some of the marked differences between ECG #2
vs ECG #1.
Sinus rhythm has been restored in ECG #2. Although
the upright P wave in lead II does not satisfy the ≥2.5
mm amplitude voltage criteria for RAA (Right Atrial
Abnormality) — the distinctly pointed shape of the
upright P wave in leads II,III and aVF still strongly
suggests RAA given the clinical context.
The QRS is no longer wide in ECG #2(I measure 0.10
second in duration). There is now a distinct triphasic
(rSRʼ) pattern in lead V1 — with terminal (albeit narrow)
S waves in lateral leads I and V6 ==> therefore consistent
with incomplete RBBB.
In the context of a normal duration QRS complex — the
predominantly negative QRS in lead I clearly indicates
RAD (Right Axis Deviation).
There once again is strong suggestion of lead
misplacement for lead V2 — with the small amplitude rS
pattern in this lead not making sense to me given the
triphasic rbbb-like appearance in both of its neighboring
leads ( = leads V1 and V3).

BOTTOM Line: Looking at ECG #2 alone — Iʼd interpret this
tracing as sinus rhythm +RVH(given the clinical context of
known severe pulmonary disease with the findings of IRBBB,
RAD, and RAAon ECG). Once again — Rʼ amplitude in lead V3
is huge (albeit significance of this finding is uncertain).
Iʼd be intellectually curious as to why the QRS so
suddenly became narrow — especially with loss of the
qR pattern in lead V1 (? marked improvement in
hemodynamics on ECMO that was started after the 2nd
cardiopulmonary arrest?).
Finally — the QTc is now markedly prolonged in ECG #2,
seen here in association with dramatic diffuse ST
depression. Whether this reflects post-resuscitation
ischemia or CNS insult following a 2nd cardiopulmonary
arrest is uncertain.
Hopefully the patient went on to recover …
