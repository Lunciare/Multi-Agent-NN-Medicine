COPD exacerbation,
followed by cardiac arrest.
An elderly woman called 911 for SOB. She had a history of
COPD. On arrival, she was cyanotic and had increased work
of breathing. En route to the hospital, she had a bradycardic
arrest.
She had ROSC, and a Bedside echo showed a large RV
and very small LV. The providers made a provisional
diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based on this clinical
presentation.
Here is the first ECG:

What do you think?
There is atrial fibrillation. There is RBBB with right axis
deviation (deep S-wave in I, with R/S ratio < 1), including a

probable left posterior fascicular block. The R-wave
 1/12
amplitude in right precordial leads is very large. I saw this on
the EKG system before I ever knew
