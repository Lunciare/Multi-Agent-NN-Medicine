Is it important to try to
determine the culprit vessel
based on ECG?
Written by Willy Frick
A man in his 60s with hypertension and prior stroke presented with
 
three days of crushing chest pain. He reported intermittent chest pain
for the last few months, but never lasting this long. He described it as
substernal with radiation into the right arm.
With all of this information, we can feel reasonably confident even
before looking at the ECG that we are dealing with OMI.
What do you think?
Right away, we notice different populations of R waves. On the V1
rhythm strip, R4 and R5 look like natively conducted beats. (Note,
they are not sinus since the P waves are upside down in aVF. It looks
like a low atrial rhythm.) The other beats are wider and have a 
different origin — more on this later. Unfortunately, although natively
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 1/15
conducted beats are the best ones for evaluating ischemia, we only
have a few! Or do we?
Although printed ECGs in North America typically display 2.5 seconds
of each lead plus one or more 10 second rhythm strips, most
machines actually gather data for 10 seconds of all 12 leads! (I
recently learned from Dave Richley that modern machines collect 10
seconds of data from leads I and II plus V1-V6. They do not actually
measure III, aVL, aVR, aVF but rather calculate them.)
Smith comment: this is one of the major obstacles that Powerful
Medical needed to overcome in digitizing 12-lead ECG images: all
digital ECG recordings are 10 seconds of each lead, but the images
only display 2.5 seconds. So 75% of the image is missing! Most
computer scientists in the 12-lead ECG world said it was impossible.
But they did it. They were also able to produce an XML file with 10
seconds of each lead out of these JPG, PNG, or PDF files. This is
critical because AI needs an XML file for analysis.
Case Continued
I like to take advantage of this fact by opening up the ECG in the
reading software and reformatting it into 12 channels of rhythm.

Before reading further, see if you can figure out the rhythm. My
interpretation is described in reference to the lead II rhythm strip
below with annotations for clarity.
Beats 4 and 5 have the narrowest QRS of all. These must be
natively conducted beats. Note that the P waves indicated by
the blue arrows have a superior axis (i.e. they are inverted in
the inferior leads). Sinus rhythm has an inferior axis, so this
must be a low atrial rhythm.
Beats 1-2 and 7-10 are wider, uniform, and regular. In context of
reperfused OMI (I will come back to this), we commonly see
AIVR. This QRS complex is almost exactly 120 ms, which is on
the narrow end for ventricular origin. And AIVR is commonly
closer to 80-110 bpm. Still, this would be very fast for a
junctional or ventricular escape rhythm under normal
circumstances, so I favor AIVR.
The red arrows associated with R waves 3 and 6 indicate P
waves with sinus morphology — upright in I, II, aVF. (They are
upside down in V1 and V2, but this is probably because the
electrodes are too high.) Additionally, the PR intervals are very
short and the QRS complexes are intermediate in morphology
between the AIVR beats. Hence they are fusion beats [fusion
between ventricular (wide) and conducted (narrow)]. R3 is
mostly AIVR morphology, and R6 is mostly sinus conducted
morphology.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 3/15
The green arrows indicate atrial activity that appears to have
been beaten out by the AIVR (i.e., did not conduct because the
AIVR beat came first). I doubt retrograde conduction because
the RP interval is variable between 8 and 9. If the atrial activity
were due to retrograde conduction, the interval from the R wave
to the retrograde P wave would likely be the same between the
two beats.
Moving on to ischemia, the ECG shows reperfused inferoposterior
infarct. Specifically focusing on beats 4 and 5, we see:
TWI in II, III, aVF
Overly upright posterior reperfusion T waves most pronounced
in V2-3*
Reciprocally upright T waves in I/aVL (we would expect them to
be inverted with the LVH strain pattern)
*Some of this may be the expected T wave in a patient with LVH
strain pattern. It is hard to be sure, but this nuance does not impact
the overall diagnosis.
Back to the case:
Unfortunately for the patient, he presented on Friday morning to a
facility that did not have cath lab coverage until the following Monday.
The cardiology consultant notes that pain is “almost resolved.”
Remember that in OMI, chest pain is a sign of ongoing infarction.
“Almost resolved” means it is NOT resolved. There is active
infarction. There either is ischemic chest pain or there is not.
The patient was loaded with aspirin and clopidogrel and started on
continuous heparin infusion with plan for cath Monday. The note says
that “if symptoms become refractory,” the patient will need to be
transferred for urgent cath over the weekend. (What does refractory
mean if not days of unresolved chest pain which persists after
starting medical therapy?) Initial hsTnI was 14,114 ng/L, repeat 12,651
ng/L, none further checked. Echocardiogram showed inferior wall
hypokinesis. The patient was evaluated Saturday with no changes to
plan.
On Sunday, the patient complained of dyspnea and angina while
ambulating. Repeat ECG is shown.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 4/15
Again, we see reperfusion in the inferior and posterior territories.
There is just a hint of coving in leads III and aVF suggesting a
component of active ischemia which fits with persistent pain.
The Queen of Hearts recognizes this as reperfused OMI:
This was interpreted by cardiology as “suggestive of anterior wall ST
elevation MI.” Yes, you read that right. It was hand written in two
places in the note, so definitely not an accident.
Smith: yes, it is suggestive of anterior MI — of OLD anterior MI. But
also of subacute inferior OMI.
Perhaps the cardiologist was attempting serial comparison and
thought there was new STE in V3 without realizing that the prior ECG
shows AIVR and fusion beats in V3. Fortunately for the patient, this
mistaken interpretation at least got him urgently transferred to a cath
capable facility where he underwent urgent angiography.
If interested, you can review the angiography in detail on my
coronary angiography guide where you will find a lot more
information about coronary angiography generally.
Here is an LAO cranial view showing TIMI 0 in the mid to distal RCA
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 5/15
Angiography was interpreted as showing chronic total occlusion of
the RCA. (We know from the ECG that the RCA is actually the acute
culprit!) The patient received DES to mid LAD and DES to diagonal,
with no intervention to the culprit RCA.
Unfortunately, wrong vessel PCI is very common. In a prospective
cohort of patients presenting with NSTEMI, 27% of patient receiving
PCI had intervention solely to uninvolved arteries. In the same cohort,
almost HALF (46%) have either the wrong infarct related artery
selected, or the ultimate diagnosis is not ischemic in the first place!
Not surprisingly, the patient had persistent pain after PCI, continuing
through the night. The following day, he returned to lab where a
different operator performed repeat angiography. The second
operator described the RCA as an acute thrombotic occlusion and
placed three overlapping stents. The final shot is shown.

Learning points:
Just because the cath report describes a lesion as “CTO” does
not mean it is. It may still be an acute culprit.
Wrong vessel PCI is very common, it happens in about 1 in 4
NSTEMIs.
Angiography has inherent limitations. About half of NSTEMI
diagnoses are incorrect.
As always, effective OMI care requires putting the ECG in
context of the patientʼs symptoms.
Here is another video explanation of a case in which the
ECG was critical in finding the culprit:
Right Ventricular MI seen on ECG helps Angiographer to find Culprit Lesion
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (1/5/2025):
===================================
Awareness that many modern ECG machines do not display
all of the data they gather when writing out an ECG is a
greatly underused concept. That said, uncovering much of
this unused extra data by routinely displaying each beat
in each of the 12 leads would not only prove cumbersome —
but it would be unnecessary in the great majority of tracings
that lack the great degree of morphology variation seen in
todayʼs case.
Todayʼs case by Dr. Frick illustrates an exception to the
above generality. By reformatting the data collected into
12 channels of the rhythm — Dr. Frick facilitated
interpretation not only of todayʼs initial 12-lead ECG —
but he also provides insight into the mechanism of
todayʼs fascinating initial rhythm.
I focus my comment on exploring this mechanism.
Thanks to Dr. Frick — I was able to obtain a long lead
II rhythm strip. In Figure-1 — I combine this derived lead
II with the already displayed lead V1 rhythm strip to facilitate
clarifyingatrial activity in todayʼs initial tracing.
Without Dr. Frickʼs reformatting the 10 beats in todayʼs
initial tracing into 12 channels of rhythm — I
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 7/15
would never have realized that there are 2 atrial foci in
the initial rhythm.(Although P wave morphology of sinus
P waves may vary some from one beat to the next — I
would not expect as much variation as we abruptly see
for just 2 beats in todayʼs initial rhythm).
As per Dr. Frick — the P waves that precede beats #4
and #5 are predominantly negative in lead II, therefore
presumably of low atrial origin (BLUE arrow P waves in
Figure-1).
RED arrows in Figure-1 highlight sinus P waves that are
upright in lead II. Of these, P waves c and f are the only
P waves clearly seen. Dr. Frick pointed out P
waves h and i that appear shortly after beats #8 and 9 in
lead II (albeit they are not seen in lead V1).
Given sinus P waves f, h and i — it seems logical that
another on-time sinus P wave will almost certainly be
hiding within the QRS complex of beat #7 (WHITE
arrow).
Motivated to look even closer for “hidden” P waves —
the slight angulation just before the QRS of beat #2 is
not present in other beats (strongly suggesting
that b represents another on-time sinus P wave).
Finally — the subtle notch that simulates an rʼ deflection
at the end of the QRS of beat #1 falls in a perfect place
to be hiding a final on-time sinus P wave. (This rhythm
simply makes more sense if we postulate more regular
atrial activity — and the highlighted atrial deflections
support this premise).
Whereas atrial activity is best displayed in the long lead II
rhythm strip of todayʼs initial ECG — I thought the variation in
QRST morphology to be best displayed in the long lead V1.
As per Dr. Frick — the pathology underlying todayʼs case
is an acute inferior OMI — now with reperfusion T
waves (best seen in the inferior leads of this initial
tracing) and with AIVR
(Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm) that is so
commonly seen as a reperfusion arrhythmia.
Focusing on QRST morphology in lead V1 of Figure-1 —
beats #1,2; and 7,8,9,10 are all wide and not preceded by
any P wave. These are all ventricular beats at a regular
and slightly accelerated rate of ~60/minute (which is
perfectly consistent with AIVR).
The 2 low atrial P waves ( = d and e) are conducted
normally to the ventricles (ie, beats #4 and 5 are narrow
QRS complexes).
Beats #3 and #6 are Fusion beats (F). We know this —
because both of these beats: i) Manifest a QRS and T
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 8/15
wave morphology that is intermediate to the beat before
and the beat after it (ie, QRST morphology of beat #3 is
intermediate to that of beats #2 and #4 — and QRST
morphology of beat #6 is intermediate to that of beats
#5 and #7); — and, ii) Both beats #3 and 6 are preceded
by P waves that have a chance to partially conduct (and
as would be expected with fusion beats — beat #6 with
a slightly longer PR interval provides slightly more time
for the sinus P wave preceding it to conduct in the
ventricles, which is why fusion beat #6 looks more like
normally conducted beats #4 and 5 than does beat #3
which is preceded by a shorter PR interval).
Why was AIVR able to appear in this initial tracing?
Whereas the R-R interval of ventricular beats in Figure-
1 remains quite constant — the atrial rate of sinus P
waves varies somewhat. As a result — slowing of the
sinus P wave rate facilitates intermittent appearance of
either a low atrial escape rhythm or of AIVR.
P.S.: As often occurs — there may be slight lag in the
intermittent appearance of AIVR. But the “theme” of this
initial rhythm, is that OMI reperfusion results in a slightly
accelerated AIVR that in general makes its presence
around the time that the sinus rate slows. A longer
period of monitoring would be needed to know for
certain — but the back-and-forth between wide and
narrow QRS complexes is almost like that seen with
isorhythmic AV dissociation, albeit complicated by low
atrial escape.
Figure-1: Combined lead II and lead V1 rhythm strip.
My Proposed Laddergram:
Sinus P waves a,b and g are not conducted to the
ventricles — because ventricular beats #1,2 and 7 have
rendered the AV nodal area refractory to
supraventricular impulses.
Sinus P waves h and i are not conducted to the
ventricles — because these P waves occur after the
QRS of beats #8 and 9 during the ARP (Absolute
Refractory Period).
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/does-guessing-culprit-vessel-based-on/ 9/15
Escape low atrial impulses d and e occur at just the right
time to be able to conduct normally to the ventricles to
produce beats #4 and 5.
Sinus P wave c occurs just before the QRS of beat #3.
As a result — this P wave is only able to conduct a short
distance in the ventricles before being stopped by the
AIVR impulse. This fusion beat therefore looks very
much like other AIVR impulses.
Sinus P wave f manifests a slightly longer PR interval
than did c. As a result — this P wave penetrates further
in the ventricles — which leads to a fusion beat that
looks much more like normally conducted beats #4 and
#5.
