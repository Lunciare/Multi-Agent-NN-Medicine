Case Summary

A man in his 60s with hypertension and prior stroke presented with 3 days of crushing substernal chest pain, radiating to the right arm. He reported intermittent chest pain for months, but never this severe or prolonged. Based on symptoms alone, acute OMI was highly likely even before ECG review.

ECG Interpretation — Rhythm First

The initial ECG showed multiple QRS morphologies, indicating more than one rhythm mechanism.

Key rhythm findings (best seen after reformatting ECG into 12-channel rhythm):

Narrow QRS beats (beats 4–5)

True natively conducted beats

Preceded by P waves inverted in inferior leads → low atrial rhythm

These beats are the most reliable for ischemia assessment

Wide, regular beats (beats 1–2, 7–10)

Uniform morphology, ~120 ms QRS

Rate ~80–100 bpm

Consistent with AIVR (Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm)

Typical reperfusion arrhythmia

Fusion beats (beats 3 and 6)

Intermediate morphology between narrow and wide beats

Occur when sinus impulse partially conducts into ventricle already depolarized by AIVR

Atrial activity without conduction

Atrial impulses sometimes blocked because ventricular depolarization occurred first

Not retrograde conduction (variable RP intervals)

Conclusion (rhythm):
Reperfused OMI with AIVR + low atrial rhythm + fusion beats, consistent with acute ischemia followed by partial reperfusion.

ECG Interpretation — Ischemia

Focusing on the narrow conducted beats (4–5):

Inferior leads (II, III, aVF):

T-wave inversion → inferior infarction

V2–V3:

Overly upright T waves → posterior reperfusion

I / aVL:

Upright T waves where inversion would be expected with LVH strain → reciprocal reperfusion pattern

Diagnosis from ECG:
Reperfused inferoposterior OMI, most consistent with RCA occlusion.

Clinical Course and System Failure

Patient presented to a hospital without cath lab coverage over the weekend

Chest pain documented as “almost resolved”

In OMI, this means NOT resolved

Managed medically (ASA, clopidogrel, heparin), cath deferred to Monday

hs-troponin extremely elevated (>14,000 ng/L)

Echo: inferior wall hypokinesis

On Sunday:

Patient developed dyspnea and exertional angina

Repeat ECG showed:

Persistent inferior/posterior reperfusion

Subtle coving in III and aVF → ongoing ischemia

Cath Lab Errors
First Angiography:

RCA described as “chronic total occlusion (CTO)”

PCI performed to LAD and diagonal branches

Culprit RCA not treated

Patient had persistent chest pain overnight

Second Angiography (next day, different operator):

RCA recognized as acute thrombotic occlusion

Three overlapping stents placed

Culprit finally treated

Core Lessons
1. ECG Can Identify the Culprit Vessel

This ECG correctly localized the infarct to the RCA

Angiography misidentified the culprit vessel

2. Wrong-Vessel PCI Is Common

~27% of NSTEMIs receive PCI to uninvolved arteries

~46% have either:

Wrong infarct-related artery treated, or

No ischemic diagnosis at all

3. “CTO” on Angiography ≠ Chronic

ECG evidence + symptoms must override cath labels

4. Chest Pain Is Binary in OMI

“Almost resolved” = ongoing infarction

Refractory pain means immediate cath, regardless of timing or logistics

5. AIVR Is a Reperfusion Marker

Presence of AIVR strongly suggests:

Recent reperfusion

Recently occluded artery

It does not mean the problem is over

Key Takeaways for Practice

Always integrate ECG + symptoms, not cath alone

Identify the culprit vessel on ECG whenever possible

Use narrow conducted beats to assess ischemia

AIVR + fusion beats in chest pain = recent OMI

Delayed or wrong-vessel PCI leads to avoidable myocardial loss
