46 year old with chest pain develops a wide complex rhythm — see many examples

A 46-year-old male presented to the emergency department with 2 days of heavy substernal chest pain and nausea. He reported a history of “Wolf-Parkinson-White” and “heart attack” but said neither had been treated. These diagnoses were not found in his medical records nor even a baseline ECG. He had no previously documented medical problems except polysubstance use. An ECG was obtained shortly after arrival: There is no evidence of WPW on this ECG, but it is diagnostic for OMI. About one hour later his high sensitivity troponin I resulted at 3,000 ng/L (reference 3-54 ng/L). The patient continued having chest pain. Three additional ECGs were performed over the next 5 minutes: The rhythm is AIVR — accelerated idioventricular rhythm. The patient was given aspirin, heparin, morphine, and ondansetron and transferred to a PCI-capable facility for a diagnosis of “unstable angina” with dynamic ECG changes. About 2 hours later the patient arrived at a PCI-capable center and repeat ECG was obtained: The patient continued to have chest pain and bedside ultrasound showed hypokinesis of the septum with significantly reduced LVEF. The patient was then taken for angiography. This is a right anterior oblique caudal view. It clearly shows the tiny remaining
