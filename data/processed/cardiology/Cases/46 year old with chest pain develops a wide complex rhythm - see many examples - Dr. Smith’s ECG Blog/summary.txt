A 46-year-old male presented to the emergency department with 2 days of heavy substernal chest pain and nausea. He reported a history of “Wolf-Parkinson-White” and “heart attack” but said neither had been treated. These diagnoses were not found in his medical records nor even a baseline ECG. He had no previously documented medical problems except polysubstance use. An ECG was obtained shortly after arrival: There is no evidence of WPW on this ECG, but it is diagnostic for OMI. About one hour later his high sensitivity troponin I resulted at 3,000 ng/L (reference 3-54 ng/L).
