65 year old with chest pain
during dialysis
Written by Jesse McLaren, with edits by Smith
A 65 year old with history of CABG and end stage renal disease developed
sudden chest pain and diaphoresis during routine dialysis, and was given three
nitro sprays and then sent to the emergency department. On arrival, heart rate was
145 and BP 75/50. What do you think? 

There’s a wide complex tachycardia which is regular (so not AF) and without
preceding P
waves (so not sinus tach). There is an LBBB appearance in the precordial leads,
but the limb leads have rS complexes in I/aVL rather than monophasic R waves –
making it non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD). There are no
obvious
features of hyperkalemia (eg very wide QRS, peaked T waves). Instead, There’s
fast septal depolarization in V1-3 (narrow rS) suggesting supraventricular
origin. With the abnormal depolarization there’s expected discordant
repolarization abnormalities, which are exaggerated by the tachy-arrhythmia –
producing diffuse ST depression with reciprocal STE in aVR. But there’s
unexpected concordant STE in III, which could be subepicardial (i.e.,
analogous to OMI) secondary to the tachy-arrhythmia or from primary ACS.
Bottom line: unstable non-sinus tachy-arrhythmia: cardiovert and reassess.
The patient spontaneously cardioverted and systolic BP increased to the 90s, but
had
ongoing chest pain. Repeat ECG:
What do you think?
Sinus rhythm with PVC, first degree AV block, and same QRS morphology as
during
tachy-arrhythmia – confirming it was supraventricular. The final blinded read was
non-specific IVCD, suggesting that all ST/T changes are secondary to abnormal
depolarization. But there is still ongoing inappropriate concordant ST
elevation III and reciprocal ST depression I/aVL, as well as mild concordant ST
depression
in V2 – indicating superimposed primary ischemic changes from inferior +/-
posterior OMI.
Old MI can result in Q waves with residual STE (LV aneurysm morphology),
which in the inferior leads can be difficulty to distinguish from acute OMI. But
when this is the case, the Q-wave is MUCH more prominent and always more
prominent than the R-wave. Moreover, this was new compared to an old ECG:

The old ECG also had a narrower QRS, so cath lab was activated both for “new
LBBB” as well as concordant inferior ST elevation. But it’s not a true LBBB, and
“new LBBB” is no longer an indication for cath lab activation. However, despite
not being a true LBBB, the principle of inappropriate concordance is still helpful
in identifying OMI.
Even without a prior to compare, this ECG in a patient with a high pre-test
likelihood of ACS is diagnostic of OMI. Here’s the Queen’s interpretation,
highlighting concordant STE and reciprocal STD:

What about the initial troponin?
Troponin is often chronically elevated in a dialysis patients, and can rise from the
demand ischemia of tachy-arrhythmias or other shock states. The initial troponin
is an unreliable marker of acute OMI (it can be normal acutely, and even if
elevated it lags far behind the myocardial damage), and doesn’t provide real-time
information to distinguish Occlusion MI from Non-Occlusion MI. So in this
patient the initial troponin would not help differentiate chronic myocardial injury,
type 2 MI from tachyarrhythmia demand ischemia, and type 1 MI from OMI or
NOMI due to plaque rupture (ACS) – and if OMI, waiting for troponin would cost
myocardium.

So this is a clinical diagnosis, aided by ECG.
Fortunately the patient was immediately taken to cath lab without waiting for the
troponin,
with a door to cath time of only 45 minutes. There was a 95% left circumflex
occlusion which was stented. First troponin I was 80 ng/L (only slightly higher
than the patient’s baseline of 50ng/L), which rose to 500, then 2,000 and then a
peak of 8,000 ng/L. Follow up ECG
showed resolution of the primary ischemic ST changes, and subtle infero-
posterior reperfusion T wave inversion compared with baseline:
Take 2. Tachy-arrhythmias can cause secondary ST/T changes due to supply/demand
mismatch that can be reassessed after cardioversion. When the troponin is
elevated, this is one of the etiologies of “Type 2 MI”
3. ‘New LBBB’ is not an indication for cath lab activation
4. Inappropriate concordant STE can identify OMI in both LBBB and IVCD
5. First troponin is an unreliable marker of OMI in acute chest pain and can’t
differentiate chronic myocardial injury and demand ischemia from Type 1 MI
(ACS, plaque rupture) OMI or NOMI: OMI is a clinical diagnosis, aided by ECG
(and AI)
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (6/29/2025):
===================================
Insightful case by Dr. McLaren — with lots of PEARLS in assessment
and management. I focus my comment on a few additional interesting
aspects regarding the repeat ECG, obtained after spontaneous
conversion of the regular WCT (Wide-Complex Tachycardia) seen in
todayʼs 1st ECG.
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced and labeled
this repeat ECG.
 4/11
Rhythm Detection Using Simultaneous Leads:
As per Dr. McLaren — preservation of the same QRS
morphology as was seen during the WCT in todayʼs 1st ECG
confirmed that this WCT was supraventricular, with an
unusual IVCD (IntraVentricular Conduction Defect)
morphology. I chose to reproduce this tracing — because it
provides an excellent example of time-efficient use
of simultaneously-recorded leads to deduce the etiology of
each beat in Figure-1:
Caveat: As per Dr. McClaren — the KEY clue for
suggesting that the WCT in todayʼs 1st ECG was
supraventricular, was the fast septal depolarization
(ie, narrow initial R wave in leads V1-to-V3). That said
— Iʼll add the caveat that as helpful as this clue is, it is
not infallible — as Iʼve seen documented VT on occasion
manifest surprisingly narrow initial QRS deflections in
these anterior leads. The reason I was not confident in
todayʼs case about a supraventricular etiology for the
WCT until I saw ECG #2 — was that the initial QRS
deflection in the WCT rhythm was wide in many of the
other leads.
But the presence of sinus P waves with a constant
(albeit prolonged) PR interval in the long lead V1 rhythm
strip (RED arrows) — confirmed the supraventricular
etiology in Figure-1.
While fully acknowledging that additional details
regarding the rhythm in Figure-1 do not alter
management — facile use of the long lead V1 rhythm
strip in association with the simultaneously-
recorded leads from the 12-lead tracing above it, allow
clarification that the PINK arrow P waves in Figure-
1 are PACs — because: i) Beats #2,6 and 12 all occur
earlier-than-expected; ii) The PR interval of these 3
beats is consistently shorter than the PR interval of
the RED arrow P waves; and, iii) P wave morphology of
the 4 PINK arrow P waves in Figure-1 is
subtly different than the P wave morphology of the RED
arrow sinus P waves (these PINK arrow P waves all lack
the terminal negative P wave deflection of the sinus P
waves).
In contrast — beat #10 is a PVC, even though the QRS
complex of this beat is small in the long lead V1 rhythm
strip. We know this — because simultaneously-
recorded beat #10 in leads V1,V2,V3 is clearly very wide
and very different in morphology compared to beats
#8,9 and 11 in these leads.
However — beat #13 in the long lead V1 rhythm strip
is not a PVC. We know this despite how wide and
different-looking this beat is in lead V1 — because the
QRS morphology of beat #13 in simultaneously-
recorded beat #13 in leads V4,V5,V6 is identical to the
 5/11
QRS morphology of beats #12 and 14 in these leads. It
should be apparent that the reason for the bizarre QRS
morphology of beat #13 in the long lead V1 is the result
of artifact.
“Take-there are times when this technique will be the sole
determining factor for distinguishing between an SVT vs
VT.
Figure-1: The repeat ECG in todayʼs case, obtained after
spontaneous conversion of the regular WCT.
An Aslanger Pattern?
While fully acknowleding the confounding role of the unusual
IVCD morphology that we see in Figure-1 — I instantly arrived
at a similar decision as Dr. McLaren that ECG #2 was
indicative of acute inferior infarction — because of the
resemblance of this tracing to Aslangerʼs Pattern.
As discussed by Dr. Meyers and in My
Comment from the December 31, 2024 post of
Dr.Smithʼs ECG Blog — the combination of ST elevation
in lead III (but not in other inferior leads) — in
association with an ECG picture that is otherwise
consistent with DSI (Diffuse Subendocardial
Ischemia) — suggests there is inferior OMI
plus underlying multivessel disease.
The diagnosis of DSI in todayʼs case is suggested by ST
depression in multiple leads (as per the 7 BLUE arrows
in Figure-1) — in association with marked ST elevation
in lead aVR.
Although we are only provided with information from the
cardiac catheterization report regarding the “culprit” LCx
artery — the bizarre IVCD morphology, in association
with fragmented QRS complexes in several leads is
almost certain indication of additional underlying “scar”
from coronary disease.
