A young man presented with altered mental status (AMS) and seizure-like activity. EMS was called by police after the patient was observed ingesting powder and pills, followed by erratic behavior. He was actively seizing on ED arrival; seizures resolved after 5 mg midazolam (Versed) administered prehospital. During secondary survey, a large amount of white powder was noted both in a bag and free-form around the genital area, raising concern for acute drug toxicity. Initial ECG Findings (ECG #1) Sinus rhythm, borderline tachycardia Markedly wide QRS: ~178 ms Large R wave in aVR Terminal right axis deviation Brugada-type morphology in V1–V2 This ECG pattern is pathognomonic for sodium channel blockade. Although hyperkalemia can cause wide, bizarre QRS complexes, the combination of findings (large R in aVR + Brugada phenocopy + extreme QRS widening) strongly favors toxic sodium channel blockade, requiring immediate antidotal therapy. Etiology: Drugs Causing Sodium Channel Blockade Common causes include: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Class I antiarrhythmics (especially flecainide, procainamide) Cocaine Given the history of white powder ingestion and seizure, cocaine toxicity was the leading diagnosis in this case (though TCA overdose must always be considered in similar presentations). Management and ECG Response Immediate Treatment IV sodium bicarbonate administered immediately
