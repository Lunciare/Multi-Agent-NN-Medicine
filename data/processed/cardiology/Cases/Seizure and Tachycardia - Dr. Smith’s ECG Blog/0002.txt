cocaine toxicity was the leading diagnosis in this case (though TCA overdose must always be considered in similar presentations). Management and ECG Response Immediate Treatment IV sodium bicarbonate administered immediately Each “amp”: 100 mL of 8.4% NaHCO₃ = 100 mEq sodium + 100 mEq bicarbonate Serial ECG Changes with Treatment QRS narrowed from 178 ms → 160 ms After additional bicarbonate doses: QRS → 130 ms Eventually normalized to ~110 ms (upper limit of normal) Brugada morphology gradually resolved Acid–Base Status Initial venous blood gas: pH 6.96 pCO₂ 64 HCO₃⁻ 14 Repeat after treatment: pH 7.21 pCO₂ 47 HCO₃⁻ 18 Severe combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis likely contributed to sodium channel toxicity and arrhythmogenic risk. Clinical Course Required intubation for airway protection and persistent stupor Bicarbonate infusion planned but ultimately not required as QRS remained normalized Urine drug screen positive for cocaine and fentanyl Discharged from ICU three days later with good outcome Key ECG Features of Sodium Channel Blockade QRS ≥ 100 ms In TCA toxicity, QRS > 100 ms is 100% sensitive for seizure risk Large R wave in aVR R ≥ 3 mm or R/S ratio > 0.7 Terminal right axis deviation Brugada phenocopy (V1–V2) QT prolongation
