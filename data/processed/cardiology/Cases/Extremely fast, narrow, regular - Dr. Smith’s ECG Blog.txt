Extremely fast, narrow,
regular
This was emailed to me by a reader with this info: 39-year-old
male with no past medical history presents with 3 days of
palpitations and 2 episodes of syncope in the past 8 hours.
(I later heard from a publisher that this is from their book
and is copyrighted. The sender represented the ECG as
from her own institution, and gave permission to use it. The
publisher agrees to let me keep it here with attribution. I
think the sender really believed that it came from a
colleague at her own instutution. An honest mistake.)
This comes from this book, now with permisson:

What is it, and how did I respond?
My response: “Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. This AV node
conducts too fast. Probably hyperthyroid.” You can see
flutter waves at a rate just above 300, and a corresponding
ventricular rate just above 100.
Case answer: This patientʼs ED workup was consistent with
thyroid storm. He was chemically cardioverted with
adenosine after which he
briefly went into sinus tachycardia before going into atrial
fibrillation with RVR at ~140 bpm. Atrial fibrillation is
commonly seen with thyroid storm and will often be
refractory to rate control or cardioversion until the elevated
thyroid hormones are treated.
So was this extremely fast AVNRT, AVRT, or atrial flutter
with 1:1 conduction? We may never know. Conversion after
adenosine certainly makes one believe that it is AVNRT or
orthodromic AVRT, but there do appear to be flutter waves. I
think AVNRT or AVRT are most likely. In any case, the AV
node is working VERY fast.

Learning point: K. Wang, who wrote the fantastic EKG Atlas
(below) told me years ago that the only way an AV node can
conduct at this accelerated rate is if the patient is
hyperthyroid, which results in very high sympathetic tone.
The literature on this is scant. Other etologies of extreme
catecholamine surge could (theoretically) do this as well,
including sympathomimetic drugs, pheochromocytoma, etc.
Although such rapid conduction can be seen with an
accessory pathway, that would not have such a narrow
complex.
The therapy here is obvious: electrical cardioversion.

See other cases of atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. But all of
them have a much slower atrial rate, often due to type 1
(usually 1c) antidysrhythmic, such as flecainide.

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (Note that
although I first published My Comment on 10/7
— I revised it on 10/8/2025):
As per Dr. Smithʼs initial reply — I also thought todayʼs ECG
(that Iʼve reproduced in Figure-1) suggested a single,
immediate answer = AFlutter (Atrial Flutter) with 1:1 AV
conduction. That said, to the differential diagnosis — I had to
add AVRT (AtrioVentricular Reentry Tachycardia), in which an
AP (Accessory Pathway) participates in the reentry circuit —

as both orthodromic and antidromic forms of AVRT may on
rare occasions reach SVT rates this fast.
The rhythm in Figure-1 — is a regular, exceedingly fast
narrow-complex tachycardia without clear sign of atrial
activity. Although there does seem to be suggestion of a
notching at the very end of the QRS complex in lead II
(within the BLUE circle) — no such notching is seen in
the other inferior leads, as it typically is when there is
retrograde atrial conduction from a reentry SVT rhythm.
That the indication of atrial activity is uncertain in
Figure-1 should not be surprising — given how very fast
the heart rate is (ie, There simply isnʼt much place to put
P waves given that the R-R interval is entirely taken up
by the QRS and ST-T wave). Almost like an ambiguous
image — after looking at this tracing multiple times, I
wondered
