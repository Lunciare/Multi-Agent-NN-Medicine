Extremely fast, narrow,
regular
This was emailed to me by a reader with this info: 39-year-old
male with no past medical history presents with 3 days of
palpitations and 2 episodes of syncope in the past 8 hours.
(I later heard from a publisher that this is from their book
and is copyrighted. The sender represented the ECG as
from her own institution, and gave permission to use it. The
publisher agrees to let me keep it here with attribution. I
think the sender really believed that it came from a
colleague at her own instutution. An honest mistake.)
This comes from this book, now with permisson:

What is it, and how did I respond?
My response: “Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. This AV node
conducts too fast. Probably hyperthyroid.” You can see
flutter waves at a rate just above 300, and a corresponding
ventricular rate just above 100.
Case answer: This patientʼs ED workup was consistent with
thyroid storm. He was chemically cardioverted with
adenosine after which he
briefly went into sinus tachycardia before going into atrial
fibrillation with RVR at ~140 bpm. Atrial fibrillation is
commonly seen with thyroid storm and will often be
refractory to rate control or cardioversion until the elevated
thyroid hormones are treated.
So was this extremely fast AVNRT, AVRT, or atrial flutter
with 1:1 conduction? We may never know. Conversion after
adenosine certainly makes one believe that it is AVNRT or
orthodromic AVRT, but there do appear to be flutter waves. I
think AVNRT or AVRT are most likely. In any case, the AV
node is working VERY fast.

Learning point: K. Wang, who wrote the fantastic EKG Atlas
(below) told me years ago that the only way an AV node can
conduct at this accelerated rate is if the patient is
hyperthyroid, which results in very high sympathetic tone.
The literature on this is scant. Other etologies of extreme
catecholamine surge could (theoretically) do this as well,
including sympathomimetic drugs, pheochromocytoma, etc.
Although such rapid conduction can be seen with an
accessory pathway, that would not have such a narrow
complex.
The therapy here is obvious: electrical cardioversion.

See other cases of atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. But all of
them have a much slower atrial rate, often due to type 1
(usually 1c) antidysrhythmic, such as flecainide.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (Note that
although I first published My Comment on 10/7
— I revised it on 10/8/2025):
As per Dr. Smithʼs initial reply — I also thought todayʼs ECG
(that Iʼve reproduced in Figure-1) suggested a single,
immediate answer = AFlutter (Atrial Flutter) with 1:1 AV
conduction. That said, to the differential diagnosis — I had to
add AVRT (AtrioVentricular Reentry Tachycardia), in which an
AP (Accessory Pathway) participates in the reentry circuit —

as both orthodromic and antidromic forms of AVRT may on
rare occasions reach SVT rates this fast.
The rhythm in Figure-1 — is a regular, exceedingly fast
narrow-complex tachycardia without clear sign of atrial
activity. Although there does seem to be suggestion of a
notching at the very end of the QRS complex in lead II
(within the BLUE circle) — no such notching is seen in
the other inferior leads, as it typically is when there is
retrograde atrial conduction from a reentry SVT rhythm.
That the indication of atrial activity is uncertain in
Figure-1 should not be surprising — given how very fast
the heart rate is (ie, There simply isnʼt much place to put
P waves given that the R-R interval is entirely taken up
by the QRS and ST-T wave). Almost like an ambiguous
image — after looking at this tracing multiple times, I
wondered about 1:1 flutter waves ( = slanted light BLUE
lines in leads II,III,aVF; aVL; V1). I finally concluded that
atrial activity is uncertain.
KEY Point: The heart rate in todayʼs tracing is over
300/minute! Note below in Figure-1 that Iʼve placed a
RED arrow precisely on an R wave occurring on a heavy
grid line. Five large boxes later — we see that the 5th
QRS complex occurs slightly before the 5th heavy grid
line (the YELLOW arrow marking the R wave of the 5th
QRS complex — that occurs before the 5th heavy grid
line). This tells us that the R-R interval is a little less than
1 large box in duration — which means that the heart
rate isover 300/minute!
To Emphasize — AFlutter with 1:1 AV conduction is rare!
That said, especially when 1:1 AFlutter presents with a
ventricular rate as fast as we see in Figure-1 — this
constitutes a medical emergency in need of immediate
synchronized cardioversion.
To Also Emphasize — AVRT typically does not go as
fast as the rhythm in Figure-1. That said — it can on rare
occasions attain rates of ~300/minute (and up to
~320/minute in infants and young children) — especially
if conditions prompting extreme increases in
sympathetic tone are ongoing.
BOTTOM Line: I suspect the rhythm in Figure-1 is
AFlutter with 1:1 AV conduction. That said — I cannot rule
out an unusually fast AVRT.

interval is slightly less than 1 large box in duration — which
means that the heart rate is over 300/minute!

I Favor Atrial Flutterin Figure-1 …
In my experience — the most likely rhythm to produce a
regular SVT (SupraVentricular Tachycardia) in an adult at a
rate ≥300/minute is AFlutter with 1:1 AV conduction.
The usual atrial flutter rate range in adults in untreated
AFlutter is between250-350/minute(most commonly
very close to 300/minute). Because of an inherent
“protective” function of the AV node — 1:1 AV
conduction is rare. As a result, by far — the most
common response of the AV node is to only allow 1 out
of every 2 flutter impulses to conduct through the AV
node. This explains why the usual ventricular rate with
untreated AFlutter is close to 150/minute(300 ÷2 =
150/minute) — with the usual ventricular rate range in a
patient presenting with untreated AFlutter being
between ~130-to-170/minute.
NOTE: I unfortunately do not have specific follow-up to
the conclusion of this case — and therefore do not have
a definite answer as to whether the etiology of the
rhythm in Figure-1 is AFlutter with 1:1 AV conduction (as
I suspect) — or an exceedingly fast AVRT. My
comments below are based on my hunch that the
rhythm is 1:1 AFlutter.

When Might You See AFlutter with 1:1 AV
Conduction?
As stated above — AFlutter with 1:1 AV conduction is rare.
That said — it can occur — and when it does, it is almost

always in association with one or more of the following
circumstances (See Murthy et al — BMJ Case Rep, 2013):
The patient is on some kind of antiarrhythmicdrug
(most often, a Class IC agentsuch as flecainide or
propafenone). This is because these agents slow the
atrial rate of flutter — such that AFlutter at an atrial rate
of say, 220/minute (instead of 300/minute) may be slow
enough for the AV node to conduct 1:1 unless the patient
is also taking an AV nodal blocking agent.
KEY Point: Although taking a 1C agent is probably the
most common predisposing cause 1:1 AV conduction
with AFlutter — since these drugs slow the atrial rate of
flutter — 1:1 AV conduction will typically not present with
1:1 AFlutter at a ventricular rate as fast as in todayʼs
case! As a result — a patient on a 1C agent may be able
to tolerate 1:1 AFlutter for longer than if the flutter rate is
300/minute.
Other Conditions that may predispose to 1:1 AFlutter:
The patient may have an AP (Accessory Pathway) that
allows faster conduction of atrial impulses to the
ventricles.
Hyperthyroidism is associated with greatly increased
sympathetic activity that potentiates AV conduction (as
was seen in todayʼs case).
And, on rare occasions — exercise has been reported to
cause 1:1 AV conduction of AFlutter (due to both an
increased flutter cycle length of flutter waves, as well as
to enhanced AV conduction from the increase in
sympathetic activity). And while exercise alone is an
unlikely culprit — in combination with an antiarrythmic
drug, an accessory pathway and/or hyperthyroidism,
this could be enough to precipitate 1:1 AFlutter.
CAVEAT #1: While one or more of the predisposing factors
listed above will most often be associated with those rare
cases of 1:1 AFlutter that do occur — a case report by Murthy
et al (BMJ Case Rep, 2013) describes a 50-year old man
who presented with 1:1 AFlutter at the very rapid rate of
280/minute but without any predisposing conditions.
NOTE: While I did encounter occasional other case
reports of patients presenting with 1:1 AFlutter — most of
these were in patients taking Class I antiarrhythmics, in
whom the ventricular rate of AFlutter was usually
significantly slower than the rate of todayʼs patient.

CAVEAT #2: Be aware that when the ventricular rate of 1:1
AFlutter is very fast — that the QRS may widen as a result of
rate-related aberrant conduction. Snipes et al looked at 8
patients not on antiarrhythmics and without preexcitation —
who presented with 1:1 AFlutterdisguised by QRS widening
that understandably prompted a misdiagnosis of VT (J Innov
Card Rhythm Manag 15(10):6041-6046, 2024).
P.S.: Presumably the reason this study by Snipes et al
consisted of only 8 patients — is that AFlutter with 1:1
AV conduction is rare, so very difficult to find patients
to include in a study … That said — the “Take-Home”
Point of this small patient sample is to be aware that 1:1
AFlutter with rate-related aberrant conduction may
simulate VT (and probably does so more often than we
realize).
A Final Consideration in Todayʼs Case:
Todayʼs Patient was a previously healthy 39-year old man
who presented with 3 days of palpitations, including 2
syncopal episodes.
Itʼs important to be aware of the entity known as TCM
(Tachycardia-induced CardioMyopathy) — in which left
ventricular dysfunction may develop solely as a result of
a persistently increased heart rate.
In Huizar, Ellenbogen et alʼs review of this subject (
JACC 73:2328-2344, 2019) — they cite a highly
variable duration of tachycardia in patients who went on
to develop TCM, with a duration as short as3 days
being enough to result is depressed LV function.
The “good news” — is that many (most) patients with
TCM recover LV function once the tachycardia is
controlled (usually within 1-3 months) — with this
providing proof that the persistent rapid heart rate was
in fact the cause of the patientʼs cardiomyopathy.
Regarding todayʼs patient, given the duration of
symptoms prior to presenting in the ED ( = 3 days of
palpitations, including 2 syncopal episodes) —
assessment of LV function will be an essential part of
management.

Learning Points:
It is rare to see a regular SVT(ie, narrow-complex
tachycardia) at a rate of ≥280/minute in an adult. That

said, as shown in todayʼs case — this phenomenon does
occur, especially if there is predisposition to such rapid
rates because of hyperthyroidism, an accessory
pathway, excessive sympathetic tone.
Clear sign of atrial activity will usually not be seen in
SVT rhythms at this fast of a rate — and if present, it will
usually not be diagnostic (as in todayʼs tracing). In these
cases — the rhythm diagnosis is between AFlutter with
1:1 AV conduction vsAVRT.
Distinction between 1:1 AFlutter vs AVRT is not critical to
initial management — since both rhythms respond to
immediate cardioversion, which will often be the
treatment of choice.
Adenosine would be expected to convert AVRT —
whereas it is unlikely to convert 1:1 AFlutter. However, it
may slow conduction of impulses through the AV node
with AFlutter — resulting in a short-lived reduction in
heart rate that might help diagnostically by revealing
underlying flutter waves. Whether the provider will be
comfortable administering IV Adenosine to a patient in a
regular SVT rhythm at extreme rates (ie, >280/minute) is
something for which, “Ya gotta be there”.
Definitive care depends on whether a treatable cause of
the rhythm is found (ie, hyperthyroidism) — and if not,
refer for EP testing and probable ablation.
