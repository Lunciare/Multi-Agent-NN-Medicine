A woman in her 60s with
chest pain and “No STEMI”
Sent by anonymous.
A woman in her 60s presented with acute chest pain and
normal vital signs. Here is her triage ECG:
What do you think?
It shows diagnostic findings of acute LAD occlusion, including
the precordial swirl pattern (inappropriate STE and HATWs in
V1-V2/V3, and reciprocal STD in V5-V6).
Smith: there are hyperacute T-waves in V2-3, down-up T-
waves in III, aVF, and V6. There are all highly specific for LAD
Occlusion MI (OMI).
Read more about precordial swirl pattern in our publication
and this blog post:

Sadly it was interpreted as “No STEMI”, which is the extent of
normal ECG teaching and performance in most clinical
practice.

The physician decided to order labs including a troponin
before any significant action.
The initial troponin was 48 ng/L. This triggered a repeat ECG,
1.5 hours after first:
This was interpreted as “STEMI”, so the cath lab was
activated.

The mid LAD Occlusion was opened.
Repeat troponins rose to >25,000 ng/L (too high to measure
— it could have been over 100,000 ng/L)
A repeat ECG was obtained hours after cath:
The formal echocardiogram showed:
The left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced with
LVEF of 40%
(+/-5%) by 3D. There is severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the
mid to apical anteroseptal and inferoseptal wall. There is
severe hypokinesis of the apical inferior, apical anterior, and
apical wall.
I think that this patientʼs long term outcome would be better if
they had been recognized and treated 1.5 hours earlier.
Smith:
Remember this graph: By 4 hours after onset of chest pain,
80% of the benefit of reperfusion is lost!!
Pendell will present an abstract at ACC meeting in New
Orleans. In it, 380 (19%) of 2000 cath lab activations had an
initial “non-diagnostic” ECG. The mean delay between that
initial non-diagnostic ECG and the subsequent “STEMI” ECG
was 74 minutes. On 297 (78%) of those 380 Non-diagnostic
ECG, the Queen of Hearts was able to detect OMI an
average of 68 minutes prior to the STEMI ECG. Mortality in
these patients was 9.4%.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(1/15/2026):
The important point to learn from todayʼs case is simple:
When at all uncertain as to whether a patient with new CP
(Chest Pain) is in the midst of an ongoing acute cardiac event
— Repeat the ECG within 15-20 minutes! Although possible
that no significant change will be observed when the initial
ECG is repeated within this brief 15-to-20 minute period of
time — We have illustrated numerous examples on Dr. Smithʼs
ECG Blog in which dramatic ST-T wave evolution will be seen
within a surprisingly short period of time! (See My Comment
in theDecember 7, 2025 post — and theJuly 9, 2025 post,
among many others).
And if CP persists despite the lack of significant change
on a repeat ECG done 15-to-20 minutes after the initial
tracing — Repeat the ECG one more time within
another 15-to-20 minutes. If your patientʼs CP is from
acute ischemia — there is an excellent chance that your
repeat ECG(s) will now show some “dynamic” ST-T
wave changes that allow you to make a definitive
diagnosis.
The reason for expediting assessment (and cath with
PCI when indicated) — is simple = “Time is Muscle
(myocardium)”. As emphasized in the October 23, 2025
post(and in the graph Dr. Smith added above) — The
most benefit from reperfusion occurs within the first 4
hours(Every 2-hour delay results in 60% more
myocardium infarcted).

Was the Initial ECG Diagnostic?
Looking closely at todayʼs initial ECG(that Iʼve labeled in
Figure-1) — this tracing is already diagnostic, with no need to
wait for Troponin or a repeat tracing before activating the
cath lab.
The rhythm is sinus — with normal intervals and axis,
and no chamber enlargement.
My “eye” was immediately drawn to anterior leads
V1,V2,V3 (within the RED rectangle in Figure-1).
Considering small size of the QRS in these leads — the
associated ST-T waves are clearly not “normal”
The ST-T wave in lead V1 is definitely abnormal, in
that there is more ST elevation than should be seen
in this lead when the ECG shows no LVH and no
QRS widening — plus the shape of the ST segment
in lead V1 is abnormally coved, and ends with
abnormal T wave inversion.
In leads V2,V3 — the QRS is tiny! As a result — the
ST-T waves in these leads are clearly
disproportionate(fatter-at-peak and wider-at-
base than should be given these tiny QRS
complexes).
Assessing the T wave in lead V4 is more
challenging — but by the concept of neighboring
leads(ie, the definite hyperacute T waves in leads
V2,V3) — the T wave in lead V4 is “bulkier” than it
should be.
ST-T wave changes in the remaining leads are
more subtle — but given hyperacute ST-T waves
in leads V1-V4 in this patient with new CP — I
interpreted the ST segments in leads I,II,III,aVF;
and V5,V6 as definitely flattened (and the slight ST
depression we see in lead V6 in association with
anterior lead findings suggests “Precordial Swirl”
— as per the multiple examples provided by Drs.
Meyers and Smith, and My Comment at the bottom
of the page in theOctober 15, 2022 post).
= = =
When the ECG was Finally Repeated …
The bottom tracing in Figure-1 shows obvious evolution of
this acute STEMI. But the point is that much of the potential
benefit from reperfusion has already been lost by this 1.5
hour delay that did not have to be.

PEARL: If you had difficulty appreciatiating the
hyperacute ST-T waves in each of the leads that I
highlight above in ECG #1(ie, in leads V1,V2,V3 and V4)
— Compare the 2 tracings in Figure-1.Going back over
the initial ECG once you see how serial tracings evolve
— is the BEST way to improve your ability to instantly
detect subtle-but-definitely-present ST-T wave changes
in your patientʼs initial ECG!
