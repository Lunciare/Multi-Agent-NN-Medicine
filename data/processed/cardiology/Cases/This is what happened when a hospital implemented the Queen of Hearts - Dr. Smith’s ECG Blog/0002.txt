Case Summary

ST elevation suggestive of RV MI Immediate post-PCI ECG showed larger T waves in V2–V3, consistent with posterior reperfusion T waves Reperfusion in posterior myocardium produces anterior T-wave augmentation (inversion posteriorly appears as increased anterior T-wave amplitude) These are not hyperacute T waves, which occur during active occlusion ECG at ~90 minutes post-PCI showed continued recovery with normalization of ST segments Median-beat overlays across ECGs highlighted resolution of ST depression and posterior reperfusion T waves Expert Interpretation (Key ECG Pearls) Posterior OMI often presents with anterior ST depression rather than classic ST elevation Lead V3 is critical: instead of normal slight upsloping ST elevation, ST straightening/depression is abnormal and concerning Lead placement issues (e.g., V1–V2 placed too high) can complicate interpretation but did not obscure diagnosis here Subtle lateral changes (e.g., in V6) can support posterior OMI when paired with anterior ST depression Clinical Impact Prompt AI recognition enabled rapid reperfusion, likely improving myocardial salvage Demonstrates the value of AI-assisted ECG analysis in accelerating diagnosis of OMI without STEMI criteria Highlights that posterior OMI can be missed without careful ECG analysis or advanced tools Key Learning Points Posterior OMI may present with ST depression in V1–V4 and subtle lateral changes
