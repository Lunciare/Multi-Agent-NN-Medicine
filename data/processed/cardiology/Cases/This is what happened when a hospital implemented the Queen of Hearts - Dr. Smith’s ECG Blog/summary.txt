A patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain that began ~24 hours prior to arrival. An ECG was obtained immediately at triage. At this hospital, the Queen of Hearts (QOH) AI system is routinely used to determine cath lab activation. Initial ECG Findings The triage ECG demonstrated: ST depression maximal in V1–V4, diagnostic of posterior OMI Subtle ST elevation and mildly hyperacute T wave in V6, consistent with lateral/posterior involvement (V6 is anatomically close to posterior leads) These findings are not de Winter T waves (which indicate LAD occlusion with depressed ST takeoff and hyperacute T waves) QOH analyzed the ECG and diagnosed OMI with high confidence, triggering automatic cath lab activation without physician delay.
