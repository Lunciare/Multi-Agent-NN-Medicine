A patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain that began ~24 hours prior to arrival. An ECG was obtained immediately at triage. At this hospital, the Queen of Hearts (QOH) AI system is routinely used to determine cath lab activation. Initial ECG Findings The triage ECG demonstrated: ST depression maximal in V1–V4, diagnostic of posterior OMI Subtle ST elevation and mildly hyperacute T wave in V6, consistent with lateral/posterior involvement (V6 is anatomically close to posterior leads) These findings are not de Winter T waves (which indicate LAD occlusion with depressed ST takeoff and hyperacute T waves) QOH analyzed the ECG and diagnosed OMI with high confidence, triggering automatic cath lab activation without physician delay. Intervention and Outcomes Door-to-balloon time was extremely short 100% circumflex artery occlusion was identified and opened with stenting High-sensitivity troponin T later returned at 1400 ng/L This case illustrates that AI-based ECG interpretation diagnosed OMI faster than troponin Additional ECGs and Evolution Right-sided ECG (V3R–V6R) showed ST depression (expected opposite posterior wall); no ST elevation suggestive of RV MI Immediate post-PCI ECG showed larger T waves in V2–V3, consistent with posterior reperfusion T waves Reperfusion in posterior myocardium produces anterior T-wave augmentation (inversion
