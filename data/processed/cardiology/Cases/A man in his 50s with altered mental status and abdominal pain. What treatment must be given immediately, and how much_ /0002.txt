A man in his 50s with altered mental status and abdominal pain. What treatment must be given immediately, and how much?

the first! 2 gm calcium gluconate was not enough. This was realized, and next 6 more gm of calcium gluconate were given. Here is the ECG shortly after that: As hoped, the QRS has improved somewhat, the rate has increased, and P waves have become more clear. The patient underwent dialysis and a repeat EKG was obtained: The QRS has narrowed. There is likely underlying LVH, maybe also LAFB. The most concerning hyperkalemic findings have resolved. The patient did well. See this case of cardiac arrest from HyperK, in which Pendell gave 13 g of calcium chloride (= 39 g of calcium gluconate). See this case of Ventricular Tachycardia from Hyperkalemia which required 15 grams of Ca Gluconate for Stabilization. In this case, the providers thought that 1 g of calcium gluconate had fixed the hyperK. But what really happened? Tachycardia and hyperkalemia. What will happen after therapy with 1 gram of Ca gluconate and some bicarbonate? General hyperkalemia cases (cardiology-relevant): * A 50s year old man with lightheadedness and bradycardia * Patient with dyspnea; triage ECG interpreted as “normal” * Severe shock, obtunded, and a diagnostic prehospital ECG * A woman with near-syncope, bradycardia, and hypotension * What happens
