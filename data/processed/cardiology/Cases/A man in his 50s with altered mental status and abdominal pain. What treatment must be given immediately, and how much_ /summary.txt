A 50-year-old male with PMH of ESRD, heart failure, pancreatitis and previous MI presents to the ED with chief complaint of epigastric pain. He was described as “altered” with limited history able to be obtained due to mental status on arrival. Here is his triage ECG: What are your initial thoughts? – This EKG looks sinusoidal and highly concerning for hyperkalemia – Wide complex – Rate too slow to be Vtach. Patient then divulges that he has not been dialyzed in 5 days, hyperkalemic treatment started with albuterol, insulin, dextrose, lokelma and only 2g calcium gluconate. (Meyers note: this is a common and important initial mistake, 2g calcium gluconate is not nearly enough for this peri-arrest hyperkalemia).
