Case Summary

A man in his 60s with hypertension and prior stroke presented with 3 days of crushing substernal chest pain, radiating to the right arm. He reported intermittent chest pain for months, but never this severe or prolonged. Based on symptoms alone, acute OMI was highly likely even before ECG review. ECG Interpretation — Rhythm First The initial ECG showed multiple QRS morphologies, indicating more than one rhythm mechanism. Key rhythm findings (best seen after reformatting ECG into 12-channel rhythm): Narrow QRS beats (beats 4–5) True natively conducted beats Preceded by P waves inverted in inferior leads → low atrial rhythm These beats are the most reliable for ischemia assessment Wide, regular beats (beats 1–2, 7–10) Uniform morphology, ~120 ms QRS Rate ~80–100 bpm Consistent with AIVR (Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm) Typical reperfusion arrhythmia Fusion beats (beats 3 and 6) Intermediate morphology between narrow and wide beats Occur when sinus impulse partially conducts into ventricle already depolarized by AIVR Atrial activity without conduction Atrial impulses sometimes blocked because ventricular depolarization occurred first Not retrograde conduction (variable RP intervals) Conclusion (rhythm): Reperfused OMI with AIVR + low atrial rhythm + fusion beats, consistent with acute ischemia followed by partial reperfusion.
