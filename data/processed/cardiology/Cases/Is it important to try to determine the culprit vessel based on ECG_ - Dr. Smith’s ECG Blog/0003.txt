LAD and diagonal branches Culprit RCA not treated Patient had persistent chest pain overnight Second Angiography (next day, different operator): RCA recognized as acute thrombotic occlusion Three overlapping stents placed Culprit finally treated Core Lessons 1. ECG Can Identify the Culprit Vessel This ECG correctly localized the infarct to the RCA Angiography misidentified the culprit vessel 2. Wrong-Vessel PCI Is Common ~27% of NSTEMIs receive PCI to uninvolved arteries ~46% have either: Wrong infarct-related artery treated, or No ischemic diagnosis at all 3. “CTO” on Angiography ≠ Chronic ECG evidence + symptoms must override cath labels 4. Chest Pain Is Binary in OMI “Almost resolved” = ongoing infarction Refractory pain means immediate cath, regardless of timing or logistics 5. AIVR Is a Reperfusion Marker Presence of AIVR strongly suggests: Recent reperfusion Recently occluded artery It does not mean the problem is over Key Takeaways for Practice Always integrate ECG + symptoms, not cath alone Identify the culprit vessel on ECG whenever possible Use narrow conducted beats to assess ischemia AIVR + fusion beats in chest pain = recent OMI Delayed or wrong-vessel PCI leads to avoidable myocardial loss
