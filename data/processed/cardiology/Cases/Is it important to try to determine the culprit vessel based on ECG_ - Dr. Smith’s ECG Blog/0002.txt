Case Summary

Not retrograde conduction (variable RP intervals) Conclusion (rhythm): Reperfused OMI with AIVR + low atrial rhythm + fusion beats, consistent with acute ischemia followed by partial reperfusion. ECG Interpretation — Ischemia Focusing on the narrow conducted beats (4–5): Inferior leads (II, III, aVF): T-wave inversion → inferior infarction V2–V3: Overly upright T waves → posterior reperfusion I / aVL: Upright T waves where inversion would be expected with LVH strain → reciprocal reperfusion pattern Diagnosis from ECG: Reperfused inferoposterior OMI, most consistent with RCA occlusion. Clinical Course and System Failure Patient presented to a hospital without cath lab coverage over the weekend Chest pain documented as “almost resolved” In OMI, this means NOT resolved Managed medically (ASA, clopidogrel, heparin), cath deferred to Monday hs-troponin extremely elevated (>14,000 ng/L) Echo: inferior wall hypokinesis On Sunday: Patient developed dyspnea and exertional angina Repeat ECG showed: Persistent inferior/posterior reperfusion Subtle coving in III and aVF → ongoing ischemia Cath Lab Errors First Angiography: RCA described as “chronic total occlusion (CTO)” PCI performed to LAD and diagonal branches Culprit RCA not treated Patient had persistent chest pain overnight Second Angiography (next day, different operator): RCA recognized as acute thrombotic occlusion Three overlapping stents placed
