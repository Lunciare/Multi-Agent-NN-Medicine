A man in his 40s called emergency medical services for acute symptoms including chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.

the most likely explanations are artifact or hyperkalemia. In this case, hyperkalemia was the cause of marked QRS widening with absence of atrial activity. There is no need to verify serum potassium levels before administering empiric intravenous calcium when the ECG is diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. ECG findings of severe hyperkalemia include: Marked QRS widening Absent P waves Tall, peaked, symmetric T waves with narrow bases Occasionally inverted peaked T waves Brugada phenocopy patterns Selected patients may remain alert and hemodynamically stable despite critically elevated serum potassium levels. Comparison with a baseline ECG recorded during normal potassium levels highlights the dramatic ECG changes caused by hyperkalemia.
