An EMS ECG was obtained. Initial ECG Interpretation Critical hyperkalemia with a sine wave appearance. The ECG machine produced a false positive “STEMI” alert. The Queen of Hearts model did not identify this ECG as STEMI. Prehospital Management and Repeat ECG Paramedics administered 2 grams of calcium gluconate and continuous albuterol nebulization. A repeat ECG showed improvement in QRS width and morphology, though additional improvement was anticipated with further calcium administration.
