the cath lab?
Steve Smith onDecember 7, 2025
Chest pain, resolved.
Reperfusion T-waves.
Should the patient go
emergently to the cath lab?
Written by Emily Dawra, one of our superb EM G3 residents,
with a few edits by Smith.
Case: A patient presented to the emergency department from
 
a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having
stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for
nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and
told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he
waited until his convenient appointment with his primary
doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed
the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he
recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the
ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.
Here is that clinic ECG, recorded while pain-free:

What do you think?
This is diagnostic of acute vs. subacute OMI, almost certainly
reperfused. There is inferior ST elevation (II, III, aVF)
and anterior precordial ST depression (V2, V3), diagnostic of
inferior-posterior occlusive event. But also note the T-wave
inversions inferiorly, which strongly suggest some element
of reperfusion, especially in the context of resolved chest
pain (pain free). There are also well-formed Q-waves that
suggest that the infarct was subacute (several hours old) at
the time it reperfused.

Smith: I am surprised that she does not say “Repefused OMI”.
The cardiology fellow was in the ED by the time Dr. Smith
arrived; he looked at the ECG and said “This is a reperfused
OMI. The patient should go to the cath lab now because he
is at very high risk of re-occlusion at any moment.”
The fellow talked with the interventionalist, who said: “This is
an NSTEMI and the patient can wait for intervention.”
At this moment, while the patient was still completely pain
free, we recorded another ECG:
Now there is significant worsening of ST elevation inferiorly
and of the ST depression in the precordial leads. Accordingly,
there is increased reciprocal ST depression in aVL. This is
now clearly a hyperacute Occlusion MI.
The artery is actively re-occluding without any pain!
5 minutes later we record a right sided ECG:

Limb leads are not placed differently in a right sided ECG
(only precordial leads are reversed). The limb leads now show
pseudonormalization of the inferior T-waves [re-occlusion
results in the previously inverted reperfusion T-waves
becoming upright (“pseudonormalizing”)].
V4-6 are now V4R, V5R, V6R on the right chest.
Comment on right sided ECGs: all leads for Right sided ECG
are reversed: [V1 = V2R to the right of the sternum; V2 = V2R
to the left of the sternum, etc.] Q-waves are normal in right
chest leads because they are opposite of the electrically
dominant LV. Note the slight ST elevation in V4R, V5R, and
V6R highly suggestive of RV infarction.

Grauer: Did YOU recognize the “technical
misadventure” in the recording of the right-sided ECG?
(Please check out Figures-2, -3, and -4 in my
ADDENDUM at the bottom of My Comment below for
illustration of what happened! ).

With the progression of ECG changes and concerning
history, even without chest pain at this moment, patient was
fortunately taken to the catheterization lab.
Angiogram:
90% distal LM
90% ostial proximal LAD
Subtotal occlusion of LADD1 and LADD2
Subtotal occlusion of OM-1
70-80% mid and distal RCA
OM-1 was the probable culprit. Since the proximal RCA was
not involved, the ST Elevation in right leads is probably a false
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/chest-pain-resolved-reperfusion-t-waves-should-the-patient-go-emergently-to-the-cath-lab/ 4/16
positive.
Echo:
Estimated LV ejection fraction lower limits of normal-51%.
Regional wall motion abnormalities : mid-apical inferior and
inferior. Septal walls are dyskinetic, and likely aneurysmal.
Normal right ventricular size and function. (This verifies that
RV MI is very unlikely).
Management
Due to severe multi-vessel disease including proximal LAD. A
temporizing intra-aortic balloon pump was placed while a
CABG was planned for the next day to augment coronary
perfusion pressure and allow for safer induction of anesthesia
the next day.
No percutaneous intervention was done on the OM1 culprit.
We see this frequently: when the patient needs CABG, no
intervention is done on the culprit, even if there is poor flow.
Iʼm not sure why this is.
First hs troponin I returned at 3443 ng/L. Next trop was not
measured until 6 hours later and was 2987 ng/L. I suspect it
rose a bit and then fell, the peak occurring sometime in the
interval.
EmilyʼsReminders & Take-Aways:
Do not let the resolution of chest pain alone dissuade
you from activating Cath Lab–the ECG is
crucial! Especially when ECG is concerning or prior
history is highly suggestive of coronary occlusion.
Itʼs estimated that over 20% of heart attacks are silent
[1]. Although a “silent MI” is one that is not discovered
until a later physician visit, it highlights the fact that
cardiac ischemia can be completely asymptomatic.
