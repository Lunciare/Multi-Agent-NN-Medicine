Chest pain, resolved.
Reperfusion T-waves.
Should the patient go
emergently to the cath lab?
Written by Emily Dawra, one of our superb EM G3 residents,
with a few edits by Smith.
Case: A patient presented to the emergency department from
 
a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having
stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for
nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and
told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he
waited until his convenient appointment with his primary
doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed
the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he
recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the
ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.
Here is that clinic ECG, recorded while pain-free:

What do you think?
This is diagnostic of acute vs. subacute OMI, almost certainly
reperfused. There is inferior ST elevation (II, III, aVF)
and anterior precordial ST depression (V2, V3), diagnostic of
inferior-posterior occlusive event. But also note the T-wave
inversions inferiorly, which strongly suggest some element
of reperfusion, especially in the context of resolved chest
pain (pain free). There are also well-formed Q-waves that
suggest that the infarct was subacute (several hours old) at
the time it reperfused.
Here is the PMCardio Queen of Hearts interpretation:

Smith: I am surprised that she does not say “Repefused OMI”.
The cardiology fellow was in the ED by the time Dr. Smith
arrived; he looked at the ECG and said “This is a reperfused
OMI. The patient should go to the cath lab now because he
is at very high risk of re-occlusion at any moment.”
The fellow talked with the interventionalist, who said: “This is
an NSTEMI and the patient can wait for intervention.”
At this moment, while the patient was still completely pain
free, we recorded another ECG:
Now there is significant worsening of ST elevation inferiorly
and of the ST depression in the precordial leads. Accordingly,
there is increased reciprocal ST depression in aVL. This is
now clearly a hyperacute Occlusion MI.
The artery is actively re-occluding without any pain!
5 minutes later we record a right sided ECG:

Limb leads are not placed differently in a right sided ECG
(only precordial leads are reversed). The limb leads now show
pseudonormalization of the inferior T-waves [re-occlusion
results in the previously inverted reperfusion T-waves
becoming upright (“pseudonormalizing”)].
V4-6 are now V4R, V5R, V6R on the right chest.
Comment on right sided ECGs: all leads for Right sided ECG
are reversed: [V1 = V2R to the right of the sternum; V2 = V2R
to the left of the sternum, etc.] Q-waves are normal in right
chest leads because they are opposite of the electrically
dominant LV. Note the slight ST elevation in V4R, V5R, and
V6R highly suggestive of RV infarction.

Grauer: Did YOU recognize the “technical
misadventure” in the recording of the right-sided ECG?
(Please check out Figures-2, -3, and -4 in my
ADDENDUM at the bottom of My Comment below for
illustration of what happened! ).

With the progression of ECG changes and concerning
history, even without chest pain at this moment, patient was
fortunately taken to the catheterization lab.
Angiogram:
90% distal LM
90% ostial proximal LAD
Subtotal occlusion of LADD1 and LADD2
Subtotal occlusion of OM-1
70-80% mid and distal RCA
OM-1 was the probable culprit. Since the proximal RCA was
not involved, the ST Elevation in right leads is probably a false

positive.
Echo:
Estimated LV ejection fraction lower limits of normal-51%.
Regional wall motion abnormalities : mid-apical inferior and
inferior. Septal walls are dyskinetic, and likely aneurysmal.
Normal right ventricular size and function. (This verifies that
RV MI is very unlikely).
Management
Due to severe multi-vessel disease including proximal LAD. A
temporizing intra-aortic balloon pump was placed while a
CABG was planned for the next day to augment coronary
perfusion pressure and allow for safer induction of anesthesia
the next day.
No percutaneous intervention was done on the OM1 culprit.
We see this frequently: when the patient needs CABG, no
intervention is done on the culprit, even if there is poor flow.
Iʼm not sure why this is.
First hs troponin I returned at 3443 ng/L. Next trop was not
measured until 6 hours later and was 2987 ng/L. I suspect it
rose a bit and then fell, the peak occurring sometime in the
interval.
EmilyʼsReminders & Take-Aways:
Do not let the resolution of chest pain alone dissuade
you from activating Cath Lab–the ECG is
crucial! Especially when ECG is concerning or prior
history is highly suggestive of coronary occlusion.
Itʼs estimated that over 20% of heart attacks are silent
[1]. Although a “silent MI” is one that is not discovered
until a later physician visit, it highlights the fact that
cardiac ischemia can be completely asymptomatic.
Waiting for a patient to tell you about their recurrence
of chest pain is dangerous.
Repeat ECGs save lives!
Queen of Hearts can differentiate active acute
occlusive myocardial infarctions from reperfused OMI.

1. Any patient with OMI that is reperfused can have re-
occlusion at any time.
2. Re-occlusion is not always accompanied by chest pain
3. These patients, in my opinion, should go for emergent
angiogram. They are “Transient STEMI” or “Transient
OMI“
4. Transient STEMI was studied by Lemkes, randomizing to
emergent vs. delayed intervention. Mortality was the
same, but many patients in the delayed group had re-
occlusion and needed to go the the cath lab emergently
in the middle of the night.
5. See these cases to illustrate that, if you do not go
emergently, the patient may re-occlude painlessly. You
should therefore use continuous ST segment monitoring.
See this case: Why we need continuous 12-lead ST
segment monitoring in Wellensʼ syndrome. Here is the
initial ECG of this case, recorded after resolution of
prehospital chest pain:

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/7/2025):
Dr. Smith asks the important question in todayʼs case as to
whether emergent cardiac catheterization is needed in a
patient who has just had an MI — but who is now pain-free
and showing reperfusion T waves on ECG?
= = =
How Do You Know?

How do you know if the MI that this patient has just had is
“complete” — or, was momentarily complete, but is now
ongoing?
The simple answer to the above question is, You donʼt
know … which fortunately in todayʼs case was quickly
addressed by repeating the ECG immediately after
contacting a naysaying consultant.
But what if the repeat ECG failed to show any change?
The answer is that we simply donʼt know if or when a
recent OMI may spontaneously reocclude …
An important hint in todayʼs history that this acute MI
might still be ongoing — is that this patientʼs symptoms
have been “stuttering”over the past 2 days. This is
because a common reason for “stuttering symptoms”
are ongoing episodes of spontaneous reperfusion that
are punctuated by episodes of transient spontaneous
reocclusion. Eventually, the final state of the “culprit”
artery will be reached — but we have no idea if this final
state will be a patent or totally occluded “culprit” artery.
= = =
What Do Todayʼs ECGs Show?
For clarity and ease of comparison in Figure-1 — Iʼve put the
initial ECG and the repeat ECG together.
ECG #1 — shows sinus rhythm with obvious indication of
inferior MI. Each of the 3 inferior leads (II,III,aVF) show
large Q waves, but with residual ST elevation — and with
terminal T wave inversion in leads III and aVF(BLUE
arrows in Figure-1).
Confirmation of infarction is forthcoming from the ST
segment flattening with slight ST depression in lead aVL
— with terminal T wave positivity (nearly the mirror-
image opposite picture in lead aVL of the ST-T wave in
lead III).
The taller-than-expected T wave in lead V2, and ever-
so-slight ST depression in this lead are consistent with
posterior MI. As is the case for the 3 limb lead BLUE
arrows — this further supports the impression of infero-
posteroOMI, now with reperfusion T waves.
= = =
PEARL: Note that despite evidence of posterior OMI —
the ST segment in lead V1 is not at all depressed. This
suggests that “something else” must be attenuating the
amount of ST depression that we would normally expect
to see in lead V1 as a result of posterior OMI — with this
“something else” most likely being acute RV MI (which

in association with acute/recent inferior MI, strongly
suggests the proximal RCAas the “culprit” artery).
NOTE: The other possibility for explaining the
unanticipated straightening of the ST segment in lead V1
— could be that there is multi-vessel disease with
difficult-to-predict collateralization patterns (which we
would only be able to verify via cardiac cath) — and
which cardiac cath on this patient subsequently showed!
= = =
Figure-1: Comparison between the first 2 ECGs in todayʼs
case.
= = =
What Does ECG #2 Show?
Lead-by-lead comparison in Figure-1 between the repeat
ECG and the initial ECG, shows that within the space of a few
minutes — there have been “dynamic“ ST-T wave changes.
The heart rate is faster.
ST elevation is greater in each of the inferior leads. The
ST-T waves in leads III and aVF are now hyperacute!
Reciprocal ST depression is much more prominent in
high-lateral leads I and aVL.
There has been a dramatic change in shape and
increase in the amount of ST segment depression in
leads V2,V3,V4.

Bottom Line: It is likely that the “culprit” artery had
spontaneously reopened at the time ECG #1 was
recorded — but has now spontaneously reclosed. This
patientʼs infero-postero MI is ongoing! It is because
there is no way to accurately predict if or when
spontaneous reclosure might occur — that optimal
management of acute OMI most often entails prompt
cardiac cath with PCI, even if the patient has become
pain-free and reperfusion T waves have developed.

ADDENDUM 12/8/2025 :
* ( )
The 3rd ECG recorded in todayʼs case (shown above in Dr.
Smithʼs discussion) — was with right-sided leads. In Figure-2
below — Iʼve put this 3rd ECG together with ECG #2 to
facilitate assessment of these right-sided leads, which are
used to determine if there is also RV infarction.
QUESTION — Did you see the “technical misadventure”
that occurred with the recording of the right-sided leads
in Figure-2?

ANSWER:
Limb leads should not be switched when recording a right-
sided ECG! (Only the chest leads are reversed).
Note in Figure-2 — that the limb leads look very
different in ECG #3 compared to how they looked in ECG
#2(ie, Lead I shows an all-negative QRS in ECG #3 —
and an all-positive QRS in lead aVR!). This is because in
addition to reversing the chest leads — the technician
mistakenly also switched the LA and RA electrodes!
ECG #3 was recorded 5 minutes after ECG #2. The
reason the LA and RA electrodes should not be switched
when recording right-sided leads — is that we still want
to be able to compare the limb leads with this ECG done
5 minutes later.
= = =
In Figures-3 and -4 below — I correct for the LA-RA reversal
that was mistakenly done when the technician recorded right-
sided leads. I then compare ECG #2 with what the right-sided
ECG should have looked like.
= = =
Figure-3: I show the effect of LA-RA lead reversal on the limb
leads — and correct for this in ECG #3b.

Figure-4: What comparison between ECG #2 and a right-
sided ECG should have looked like if the LA and RA
electrodes were not switched.
The right-sided ECG in todayʼs case was recorded ~5
minutes after ECG #2. After correcting for LA-RA
reversal — we can see that there has essentially been no
change during these 5 minutes in the appearance of the
limb leads.
As noted above in Dr. Smithʼs discussion — right-sided
leads do show slight ST elevation in leads V4R,V5R and
V6R — but given cath and Echo findings, OM-1 was the
probable “culprit” artery in todayʼs case (and this right-
sided ST elevation is most probably a false positive).
