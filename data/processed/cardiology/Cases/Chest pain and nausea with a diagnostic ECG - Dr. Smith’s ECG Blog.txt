Chest pain and nausea with
a diagnostic ECG
Written by Pendell Meyers, sent by anonymous
A man in his 40s called EMS for acute symptoms including
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.
Here is his EMS ECG:

What do you think?
Critical hyperkalemia, with sine wave appearance. Please try
to ignore the Zoll machineʼs “***STEMI***”!

Paramedics administered 2gm calcium gluconate and
continuous albuterol nebulizer, followed by this repeat ECG:
Much improvement in width and morphology, but still more
improvement could likely be achieved with more calcium.
On arrival to the ED, the bedside venous blood gas revealed a
potassium level of 9.1 mEq/L.
An old ECG from weeks ago was available for comparison:
The patient had missed dialysis, complicated by a
dysfunctional AV graft.
More calcium was administered, as well as insulin and
glucose.

An emergent dialysis access catheter was placed, and
dialysis was successful. The patient survived.
======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(7/14/2025):
A good general rule is that IF a patient presents with stable
vital signs and an ECG that looks, “too wide (and/or too
unreal) to be true” — that the reason for this appearance is
likely to be either: i) Artifact; or, ii) Hyperkalemia.
In todayʼs case — the paramedics presumably knew the
ECG was correctly recorded (and/or perhaps they were
able to elicit some history from the patient predisposing
to renal insufficiency). This left hyperkalemia as the
most likely explanation for todayʼs initial ECG (that Iʼve
reproduced in Figure-1).
Of the 12 leads in ECG #1 — it is lead V4 (within the RED
rectangle in ECG #1) that caught my attention as looking
“real”, albeit with a dramatically widened QRS complex.
NOTE: ECG #1 is a prehospital tracing. In the United
States (? in other countries) — many of the prehospital
ECG machines automatically “cut off” QRS R wave or S
wave amplitude that exceeds 10 or more millimeters —
which accounts for the straight line appearance in those
leads to which I added YELLOW arrows.
PEARL #1: Be aware that selected patients may manifest
surprisingly normal vital signs and alertness despite
potentially lethal serum K+ levels (such as the 9.1 mEq/L
venous level for the patient in todayʼs case).
The EMS Team correctly suspected severe
hyperkalemia in ECG #1 as the cause of marked QRS
widening without sign of atrial activity (and as a result —
they correctly administered empiriccalcium gluconate
IV).

To Emphasize (As per Dr. Meyers) — there is no need to
verify a low serum level of K+ before giving empiric IV
Calcium when the tracing in front of you resembles the
initial EMS ECG in todayʼs case. This ECG is diagnostic
of critically elevated serum K+, with need for immediate
treatment (and there is no downside to giving empiric IV
Calcium in this situation).
For review of the ECG findings of Hyperkalemia — Check out
My Comment at the bottom of the page in the January 26,
2020 post in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog. Many of these findings
are seen in ECG #2 (with these findings still present after 2
gm of IV Calcium Gluconate + continuous Albuterol
nebulizer). These ECG findings include:
Marked QRS widening (to ≥0.14 second in ECG #2).
Absent P waves
Tall, peaked and pointed T waves in multiple leads (RED
arrows in ECG #2 — that highlight an “Eiffel Tower-like”
T wave appearance, in which these symmetric, tall
pointed T waves manifest a surprisingly narrow base).
Occasional pointed T waves that are negative (BLUE
arrows in ECG #2).
Brugada Phenocopy (See My Comment at the bottom of
the page in the January 13, 2025 post).
Appreciation for the ECG changes of marked hyperkalemia
that we see in ECG #1 and ECG #2 — become readily
apparent when we compare these tracings to ECG #3, which
is a baseline tracing from todayʼs patient, recorded when
serum K+ was normal.

Figure-1: To facilitate comparison — Iʼve reproduced the first 3 tracings in
todayʼs case.
