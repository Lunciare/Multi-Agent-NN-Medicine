Can you guess the
diagnosis?
 
I was sent this ECG by a former colleague without clinical
context and asked for an interpretation. Interpreting ECGs
without clinical context should be avoided when it comes to
actual clinical desicion making but it can be a fun exercise
and a good way to learn pattern recognition.
Without the benefit of clinical information how would you
describe this ECG? If any, what are the features that concerns
you?
ECG #1
The ECG shows sinus rhythm at just above 90 beats per
minute. The QRS is narrow. Of note are T wave inversions in
leads V1-V3. QRS voltage is on the low side. Lead III in

addition to miniscule q waves also has T wave inversions.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 1/18
Smith: There is T-wave inversion in V1-V3, and T-wave
inversion in lead III (and S1Q3T3). When the differential is ACS
vs. PE, and there is T-wave inversion in precordial leads, the
presence of T-wave inversion in lead III has an EXTREMELY
high Likelihood ratio for PE.
My response was:
“
“Perhaps not diagnostic, but need to rule
out right heart strain.”
Here is some clinical correlation; The patient is a 75-year-old
overweight female who had experienced subacute shortness
of breath for the past two weeks. On the day of presentation,
her breathing difficulties worsened, accompanied by
lightheadedness during exertion, prompting her to seek
medical care.
Her symptoms, along with findings on the ECG, led to further
evaluation with a pulmonary artery CT scan. This imaging
revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli with significant right
heart strain. In the accompanying image, the ventricles are
labeled, clearly showing how the right ventricle is markedly
enlarged compared to the left ventricle.
CT pulmonary angiogram
RV = Right ventricle. LV = Left ventricle.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 2/18
This patient had a large PE. Submassive pulmonary embolism
accounts for about 40% of all PE cases and is associated
with a mortality rate up to 25%. Patients with submassive PE
remain normotensive but are usually tachycardic and show
signs of myocardial injury or dysfunction. They show signs of
RV strain on either ECG or imaging modalities such as CT or
ultrasound and often have elevated troponins and BNP levels.
Table 1
Table 1 shows a summary of characteristics and mortality for
the different subgroups of pulmonary embolism. Modified
from (1)
On presentation our patient was hypoxemic and had an
elevated hs-troponin I at 1348ng/L and NT-proBNP of
4555pg/mL. She was normotensive with a heart rate in the
90s. She was treated with a heparin drip and then later
switched to OAC. The distinction between submassive and
massive PE is not straight foreward and often times it can be
difficult to decide who are «sick enough» to be treated with
thrombolytics and/or thrombectomy.
This case illustrates that life-threatening pulmonary embolism
even when causing severe right heart strain may be very
difficult to identify solely off of the ECG and often clinical
suspicion and imaging studies are needed to make the
diagnosis. The most sensitive ECG finding in PE is sinus
tachycardia, but this is very unspecific for PE.
What hemodynamic change occurs in acute
severe PE?
The right ventricle is thin-walled and compliant, and therefore
it is ill-equipped for acute increases in afterload compared to
the muscular thick-walled noncompliant left ventricle. In case
of sudden afterload increase the RV typically, due to its thin
wall and compliant structure dilates.

from (1)
As the RV stroke volume falls, blood accumulates in the right
ventricle leading to dilation of this chamber. If the right
ventricle becomes very dilated, it will interfere with left
ventricular filling as the heart is contained within the fibrous
pericardium. This leads to reduced left ventricular stroke
volume and cardiac output.
In contrast to the LV, the RV is supplied with blood throughout
the cardiac cycle, both during systole and diastole. This is
because the right ventricular systolic pressure is typically
lower than the systemic diastolic pressure, so coronary blood
flow to the right ventricle is not interrupted when the RV
contracts. In severe PE, the LV stroke volume and cardiac
output may not generate sufficient diastolic blood pressure to
perfuse the RV throughout the cardiac cycle resulting in RV
ischemia.
These hemodynamic changes may result in syncope, shock
or cardiac arrest.
LEARNING POINTS:
Even large PE may show little if anything on an ECG
The RV is compliant and will dilate in respons to acute
afterload increase
RV dilatation in severe acute PE leads to LV underfilling
and decreaed CO.
The RV receives blood supply throughout the caridac
cycle

The ECG in Pulmonary Embolism:
The ECG is not sensitive for PE, but when there are findings
such as S1Q3T3 or anterior T-wave inversions, or new RBBB,
or sinus tachycardia, then they have a (+) likelihood ratio.
S1Q3T3, or even just the T3, may help to differentiate Wellensʼ
from PE.
What is an S1Q3T3? Very few studies define S1Q3T3. It was
described way back in 1935 and both S1 and Q3 were
defined as 1.5 mm (0.15 mV). In the Marchik article,
(assuming they defined it the same way, and the methods do
not specify this), among patients with suspicion for PE,
S1Q3T3 was found in 8.5% of patients with PE and 3.3% of
patients without PE.
When there is a positive troponin, then the findings are
related to myocardial injury, and then PE and MI are at the top
of the differential, and Kosugeʼs article (see below) applies.
Kosuge et al. showed that, when T-waves are inverted in
precordial leads, if they are also inverted in lead III and V1,
then pulmonary embolism is far more likely than ACS. In this
study, (quote) “negative T waves in leads III and V were
1
observed in only 1% of patients with ACS compared with 88%
of patients with APE (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value of this finding for the diagnosis of PE were 88%, 99%,
97%, and 95%, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of
negative T waves in both leads III and V allows PE to be
1
differentiated simply but accurately from ACS in patients with
negative T waves in the precordial leads.”
Witting et al. looked at consecutive patients with PE, ACS, or
neither. They found that only 11% of PE had 1 mm T-wave
inversions in both lead III and lead V1, vs. 4.6% of controls.
This does not contradict the conclusions of Kosuge et al.,
who studied a select population of patients who were known
to have either PE or ACS — that is, all were indeed ill. Of
those select patients, the ones who also had T-wave
inversions in the right precordial leads were studied. Of
these, T-wave inversion in lead III was very specific for PE. In
my experience, this is true, but needs validation in a study of
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 5/18
similar methodology. Supporting Kosuge, Ferrari found that
anterior T-wave inversions were the most common ECG
finding in massive PE.
Finally, Stein et al. found normal ECGs in only 3 of 50
patients with massive PE, and 9 of 40 with PE that is not
massive. Today, however, that number would be lower
because we diagnose more of the smaller PEs that have
minimal symptoms.
This is a paper worth reading: Marchik et al. studied ECG
findings of PE in 6049 patients, 354 of whom had PE.
Just to be clear: these are all patients being evaluated for PE,
whereas Kosuge studied those with only ACS and PE left on
the differential. We should apply Kosugeʼs data to our case
here because of the positive troponin.
They found the following positive likelihood ratios for PE:
1. S1Q3T3 = 3.7
2. Inverted T-waves in V1 and V2, = 1.8
3. Inverted T-waves in V1-V3, = 2.6
4. Inverted T-waves in V1-V4, = 3.7
5. Incomplete RBBB = 1.7
6. Tachycardia, = 1.8.
Finally, they found these independent predictors of PE:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 6/18
Note that tachycardia only has an Odds ratio of 1.8.
Remember that is the odds ratio comparing all patients
without PE to those with PE.If you did an OR for all patients
with ACS vs. those without ACS, it would be far
higher.Tachycardia is unusual in ACS unless there is
cardiogenic shock or a second simultaneous pathology.
======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(7/28/2025):
I found todayʼs case presentation by Dr. Nossen highly
challenging and insightful for multiple reasons.
As per Dr. Nossen — “This case illustrates that life-
threateningPE (Pulmonary Embolism) even when
causing severe physiologic RV ‘strainʼ — may be very
difficult to identify solely by ECG”.
This case emphasizes the importance of theHistory —
which is truly essential for optimal clinical ECG
interpretation.
Finally — Todayʼs case highlights a series of subtleECG
signs of significant pulmonary disease, that taken
together in the context of the clinical History — does
correlate with the severe clinical picture that this patient
was experiencing.
The Importance of History:
I did not suspect todayʼs patient was in the midst of a
submassive PE. Given the predominance of ischemia-related
cases on most ECG forums — I instead contemplated various
degrees of subendocardial ischemia and/or recent inferior
— right ventricular — or anteroseptal OMI, now potentially in
any of the various stages of “pseudo-normalization”and/or
reperfusion.
This highlights yet another “Take-does (or does not) know the clinical history at the time
they are presented with an ECG — the same sequential
systematic approach is followed.
To Emphasize: Expert, experienced interpreters are
automatically (and instantly) systematic — such that
being systematic does not slow you down. But it does
prevent overlooking potentially important findings that
are easy to miss if one jumps to premature conclusions.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 7/18
ECG Findings in Todayʼs Tracing:
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced todayʼs ECG. My
thoughts on seeing this tracing without the benefit of any
history, were the following:
The rhythm is sinus — albeit the heart rate is relatively
rapid (with an R-R interval just over 3 large boxes in
duration = a rate of~90/minute).
Regarding intervals — both the PR interval and QRS
duration are normal. The QTc appears to be of
borderline duration, albeit difficult to assess given the
fairly rapid rate.
The frontal plane axis is normal (about +60 degrees).
No chamber enlargement.
RegardingQ–R–S–T Wave Changes:
Q waves — A small q wave appears to be present in
lead III (albeit, as often occurs in lead III — there is some
respiratory variation in QRS morphology).
R wave progression — There is early transition (ie, The
R wave becomes predominant already in lead V2 —
whereas normally this does not occur until leads V3-to-
V4, or later).
A qR complex is seen in lead V1 — which could
represent either IRBBB (Incomplete RBBB) or simply
terminal RV outflow track depolarization.
There are lots of S waves (being seen in leads I,II,III;
aVL,aVF: and in leads V2-thru-V6).
There are lots of subtle ST-T wave abnormalities of
uncertain significance. This includes straightening of the
ST segment in multiple leads, often with a hint of ST
depression.
There is subtle ST segment coving in multiple leads
(leads III,aVR; V1,V2,V3) — with a hint of slight ST
elevation in leads III, aVR and V1.
There is shallow Twave inversion in leads III, V1,V2,V3.
MY Impression of ECG #1: I was left with really wanting to
know the history. On the one hand — most (all) of the above
findings might be nonspecific and without clinical
significance. But then again I thought that Dr. Nossen would
not have presented this case if there wasnʼt some form of
pathology!
I thought this ECG could be the result of ichemic heart
disease. If the missing History in todayʼs case was that
this patient had new CP (Chest Pain) — but that this CP
had significantly decreased (or resolved) at the time
ECG #1 was recorded — then the diffuse ST segment
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 8/18
straightening with a hint of ST elevation in lead aVR
could represent some degree of DSI (Diffuse
Subendocardial Ischemia).
The subte ST segment coving with elevation in lead III —
with more marked ST coving and deeper T wave
inversion in lead V1 might represent recent inferior
and/or RV infarction — now with some pseudo-
normalization from spontaneous reperfusion ST-T
wave changes. Or perhaps the localization of recent
OMI was the result of LAD occlusion, followed by
resolution of ST elevation on the way to developing
reperfusion T waves, given the ST coving in leads
V1,V2,V3?
Then again — there are a number of ECG findings
potentially consistent with pulmonarydisease, that
might be recent.
================================
Figure-1: Iʼve reproduced todayʼs ECG. No history provided.
================================
ECG Findings of Acute PE:
Over the years — weʼve covered many cases illustrating
potential ECG fidings of acute PE (See My Comment at the
bottom of the page in the June 17, 2024 post, among many
others). It is from this June 17, 2024 post — that Iʼve
reproduced in Figure-2 a list of ECG Findings associated with
Acute PE. As weʼll see momentarily — suggestion of many of
these findings is put forth by the ECG in Figure-1:
To Emphasize: The ECG findings that Iʼll point out
momentarily in todayʼs tracing are extremely subtle —
which is why, without knowing the history in todayʼs
case, I did not suspect the patient was experiencing
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 9/18
submassive PE. But the moment I learned that this older
woman presented with progressively increasing
dyspnea over a 2-week period — all of the subtle ECG
findings in todayʼs tracing began to make sense!
PEARL: We are told that todayʼs patient was
“overweight” How overweight she was (which would of
course be instantly obvious the moment we saw the
patient) — might have a significant impact on why many
of todayʼs ECG findings are subtle (ie, IF this patient was
significantly overweight — that might account for the
relatively modest overall QRS voltage, as well as for
nonspecific ST-T wave flattening that may have been
even more marked on this patientʼs baseline ECG).
P.S.: One relevant ECG finding that I did not include in
my Figure-2 Table — is the presence of a qR pattern in
lead V1. As I highlight in My Comment at the bottom of
the page in the February 12, 2023 post — in the right
clinical setting (ie, in a patient in whom we are
considering acute PE) — the ECG finding of a qR pattern
in lead V1 often correlates with significant pulmonary
hypertension(this ECG finding reflecting marked RV
dilatation from increased RV pressure).
Challenge Yourself!
Take Another LOOK at the ECG in Figure-1. How many of
the findings in Figure-2 can you identify?
================================
Figure-2: ECG findings associated with Acute PE (from My
Comment in the June 17, 2024 post).
================================
Taking Another Look at ECG #1:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 10/18
As emphasized by Dr. Nossen — todayʼs case illustrates how
even potentially life-threatening PE may be difficult to
recognize from a single ECG. That said, knowing about this
older womanʼs 2-week history of progressively increasing
dyspnea — many of the ECG findings in Figure-2 can be
recognized.
No — sinus tachycardia is not present, since the heart
rate does not exceed 100/minute. But this patientʼs heart
rate of ~90/minuteis faster than the usual resting heart
rate.
Although T wave inversion in ECG #1 is not deep — the T
wave is inverted in the anterior leads, as well as in lead
III (BLUE arrows in Figure-3) — which is consistent with
RV “strain”.
An S1Q3T3 patternis present! Once again — the size of
the S wave in lead I — and the Q wave and depth of T
wave inversion in lead III is not great, but it is present! In
association with all of the other suggestive ECG findings
— the presence of an S1Q3T3 pattern increases the
likelihood of a significant PE.
NOTE: As highlighted within the RED rectangle in Figure-
2 — When there is T wave inversion in the chest leads —
and both leads III and V1 manifest T wave inversion —
acute PE becomes much more likely to be the cause
than ischemic heart disease!
RAA and right axis deviation are not present in Figure-3.
A qR patternis present in lead V1! This may reflect
incomplete RBBB (clearly possible given associated
terminal s waves in left-sided leads I and V6) — and/or
— this qR pattern may reflect pulmonary hypertension
(as per the P.S. that I wrote above) — or most probably
both entities.
The ECG diagnosis of RVH is often challenging —
because the normal LV is so much thicker and larger
than the normal RV. But in view of the small amplitude S
wave in lead V1 — the R wave in this lead looks
disproportionately tall, therefore potentially a
manifestation of RVH.
Two findings of pulmonary disease are: i) Persistent
Precordial S waves; — and, ii) S waves in leads I,II,III
(the BLUE “Sʼs” in Figure-3).
Doesnʼt the ST segment in lead aVR “look” elevated?
(even though the amount of any ST elevation in this lead
is modest).
In Summary: It is only after I learned that todayʼs patient had
a 2-week history of progressively increasing dyspnea — that I
expanded on the potential clinical significance of the above
subtle findings. But in this clinical context — all of the above
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/by-magnus-nossen-i-was-sent-this-ecg-by/ 11/18
ECG findings are completely consistent with the clinical and
CT pulmonary angiogram findings that are diagnostic of
acute submassive PE in todayʼs patient.

findings.
