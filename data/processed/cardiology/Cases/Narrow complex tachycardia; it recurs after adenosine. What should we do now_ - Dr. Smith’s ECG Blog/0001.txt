A man in his 50s presented with palpitations, fever, and hypotension (BP ~80/40). Ultrasound showed low intravascular volume (flat IVC), good LV function, and no pulmonary edema. He had a history of atrial fibrillation with prior ablation, and had recently been in sinus rhythm. IV fluids were given. Because of a very rapid heart rate (~190 bpm), an ECG was obtained. Initial ECG Interpretation The ECG showed a narrow complex tachycardia at ~156 bpm with no clearly visible P waves. Key features: Narrow QRS → supraventricular origin Not irregularly irregular → not atrial fibrillation Regularly irregular rhythm with two alternating RR intervals (approximately 360 ms and 400 ms) Each RR interval had a slightly different QRS amplitude Differential diagnosis included: Atrial flutter AVNRT AVRT Atrial tachycardia No flutter waves were identified. Sinus tachycardia at this rate would be very unusual for a patient of this age. The alternating RR intervals suggested reentry SVT, most consistent with AVNRT, possibly involving multiple AV nodal pathways. Initial Management Given the rapid rate and narrow-complex SVT, adenosine was administered. Adenosine converted the rhythm to sinus, but the patient rapidly reverted back to SVT Adenosine was repeated two more times, each with transient conversion followed
