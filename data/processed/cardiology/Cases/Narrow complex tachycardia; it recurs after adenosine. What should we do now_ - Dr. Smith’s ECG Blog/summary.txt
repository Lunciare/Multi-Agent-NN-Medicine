A man in his 50s presented with palpitations, fever, and hypotension (BP ~80/40). Ultrasound showed low intravascular volume (flat IVC), good LV function, and no pulmonary edema. He had a history of atrial fibrillation with prior ablation, and had recently been in sinus rhythm. IV fluids were given. Because of a very rapid heart rate (~190 bpm), an ECG was obtained. Initial ECG Interpretation The ECG showed a narrow complex tachycardia at ~156 bpm with no clearly visible P waves.
