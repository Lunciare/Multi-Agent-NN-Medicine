~66 bpm A diltiazem infusion was started for maintenance Chest X-ray showed pneumonia, explaining the fever and hypotension. Despite hypotension, the patient did not mount an appropriate sinus tachycardic response due to AV nodal blockade from diltiazem, and therefore required continued phenylephrine support. The patient ultimately recovered and did well. Key Learning Points Narrow-complex SVT with alternating RR intervals strongly suggests reentry SVT (AVNRT/AVRT) Immediate conversion with adenosine confirms a reentry mechanism Rapid recurrence after adenosine or cardioversion means these therapies should be stopped Use a long-acting AV nodal blocker (diltiazem or verapamil) if LV function is preserved Avoid calcium channel blockers in patients with poor LV function Support blood pressure before AV nodal blockade if hypotension is present Always record a long rhythm strip after adenosine, as conversion may be very brief and easily missed
