Case Summary
KEYWORDS: adenosine, svt, sinus, patient, rhythm, hypotension, diltiazem, nodal, conversion, started, bpm, atrial, function, reentry, svt adenosine

narrow-complex SVT, adenosine was administered. Adenosine converted the rhythm to sinus, but the patient rapidly reverted back to SVT Adenosine was repeated two more times, each with transient conversion followed by immediate recurrence Electrical cardioversion was attempted twice, with the same result (brief sinus rhythm, then reversion) Amiodarone bolus and infusion were started on cardiology recommendation, with no effect Despite IV fluids, the patient remained hypotensive. Reassessment and Management Strategy Because the SVT consistently reverted after adenosine and cardioversion, further use of short-acting therapies was deemed futile. Key principles: Adenosine and electricity terminate reentry SVT transiently but do not prevent recurrence Persistent SVT requires a longer-acting AV nodal blocker Calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are effective if LV function is good These agents can worsen hypotension, so blood pressure support may be required first Amiodarone was discontinued. To support blood pressure without beta-agonist stimulation, a phenylephrine infusion was started. Once BP improved to ~105/70, a diltiazem bolus was administered. Outcome Immediate and sustained conversion to sinus rhythm Sinus rate ~66 bpm A diltiazem infusion was started for maintenance Chest X-ray showed pneumonia, explaining the fever and hypotension. Despite hypotension, the patient did not mount an appropriate sinus tachycardic response
