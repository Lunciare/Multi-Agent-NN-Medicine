What pathology do all these
ECGs manifest?
 
ECG 1:

What do you think? Then you can look at the rest.
ECG 1: This is hyperkalemia. As soon as I saw it, I knew it. The
peaked T-waves of hyperK are not always tall a peaked.
Sometimes they are just small triangles, as in this case. T-
waves like this are not seen in anything else. To me, they are
almost pathognomonic. Lab results: K = 6.3; ionized Calcium
= 4.0 (slightly low, explains long ST segment — typical of
dialysis patients)
Extra credit: There is also right axis deviation and a large R-
wave (R/S > 1) in V1, so this is Right Ventricular Hypertrophy
(RVH) also.

ECG 2: HyperK immediately recognized by Smith. Stat
placed. K = 6.2
ECG 3:
ECG 3: hyperkalemia 7.1. Pseudo-OMI. Cath lab activated
falsely.
ECG 4:
ECG 4: K = 6.3. Called “normal”. Patient arrested.
ECG 5:

ECG 5: K = 7.1. This one is easy due to bradycardia. But still
look how small the T-waves are.
ECG 6 (below): K = 6.8. See this full case here from this
post, with lots of other fascinating HyperK cases!!
After seeing this ECG, are there any
medications you would consider giving?

Learning point:
Hyperkalemia T-waves are not necessarily tall and peaked;
they may be very short and peaked, like a small triangle. I
have learned to recognized these instantly and accurately.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/21/2025):
The diagnosis of hyperkalemia is easy — when the QRS is
wide with tall, peaked T waves on ECG and the clinical
situation is obvious (ie, renal failure, acidosis, ingestion of K+
retaining medications). The diagnosis is far more elusive
when the QRS is not wide and T waves are not tall and
peaked.
The reality is that failure to promptly identify and treat
severe hyperkalemia is a potentially lethal oversight. Yet
the multifaceted “ECG identities” of hyperkalemia make
recognition of its more subtle presentations an ongoing
challenge.

Subtle “ECG Identities” of Hyperkalemia:
Unlike the dogma that used to be taught (ie, That there
is a set “sequence” of ECG changes that are seen with
 3/10
progressively increasing degrees of hyperkalemia) —
many patients “do not read the textbook”. Thus, the
clinical reality is that any combination of ECG changes
can be seen with virtually any elevated level of serum
K+. In the extreme — this includes the possibility of
cardiacarrest as the 1st manifestation of hyperkalemia
(without QRS widening, loss of P wave amplitude;
various bradyarrhythmias and AV blocks — and even
without any T wave peaking! — See My Comment in the
August 22, 2025post).
Among cases of Brugada Phenocopy published on Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog (in which a Brugada-1 ECG pattern is
precipitated by some underlying condition) —
hyperkalemia is the most common cause. As with other
causes of Brugada Phenocopy — this ECG sign usually
disappears promptly once hyperkalemia is treated (See
My Comment in the May 5, 2022 post — and the
January 13, 2025 post). Therefore — I always consider
the possibility of hyperkalemia whenever I see an
unexpected Brugada-1 ECG pattern in which there is
QRS widening.
Rhythm assessment may be especially challenging
with hyperkalemia because:i) The QRS may widen,
often with an unusual QRS morphology that suggests a
ventricular rhythm; — ii) P wave amplitude may
decrease (and P waves may even disappear =
sinoventricular rhythm); — iii) Bradyarrhythmias are
common — often with 1st-degree AV block and/or with
other forms of AV block that often “do not obey the usual
rules” for rhythm interpretation; — and, iv) Ultimately
VT may develop, but — Is the regular wide rhythm
without P waves VT? — or perhaps a sinus or junctional
rhythm with loss of P waves due to hyperkalemia? (See
My Comment in the January 16, 2022 post).
Significant hyperkalemia is notorious for masking ECG
signs of ischemia/infarction(See My Comment in the
September 5, 2022 post). This is because the ECG
shows us the net effect of hyperkalemia and
whatever other condition(s) may be operative. For
example — IF T waves were peaked because of
hyperkalemia — What will happen to such T wave
peaking if acute ischemia on the baseline ECG was
causing ST depression/T wave inversion?
And then there is the patient who presents with
marked QRS widening and a potentially lethal elevated
serum K+ level — who is surprisingly alert with normal
vital signs despite a QRS duration approaching 1 large
box in duration (See My Comment in theJuly 14, 2025
post).

Hyperkalemia with Small T Waves:
In addition to the above subtle ECG “identities” of
hyperkalemia, is the “theme” of todayʼs discussion by Dr.
Smith — which in essence, is that the T waves of
hyperkalemia are sometimes surprisingly small.
KEY Point: If you see multiple symmetrically peaked T
waves (even if small) — then consider hyperkalemia
(especially if the clinical situation is potentially
consistent for association with hyperK).

For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced 3 of the tracings
from Dr. Smithʼs discussion that Iʼll briefly comment on:

Figure-1: ECGs #3,4,5 from Dr. Smithʼs above discussion.
ECG #3: The T wave peaking in this tracing fooled
providers into thinking these were the hyperacute T
waves of an acute OMI. Clues to hyperkalemia include:
i) Diffuseness of this T wave peaking (in no less than
8/12 leads); — ii) Shape of these T waves (very pointed
at their peak); — and, iii) Awareness that the T waves of
hyperkalemia are not always positive — but the T wave
peaking may be negative (as it is here in lead III ).
ECG #4: The T waves in leads V3,V4 manifest the
typical “Eiffel Tower” effect of hyperkalemia ( =
symmetric T wave shape, pointed at their peak, with a
narrow T wave base). While T waves are relatively small
in other leads — the small, symmetric triangles
described by Dr. Smith are clearly present in most other
leads.
ECG #5: The QRS is small and narrow — and tall, peaked
T waves are not seen. But: i) The rate is very slow; —
ii) P waves are absent (? sinoventricular rhythm?); —
and, iii) Even though small and not particularly pointed
— T waves are disproportionately tall considering how
tiny the QRS is — and these T waves do form symmetric
triangles. We need to condition ourselves to consider
hyperkalemia with this type of tracing.
