A 69 year old with acute chest pain

though lead V1 showed higher-than-expected ST elevation for RBBB, raising suspicion for associated pathology. Overall, ECG #1 was interpreted as suspicious for acute inferior OMI until proven otherwise, with T-wave inversions possibly reflecting spontaneous reperfusion as chest pain was decreasing. When chest pain returned, ECG #2 showed clear progression with increased ST elevation and hyperacute ST-T wave changes in leads III and aVF, persistent abnormal ST elevation in lead II, and definitive reciprocal ST depression in aVL. These findings confirmed acute inferior OMI. Subsequent angiography confirmed the culprit lesion. The case highlights the importance of serial ECGs, careful inferior lead assessment, and maintaining a high index of suspicion for OMI in patients with chest pain and known coronary disease.
