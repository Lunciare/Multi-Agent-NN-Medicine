This ECG was emailed to me by Sam Ghali. “69 year old woman with chest pain.” I responded: “Suggestion of inferior OMI, but not quite diagnostic.” There is an incomplete RBBB. There is minimal ST elevation in lead III with an inverted T-wave, suggesting acute MI with some degree of reperfusion. Same in aVF. There is minimal reciprocal ST depression in aVL.

Prior ECGs looked very similar but previously appeared to reflect an SGA-RCA issue. The patient was instructed to report immediately if pain returned. Pain did return and a repeat ECG was recorded.

The artery appeared completely occluded and then reopened, described as TIMI-1 flow. Learning Points: 1. Use serial ECGs 2. Consider OMI even with subtle initial findings MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/20/2024) Interpretation of ECGs in patients with known coronary disease and conduction abnormalities is challenging, especially without
