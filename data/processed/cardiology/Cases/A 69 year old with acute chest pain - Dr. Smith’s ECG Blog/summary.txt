This ECG was emailed to me by Sam Ghali. “69 year old woman with chest pain.” I responded: “Suggestion of inferior OMI, but not quite diagnostic.” There is an incomplete RBBB. There is minimal ST elevation in lead III with an inverted T-wave, suggesting acute MI with some degree of reperfusion. There is minimal reciprocal ST depression in aVL. There is a normal amount of discordant ST depression in V2. Queen of Hearts interpretation: OMI with low confidence.
