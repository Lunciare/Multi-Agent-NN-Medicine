A 69 year old with acute chest pain

Consider OMI even with subtle initial findings MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/20/2024) Interpretation of ECGs in patients with known coronary disease and conduction abnormalities is challenging, especially without prior tracings for comparison. In this case, despite lack of prior ECGs, the initial tracing should be considered highly suspicious for acute OMI given new chest pain. ECG #1 showed sinus rhythm at 60–65 bpm, a wide QRS (~0.12 s), and an atypical RBBB pattern. There was no chamber enlargement. Small narrow Q waves in leads I and aVL were likely normal septal Q waves. No true Q waves were present in leads III or aVF. ST-T wave abnormalities were most notable in the inferior leads. Lead aVF showed straightened ST takeoff with slight but real ST elevation and terminal T-wave inversion. Lead III showed subtle ST elevation with definite terminal T-wave inversion. Lead II demonstrated abnormal J-point elevation supportive of inferior OMI. Lead aVL showed equivocal but potentially reciprocal ST depression. Chest lead assessment was difficult without prior ECGs, though lead V1 showed higher-than-expected ST elevation for RBBB, raising suspicion for associated pathology. Overall, ECG #1 was interpreted as suspicious for acute inferior OMI until proven otherwise, with T-wave
