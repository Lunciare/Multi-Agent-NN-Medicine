vector points “straight up” (≈ −90°, i.e., “north”) Suggested Etiologies (high-risk culprits) This pattern can indicate: Left main coronary artery occlusion Proximal LAD occlusion Multivessel coronary artery disease Clinical implication: represents a large territory at risk and can be missed by traditional STEMI criteria, so it should trigger immediate cath lab activation when clinically consistent. Case Course / Outcome The cath lab was activated. On arrival, the patient was diaphoretic, clammy, and altered, and was taken emergently to the cath lab with a weak thready pulse. Cath findings: 100% occlusion of the left main coronary artery, TIMI 0 flow Despite restoration of flow in the left system, the patient had emesis with inability to protect airway, was intubated, then suffered PEA arrest, underwent CPR, and was pronounced dead at 12:06 am. Additional Expert Note (Conceptual Pearl) Prediction of the culprit artery can be hard when the ECG suggests occlusion but with conflicting regional findings; this often points toward significant multivessel disease. Acute left main occlusion has high variability in ECG presentation, and lead aVR alone does not “solve” the diagnosis.
