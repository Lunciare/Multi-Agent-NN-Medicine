A 54-year-old male presented to the ED with severe substernal chest pain lasting 15–20 minutes, associated with general weakness, mild dyspnea, and diaphoresis. An initial 12-lead ECG was obtained. ECG Pattern Recognition The ECG shows: ST elevation (STE) in V1, V2, aVR, and aVL Hyperacute T wave in V3 Otherwise diffuse ST depression (STD): Inferior leads (II, III, aVF) Low lateral / lateral leads (V4–V6) Overall interpretation: Superiorly directed ST vector (a “north-pointing” injury vector). This is unequivocally an OMI / STEMI-equivalent pattern, but the distribution is unusual because the STE vector is directly superior with reciprocal inferior/lower-lateral STD. Named Pattern: “Northern OMI” This ECG matches what is sometimes called “Northern Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (Northern OMI)” — a STEMI/OMI pattern associated with subepicardial (transmural) ischemia of the base of the heart, potentially involving the basal septum.
