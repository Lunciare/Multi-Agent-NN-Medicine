Case Summary

A 54-year-old male presented to the ED with severe substernal chest pain lasting 15–20 minutes, associated with general weakness, mild dyspnea, and diaphoresis. An initial 12-lead ECG was obtained. ECG Pattern Recognition The ECG shows: ST elevation (STE) in V1, V2, aVR, and aVL Hyperacute T wave in V3 Otherwise diffuse ST depression (STD): Inferior leads (II, III, aVF) Low lateral / lateral leads (V4–V6) Overall interpretation: Superiorly directed ST vector (a “north-pointing” injury vector). This is unequivocally an OMI / STEMI-equivalent pattern, but the distribution is unusual because the STE vector is directly superior with reciprocal inferior/lower-lateral STD. Named Pattern: “Northern OMI” This ECG matches what is sometimes called “Northern Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (Northern OMI)” — a STEMI/OMI pattern associated with subepicardial (transmural) ischemia of the base of the heart, potentially involving the basal septum. Key Features (as described in the case) STE in aVR and aVL (often with negative T waves) STD in inferior (II, III, aVF) and lateral (V4–V6) leads with positive or biphasic T waves ST vector points “straight up” (≈ −90°, i.e., “north”) Suggested Etiologies (high-risk culprits) This pattern can indicate: Left main coronary artery occlusion Proximal LAD occlusion Multivessel coronary artery disease Clinical implication:
