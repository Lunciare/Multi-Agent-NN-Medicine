An elderly man with a history of diabetes and hypertension presented with lethargy and weakness, decreased urine output, and hypotension. There was no history of GI bleeding or other hemorrhage, and no fever. He had no chest pain or shortness of breath. It was unknown whether there was a prior history of atrial fibrillation. He was on atenolol, but it was not known whether this was for hypertension or atrial fibrillation. He was not anticoagulated.

leads should be used. Additional ECG Interpretation Notes The initial ECG shows diffuse ST depression with subtle ST elevation in aVR, consistent with diffuse subendocardial ischemia. This pattern suggests severe underlying coronary disease or a non-occlusive systemic cause such as sustained tachycardia, hypotension, shock, sepsis, or anemia. Mechanisms by which atrial fibrillation may precipitate subendocardial ischemia include loss of atrial kick and shortening of diastolic filling time, particularly in hypovolemia. Wide “funny-looking beats” in atrial fibrillation may represent either PVCs or aberrantly conducted supraventricular beats (Ashman phenomenon). In this case, treatment was not required, and the abnormal beats resolved with correction of hypovolemia and sepsis.
