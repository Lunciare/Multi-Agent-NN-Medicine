An elderly man with a history of diabetes and hypertension presented with lethargy and weakness, decreased urine output, and hypotension. There was no history of GI bleeding or other hemorrhage, and no fever. He had no chest pain or shortness of breath. It was unknown whether there was a prior history of atrial fibrillation. He was on atenolol, but it was not known whether this was for hypertension or atrial fibrillation. He was not anticoagulated.

was performed using bedside ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The IVC was collapsing, consistent with volume depletion. Additional views showed a small right ventricle and a small left ventricle with reasonably good contractility, supporting volume depletion. The appropriate therapy was fluids and further workup for hemorrhage, dehydration, or sepsis. Initial Management and Reassessment Both an esmolol bolus and infusion, and IV fluids were started. Beta blockade should not be given early in a volume-depleted state, as reflexive tachycardia may be necessary to maintain cardiac output. Lactate was 3.3 mEq/L. Initial troponin I was 0.139 ng/mL. This was felt to represent Type II (demand ischemia) myocardial infarction rather than ACS. Cardioversion was not performed due to risk of thromboembolism, possible chronic atrial fibrillation, and because atrial fibrillation with RVR was not the primary cause of shock. Esmolol was stopped and 2 liters of IV fluids were administered. After fluids, the IVC was less collapsing. No B-lines were present. Rhythm Conversion and Lewis Leads The monitor then showed a regular narrow complex tachycardia without visible P-waves, raising the question of SVT versus sinus tachycardia. Lewis leads were applied by repositioning electrodes: Right arm electrode on the manubrium Left arm electrode
