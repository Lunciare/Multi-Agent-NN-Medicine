An elderly man with a history of diabetes and hypertension presented with lethargy and weakness, decreased urine output, and hypotension. There was no history of GI bleeding or other hemorrhage, and no fever. He had no chest pain or shortness of breath. It was unknown whether there was a prior history of atrial fibrillation. He was on atenolol, but it was not known whether this was for hypertension or atrial fibrillation. He was not anticoagulated.

narrow complex tachycardia without visible P-waves, raising the question of SVT versus sinus tachycardia. Lewis leads were applied by repositioning electrodes: Right arm electrode on the manubrium Left arm electrode over the 5th intercostal space at the right sternal border Left leg electrode over the right lower costal margin With Lewis leads, P-waves became clearly visible, confirming sinus tachycardia. Additional fluids were given, and the heart rate decreased. Subsequent ECG was normal. Hospital Course Second troponin I: 0.562 ng/mL Third troponin I: 2.165 ng/mL The patient developed fever, and urinalysis showed white blood cells. He was treated for urosepsis and improved. He did not have ACS. Learning Points Not all myocardial infarction is due to ACS; this was a Type II MI. Subendocardial supply–demand ischemia in atrial fibrillation with RVR may be maximal in V1–V4. Atrial fibrillation with RVR may be a consequence, not the cause, of acute illness. Volume status is critical in the management of atrial fibrillation with RVR. If the source of supraventricular tachycardia is unclear, Lewis leads should be used. Additional ECG Interpretation Notes The initial ECG shows diffuse ST depression with subtle ST elevation in aVR, consistent with diffuse subendocardial ischemia. This pattern suggests severe
