KEYWORDS: patient, pain, ecg, troponin, chest pain, chest, reperfusion, lab, cath, cath lab, patient year, troponin rose, old, rose, lvh

first troponin returned at 8,000ng/L the nursing notes documented the patient still had chest pain. The patient was admitted as ‘high risk NSTEMIʼ, and after troponin rose to 12,000 two hours later the patient was taken to cath lab. Door-to-cath was 5hr40 minutes. There was 100% mid LAD occlusion, and peak troponin was 30,000 ng/L, with EF 48%. Discharge diagnosis remained NSTEMI. Next day ECG showed more obvious reperfusion T wave inversion.
