4 patients with chest pain, LVH, and elevated troponin: which has Occlusion MI?

Four patients presented with chest pain, an ECG showing LVH, and an elevated troponin. Which patient has an acute coronary occlusion? Patient 1: 50 year old, no past medical history, with chest pain that began on exertion but continues, and feels like heartburn Back to Patient 1: Queen of Hearts identified LAD OMI with ECG signs of reperfusion, but clinically the patient still had pain at the time of the ECG. The ECG was repeated 15 minutes later, when the patient reported reduction but still ongoing pain Queen now calls this OMI: Cath lab was activated: 100% mid LAD occlusion, with RCA CTO and 80% circumflex stenosis. LAD stented. First troponin I was 2,000 ng/L and peak 10,000ng/L. Discharge ECG showed reperfusion T wave inversion: Discharge diagnosis was “STEMI” because of rapid reperfusion, even though no ECG had a final interpretation of STEMI, because STEMI criteria cannot be applied in the presence of LVH. Patient 2: 55 year old, no past medical history, with exertional chest pain and syncope The ECG was repeated on arrival. Cath lab was canceled and the patient was sent to the emergency department for assessment. Troponin rose from 30 to 55 ng/L, the patient was
