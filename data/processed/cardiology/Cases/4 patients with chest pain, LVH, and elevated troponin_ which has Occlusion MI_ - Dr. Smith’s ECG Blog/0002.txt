4 patients with chest pain, LVH, and elevated troponin: which has Occlusion MI?

ECG was repeated on arrival. Cath lab was canceled and the patient was sent to the emergency department for assessment. Troponin rose from 30 to 55 ng/L, the patient was admitted as NSTEMI. Angiogram showed minimal coronary artery disease and echo showed severe aortic stenosis (explaining the exertional chest pain and syncope), treated with aortic valve replacement. Patient 3: 60 year old, history of hypertension, with one week of chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion Cath lab was activated by the emergency physician but canceled by cardiology. Serial troponins were stable at 17ng/L (normal <16 in females) and echo diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patient 4: 55 year old, no past medical history, with 3 days exertional chest pain Thereʼs minimal LVH criteria, making the biphasic T waves V2-4 concerning for primary ischemic changes from reperfusion (rather than secondary to LVH). Wellens syndrome requires resolution of ischemic symptoms and intact R waves (ie reperfusion before a major infarct); but V4 has lost most of its R wave, and when the first troponin returned at 8,000ng/L the nursing notes documented the patient still had chest pain. The patient was admitted as ‘high risk NSTEMIʼ, and after troponin rose to 12,000 two
