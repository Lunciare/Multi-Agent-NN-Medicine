context + ECG morphology, immediate cath lab activation was deferred. Follow-Up and Additional Data Repeat ECG (ECG 2, next day) Persistent but improving ST segment abnormalities Overall trend toward normalization Biomarkers Initial high-sensitivity troponin I: 2676 ng/L Repeat value: 2080 ng/L (downtrending) Final Interpretation The overall picture was most consistent with post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS) following surgery involving pericardiotomy as part of lung transplantation. This represents an immunologically mediated pericarditis / myopericarditis, rather than acute coronary occlusion. Supporting Features for PCIS / Pericarditis Recent cardiac-adjacent surgery Absence of chest pain Normal wall motion on echocardiography Audible pericardial friction rub Concave ST elevation High ST/T wave ratio in lateral leads (e.g., V6) PR segment elevation and ST depression in aVR and V1 Improving ECG and troponin trend Key Learning Points Automated STEMI algorithms have high false-positive rates, especially in postoperative and inflammatory states Concave ST elevation with narrow-based T waves can mimic OMI Clinical context is essential: ECG interpretation must not occur in isolation Pericarditis and PCIS can present with significant ST elevation AI tools are valuable, particularly for reducing false-positive cath lab activations, but must be interpreted in context Bottom Line Despite being STEMI-positive by conventional ECG algorithms, this high-risk
