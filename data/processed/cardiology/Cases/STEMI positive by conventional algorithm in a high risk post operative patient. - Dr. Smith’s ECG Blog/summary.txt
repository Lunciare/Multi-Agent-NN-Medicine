A man in his late 60s was hospitalized following bilateral lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis. His medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and chronic steroid use, both risk factors for coronary artery disease. On postoperative day 2, an ECG was obtained. Initial ECG (ECG 1) The automated GE algorithm interpretation was “ACUTE MI / STEMI.” ECG findings: Sinus tachycardia Concave ST elevation in multiple leads Markedly asymmetric T waves (gentle upslope, sharper downslope) ST segments that are very flat initially, then turn sharply upward into a narrow-based T wave Additional observations: ST elevation in I and aVL No reciprocal ST depression in inferior leads Presence of ST elevation in lead II These findings were considered atypical for LAD occlusion. Clinical Context The patient denied chest pain Bedside echocardiogram showed normal wall motion Physical examination revealed a prominent pericardial friction rub When analyzed by the Queen of Hearts AI model: Result: No OMI, but low confidence AI score was near the positivity threshold (approximately 0.53 on a 0–1 scale) Given the clinical context + ECG morphology, immediate cath lab activation was deferred.
