ST elevation AI tools are valuable, particularly for reducing false-positive cath lab activations, but must be interpreted in context Bottom Line Despite being STEMI-positive by conventional ECG algorithms, this high-risk postoperative patient did not have acute coronary occlusion. The ECG findings, troponin trend, physical exam, and imaging were most consistent with post-cardiac injury syndrome, and immediate invasive intervention was appropriately avoided.
