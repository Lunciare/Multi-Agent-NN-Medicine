A 15 year old with acute chest pain

from retrospective studies that cardiac catheterization in otherwise healthy adolescents with chest pain and abnormal ECGs usually does not change management. But rare ≠ never. At the least — today’s 15-year old patient has acute myocarditis (despite no symptoms of acute viral illness). That said — I don’t know how to rule out an acute OMI or some rare congenital abnormality (like an anomalous coronary artery) in an adolescent with new acute symptoms — a clearly abnormal ECG — and a serum Troponin value = 11,000 ng/L. I don’t know how “trending Troponins” will possibly change the situation in today’s case (ie, what will be different regardless if serial Troponins trend toward normal — or increase to 50,000?).
