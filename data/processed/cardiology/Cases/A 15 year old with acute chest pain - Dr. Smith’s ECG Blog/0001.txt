This was sent to me real time by an outstanding former EM resident, Quin Stevens. Quin wrote that a 15 year old presented with sudden onset chest pressure one hour prior. There were no symptoms of viral illness. Here is his ED ECG: What do you think? There is quite a bit of ST Elevation in I and aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in lead III, as well as V1–V3. In an adult, one would need to assume OMI until proven otherwise. Interestingly, the Queen of Hearts said “Not OMI with low confidence.” The model output was 0.35 and it must be above 0.50 to have 98% specificity. I’m not certain what the specificity is at 0.35. I sent the ECG real time to my EKG Nerdz friends without any info. The response was “OMI”. When I told them it was from a 15yo, they wrote that “it could be myocarditis, but doesn’t look like pericarditis.” Those were my exact thoughts. “I would have a low threshold for angiogram.” Also my exact thoughts. So I texted back to encourage an angiogram. So she called cardiology. Then the first troponin I returned at 11,000 ng/L. This is typical of subacute OMI
