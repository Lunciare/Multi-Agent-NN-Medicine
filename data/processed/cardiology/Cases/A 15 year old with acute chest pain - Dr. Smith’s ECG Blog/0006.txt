leads (BLUE arrows) is not a finding of benign repolarization in patients with new symptoms. I’ve highlighted the lateral chest lead ST elevation in leads V5, V6 with GRAY arrows — since as isolated findings, this would be consistent with repolarization changes (but it isn’t in association with the above-noted findings in 7 other leads). Figure-1: I’ve labeled today’s initial tracing. As per Dr. Smith — acute MI can occur in otherwise healthy adolescents (Ramphul et al — Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis 8(1):177–181, 2023 — and — Lande and Ben Shachar — Pediatrics 120(4):e938–43, 2007 — and — Rakash et al — JACC 81(8), 2023). Assuming no cocaine/illicit drug use — Anomalous Coronary Artery is a rare but potentially life-threatening congenital defect in which the first symptom may be an acute MI or sudden death (Borns et al — Front Cardiovasc Med 22(7):559794, 2020). BOTTOM LINE We all know and accept that acute OMI is rare in otherwise healthy adolescents. And, the literature I was able to find suggests from retrospective studies that cardiac catheterization in otherwise healthy adolescents with chest pain and abnormal ECGs usually does not change management. But rare ≠ never. At the least — today’s
