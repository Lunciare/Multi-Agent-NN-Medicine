A 15 year old with acute chest pain

Troponin I in Children and Adolescents? A Diagnostic Approach. Role of Troponin Determination to Diagnose Chest Pain in the Pediatric Emergency Department ====================================== MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/25/2025): My impression on seeing today’s case was similar to that of Dr. Smith, and to those of our EKG Nerdz colleagues: IF the patient is an adult — then acute OMI until proven otherwise. IF an adolescent — then probably myocarditis. For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced today’s tracing from this presumably healthy 15-year old who presented with sudden onset chest pressure of 1 hour duration. The abnormalities are undeniable: There is ST elevation in high-lateral leads I and aVL, which especially in lead aVL with its high J-point takeoff and ST segment straightening looks acute (RED arrows in these leads). The small narrow q waves in these high-lateral leads are of uncertain significance. While one might attribute ST elevation in an adolescent to “repolarization abnormalities” — the ST depression seen in leads III, aVF and in the anterior leads (BLUE arrows) is not a finding of benign repolarization in patients with new symptoms. I’ve highlighted the lateral chest lead ST elevation in leads V5, V6 with GRAY arrows
