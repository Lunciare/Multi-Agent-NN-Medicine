my exact thoughts. So I texted back to encourage an angiogram. So she called cardiology. Then the first troponin I returned at 11,000 ng/L. This is typical of subacute OMI or of myocarditis. Both would have reciprocal ST depression. Both would have wall motion abnormalities. Now it is OMI until proven otherwise. There is simply no way to tell the difference with this data between acute OMI and myocarditis. Only angiogram can tell you if intervention is necessary. Only MRI can make the definitive diagnosis of MI vs. myocarditis, but that takes time. To not do an angiogram is to play Russian Roulette with a child’s heart. Maybe the probability is 20:1 for myocarditis over OMI, but children do get acute MI. They can have atherosclerosis (just because it is rare does not mean it is impossible — it is especially likely in an adolescent with acute chest pain, an ischemic ECG, and a very high troponin). They can also have coronary spasm, coronary aneurysms (especially if they had Kawasaki disease, which can go undiagnosed), coronary dissection. So my ex-resident called cardiology and transferred the patient to a pediatric hospital. The cardiologist said that they will “Trend Troponins,” and not
