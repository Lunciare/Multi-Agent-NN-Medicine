will titrate. Continue telemetry and possible limited TTE to follow up LV function appropriate in 4 – 6 days or sooner with unexplained change in clinical status. Pain control appears to be improving. Continue present pain management. Recommendations: Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, improving, secondary to myocarditis a. Continue to manage pulmonary edema and other causes of respiratory failure b. Continue diuresis with IV lasix i. Active diuresis until patient is off O2 and is comfortable – would attempt to estimate volume status and verify patient is no longer clinically hypervolemic) ii. Monitor with BMP for renal function and contraction alkalosis c. Continuous telemetry, strict Is/Os, daily weights Acute inflammatory myopericarditis a. Etiology: Recommend autoimmune/additional laboratory (HIV, ANA, autoimmune, etc) evaluation b. Rheumatological evaluation consultation to exclude autoimmune conditions c. cardiomyopathy/afterload: Start valsartan 20 mg BID d. Close monitoring on telemetry for arrhythmias e. Pain: Continue NSAID’s and colchicine i. Additional pain management per primary echo: Moderately decreased left ventricular systolic function with an estimated EF of 30%. Diffuse hypokinesis of the mid and apical segments. echo 9 days later: LV systolic dysfunction. The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 40 %. No regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality. Normal right
