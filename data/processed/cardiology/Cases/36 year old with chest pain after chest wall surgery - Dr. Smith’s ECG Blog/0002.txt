a few days ago, she had shortness of breath and surgeon was not concerned. However, today she describes feeling of an elephant sitting on her chest. She has significant family history of cardiac issues. Her first troponin was 10,216 and Rose to 10,655 and then dropped five hours later to 7459. The angiogram showed no coronary disease. Cardiac MRI Dilated left ventricular size with moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function, calculated EF 38%. Prolonged native T1, T2, ECV without LGE suggests myocardial edema + inflammatory cardiomyopathy without fibrosis. Diffuse pericardial enhancement noted, consider pericarditis. Discussion: Patient is a 36 year old with a history of hypothyroidism and recent bilateral breast reduction who was admitted to the MICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure with acute pulmonary edema and new reduced EF30%. Her respiratory failure has improved with diuresis. CMRI is consistent with myopericarditis. Etiology is unknown at this point. Viral workup was negative, but need to pursue additional workup for her severe acute inflammatory myopericarditis. Starting valsartan for afterload reduction and will titrate. Continue telemetry and possible limited TTE to follow up LV function appropriate in 4 – 6 days or sooner with unexplained change in clinical status. Pain control appears
