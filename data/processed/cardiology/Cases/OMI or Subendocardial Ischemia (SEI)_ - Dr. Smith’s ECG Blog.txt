OMI or Subendocardial
Ischemia (SEI)?
A 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a
benign brain tumor was awakened by chest pain and
dyspnea. She reported having similar but transient symptoms
over several months, but on this occasion, her symptoms
persisted. She contacted her primary care physician who
referred her to the emergency department due to ST-segment
depression (initial ECG unavailable). Vital signs in the ED were
as follows: BP 159/87 mmHg, oxygen saturation 99%, RR
19/min, and she was afebrile. The below ECG was recorded.

ECG #1
What do you think?
Smith: I would say this is a posterior and high lateral OMI,
strongly suggestive of circumflex occlusion (STD max V3-4;
STD inferior reciprocal to STE in aVL), so one should activate
the cath lab emergently. I have not read further yet and am
interested to know what is coming.
