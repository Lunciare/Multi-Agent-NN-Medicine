OMI or Subendocardial
Ischemia (SEI)?
A 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a
benign brain tumor was awakened by chest pain and
dyspnea. She reported having similar but transient symptoms
over several months, but on this occasion, her symptoms
persisted. She contacted her primary care physician who
referred her to the emergency department due to ST-segment
depression (initial ECG unavailable). Vital signs in the ED were
as follows: BP 159/87 mmHg, oxygen saturation 99%, RR
19/min, and she was afebrile. The below ECG was recorded.
What do you think?
ECG #1
What do you think?
Smith: I would say this is a posterior and high lateral OMI,
strongly suggestive of circumflex occlusion (STD max V3-4;
STD inferior reciprocal to STE in aVL), so one should activate
the cath lab emergently. I have not read further yet and am
interested to know what is coming.

Magnus continues:
There is sinus rhythm with a heart rate of about 100 bpm.
QRS complexes are narrow with ST-segment depression in
leads II, III, aVF, and V3-V6. (Lead V2 also likely has ST
depression, though baseline artifact makes this difficult to
asses properly).
As emphasized repeatedly on this blog, ST depression due to
subendocardial ischemia does not localize and cannot
identify the specific ischemic territory. When evaluating ST
depression in the context of ACS it is important to
differentiate OMI from subendocardial ischemia as the causes
and treatment can differ. Also it is important to remember that
SEI and OMI may be present in the same ECG. Aslanger
pattern is an example of this.
In general, the presence of tachycardia is more suggestive of
a supply/demand imbalance (type II MI) rather than focal
occlusion, unless the ejection fraction is severely reduced or
mechanical complications is present.
Smith: this is very mild tachycardia, at approximately 102
beats per min.
Back to the case: The patient received morphine for pain
relief, with reported symptom improvement. It is unclear if she
became pain free. Initial high-sensitivity troponin I returned
elevated (2280 ng/L, ref <16). She was admitted with a
working diagnosis of NSTEMI.
Smith: morphine is terrible if you are not committed to the
cath lab.
Magnus: Whenever there is inferior ST depression it is
important to examine high lateral leads, as subtle ST elevation
here may be a clue to lateral OMI. The ST segment in aVL in
ECG #1 is shows very slight STE, which in the context of
widespread ST depression, should alert the provider to the
possibility of lateral OMI being present. If I had cared for this
patient I would have repeated the ECG to assess for dynamic
changes and attempted a better-quality recording, especially
of lead V2. Also, I would have withheld morphine as it may
mask ongoing symptoms, complicating clinical assessment.
If symptoms persist despite optimal therapy, urgent
angiography is indicated regardless of whether the ST
depression represents OMI or subendocardial ischemia from
ACS.

A follow-up ECG obtained the next morning showed sinus
tachycardia and persistent ST depression, now clearly
maximal in V2. Drs. Meyers and Smith demonstrated that
maximal ST depression in V1-V4 in acute coronary syndrome
is highly specific for OMI. The specificity of ischemic STD
max V1-V4 was 97% for OMI. Ischemic STD maximal in leads
V1-V4 is OMI until proven otherwise, in contrast to STD
maximal in V5-6 which is usually SEI (non-occlusive
ischemia). There is one exception to this general rule: In
atrial fibrillation with RVR, the SEI without OMI often manifests
as maximal STD in V1-4.
The patient eventually underwent coronary angiography,
which revealed diffuse (triple vessel) coronary disease and a
subtotal LCx occlusion. Peak troponin I reached 18.911 ng/L
(ref < 16ng/L). Echocardiography showed a posterolateral
wall motion abnormality. Despite the delayed treatment this
patient did well. At cath there was a subtotal occlusion and it
is likely that there was some reperfusion-reocclusion during
her hospital stay with the reperfusion episode(s) minimizing
myocardial damage.
How did the Queen of hearts interpret the initial ECG? The AI
model flags both ECGs as OMI. This is interesting, as she is
not influenced by the tachycardia and does see OMI pattern
through the diffuse ST depression of SEI (which is clearly also
present).

Learning Points
Relief or persistence of symptoms is key for ongoing
management; the use of morphine may mask symptom
progression.
Differentiation between OMI and subendocardial
ischemia on ECG can be challenging and sometimes
both processes overlap.
Even if it is SEI (and not OMI), if there are persistent
ischemic symptoms refractory to Nitroglycerine, the
patient needs the cath lab emergently.
All pain will respond to morphine, even if there is ongong
ischemia and infarction, so donʼt give morphine until
committed to emergent cath lab.
ST depression in inferior or precordial leads requires
close scrutiny of high lateral leads and possible repeat
ECGs to detect dynamic changes.
Opiates are associated with worse outcomes in Myocardial
Infarction.
See this case: A man his 50s with chest pain. What happens
when you treat with morphine rather than with reperfusion?
—-See this study showing an association between morphine
and mortality in ACS:
Use of Morphine in ACS is independently associated with
mortality, at odds ratio of 1.4. Meine TJ, Roe M, Chen A, Patel

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/30/2025 )
Todayʼs case by Dr. Nossen features a 79-year old woman
who was awakened byCP (Chest Pain) and dyspnea. When
her CP persisted — this patient contacted her primary care
physician, who referred her to theED (Emergency
Department) due to “ST depression”on her officeECG
(which unfortunately is not available).
KEY Point #1: The initial ECG in todayʼs case ( = ECG #1)
— is the initial ECG that was recorded in the ED. Itʼs
important to appreciate that our lack of access to the
office ECG (which was done some amount of time
beforeECG #1) highlights our loss of a “golden
opportunity” to make a definitive diagnosis of an acute
OMI from the initial ED ECG(thereby potentially
reducing the time until activation of the cath labby
many hours!).
Simply stated — we lack the following: — i) Knowing
what the relativeseverity of this patientʼs symptoms
were at the time she was seen by her primary care
physician? (and at the time thatECG #1was recorded);
— ii) We lack the ability to compare the office ECG with
the initial ED ECG to see if there have been “dynamic“
ECG changes between these 2 tracings; — and, iii) We
lack the ability to correlate the relative severity of CP
with ECG findings in the office ECG and the initial ED
ECG that was done “X” number of minutes (hours?) after
the office ECG was done (ie, reduction or increase in CP

severity in association with improved or worsening “ST
depression” could have provided KEY correlation data
regarding acuity and status of the “culprit” vessel [ie,
open or closed]).
= = =
KEY Point #2: In addition to the important Learning
Points put forth by Dr. Nossen — Iʼd emphasize that in
this high-risk patient (given older age; recent history of
intermittent CP — with very worrisome history that
prompted her ED visit, of being awakened by CP and
dyspnea) — a repeat ECG in the ED should have been
donewithinno more than 15-30 minutes afterECG #1
(instead of waiting until the next morning).
= = =
For clarity and ease of comparison in Figure-1 — Iʼve put the
first 2 ECGs in todayʼs case together.
As per Dr. Nossen — the initial ED ECG manifests
diffuse ST depression in 9/12 leads(BLUE arrows in
leads I,II,III; aVF; V3-thru-V6 — and almost certainly also
in lead V2 given the first 2 BLUE arrows in this lead) —
in association with ST elevation in lead aVR (RED arrow
in this lead).
As emphasized on many occasions in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog
(See My Comment in the March 1, 2023 post, among many
others) — this ECG pattern that we see in ECG #1 strongly
suggests DSI (Diffuse Subendocardial Ischemia = SEI
[SubEndocardial Ischemia]) — and should immediately
prompt the following diagnosticconsiderations:
Severe Coronary Disease (due to LMain, proximal LAD,
and/or severe 2- or 3-vessel disease) — which in the
right clinical context may indicate ACS
(Acute Coronary Syndrome).
Subendocardial Ischemia from anotherCause
(ie, sustained tachycardia — sinus or from some other
arrhythmia; shock/profound hypotension; GI bleeding;
anemia; etc.).
NOTE #1: Given the history in todayʼs case (being awakened
by sudden onset of severe CP) — DSI in a patient with severe
coronary disease has to rise to the top of our list of
diagnostic considerations.
NOTE #2: As has also often been emphasized in Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog — the rapidheart rate in ECG #1
(almost 100/minute) in association with the dyspnea this
patient awoke with, should suggest anotherof the

causes listed above (in addition to severe underlying
coronary disease) as the reason for her symptoms and
the ECG findings in this initial tracing.

QUESTION: What difference(s) do YOU see?

repeat ECG done the following morning.

ANSWER: What difference(s) do YOU See?
KEY Point #3: Note how much EASIER it is to identify
differences between the 2 tracings in Figure-1 — when you
compare lead-by-lead with both ECGs right next to each
other!
As per Dr. Nossen — the RED arrow in lead V2 of ECG
#2 highlights the obvious change in shape, as well as
the increase in ST depression seen in this repeat ECG
compared tothe initial ECG.
In addition — I thought there is also less marked ST
depression in most of the leads in ECG #2 compared to
ECG #1 (including less ST elevation in lead aVR!). To me
— this ECG picture in the repeat ECG now clearly
suggests both severe underlying multi-vessel coronary

disease andacute posterior OMI (given what now
clearly is maximal ST depression in lead V2! ).
KEY Point #4: Given the above findings in ECG #2 — I
have to wonder if ECG #1 would have also been
diagnostic of acute posterior OMI had the initial tracing
been immediately repeated to obtain an isoelectric
baseline! (ie, the 2nd BLUE arrow in lead V2 of ECG #1
suggests that there was maximal ST depression in this
lead on the initial ECG — and — the wandering baseline
in lead V2 invalidates the YELLOW arrow ST segments
from our consideration). Had the initial ECG been
repeated within 15-to-30 minutes with attention to
obtaining a level baseline — a definitive diagnosis might
have been reached hours earlier than what occurred.
= = =
My Final KEY Point: Although Dr. Nossen already included my
final point among his Learning Points — it bears repeating.
That is, the presence of severe underlying, multi-vessel
coronary disease will often complicate discrimination
between DSIvsacute OMIvsboth DSI + acute OMI.
In such cases — extra attention to additional
investigative modalities may be instrumental for
expediting recognition of those patients with both DSI +
acute OMI (ie, Frequent serial ECGs looking for
“dynamic” ST-T wave changes — Echo showing a
localized wall motion abnormality [as Echo did in
todayʼs case] — correlation with serial Troponins and
relative severity of the patientʼs symptoms with respect
to each of the serial ECGs recorded).
