Acute chest pain in a 50-
something: resolves,
recurs, resolves: Does the
ED ECG show “Early
Repol”?
My city of Minneapolis is being attacked and occupied by ICE
right now and it is very frightening and anxiety provoking,
especially for anyone who has brown skin. They are
constantly breaking the law. I have personally witnessed
gross and dangerous traffic violations: 1) driving 80 mph on
35W, 2) a convoy of 12 vehicles going directly through a red
light, 3) an SUV passing at 60 mph in the oncoming lane of a
city street, 4) an SUV going through a red light and then
turning left across 8 lanes of trafffic. 5) a convoy driving on a
street that is for buses only. These are just the incidents that I
have personally witnessed. I wish I had had a dashcam, but
only thought of it later.
Case
A 50-something male called 911 for acute chest pain. He had
a very significant history of MI and coronary disease with
multiple stents (to D1 and RCA), and history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy
Medics arrived and recorded these ECGs:

The pain began to improve, and serial ECGs were recorded:
ECG 2, time 2 minutes:
ECG 3, time 16 minutes

ECG 4, time 32 minutes:
Now it is normalized!
The patient was pain free at this time, and the ECGs
successively show prehospital full reperfusion.
He then arrived in the ED and had recurrent chest pain. This
is recorded at t = 58 minutes. So this is ECG 5 recorded in the
ED.
This is “The last ECG” referred to in the TITLE of the post.
What do you see now?
There is recurrent ST Elevation. There is also loss of the
previously present S-wave in V2-V5. Absence of S-wave in
V2-3 is never seen in normal variant with one exception:
sometimes (10%) the S-wave in V3 may be absent IF THERE
IS A J-WAVE. Absence of both S-wave and J-wave in V2-3 is
what I call “Terminal QRS Distortion”, and I showed that it is
never present in early repolarization (normal variant STE in
V2-V4).
In this case, there is actually J-point notching in V3!!
However, the S-wave has disappeared compared to both the
previous serial ECG and compared to the Old ECG (shown
below). So in spite of this notching, there is terminal QRS
distortion (TQRSD).

Moreover, I never call “normal variant STE” or “Early
repolarization” when there is 5 mm of ST Elevation. That is
too much. All of this is outlined in this 2012 paper. ECG

but is absent in Early Repol

Case continued
Unfortunately, the Queen of Hearts did not see it, though she
was worried about it (Indeterminate result at with a numeric
value of 0.4 — positive is 0.5 or above):
This result is from “PMCardio for Organizations.”
“Indeterminate” means that this may indeed be OMI, but
uncertain. It is not yet available on PMCardio for Individuals,
but will be soon.”
Just to prove this, letʼs look at an ECG recorded 2 months
prior on this patient:
Screenshot
This confirms that the patient normally has S-waves in V2-3,
as all early repol does.

The interventionalist stated that the ED ECG (ECG 5) was
“early repolarization”. This is clearly not true. It had
normalized prehospital, but then re-occluded.
Then the patient became pain free again.
Angiogram showed 95% LAD culprit with 3 vessel disease.
Patient was set up for CABG. No PCI was done.
Peak troponin I was 328 ng/L.
ECG after angina subsided:
This confirms spontaneous reperfusion with reconstitution
of S-waves and typical Wellens reperfusion T-waves.
Echo:
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mildly increase wall
thickness, and mildly reduced ejection fraction of 40 – 45%.
Regional wall motion abnormality-inferior and inferolateral
(from previous MI). Notice that there is no anterior wall motion
abnormality (WMA). Rapid reperfusion often results in zero
WMA; sometimes it results in a temporary WMA (“stunning”)
that resolves with time. So if you think you can diagnose ACS
with high sensitivity by obtaining a next day echo, think
again.
Learning Point:
Learn to recognize Terminal QRS Distortion (TQRSD). Here is
a terrible case of TQRSD:

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(1/19/2026):
I love the way todayʼs case provides 5 serial ECGs recorded
within the 1st hour after this patient with new CP (Chest Pain)
was seen.
I focus My Comment on the first 3 serial ECGs that were
recorded within the first 16 minutes.
Confession: I looked at the first 2 tracings — but did not
see anything by looking at ECG #1 and ECG #2
separately. I next looked at ECG #3 separately, and I
thought it looked like there was “some improvement” —
but I had trouble specifying what was better when I
looked at that tracing separately.
= = =
Try it YOURSELF!
Look at ECG #1. Then put ECG #1 aside.
Now look at ECG #2 by itself. Does it look better or
worse than ECG #1?
Now put ECGs #1 and 2 aside — and look only at ECG
#3. How much of a change is there?
Now look at all 3 tracings together in Figure-1. Compare
each tracing to the others, looking lead-by-lead to
verify the differences.

visualization — Iʼve digitized the original ECGs

Lead-by-Lead Comparison:
I thought the KEY differences in lead-to-lead comparison
were found in leads V1-thru-V4.
ECG #1 — is the most concerning tracing! There is ST
coving with subtle ST elevation in lead V1 — ST segment
straightening with at least 1.5 mm of ST elevation in lead
V2 — coving (if not bulging!) of the elevated ST segment
in lead V3 — with ST segment straightening and still 1
mm of ST elevation in lead V4.
ECG #2 — done just 2 minutes after ECG #1, already
shows improvement. The coved ST segment in lead V1
is less prominent than it was 2 minutes earlier — there is
now less ST segment straightening and less ST elevation
in lead V2 — there clearly is less ST segment “bulging”
and less J-point elevation in lead V3 — and there is
subtle decrease of the ST segment straightening in lead
V4 compared to what was seen in ECG #1.
ECG #3— has more artifact, but the change in ST-T
wave abnormalities compared to ECG #2 done 14
minutes before is remarkable. The ST segment in lead
V1 is now flat — and the amount of ST elevation is less,
now with more of an upward ST segment concavity in
leads V2,V3,V4 than was seen in ECG #2.

Appreciation of the above-noted, sometimes subtle ST-T
wave changes observed in these 3 serial tracings should not
have been needed to establish the diagnosis of an acute
ongoing OMI in need of prompt cath with PCI in todayʼs case
(as this should be evident from the initial ECG and the history
of new CP in this high-risk patient).
That said — there are many instances in the evaluation
of patients with new CP in whom detection of
“dynamic“ST-T wave changes may be the critical ECG
finding for convincing a reluctant interventionist of the
need for prompt cath and PCI.
Unless you compare serial tracings lead-by-lead with
each tracing placed next to the one you are comparing it
with — subtle-but-important ST-T wave changes will be
missed!
= = =
ADDENDUM (1/20/2026):
Additional “Learning Points” worthy of repetition from
todayʼs case include the following:
Refinement of our understanding of T-QRS-D (Terminal
QRSDistortion). I illustrated the “picture” of what is (and
what is not) T-QRS-D in My Comment at the very bottom
of the page in the May 8, 2025 post.
Dr. Smith emphasized in his above discussion how the
absence of an S wave(ie, that reaches down to the
baseline) is never seen in a normal variant with one
exception (ie, in ~10% of cases the S wave may be
absent without this being T-QRS-D — if there is a J-
wave). But in todayʼs case — ECG #5does show a J-
wave in lead V3(highlighted in Figure-2bythe BLUE
arrow in this V3 lead).
However, considering that an S wave was present in
ECGs #1, #2 and #3 (from Figure-1) — despite the J
wave that has now developed in lead V3 of ECG #5, we
shouldstill define the ECG picture in lead V3 of ECG #5
as T-QRS-D because in association with recurrence of
CP, the S wave that previously was present has now
disappeared.
Similarly — despite the J-wave seen in lead V4 of ECG
#5 — The S wave that previously was present in ECGs
#1,#2,#3 has now disappeared — so this should also
qualify as T-QRS-D.
That said — we should appreciate that the 4 BLUE
arrows in ECG #5 highlight J waves in each of these

leads! And these J waves were not seen in the prior
ECGs in todayʼs case!
The important point is that ischemic J waves may on
occasion be seen in association with ongoing acute
infarction (with this new development of J waves in ECG
#5 corresponding to recurrence of this patientʼs CP and
to recurrence of ST elevation!).
In further support that these chest leadJ waves that we
see in ECG #5 are the result of acute ischemia — is
disappearance of the J wave in lead V3 and reduced
prominence of the V4,V5 J waves in ECG #7 recorded
after CP has resolved, in association with resolution of
the ST elevation that had been present in ECG #5. (I felt
excessive artifact in the ST segment in lead V2 of ECG
#7 prevents assessment of whether or not a J wave is
truly seen).
= = =
Ischemic J Waves …
Documentation of J waves potentially serving as an ischemic
marker is forthcoming in the literature (Andreou — Cardiol J
28(4):638-639, 2021 – and – Andreou — Eur Heart J Case
Rep 6(7):ytac249, 2022).
The mechanism for development of ischemic J waves is
thought to relate to conduction delay in ischemic
myocardium and accentuation of the potassium current-
mediated action potential notch during early ventricular
repolarization in epicardium but not endocardium.
Ischemic J waves may increase in size if acute ischemia
persists and/or worsens. J waves may decrease in size
and/or disappear as CP and associated ST elevation
resolve (as was seen in todayʼs case!).
The location of J waves often localizes the “culprit”
vessel( = the BLUE arrows in ECG #5 being consistent
with acute LAD occlusion in todayʼs case).
Clinically — Development of ischemic J waves has been
shown to confer an increasedrisk of developing VFib
(thought to reflect the increase in transmural dispersion
of ventricular repolarization that these J waves serve as
a marker for).

minutes — when CP recurs! ) — with ECG #7 (recorded some
time after ECG #5 — when CP had completely resolved).
