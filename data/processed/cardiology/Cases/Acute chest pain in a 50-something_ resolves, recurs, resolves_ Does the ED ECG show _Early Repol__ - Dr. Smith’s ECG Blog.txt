something: resolves,
recurs, resolves: Does the
ED ECG show “Early
Repol”?
My city of Minneapolis is being attacked and occupied by ICE
right now and it is very frightening and anxiety provoking,
especially for anyone who has brown skin. They are
constantly breaking the law. I have personally witnessed
gross and dangerous traffic violations: 1) driving 80 mph on
35W, 2) a convoy of 12 vehicles going directly through a red
light, 3) an SUV passing at 60 mph in the oncoming lane of a
city street, 4) an SUV going through a red light and then
turning left across 8 lanes of trafffic. 5) a convoy driving on a
street that is for buses only. These are just the incidents that I
have personally witnessed. I wish I had had a dashcam, but
only thought of it later.
Case
A 50-something male called 911 for acute chest pain. He had
a very significant history of MI and coronary disease with
multiple stents (to D1 and RCA), and history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy
Medics arrived and recorded these ECGs:

ECG 1, time zero:
What do you think?
This is diagnostic of LAD Occlusion (LAD OMI).

The pain began to improve, and serial ECGs were recorded:
ECG 2, time 2 minutes:
ECG 3, time 16 minutes

ECG 4, time 32 minutes:
Now it is normalized!
The patient was pain free at this time, and the ECGs
successively show prehospital full reperfusion.
He then arrived in the ED and had recurrent chest pain. This
is recorded at t = 58 minutes. So this is ECG 5 recorded in the
ED.
This is “The last ECG” referred to in the TITLE of the post.
What do you see now?
There is recurrent ST Elevation. There is also loss of the
previously present S-wave in V2-V5. Absence of S-wave in
V2-3 is never seen in normal variant with one exception:
sometimes (10%) the S-wave in V3 may be absent IF THERE
IS A J-WAVE. Absence of both S-wave and J-wave in V2-3 is
what I call “Terminal QRS Distortion”, and I showed that it is
never present in early repolarization (normal variant STE in
V2-V4).
In this case, there is actually J-point notching in V3!!
However, the S-wave has disappeared compared to both the
previous serial ECG and compared to the Old ECG (shown
below). So in spite of this notching, there is terminal QRS
distortion (TQRSD).

Moreover, I never call “normal variant STE” or “Early
repolarization” when there is 5 mm of ST Elevation. That is
too much. All of this is outlined in this 2012 paper. ECG

And the proof of the significance of terminal QRS distortion is
here. Terminal QRS Distortion may be Present in LAD OMI
but is absent in Early Repol

was worried
