A woman in her late 70s presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. An ECG was obtained. Initial ECG (ECG 1) The rhythm was regular, narrow complex tachycardia and was initially interpreted as atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block. The patient received metoprolol 5 mg IV and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm. Reconsidering the Diagnosis Metoprolol does not cardiovert atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation; it only slows AV nodal conduction. While spontaneous conversion is possible, successful conversion after metoprolol strongly suggests the rhythm was not atrial flutter.
