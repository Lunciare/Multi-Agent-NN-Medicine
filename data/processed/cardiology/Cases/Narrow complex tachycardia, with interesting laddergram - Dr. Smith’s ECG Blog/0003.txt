brief burst of atrial ectopy occurred (P waves 5–9). Early atrial impulses conducted via the fast pathway. Subsequent impulses found the fast pathway refractory and conducted via the slow pathway, producing progressively longer PR intervals (decremental conduction). One atrial impulse conducted extremely slowly down the slow pathway; by the time it reached the distal AV node, the fast pathway had recovered, initiating re-entry. Because the resulting rate was <100 bpm, this was termed atrioventricular nodal reentrant arrhythmia, rather than tachycardia. Definitive Management The patient underwent electrophysiology study, which demonstrated easily inducible AVNRT. She underwent successful ablation. Learning Points Compare QRS morphology between sinus rhythm and SVT to detect concealed atrial activity, especially a pseudo R′. Telemetry heart rate trend lines are valuable for identifying arrhythmia onset and termination. Abrupt termination of a narrow-complex tachycardia with AV nodal blockers strongly favors a node-dependent mechanism (AVNRT or AVRT).
