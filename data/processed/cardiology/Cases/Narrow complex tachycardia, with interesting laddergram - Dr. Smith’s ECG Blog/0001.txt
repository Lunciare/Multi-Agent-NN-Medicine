Case Summary

A woman in her late 70s presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. An ECG was obtained. Initial ECG (ECG 1) The rhythm was regular, narrow complex tachycardia and was initially interpreted as atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block. The patient received metoprolol 5 mg IV and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm. Reconsidering the Diagnosis Metoprolol does not cardiovert atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation; it only slows AV nodal conduction. While spontaneous conversion is possible, successful conversion after metoprolol strongly suggests the rhythm was not atrial flutter. Alternative diagnoses for a regular narrow-complex tachycardia include: AVNRT AVRT Atrial tachycardia To differentiate SVT mechanisms, comparison of QRS morphology between sinus rhythm and tachycardia is useful to detect concealed atrial activity. Key ECG Clue (Lead V3) Side-by-side comparison of lead V3 showed: Loss of the R wave during tachycardia (possibly lead position–related) A terminally positive deflection at the end of the QRS during tachycardia This terminal deflection cannot be explained by lead placement and is most consistent with atrial activity. Using marching calipers showed no additional P wave halfway between beats, excluding 2:1 flutter conduction. This terminal deflection represents a “pseudo R′”, a classic finding of typical AVNRT (often
