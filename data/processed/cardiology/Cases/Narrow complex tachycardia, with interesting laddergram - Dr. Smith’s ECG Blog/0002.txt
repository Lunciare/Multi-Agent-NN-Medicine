Case Summary

activity. Using marching calipers showed no additional P wave halfway between beats, excluding 2:1 flutter conduction. This terminal deflection represents a “pseudo R′”, a classic finding of typical AVNRT (often best seen in V1, but in this case visible in V3). Mechanism of Typical AVNRT Typical AVNRT occurs in patients with dual AV nodal pathways: A fast pathway A slow pathway During sinus rhythm: Impulses enter both pathways The fast pathway reaches the ventricles first Slow pathway conduction arrives when the His–Purkinje system is refractory and is electrically silent (“concealed conduction”) Clinical Course The patient was discharged on amiodarone and therapeutic anticoagulation. Several days later, she re-presented with dizziness. ECG showed junctional bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s. Amiodarone was held and she was admitted. Telemetry Findings Telemetry heart rate trend showed an abrupt rate change, prompting rhythm review. Rhythm Interpretation (Laddergram Explanation) Initial beats were junctional escape beats with antegrade ventricular conduction and retrograde conduction up both AV nodal pathways, with concealed conduction via the slow pathway. A brief burst of atrial ectopy occurred (P waves 5–9). Early atrial impulses conducted via the fast pathway. Subsequent impulses found the fast pathway refractory and conducted via the slow pathway,
