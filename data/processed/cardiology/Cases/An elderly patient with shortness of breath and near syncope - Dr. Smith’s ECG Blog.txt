An elderly patient with
shortness of breath and
near syncope
Written by Pendell Meyers
An elderly patient experienced a week of shortness of breath on
exertion, with acute worsening including near syncope and severe
fatigue. She called EMS, who recorded this ECG on the way to the
hospital:

What do you think?
On arrival at the Emergency Department, she appeared critically ill,
and had severe hypotension but was alert and oriented and able to
follow commands.
There is sinus rhythm at around 100 bpm. The QRS morphology
alternates between two morphologies. The P waves are regular, the
PR intervals are similar, and the QRS duration is similar
throughout. This is electrical alternans.
Here is her initial ED ECG: 

Here is a prior ECG available from months ago:
No alternans.
A bedside echo revealed the large pericardial effusion, with
tamponade physiology confirmed clinically and ultrasonographically.

An emergent pericardiocentesis was performed in the cath lab, with
700 cc of fluid removed with immediate improvement in
hemodynamics.
The effusion was felt to be related to the patientʼs known cancer.
Ultimately she improved during the hospitalization and returned to her
previous state of health.

Dyspnea on Exertion in a Middle Aged Woman.
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (3/21/2025):
===================================
Today’s case by Dr. Meyers is a “Must KNOW” entity for emergency care
providers.
The patient is an elderly woman, who contacted EMS because of a
1-week history of worsening dyspnea on exertion — severe fatigure
— and near syncope.
Although alert on arrival in the ED — she was markedly hypotensive
and appeared critically ill.
Notable in her past medical history is
a known diagnosis of cancer.
KEY Point: Given the above information — recognition of the cause of
this elderly patient’s acute critical illness should be suspected within 1
minute of seeing the patient and seeing the ECG.
In Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced the initial ECG recorded in the ED.
As per Dr. Meyers — the long lead II rhythm strip shows a rapid
sinus rhythm at ~90-95/minute, with a narrow QRS complex
and alternating QRS morphology every-other-beat.
P wave morphology and the PR interval
do not change throughout this tracing (as would be expected if the
reason for the alternating QRS morphology was the result of
intermittent preexcitation or late-cycle premature junctional or
ventricular beats).
T wave morphology does not change from beat-to-beat (as would
be expected if the alternating QRS morphology was the result of
some form of intermittent bundle branch block).
Instead — each even-numbered beat in the long lead II rhythm
strip manifests decreased R wave amplitude with a prominent J-
wave that is not present in odd-numbered beats (RED arrows
highlighting J-waves in several leads).
PEARL #1: If you “step back” a bit from the tracing — Isn’t there
a pendulum-like movement from the peak of the QRS from
one odd-numbered beat to the next? (ie, downsloping dotted RED
lines alternating with upsloping dotted BLUE lines).
PEARL #2: Did you notice the low voltage? (with this finding most
marked for even-numbered beats in the limb leads).

PEARL #3: Why is the known history of cancer relevant to today’s
case?
Figure-1: The initial ECG in the ED.
DISCUSSION:
As per Dr. Meyers — the alternating QRS morphology seen in Figure-
1 represents electrical alternans.
As noted in My Comment in the October 23, 2023 post — the
various forms of electrical alternans are frequently misunderstood, if
not all-too-often overlooked.
PEARL #4: Electrical alternans is most commonly encountered by
emergency providers in association
with supraventricular tachycardias (especially for the reentry SVT
rhythms of AVRT and AVNRT). Although other entities may produce
various forms of alternans (as discussed in the Oct. 23, 2023
post) — the recognition of alternans in a regular SVT rhyhm without
atrial activity provides a clue that the mechanism of the SVT
rhythm is likely to be reentry (See Figure-3 below for an example of
this).
The above said — the importance of recognizing electrical alternans in
today’s case relates to it association with the presence of
a large pericardial effusion.
To Emphasize: The overall sensitivity of electrical alternans for
smaller pericardial effusions is poor. Even with larger effusions — its
sensitivity is limited.
That said — the likelihood of a large pericardial effusion is increased
in today’s case by the additional ECG findings in Figure-
1 of low voltage and the pendulum-like variation in the peak of
the QRS from one odd-numbered beat to the next.
Verification of a large pericardial effusion was immediately
forthcoming in today’s case by Echo at the bedside (as shown
above by Dr. Meyers’ with several still ultrasound images ).
More than just a large pericardial effusion — concern
for cardiac tamponade was raised by this patient’s critical clinical

condition (severe dyspnea — near syncope — marked hypotension
in the ED) — and as per Dr. Meyers, by signs of tamponade
physiology on physical exam and Echo (the parameters to look for
described in the November 28, 2022 post and in Jensen et al: ESC
15(17), 2017). Fortunately — emergent pericardiocentesis with
removal of 700 cc of fluid relieved the patient’s symptoms.
The history of cancer in today’s patient is relevant — because
malignancy is by far the most common non-traumatic cause of
cardiac tamponade.
To better illustrate the “swinging heart” pathophysiology of a
large pericardial effusion — I show in Figure-2 the ultrasound
recording that I’ve excerpted from another case in Dr. Smith’s ECG
Blog. Looking at this swinging heart recording in Figure-2 helps to
explain the pendulum-like movement from one odd-numbered beat
to the next that I highlighted with dotted BLUE and RED lines
in Figure-1.
