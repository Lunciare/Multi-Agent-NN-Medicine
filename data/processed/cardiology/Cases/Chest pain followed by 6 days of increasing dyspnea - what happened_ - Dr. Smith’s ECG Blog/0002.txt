The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

potentially salvageable myocardium. Hyperacute T waves are present, which are a sign of acute infarction even in the presence of Q waves. The presence of Q waves does not rule out acute occlusion myocardial infarction and may represent acute infarction superimposed on an old infarct. Inferior Lead Findings Inferior lead ST elevation does not have a typical ischemic appearance. The ST segments are upwardly concave with distinct J waves in leads II and aVF. There is slight PR segment depression. These findings are more consistent with pericarditis. Post-infarction regional pericarditis is typically localized to the infarct territory rather than diffuse. Diagnostic Considerations The ECG findings may represent: Acute anterior wall myocardial infarction with early Q-wave development, or Subacute transmural myocardial infarction complicated by post-infarction regional pericarditis. Clinical correlation is essential for appropriate management. Clinical History and Final Interpretation Due to severe dementia, the patient was unable to provide a reliable history. His wife reported a brief episode of chest discomfort six days prior, followed by progressive dyspnea. He was evaluated four days earlier and treated empirically for pneumonia without improvement. The ECG and clinical history are consistent with a subacute transmural infarction in the left anterior descending artery territory, complicated
