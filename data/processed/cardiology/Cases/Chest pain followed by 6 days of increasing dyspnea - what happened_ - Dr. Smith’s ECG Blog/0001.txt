The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

Two clinical scenarios are considered: Scenario 1: Presentation with 24 hours of substernal chest pain. Scenario 2: Presentation with 6 days of increasing dyspnea. The second scenario was the actual presentation. Initial ECG Interpretation The ECG shows sinus rhythm at approximately 94 beats per minute. QRS complexes are narrow. The frontal plane QRS axis is close to vertical at approximately 90 degrees. There is ST segment elevation in both the precordial and inferior limb leads. Precordial Lead Findings Leads V2 and V3 show minimal R waves followed by deep S waves and ST elevation. Lead V4 shows a QS complex followed by ST elevation. Leads V3 and V4 each demonstrate approximately 6 mm of ST elevation. There is some R wave present in the lateral precordial leads. Although QS waves raise consideration of left ventricular aneurysm, the ST-to-QRS ratio and T-wave-to-QRS ratio are far too large and not compatible with left ventricular aneurysm. There is substantial area under the ST segment and T waves, consistent with significant ECG “acuity” and potentially salvageable myocardium. Hyperacute T waves are present, which are a sign of acute infarction even in the presence of Q waves. The presence of Q waves does not rule
