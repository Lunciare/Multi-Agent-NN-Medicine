The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

T waves may represent either acute myocardial infarction or subacute completed infarction with post-infarction pericarditis. Post-infarction regional pericarditis implies complete transmural infarction and increased risk of myocardial rupture. Mechanical complications of transmural infarction are rare but carry high morbidity and mortality. A new harsh systolic murmur in a patient with subacute myocardial infarction suggests ventricular septal rupture or papillary muscle rupture until proven otherwise. Clinical correlation is essential in all cases.
