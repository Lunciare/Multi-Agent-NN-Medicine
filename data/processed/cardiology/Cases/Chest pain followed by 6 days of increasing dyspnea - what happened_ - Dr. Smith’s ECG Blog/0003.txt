The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

four days earlier and treated empirically for pneumonia without improvement. The ECG and clinical history are consistent with a subacute transmural infarction in the left anterior descending artery territory, complicated by post-infarction regional pericarditis. Persistently large upright anterior T waves and inferior ST elevation are consistent with subacute infarction and pericardial inflammation. Patients should not be denied revascularization solely based on symptom duration, as myocardial viability may persist due to transient reperfusion or collateral circulation. ECG, clinical history, and echocardiography together should guide catheterization decisions. Post-Infarction Regional Pericarditis (PIRP) Post-infarction regional pericarditis is a complication of transmural myocardial infarction and is more common with delayed or absent reperfusion. ECG features suggestive of PIRP include: Persistently upright T waves more than 48–72 hours after myocardial infarction Premature reversal of inverted T waves to upright deflections in the presence of well-formed Q waves Upright T waves beyond 72 hours after acute myocardial infarction should prompt consideration of PIRP. Pseudonormalization of T waves may be due to: Re-occlusion of the infarct-related artery Post-infarction regional pericarditis Echocardiographic Findings and Mechanical Complications Bedside echocardiography demonstrated regional wall motion abnormality involving the distal septum and apical left ventricle. The myocardium appeared thickened due to edema, consistent
