The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia who presented to the emergency department.

regional pericarditis Echocardiographic Findings and Mechanical Complications Bedside echocardiography demonstrated regional wall motion abnormality involving the distal septum and apical left ventricle. The myocardium appeared thickened due to edema, consistent with pseudohypertrophy. High-velocity turbulent flow through the distal interventricular septum was identified, consistent with ventricular septal rupture. A new harsh holosystolic murmur was present. Ventricular septal rupture results in left-to-right shunting, reduced cardiac output, pulmonary edema, and shock. Prognosis and Pathophysiology Ventricular septal rupture following myocardial infarction carries an extremely poor prognosis without surgical correction. Mechanical complications such as ventricular septal rupture, free wall rupture, and papillary muscle rupture are more likely in elderly patients, those with delayed or absent reperfusion, and first myocardial infarction without prior ischemic preconditioning. Ventricular septal rupture typically occurs 1–14 days after myocardial infarction, with bimodal peaks within 24 hours and again at 3–5 days. Necrotic myocardium is fragile, with maximal tissue breakdown around day 7. Surgical timing must balance hemodynamic stabilization with tissue integrity. Learning Points QS waves with persistent ST elevation and/or hyperacute T waves may represent either acute myocardial infarction or subacute completed infarction with post-infarction pericarditis. Post-infarction regional pericarditis implies complete transmural infarction and increased risk of myocardial rupture. Mechanical complications
