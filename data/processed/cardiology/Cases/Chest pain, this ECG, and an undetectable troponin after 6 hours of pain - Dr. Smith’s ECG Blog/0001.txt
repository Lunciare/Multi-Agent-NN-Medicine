A middle-aged male presented with acute chest pain.

An initial ECG was recorded. There are definite hyperacute T-waves in leads V4 and V5. This ECG is diagnostic of LAD occlusion. A prior ECG from 9 months earlier was available for comparison. The T-waves on the current ECG are hyperacute compared to the prior tracing. A repeat ECG was recorded. The T-waves appeared bulkier and fatter. This was unequivocally diagnostic of LAD occlusion (OMI). The physician activated the cath lab, which required transfer to another hospital. Shortly thereafter, the initial troponin returned undetectable. The physician became concerned that this was a false activation. Angiography did not show an unequivocal occlusion but revealed an 80% LAD stenosis with an unstable-appearing plaque. The undetectable troponin increased skepticism that this was OMI, despite the ECG findings. It was emphasized that an initial undetectable troponin is not unusual in acute OMI, even after several hours of chest pain. A second troponin I later returned at 4461 ng/L. No further troponins were measured at that time. A post-PCI ECG was recorded and showed residual hyperacute T-waves. Several hours later, another ECG suggested possible re-occlusion, with recurrent hyperacute T-waves and new ST elevation in leads V4–V6 meeting criteria for occlusion. Ultimately, the LAD reperfused, with
