A middle-aged male presented with acute chest pain.

T-waves in contiguous anterior leads strongly indicate acute LAD occlusion, even when other leads are non-diagnostic. Misplacement of precordial leads can obscure or confuse interpretation, but does not negate diagnostic findings in correctly placed leads. In the setting of new chest pain and diagnostic ECG changes, immediate activation of the cath lab is warranted regardless of initial troponin results.
