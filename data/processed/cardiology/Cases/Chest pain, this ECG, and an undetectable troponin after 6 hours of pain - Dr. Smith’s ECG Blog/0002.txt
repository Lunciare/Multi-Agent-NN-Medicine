A middle-aged male presented with acute chest pain.

hyperacute T-waves. Several hours later, another ECG suggested possible re-occlusion, with recurrent hyperacute T-waves and new ST elevation in leads V4–V6 meeting criteria for occlusion. Ultimately, the LAD reperfused, with subsequent ECGs showing T-wave inversion in the affected leads consistent with reperfusion. Peak troponin I reached 10,220 ng/L. Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 60–65% with mild septal wall hypokinesis. Learning Points When an ECG is diagnostic of OMI, do not wait for troponin results: Myocardial tissue is lost while waiting. An initially negative troponin may delay definitive care. Six hours of chest pain does not necessarily mean six hours of infarction. Ischemia may be intermittent, and sustained infarction may begin later. An undetectable initial troponin has high negative predictive value only in the setting of a normal or non-diagnostic ECG. In the presence of a diagnostic ECG, an undetectable troponin is unreliable. ECG Interpretation Insights Hyperacute T-waves are characterized by disproportionately tall, bulky, and wide-based T-waves that may appear large enough to obscure the R wave. Hyperacute T-waves in contiguous anterior leads strongly indicate acute LAD occlusion, even when other leads are non-diagnostic. Misplacement of precordial leads can obscure or confuse interpretation, but does not negate diagnostic
