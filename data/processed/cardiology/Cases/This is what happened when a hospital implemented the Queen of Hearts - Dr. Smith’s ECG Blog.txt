Case Summary

A patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain that began ~24 hours prior to arrival. An ECG was obtained immediately at triage. At this hospital, the Queen of Hearts (QOH) AI system is routinely used to determine cath lab activation.

Initial ECG Findings

The triage ECG demonstrated:

ST depression maximal in V1–V4, diagnostic of posterior OMI

Subtle ST elevation and mildly hyperacute T wave in V6, consistent with lateral/posterior involvement (V6 is anatomically close to posterior leads)

These findings are not de Winter T waves (which indicate LAD occlusion with depressed ST takeoff and hyperacute T waves)

QOH analyzed the ECG and diagnosed OMI with high confidence, triggering automatic cath lab activation without physician delay.

Intervention and Outcomes

Door-to-balloon time was extremely short

100% circumflex artery occlusion was identified and opened with stenting

High-sensitivity troponin T later returned at 1400 ng/L

This case illustrates that AI-based ECG interpretation diagnosed OMI faster than troponin

Additional ECGs and Evolution

Right-sided ECG (V3R–V6R) showed ST depression (expected opposite posterior wall); no ST elevation suggestive of RV MI

Immediate post-PCI ECG showed larger T waves in V2–V3, consistent with posterior reperfusion T waves

Reperfusion in posterior myocardium produces anterior T-wave augmentation (inversion posteriorly appears as increased anterior T-wave amplitude)

These are not hyperacute T waves, which occur during active occlusion

ECG at ~90 minutes post-PCI showed continued recovery with normalization of ST segments

Median-beat overlays across ECGs highlighted resolution of ST depression and posterior reperfusion T waves

Expert Interpretation (Key ECG Pearls)

Posterior OMI often presents with anterior ST depression rather than classic ST elevation

Lead V3 is critical: instead of normal slight upsloping ST elevation, ST straightening/depression is abnormal and concerning

Lead placement issues (e.g., V1–V2 placed too high) can complicate interpretation but did not obscure diagnosis here

Subtle lateral changes (e.g., in V6) can support posterior OMI when paired with anterior ST depression

Clinical Impact

Prompt AI recognition enabled rapid reperfusion, likely improving myocardial salvage

Demonstrates the value of AI-assisted ECG analysis in accelerating diagnosis of OMI without STEMI criteria

Highlights that posterior OMI can be missed without careful ECG analysis or advanced tools

Key Learning Points

Posterior OMI may present with ST depression in V1–V4 and subtle lateral changes

QOH can accurately and rapidly identify OMI, reducing delays to reperfusion

Posterior reperfusion T waves manifest as increased anterior T-wave amplitude post-PCI

AI can outperform troponin timing for early OMI detection

Bottom Line

Routine implementation of AI ECG analysis (QOH) enabled immediate recognition and treatment of posterior OMI, resulting in rapid cath lab activation, successful revascularization, and likely improved patient outcomes.
