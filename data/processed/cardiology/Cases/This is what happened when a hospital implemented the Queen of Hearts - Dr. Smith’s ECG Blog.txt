This is what happened
when a hospital
implemented the Queen of
Hearts
This patient had the onset of chest pain 24 hours before arrival to the
ED. An ECG was recorded immediately at triage and, at this hospital,
the Queen of Hearts is routinely used to determine cath lab
activation.
Here is that ECG:

There is ST depression maximal in V1-V4, which is diagnostic of posterior
OMI. There is some ST Elevation and slightly hyperacute T-wave in V6.
This is a common finding in posterior OMI because V6 is “almost” around
to the back, near where posterior leads would be placed.
These are NOT de Winter’s T-waves, which are hyperacute T-waves with
depressed ST takeoff due to LAD Occlusion. What not de Winter’s?
Here is the PMcardio version:
 
Because the Queen diagnosed OMI with High Confidence, the cath lab was
activated without bothering a physician.
The door to balloon time was incredibly short and there was a 100%
circumflex occlusion that was opened and stented.
Then the high sensitivity troponin T returned at 1400 ng/L.
The Non-STEMI, which was an OMI, was diagnosed much faster with AI
on the ECG than with troponin.

There was also a right sided ECG recorded, I am not sure why:

V3R-V6R are opposite the posterior wall (what would be V7-
V9 and opposite V6, and so they all have ST depression).
There is no ST Elevation in these leads, which is what one
usually looks for in right sided leads in order to find an RV MI.
Here was an ECG recorded immediately post PCI:
Notice the T-waves in V2 and V3 are larger.
These are “Posterior Reperfusion T-waves.”
Reperfusion results in T-wave inversion in leads overlying the affected
myocardium. We do not have leads overlying the posterior wall; the only
leads detecting the posterior wall are anterior. T-wave inversion on the
posterior wall shows up as increased T-wave amplitude in the anterior
leads. These are added to the normal upright T-waves of the anterior wall
and result in LARGER anterior T-waves than normal. These are NOT
hyperacute T-waves, which are only present when the OMI is active, not
reperfused.
I described “Posterior Reperfusion T-waves” in this article. It
had never been described before.
90 minutes later, this ECG was recorded:

There is not a lot of difference between post PCI and 90 minutes later
Here is an overlay of the Median Beats of all 3 ECGs:
Here you can really appreciate the posterior reperfusion T-
wave in lead V2, and recovery of the ST segment from
depressed to normal.

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (10/6/2024):
===================================
Today’s case provides an excellent example of how prompt
recognition of acute OMI worked as it should to expedite cardiac
cath and coronary reperfusion.

I focus my comment on the initial ECG — that I’ve
reproduced in Figure-1.
My Thoughts on Today’s ECG:
The rhythm in Figure-1 is sinus at ~85/minute. All intervals
(PR-QRS-QTc) are normal. There is no chamber
enlargement.
I wonder if this patient had pulmonary disease? —
because: i) Overall, there is relatively low voltage; ii) There
is minimal QRS amplitude in lead I (almost a Schamroth
Sign — as described in My Comment in the June 17,
2018 post in Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog); iii) The frontal plane
axis is almost indeterminate (nearly isoelectric complexes in
most limb leads); iv) Diffuse S waves are seen (ie, in leads
I,II,III — and throughout the chest leads to lead
V6); and, v) Criteria are present for incomplete RBBB (rSr’
in V1 with terminal s waves in leads I and V6).
The relevance of recognizing pulmonary disease on ECG —
is that this may sometimes render assessment for acute
OMI more difficult — although this was not the case in
today’s tracing. (For more on ECG findings in pulmonary
disease — Check out My Comment in the May 31,
2024 post in Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog).
Also relevant to today’s tracing — is the likelihood that
the lead V1,V2 electrodes have been placed too high on
the chest — because: i) There are surprisingly deep
negative P waves in both leads V1,V2; — ii) There is an rSr’
in both V1,V2; — and, iii) The QRST complex in leads
V1,V2 resembles the QRST in lead aVR (See My Comment
in the November 4, 2018 post).
Given the importance of ST-T wave assessment in the
anterior leads for today’s case — recognizing faulty lead
placement of leads V1,V2 may hinder diagnosis of OMI (and
may sometimes merit correcting electrode lead placement
with repeat ECG).
The above said — in today’s patient with a convincing history of
chest pain, this initial ECG in Figure-1 was all that was needed
for prompt diagnosis of acute postero-lateral OMI.
There is subtle, nonspecific ST-T wave flattening in most
limb leads. I thought this was nondiagnostic.
The KEY lead in today’s case is lead V3. As often
emphasized in Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog — there is normally
slight, upward sloping ST elevation in leads V2 and V3.
Electrode lead misplacement precludes accurate

assessment of lead V2 in Figure-1 — but instead of the
expected slight, gently upsloping ST elevation in lead V3 —
the ST segment in this lead is straightened and clearly
depressed (RED arrow in V3).
Neighboring lead V4 shows less marked, but still
clearly abnormal ST segment straightening with slight ST
depression (BLUE arrow in V4).
Lead V6 shows definite ST segment straightening with slight
ST elevation. Given the isoelectric ST segment in
neighboring lead V5 (with normal upsloping of this V5 ST
segment, as it blends with the upright T wave) — I took this
as support that the subtle ST segment straightening with
slight ST elevation in lead V6 was a lateral lead hyperacute
change.
BOTOM Line: The medical care team in today’s case
promptly recognized these findings — as did QOH
(Queen Of Hearts). The result was amazingly prompt cath
with rapid, successful reperfusion.
Figure-1: The initial ECG in today’s case. (To improve visualization —
I’ve digitized the original ECG using PMcardio).
