Sudden Palpitations in a
Young Adult
Written by Magnus Nossen and Ken Grauer (with Comment by Smith)
The ECG in Figure-1 was electronically transmitted by the ambulance
service for evaluation. The patient is a young adult male with acute onset
of palpitations. He was hemodynamically stable at the time ECG #1 was
recorded.
QUESTIONS:
 
How would you interpret this ECG?
— What entities to consider in your differential diagnosis?
— How would you manage this patient?
=====================================
NOTE: The ECGs in today’s case are recorded in the Cabrera Format
(See Dr. Grauer Comment in the October 26, 2020 post of Dr. Smith’s
ECG Blog for review on the Cabrera Format).

Figure-1: The initial ECG in today’s case. (To improve visualization
— Iʼve digitized the original ECG using PMcardio).
The patient was transported by EMS to the emergency department, where
the ECG was interpreted as showing VT (Ventricular Tachycardia). The
patient was not clinically distressed, and other than the heart rate — the
vital signs were completely normal. At this point, the palpitations had been
present for approximately 3 hours.
Since the patient was stable and tolerating the arrhythmia — it was
decided to treat with IV Amiodarone for medical conversion.
Smith: What do you think?
Smith comments: The heart rate is very fast at 204. Whenever it is this
fast, you need to be very careful to ascertain whether it is irregular (as in
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular respsonse) or regular (as in VT). Use
calipers if you need to. In this case, look in the far upper right, in lead
aVL. You can easily see 4 complexes which form that last 3 RR intervals.
The interval that is 3rd from last (between 4th and 3rd from last QRS) is
310 ms. The last RR interval is only 160 ms. Thus this is irregularly
irregular. It is not VT; it is AF. Then notice that the QRS complexes are
polymorphic. This is not because it is polymorphic VT; it is because it is
WPW with atrial fibrillation. Any of leads V2-V5 have polymorphic QRS
complexes. The last feature which cements the diagnosis of AF with WPW
is that very short RR interval of 160 ms. That really only happens in AF
WPW and also makes it very dangerous to give an AV nodal blocker.
How about the management of giving Amiodarone?:
This could be a big mistake. Amiodarone is an AV nodal blocker and
theoretically could result in VFib (Ventricular Fibrillation). However, a
relatively recent paper found that 18 of 30 stable patients with AF and
WPW converted to sinus and no ventricular acceleration or VF developed.
(ref 1)

Here is the Introduction to that paper:
“Though several cases reported IV Amiodarone could accelerate heart
rate or even promote rapid ventricular rate into VFib — the adverse events
were developed in patients who commonly suffered
from hemodynamic compromise. Hence, the IV Amiodarone was once one
of the 2nd-line choices for acute pharmacologic cardioversion in such
patients without hemodynamic instability.
The 2019
ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with
supraventricular
tachycardia indicated that IV Amiodarone should not be considered
in these populations. Nevertheless, this recommendation is still
based on the papers published before 2006.”
It may be safe to give IV Amiodarone. But why would you want to?
Why not just sedate and cardiovert, which is known to be safe?
Of course the providers in this case gave Amiodarone because they
thought this was VT. Had they known it was AF with WPW, perhaps they
would have cardioverted?
=====================================
Continuation of Today’s CASE:
The ECG was repeated while IV Amiodarone was being infused (Figure-
2).
Why is the ECG in Figure-2 pathognomonic of the diagnosis?

Figure-2: The repeat ECG (during Amiodarone infusion).
The ECG in Figure-2:
The repeat ECG is pathognomonic for WPW:
ECG #2 shows an irregularly irregular WCT(Wide
Complex Tachycardia).
The initial QRS deflection is slow and the QRS is very
wide, measuring >160msec.
There is QRS polymorphism — but importantly, the axis
in the limb leads does not change. (If this was
polymorphic VT — the axis would change!).
In certain parts of the tracing — the RR intervals are
extremely short (See Figure-3 below for a magnified
excerpt from Figure-2, during which the R-R interval is
exceeding short).
Figure-3: Magnified view of that portion of ECG #2 in which the rate is
fastest.
The paper speed in Figure-3 is 25 mm/second. Therefore —
each small box is 40 msec. in duration.

--- Страница 5 ---
22/01/2026, 15:31 Sudden Palpitations in a Young Adult - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
The shortestR-R interval in Figure-3 is marginally
longer than 4 small boxes, measuring 170 msec. in
duration. This corresponds to a ventricular rate over
350/minute! Clearly — this is a dangerous situation!
KEY Point: Nothing other than AFib with WPW results in
a ventricular response this fast (which is why Figure-2 is
pathognomonic for AFib in a patient with WPW).
=====================================
Take Another LOOK at Figure-1 …
To facilitate this — I’ve reproduced Figure-1 below, that shows the initial
ECG in today’s case.
Did YOU recognize that there is appreciable variation in the R-R
interval in this tracing with obvious QRS widening?
Figure-1: The initial ECG in today’s case.
Grauer Confession:
When I first saw ECG #1 on my mobile device — I thought “regular WCT
without P waves — therefore VT”. (I thought the last 3 beats in Figure-
1 represented the beginning of a deterioration of this VT into VFib).
It was humbling for me to go back after Dr. Nossen pointed out the
subtle-but-real irregularity that is actually present throughout the
entire tracing
Moral: It is EASY to overlook the irregularity in today’s initial tracing
— especially if on a smaller screen without calipers.
In Figure-4 — We magnify a selected portion of the tracing from ECG
#1 — which when we focus on the relative length of each R-R interval —
allows visual recognition (even without calipers) of the irregularity.

The numbers under the complexes in lead I of Figure-4 indicate
precise measurement in milliseconds of the 13 R-R intervals in ths
magnified excerpt.
KEY Point: As soon as we recognize that ECG #1 is an irregularly
irregular WCT without P waves that consistently manifests a
ventricular response well over 220/minute — we have made the
diagnosis of very rapid AFib in a patient with WPW (For another
case — See My Comment in the March 12, 2020 post in Dr.
Smith’s ECG Blog).
Figure-4: Magnified view of a selected portion of ECG #1 that shows
the irregularity of the rhythm (measurements of R-R intervals in
milliseconds).
Regarding AFib with WPW:
The very rapid heart rate and at times extremely short R-R intervals put
the patient with AFib and WPW at risk of cardiac arrest from VFib.
The risk of the rhythm deteriorating to VFib appears to be inversely
proportional to R-R interval duration. The shorter the R-R intervals
are — the higher the risk of deterioration to VFib (ref 2).
The AV node manifests a distinct property that myocardium and other
parts of the conduction system lack. This electrophysiological property is
called decremental conduction. In essence this means that if the AV
node is repetitively stimulated at very short intervals — the refractory
period prolongs. In other words — the AV node will conduct slower.
In addition — conduction through the AV node is calcium
dependent, and is slower than conduction through myocardium.
Together with the property of decremental conduction — this means
that the AV node will act as a “brake” on AFib impulses trying to
reach the ventricles. As a result — the ventricular rate rarely
exceeds 200/minute unless an AP (Accessory Pathway) is
present.
If R-R intervals become very short (ie, via conduction over an AP) —
this may predispose to the “R-on-T” phenomenon, which may
precipitate VFib.

22/01/2026, 15:31 Sudden Palpitations in a Young Adult - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
In patients with pre-excitation and AFib — some of the myocardium
will be depolarized via the conduction system (through AV node).
The degree to which this happens can explain some of the QRS
polymorphism that is commonly seen with pre-excited AFib. There
is a varying degree of “fusion” from depolarization via AP
myocardium and the conduction system. (ref 3)
If patients with AFib and WPW are given AV nodal blockers — less
depolarization of myocardium occurs through the conduction system. As a
result — a larger portion of the heart muscle is submitted to very short
coupling intervals which increases the risk of ventricular fibrillation.
In Summary: It is for the above reasons that many clinician feel patients
with WPW and AFib should not be given AV nodal blockers. Instead —
they favor sedation and synchronized cardioversion as the treatment of
choice for this entity.
Grauer Counterpoint: I’ve always felt, “Ya gotta be there”. As per
the 2021 Ren et al article cited earlier by Dr. Smith — IV
Amiodarone may be effective in a significant number of patients
(with other potentially effective agents being Procainamide and
Ibutilide). Clearly — synchronized cardioversion is appropriate (and
often optimal) initial treatment for WPW with AFib. But a trial of
medical therapy may be reasonable in select patients if the provider
stays by the bedside during the entire antiarrhythmic infusion, ready
at-any-moment to cardiovert for any adverse response.
=====================================
Continuation of Today’s CASE:
Today’s patient underwent DC conversion after initial infusion of IV
Amiodarone.
The ECG in Figure-5 shows the result following synchronized
cardioversion. BLUE arrows highlight delta waves in the post-
conversion tracing.

Figure-5: Repeat ECG following synchronized cardioversion — now
showing sinus rhythm with a short PR interval and delta waves in
most leads (BLUE arrows).
Localization of the AP:
Dr Grauer has synthesized the results of several predictive algorithms
to form a user-friendly approach for approximating localization of
the AP (Accessory Pathway).
Dr. Grauerʼs approach can be found on this Blog Post —
As per Figure-5 — Since the QRS in todayʼs case is completely
upright in lead V1 — the approach outlined in Figure-
6 suggests the likely location of the AP.
Applying this approach to todayʼs patient — the sum of delta
wave polarities in the inferior leads = +3 — thereby predicting
an antero-latral LV free wall AP.

Figure-6: Suggested approach for approximating AP localization
for todayʼs case, given that the QRS is completely upright in lead
V1 (excerpted for this Dr. Grauer Blog Post).
CASE Conclusion:
Today’s patient underwent EP (ElectroPhysiologic) study where
pre-excited AFib was induced. A anterolateral AP was
successfully ablated.
The ECG in Figure-7 was recorded after successful AP
ablation. Note that the rhythm is sinus — the QRS is narrow
— and delta waves are no longer present.

Figure-7: Repeat ECG following ablation of the AP. There is sinus
rhythm — a narrow QRS complex — and no longer any sign of
delta waves.
Final Note by Dr. Nossen:
Regarding my thoughts on managing the patient with WPW and AFib —
the 1st priority is to be aware of the ECG findings discussed in today’s
case for recognizing this entity (See below for links to additional cases in
Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog).
I always sedate and cardiovert these patients because it is safe,
quick and effective.
Ibutilide and Procainamide are 2 antiarrhythmic agents that are
approved for patients with pre-excited AFib (ref 4). I have no
experience using these medications, as they are not readily
available in Norway.

Wide Complex Tachycardia, and What is Latent Conduction and
“Concealed Conduction?”
Learning Points:
Suspect WPW with AFib if you have a wide complex irregular
tachycardia. R-R intervals less than 240 msec. should alert you to
this possibility.
The most effective treatment option is synchronized cardioversion.
Definite treatment is in the electrophysiology lab where ablation of
the accessory pathway can be performed.
