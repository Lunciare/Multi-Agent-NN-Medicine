An elderly woman with a history of COPD called emergency services for severe shortness of breath. On EMS arrival, she was cyanotic with increased work of breathing. During transport, she developed a bradycardic cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved.

pulmonary embolism both clinically and electrocardiographically. Differentiation requires integration of: Clinical context Echocardiographic findings ECG features Response to ventilation and oxygenation Misattributing RV strain solely to pulmonary embolism without considering severe COPD-related pathophysiology can lead to diagnostic anchoring. Learning Points Severe COPD exacerbation can cause: Acute RV pressure overload Profound hypoxia and hypercapnia Electrical patterns resembling massive PE Cardiac arrest in COPD patients is often driven by hypoxia and dynamic hyperinflation rather than primary coronary occlusion. ECG patterns of right heart strain are not specific for pulmonary embolism and must be interpreted in full clinical context. Bedside echocardiography is critical but should not be interpreted in isolation.
