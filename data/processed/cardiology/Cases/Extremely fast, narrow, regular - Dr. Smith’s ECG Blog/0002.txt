A 39-year-old man with no known past medical history presented with 3 days of palpitations and two episodes of syncope within the prior 8 hours. An ECG was obtained showing an extremely fast, narrow-complex, regular tachycardia.

control Difficult to cardiovert until thyroid hormone excess is corrected Pathophysiologic Insight The AV node normally cannot conduct at such extreme rates unless: There is marked sympathetic stimulation Hyperthyroidism is present Classic teaching (attributed to K. Wang): An AV node capable of 1:1 conduction at extremely high atrial rates strongly suggests hyperthyroidism. Other rare theoretical causes: Sympathomimetic drug intoxication Pheochromocytoma Extreme catecholamine surge Accessory pathways can conduct rapidly, but typically: Would not produce such a consistently narrow complex at these rates Management Principles Immediate electrical cardioversion is appropriate in unstable patients Treat the underlying cause (thyroid storm) to achieve durable rhythm control Arrhythmias associated with thyrotoxicosis often recur until hormone levels normalize Key Learning Points Extremely fast, regular, narrow-complex tachycardia should raise suspicion for 1:1 atrial flutter AV nodal conduction at extreme rates is abnormal Hyperthyroidism is a key reversible cause of unusually rapid SVT Adenosine conversion does not definitively distinguish flutter from AVNRT/AVRT Rhythm control will often fail unless the metabolic driver is addressed
