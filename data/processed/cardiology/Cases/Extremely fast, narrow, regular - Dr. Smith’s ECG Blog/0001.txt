A 39-year-old man with no known past medical history presented with 3 days of palpitations and two episodes of syncope within the prior 8 hours. An ECG was obtained showing an extremely fast, narrow-complex, regular tachycardia.

Initial ECG Interpretation Key ECG characteristics: Very fast regular rhythm Narrow QRS complexes No clearly visible P waves due to extreme rate Subtle suggestion of atrial activity at a rate slightly above 300 bpm Ventricular rate just above 300 bpm (near 1:1 relationship) Primary interpretation: Atrial flutter with 1:1 AV conduction, indicating abnormally rapid AV nodal conduction Differential Diagnosis Because of the extreme ventricular rate and narrow QRS, the main differential includes: Atrial flutter with 1:1 AV conduction AVNRT (AV nodal re-entry tachycardia) Orthodromic AVRT (accessory pathway–mediated SVT) Important exclusions: Ventricular tachycardia is unlikely due to narrow QRS Antidromic AVRT would usually produce a wide QRS Although conversion after adenosine favors AVNRT or AVRT, visible flutter-like atrial activity suggests atrial flutter with unusually fast AV conduction. Clinical Course Emergency department evaluation revealed thyroid storm. Management: Chemical cardioversion with adenosine Rhythm briefly converted to sinus tachycardia Subsequently degenerated into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (~140 bpm) Atrial fibrillation is commonly associated with thyroid storm and is often: Refractory to rate control Difficult to cardiovert until thyroid hormone excess is corrected Pathophysiologic Insight The AV node normally cannot conduct at such extreme rates unless: There is marked sympathetic stimulation Hyperthyroidism is
