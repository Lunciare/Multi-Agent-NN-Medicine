An ECG was obtained at time 0000. No prior ECGs were available. Initial ECG The ECG was triaged as “No STEMI.” The treating physician recognized the ECG as concerning for occlusion myocardial infarction, most notably a hyperacute T wave in lead V2, with lesser changes in leads V3 and V4. There may be early signs of reperfusion, including terminal T-wave inversion in leads V3 and V4. Clinical Course and Repeat ECG The patient continued to have severe chest pain rated at 8/10. He was treated with aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin.
