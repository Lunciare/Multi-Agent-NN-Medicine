A previously healthy man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with one hour of dull retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder. He reported no cardiac history and had undergone a stress test six days prior that was reported as normal. He had been given a clean bill of health by his cardiologist.

An ECG was obtained at time 0000. No prior ECGs were available. Initial ECG The ECG was triaged as “No STEMI.” The treating physician recognized the ECG as concerning for occlusion myocardial infarction, most notably a hyperacute T wave in lead V2, with lesser changes in leads V3 and V4. There may be early signs of reperfusion, including terminal T-wave inversion in leads V3 and V4. Clinical Course and Repeat ECG The patient continued to have severe chest pain rated at 8/10. He was treated with aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin. With improving pain, a repeat ECG was obtained at time 0058. In the repeat ECG, lead V2 appeared less hyperacute. There were now terminal T-wave inversions in leads V3 through V5, suggestive of reperfusion and consistent with improving acute coronary syndrome symptoms. Dynamic ECG changes were present despite improvement in symptoms. Management Discussion A nitroglycerin infusion was started, and interventional cardiology was consulted. Interventional cardiology agreed that there were dynamic ECG changes but requested consultation with the patient’s cardiology group prior to catheterization due to the recent reassuring stress test. The patient’s pain continued to improve on nitroglycerin. Stress tests are unreliable for emergency department risk stratification of chest pain.
