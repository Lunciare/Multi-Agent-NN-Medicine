A previously healthy man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with one hour of dull retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder. He reported no cardiac history and had undergone a stress test six days prior that was reported as normal. He had been given a clean bill of health by his cardiologist.

prior to catheterization due to the recent reassuring stress test. The patient’s pain continued to improve on nitroglycerin. Stress tests are unreliable for emergency department risk stratification of chest pain. Stress testing does not reliably detect unstable plaques, and many myocardial infarctions arise from non-flow-limiting coronary lesions. Stress tests have limited sensitivity for obstructive coronary artery disease and may be as low as 45%. Biomarkers and Catheterization The patient’s primary cardiologist recommended obtaining a troponin level to help decide on catheterization, as the initial ECG was felt to be relatively unremarkable. The initial high-sensitivity troponin returned at 92 (upper limit for men 22). The patient was started on heparin and underwent cardiac catheterization at approximately 0400 while pain-free. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease, including 50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and complex stenoses throughout the left anterior descending artery, with up to 80% stenosis in the distal LAD. No single acute culprit lesion was identified. Peak troponin was not measured. Surgical Management and Outcome Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting ×4 the following day. The hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and volume overload. The patient ultimately recovered and
