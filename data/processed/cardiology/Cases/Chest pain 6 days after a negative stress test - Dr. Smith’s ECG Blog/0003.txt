A previously healthy man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with one hour of dull retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder. He reported no cardiac history and had undergone a stress test six days prior that was reported as normal. He had been given a clean bill of health by his cardiologist.

surgery was consulted. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting ×4 the following day. The hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and volume overload. The patient ultimately recovered and was doing well. An ECG obtained several months later demonstrated that the hyperacute changes on the initial ECG were more apparent in retrospect. The patient was fortunate to have spontaneous reperfusion prior to intervention. It is not possible to predict which patients will spontaneously reperfuse. ECG Interpretation and Learning Points Given the history of new-onset chest pain, the diagnosis of acute occlusion myocardial infarction should have been made at the time of the initial ECG. The rhythm was sinus. Left anterior fascicular block was present. The hyperacute T wave in lead V2 was disproportionately large relative to the QRS complex. Supporting evidence included ST-segment straightening and terminal T-wave inversion in multiple precordial and inferior leads. At least 7 of 12 leads showed abnormal ST-T wave morphology on the initial ECG. Terminal T-wave inversion in multiple leads suggested spontaneous reperfusion, but spontaneous reopening may be transient, and prompt catheterization is indicated regardless of initial troponin values. Comparison of serial ECGs side-by-side revealed dynamic ST-T wave changes in at least 10 of
