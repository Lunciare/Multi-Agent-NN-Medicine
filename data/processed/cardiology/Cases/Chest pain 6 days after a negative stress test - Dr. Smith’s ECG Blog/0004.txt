A previously healthy man in his 70s presented to the emergency department with one hour of dull retrosternal chest pain radiating to the left shoulder. He reported no cardiac history and had undergone a stress test six days prior that was reported as normal. He had been given a clean bill of health by his cardiologist.

spontaneous reopening may be transient, and prompt catheterization is indicated regardless of initial troponin values. Comparison of serial ECGs side-by-side revealed dynamic ST-T wave changes in at least 10 of 12 leads. Spontaneous reperfusion explains the absence of an identifiable culprit lesion at the time of catheterization.
