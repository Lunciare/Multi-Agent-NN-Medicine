What is this pattern?
This was contributed by Amandeep Singh, from Highland
Hospital In Oakland CA.
A 54yo male presented to the ED with severe substernal
chest pain lasting 15-20 min, associated with general
weakness, mild dyspnea, and diaphoresis.
Here is the initial 12-lead ECG:
 
What do you think?
There is STE in V1, V2, aVR, and aVL. (There is also a
hyperacute T-wave in V3). Otherwise, there is diffuse ST
depression: in inferior leads and in V4-6. So there is a
superior ST vector.
There is no question that this is a STEMI-OMI. But it is
unusual in that the STE vector is directly superior, with
reciprocal STD in inferior areas (V5-6 are at the level of the
inferior part of the heart, at the apex).

There is a vaguely defined pattern here called “Northern
OMI”. It is a STEMI pattern that is associated with
subepicardial (“transmural”) ischemia of the BASE of the
heart (the base is the top, just under the atria). In particular, it
may be the base of the septum.
Key Features of Northern OMI
ECG Findings: ST elevation in lead aVR and aVL, often
with negative T-waves, combined with ST depression in
inferior (II, III, aVF) and lateral (V4-V6) leads with
positive or biphasic T-waves.
Underlying Cause: Suggests acute occlusion of the left
main coronary artery or proximal Left Anterior
Descending (LAD) artery.
Clinical Significance: Represents a severe form of acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) where a significant portion of
the heart muscle is at risk, often missed by traditional
STEMI criteria.
Diagnostic Importance: Aims to identify high-risk
patients who need immediate cath lab activation for
reperfusion, improving outcomes.
Amandeep (Deep) writes:
“This ECG is consistent with the recently described “northern
occlusion myocardial infarction” pattern (1). When the ST
vector points straight up (-90 degrees, or north), it can signify
infarction of the upper northernmost portion of the heart with
subendocardial ischemia in the inferior and low lateral regions
of the heart. This pattern can be due to left main coronary
occlusion, proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion,
or multivessel coronary artery disease. The terminology
“northern occlusion myocardial infarction” refers to the
unique ST vector orientation associated with this OMI
pattern.”
In this example, there is ST segment elevation in aVR, V1, and
V2. Lead aVL has subtle ST segment elevation with T wave
inversion and there is ST segment depression with an upright
T wave in the inferior and low lateral leads.
The cath lab was activated.
Case Outcome/Cardiology Note:
Patient arrived to ED diaphoretic, clammy and altered. He was
emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
where he had a weak thready pulse. He was found to have
100% occlusion of the left-main coronary artery with TIMI 0
flow. Flow was restored in the left-side, however, patient
 2/11
proceeded to have emesis and not protect his airway. He was
intubated, but lost his pulse. He underwent CPR, but
ultimately had PEA arrest and was pronounced at 12:06am.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/18/2025):
Predicting the “culprit” artery in an acute OMI can be
challenging. Although in many cases — determination of the
specific acutely occluded coronary artery does not alter
management (ie, If you clearly know based on history and the
initial ECG that regardless of which artery is the culprit —
prompt cath will be needed!) — in selected cases, being able
to accurately predict the “culprit” artery may be of
tremendous assistance to the interventionist for determining
where to look during the cath procedure for the vessel that
needs reperfusion!
Weʼve shown too-numerous-to-count cases in Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog of tracings in which we can
confidently predict acute RCA, LAD, or LCx occlusion
(with us often being able to predict which LAD
occlusions are proximal — and when RCA occlusions
are also associated with acute RV involvement).
PEARL: Iʼve learned that when the initial ECG shows
obvious acute occlusion — but with conflicting findings
suggesting no clear indication as to which vessel is “the
culprit” — that much of the time, the reason is that the
patient has significant multi-vessel disease.
The same is true for the uncommon acute LMain
occlusions that survive to make it to the hospital — for
 3/11
which the multiple anatomic areas affected by difficult-
to-predict contributions of ischemic myocardium, often
attenuated (and sometimes completely cancelled out) by
oppositely situated areas — make prediction by ECG of
acute LMain occlusion so very challenging.
The fact that the number of LMain occlusion cases that
we see is so small (ie, in which the patient survives long
enough to record an ECG) — makes collecting data
exceedingly difficult.
The above said — Iʼve synthesized the ECG findings collected
by Dr. Smith from 9 anecdotal cases of completeLMain
occlusion(published in the August 9, 2019 post) — into a
summarizing Table in Figure-1.
KEY Summarizing Points: Itʼs virtually impossible to
predict what the ECG will look like in a patient with acute
LMain occlusion.
Lead aVR does not provide the answer.
The above said — at least the findings in Figure-1 give
us an idea of the possibilities.
