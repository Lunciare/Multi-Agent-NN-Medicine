Chest (or abdominal?) pain
and ECG artifact.
An elderly woman presented with one day of chest and right arm
pain, and also abdominal pain. There was associated tingling and
numbness in the right hand and generalized weakness, worse on the
right side.
A triage ECG was recorded:
Smith: there is widespread artifact, except in lead III. Since lead III is
not artifactual, one can deduce that the artifact is caused by
movement of the right arm electrode, so that electrode should
be moved and the ECG re-recorded. This makes it difficult to
assess.
But one can see that there is some ST depression in lead III,
which should always make you think that it is reciprocal to 
some, often minimal, STE in aVL (of high lateral OMI). Thus,
aVL, I, and V2 must be scrutinized, but they are distorted by
artifact.

This is extremely easy to overlook, unless there is a high
suspicion of OMI.
Single limb lead electrode artifact is explained here, in a
case of Arterial Pulse Tapping Artifact (APTA): Bizarre
(Hyperacute??) T-waves
Clinical course: The provider recognized artifact, but did not
see anything worrisome and regrets not ordering another.
Labs, including troponins, were ordered and the patient needed be
placed in the waiting room pending a bed.
When the provider next looked up lab results, it was noticed that the
first troponin was 45,000 ng/L. This is then a large MI, but it is
subacute.
There was a previous ECG available for review:
This shows baseline STE in inferior leads, including lead III.
At the time is was recorded, there was no a myocardial infarction; this
was baseline STE (normal variant)
This previous ECG confirms that the STD in lead III is very abnormal
Due to the very high troponin, the patient was brought to the critical
care area and another ECG was recorded:
Sinus rhythm with PVCs
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/chest-or-abdominal-pain-and-ecg-artifact/ 2/13
There is inferior STD with STE and a coved ST segment in
aVL. There is STE in V5-6. There are new Q-waves in aVL,
V5-6.
It is diagnostic of OMI, but this is SUBACUTE OMI
I sent this ECG to my “EKG Nerdz” friends, without any clinical info at
all and they answered “OMI”
The Queen said: “STEMI-Equivalent with High Confidence:”
Notice she sees findings in both normal beats and PVCs.
There was some question of whether the patient was having
abdominal pathology, and she also had a history of aortic pathology,
so a chest abd/pelvic with aorta angiogram was ordered.
If this were ACUTE (vs. SUBACUTE) OMI, that would result in an
undesirable delay.
But this is clearly a subacute MI, with most of the damage done. How
do I know?
1) Very high initial troponin of 45,000 ng/L
2) A full day of chest pain
3) Q-waves on the ECG, with some T-wave inversion
Here is one frame of the CT scan which includes the heart:

Can you spot the infarct?
Here is an arrow pointing to it:
The Cath Lab was activated.
Angiogram:
100% occluded ramus intermedius. The ramus is an occasional
artery between the circumflex and the LAD, and often takes the place
of a large first diagonal, and has the same distribution.
It was opened and stented.
Here are the troponins:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/chest-or-abdominal-pain-and-ecg-artifact/ 4/13
Echo:
Normal LV size and hyperdynamic systolic function with an estimated EF of
77%.
Regional wall motion abnormality–mid anterior akinesis.
Compared to TTE from 7/3/24: the anterior regional wall motion abnormality is
new and is consistent with ischemia/infarction in the LAD territory
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (11/23/2024):
===================================
There are several insightful aspects of today’s case.
Marked artifact in the initial ECG (TOP tracing in Figure-1) —
makes assessment of the limb leads difficult — since lead III (within
the BLUE rectangle) is the only undistorted lead. But in a patient
with CP (Chest Pain) — the T wave in this single undistorted limb
lead clearly looks to be hyperacute (disproportionately “bulky”
considering modest size of the QRS in this lead).
I next looked at leads V2,V3,V4 for sign of posterior OMI — since
CP + hyperacute T wave in lead III + suggestion of posterior
OMI would be enough to greatly enhance my confidence of acute
OMI in this initial tracing. Unfortunately — artifact distortion of the
the ST segments in these 3 chest leads prevents drawing any
conclusions. But, in this patient with CP — ECG #1 needs to be
immediately repeated!
As per Dr. Smith — the fact that artifact in ECG #1 is maximal
in leads I and II (with lead III undistorted) — points to the RA
extremity as the “culprit” (See My Comment in the December 5,
2022 post of Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog for review on how to determine
the “culprit” extremity within seconds).

Figure-1: Comparison between the initial ECG and the
repeat ECG in today’s case.
The 2nd ECG:
Assessment of the next ECG in today’s case (BOTTOM tracing in Figure-
1) — provides its own set of insightful observations:
Overall — the artifact is decidedly less in ECG #2. That said — Note
how the “culprit” extremity has changed! Here limb lead artifact is
maximal in leads I, III and aVL — with lead II no more than
minimally affected. Note also that instead of the artifact distorting
the entire recording of 5/6 limb leads (as it did in ECG #1) — the
artifact distortion in ECG #2 is primarily of the baseline! This
localizes the source of artifact to the LA electrode (rather than
pointing to a tremulous RA extremity — as was the case in ECG
#1, in which large amplitude artifactual deflections were seen
throughout in the affected limb lead recordings).
Although the artifact in ECG #2 should also prompt repeating the ECG —
we nevertheless can draw important conclusions from this 2nd tracing.
The rhythm is ventricular bigeminy (each of the even-numbered
beats in ECG #2 is a PVC).
That every-other-beat in ECG #2 is a PVC (and not a PAC
conducted with RBBB aberration) — can be established by the fact
that underlying sinus P waves continue throughout the
tracing (YELLOW arrows in the long lead II rhythm strip showing
on-time sinus P waves producing subtle distortion of the
beginning of the ST segment of each PVC). In addition,
the direction of the initial deflection in 4 of the chest leads
is different for sinus beats and the PVCs (whereas sinus beats
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/chest-or-abdominal-pain-and-ecg-artifact/ 6/13
#9,11,13 in leads V1-thru-V4 all manifest an initial R wave —
beas #8,10,12 all manifest an initial negative deflection).
PEARL: As we have occasionally seen in other cases in Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog — it is the PVCs (and not the sinus-
conducted beats)that provide more incriminating
evidence of an ongoing acute event.
Consider lead aVL (within the PURPLE rectangle) — in which the
most markedly abnormal ST elevation is seen in beats #4 and #6
(with the tricky aspect of beat #4 being the lead change marker that
hides the QRS of beat #4).
Lead I appears to show abnormal ST elevation in both sinus beats
and the PVC in this lead — although artifact make assessment
difficult in this lead.
But BLUE arrows in lateral chest leads V5 and V6 show what
appears to be disproportionately elevated J-point ST elevation in the
PVC ( = beat #12).

Artifact is a reality of clinical practice — so comfort in
assessing tracings with artifact is essential. What follows
