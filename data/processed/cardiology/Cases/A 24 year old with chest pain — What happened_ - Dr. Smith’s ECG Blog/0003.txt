The ST Elevation is resolved and the T-waves have inverted. There is also T-wave inversion in V4-6, which tells us that this is also an area of infarct that I did not see and neither did the Queen!! If the patient is now completely chest pain free, then there is much less urgency for immediate cath. Emily continues: The STE in II, III, and aVF is still present, though not as obvious as before. He now has STE in V3-V5 and new TWI in the inferior and lateral leads. With the dynamic changes and rising troponin, cardiology was consulted. They collected additional history during which the patient described a possible positional and pleuritic component to his pain. In my experience, if a cardiologist canʼt believe that a 24 year old had an MI, they will interpret the history to conform to that bias. So I do not believe that the chest pain was positional and/or pleuritic. This, along with his young age and lack of risk factors, led
