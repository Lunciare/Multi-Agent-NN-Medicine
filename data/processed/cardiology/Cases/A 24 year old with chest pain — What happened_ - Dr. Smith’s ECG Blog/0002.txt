Given his age and the preceding URI symptoms, they were concerned about pericarditis (which brings to mind one of Dr. Smithʼs famous quotes “you diagnose pericarditis at your peril”). They performed a bedside cardiac ultrasound which did not show any large wall motion abnormalities. With some concern for ACS they loaded him with aspirin and decided to trend troponins and repeat an EKG. Smith: This is ACTIVE inferior OMI!! The cath lab should be activated immediately based on the ECG alone without waiting for troponin!! There is virtually never reciprocal ST depression in pericarditis, as there is here in aVL. We showed this years ago in this study: ST depression in lead aVL differentiates inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction from pericarditis However, myocarditis can mimic OMI nearly perfectly, and can indeed have reciprocal ST depression. (Moreover, if this is inflammation (myopericarditis), it is myocarditis (not pericarditis) if there is an elevated troponin.) Here is the diagnosis of the PMCardio Queen of Hearts AI Model (she of course diagnoses OMI (STEMI equivalent = OMI). Case continued by Emily: His troponin continued to rise with a 2H repeat elevated at 601. A repeat EKG was then obtained: Smith: this shows reperfusion of the
