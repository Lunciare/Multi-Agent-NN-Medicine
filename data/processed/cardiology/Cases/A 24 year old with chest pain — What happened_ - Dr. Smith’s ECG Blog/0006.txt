that did not immediately resolve his pain, they conferred with cardiology who agreed to take him for an angiogram. His angiogram showed a culprit lesion in the mid-LAD with embolization to the wraparound LAD which explains his inferior findings on EKG. IVUS was used to characterize the lesion given his young age and lack of any ACS risk factors, it was NOT characteristic of SCAD and indicated True ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. He underwent PCI with a DES and aspiration thrombectomy in the LAD. His lab workup did not show any hyperlipidemia, so he is currently being evaluated for hypercoagulability as an etiology for his atherosclerosis. He has not had a repeat TTE since his PCI, but has not had any clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure. This case was an important reminder for me that OMI can occur in any patient, even those without clear risk factors. This manʼs young age and his red herring URI symptoms led really excellent providers to explain away symptoms, labs, and EKG findings that would have likely triggered more urgent intervention in an older patient. Fortunately for this young man, he continues to recover well. The highest troponin measured was 7500 ng/L, but
