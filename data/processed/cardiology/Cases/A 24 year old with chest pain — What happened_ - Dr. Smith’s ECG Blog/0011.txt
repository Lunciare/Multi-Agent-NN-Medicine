new, severe CP (rated 8/10 by this patient on arrival in the ED) about whom there is uncertainty as to whether there is an ongoing acute OMI — no more than 15–20 minutes should pass before repeating the initial ECG. Doing so might have expedited cardiac cath in todayʼs case. Comparison between serial ECGs is most easily accomplished when the 2 tracings are placed side-by-side. The persistent size of the Q wave in lead III now looks even more like an infarction Q wave next to its small R wave and terminal T wave inversion. Appreciation of just how abnormal the ST segment straightening was in each of the inferior leads on the initial ECG — is now readily apparent in comparison with the deflation and change in ST-T wave shape seen in ECG #2. Note that S waves have now reformed in leads III and aVF (whereas they were absent in ECG #1). Reciprocal ST segment flattening and depression in lead aVL has now totally resolved. The flattened isoelectric ST segment in lead V2 is no longer seen in the repeat ECG. Finally — reperfusion T waves (in association with improved but not completely resolved CP) are now seen
