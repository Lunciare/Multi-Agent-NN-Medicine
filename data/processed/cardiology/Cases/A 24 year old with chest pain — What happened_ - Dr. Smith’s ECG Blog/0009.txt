A 24 year old with chest pain — What happened?

that in lead III, and does not at all look like the pattern in lead I (whereas the opposite tends to be true with acute pericarditis); iii) Acute pericarditis does not produce reciprocal ST depression — whereas this invaluable finding is convincingly present in lead aVL; iv) The ST/T wave ratio in lead V6 is normal (ie, there is no more than minimal ST elevation in lead V6 vs a much taller T wave in this lead). Instead — todayʼs initial ECG strongly suggests an acute OMI: In a patient with new CP (Chest Pain) — my “eye” was immediately drawn to the straightened ST segment takeoff, in association with definite ST elevation in each of the inferior leads. In addition — Q waves are present in each of the inferior leads, with the Q in lead III being surprisingly deep relative to modest R wave amplitude in this lead. And while inferior lead Q waves are not necessarily an abnormal finding — it is much less common to see such Q waves when the frontal plane axis is relatively horizontal, as it is in ECG #1. Reciprocal ST depression is definitely present in lead aVL. Acute posterior OMI is
