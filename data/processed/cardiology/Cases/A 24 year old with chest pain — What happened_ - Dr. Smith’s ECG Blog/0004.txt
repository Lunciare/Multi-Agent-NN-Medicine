A 24 year old with chest pain — What happened?

to conform to that bias. So I do not believe that the chest pain was positional and/or pleuritic. This, along with his young age and lack of risk factors, led them to also conclude that myocarditis or myopericarditis was most likely, despite noting his rising troponin, dynamic EKG changes, and possible wall motion abnormality on a formal TTE. They did recommend starting a heparin drip as ACS could not be ruled out. They recommended obtaining a CT Coronary Angiogram (CTCA) to evaluate his coronary arteries. Smith: Myocarditis is possible with this initial EKG, however, you cannot differentiate OMI from myocarditis using troponin or wall motion abnormality. Myocarditis will also have a rising troponin. It will also have a wall motion abnormality. The only way to differentiate on an EMERGENCY basis is using angiogram. Moreover, you donʼt get a RAPID reperfusion pattern (decreased pain, resolving ST Elevation, and T-wave inversion) with myocarditis. Myocarditis is more indolent, and resolution is not so rapid. So how else would you make the diagnosis of myocarditis? If there is no culprit on angiogram, it can still be MINOCA (Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries). The interventionalist could verify Type 1 MI (plaque rupture) with Optical
