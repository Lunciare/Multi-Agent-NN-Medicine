ST segment in lead V2 is no longer seen in the repeat ECG. Finally — reperfusion T waves (in association with improved but not completely resolved CP) are now seen in multiple leads (T wave inversion in leads III, aVF; V3, V4, V5 — along with ST segment flattening in leads II and V6 that are probably in transition toward T wave inversion given their previous appearance in ECG #1).
