The interventionalist could verify Type 1 MI (plaque rupture) with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or IVUS. If none is found, then myocarditis or Type 2 MI are likely. In order to differentiate the two, one would need MRI. Inflammatory markers are also helpful. As it was now daytime hours, the CTCA was obtained relatively quickly and notable for severe LAD stenosis. At this point I went to collect a history as part of the admitting team and was concerned when he told me that his chest pain was much better, only a 1/10 compared to the 8/10 when he had arrived. With his ongoing chest pain and the CTCA results, I was very concerned about ongoing ischemia – another thing Steve Smith has taught me is that 1/10 pain is still refractory pain and warrants more urgent PCI! I talked with his ED team who started a nitroglycerin drip and when that did not immediately resolve his pain, they conferred with cardiology who agreed to take him for an angiogram. His angiogram showed a culprit lesion in the mid-LAD with embolization
