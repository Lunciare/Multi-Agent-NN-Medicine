We need to determine WHY … The Lessons-to-be-Learned from todayʼs case are cogently highlighted by Drs. Syverud and Smith. Among them: Acute OMI can occur in any patient, including previously healthy young adult men. True acute pericarditis is rare — especially when the ECG looks much more like an acute OMI or myocarditis. The young age of todayʼs patient, his unremarkable prior medical history, and the increased initial Troponin combine to statistically favor acute myocarditis over OMI. That said, as per Dr. Smith — acute myocarditis may mimic perfectly the clinical findings of OMI, such that the only way to acutely distinguish between these 2 conditions is by cardiac cath. The 2 ECGs in Todayʼs CASE: For ease of comparison in Figure-1 — Iʼve put todayʼs 2 ECGs together. Todayʼs initial ECG does not suggest acute pericarditis because: i) ST elevation is localized to the inferior leads — rather than being generalized, as it should be with acute pericarditis; ii) The ST-T wave pattern in lead II looks similar to that in lead III, and does not at all look like the pattern in lead I (whereas the opposite tends to be true with acute pericarditis); iii) Acute pericarditis does
