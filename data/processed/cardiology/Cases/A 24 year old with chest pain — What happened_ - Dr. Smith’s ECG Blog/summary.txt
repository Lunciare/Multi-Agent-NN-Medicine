This was written up by one of our superb EM/IM residents, Emily Syverud. A 24-year-old man presented to the ED early in the morning with burning chest pain that had started suddenly the night before while watching TV, he also reported some associated nausea and vomiting. He played soccer earlier in the evening without any chest pain at all. A week earlier he had been sick with a URI-type illness, this had since resolved. Here is his initial EKG: What do you think? The conventional (Veritas) computer interpretation was this: SINUS BRADYCARDIA WITH SINUS ARRHYTHMIA ST ELEVATION CONSISTENT WITH INJURY, PERICARDITIS, OR EARLY REPOLARIZATION But the final interpretation was changed by the physician to this: SINUS BRADYCARDIA WITH SINUS ARRHYTHMIA Nonspecifc ST changes, inferior elevation.
