In such cases — we need to prove that the ECG is wrong, rather than the other way around. And, when the initial Troponin is also significantly elevated ==> We need to determine WHY … The Lessons-to-be-Learned from todayʼs case are cogently highlighted by Drs. Syverud and Smith. Among them: Acute OMI can occur in any patient, including previously
