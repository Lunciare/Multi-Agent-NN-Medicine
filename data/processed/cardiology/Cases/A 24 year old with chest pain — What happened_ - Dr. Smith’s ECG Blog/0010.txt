such Q waves when the frontal plane axis is relatively horizontal, as it is in ECG #1. Reciprocal ST depression is definitely present in lead aVL. Acute posterior OMI is also suggested in ECG #1 — because there is loss of the gentle, slight upward concavity ST elevation that is normally seen in both leads V2 and V3 (note that this gently upsloping ST elevation is present in lead V3 — whereas the ST segment in lead V2 is flat and isoelectric). P.S.: The final point that Iʼll note is the suggestion of T-QRS-D (Terminal QRS Distortion) in leads III and aVF. To emphasize that the diagnostic significance of this finding in the inferior leads is uncertain — however, it does occur here in association with other convincing findings of OMI. The Repeat ECG in Todayʼs CASE: Of note — the initial ECG in todayʼs case was apparently not repeated until ~2 hours had passed (and then, seemingly because of the increase in Troponin). In a patient who presents with new, severe CP (rated 8/10 by this patient on arrival in the ED) about whom there is uncertainty as to whether there is an ongoing acute OMI — no more
