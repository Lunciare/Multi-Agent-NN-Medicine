A 60-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease presented with new chest pain. The case ECG was sent to Dr. Smith by a former resident who is highly skilled at ECG interpretation for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).

taller T-waves ST depression appeared deeper and more acute in multiple leads ST elevation in aVR was more pronounced Loss of R-wave progression was worse in ECG #1 These changes, in the context of new chest pain, were consistent with precordial swirl, a subtle ECG pattern associated with acute LAD occlusion, even when classic ST-elevation criteria are not met. Clinical Course The treating physician administered one sublingual nitroglycerin, after which the patient’s pain improved from severe to 1/10, but did not fully resolve. No repeat ECG was obtained. The patient was admitted with the working diagnosis of progression of chronic multivessel disease and modest troponin elevation. She ultimately proved to have acute LAD occlusion, but did not undergo catheterization for almost 24 hours. Outcomes: Large anterior myocardial infarction Troponin I peaked above 5000 ng/L Left ventricular ejection fraction dropped from 50% to 20% Post-cath ECG showed a new intraventricular conduction defect resembling LBBB The ECG was Smith-modified Sgarbossa negative, reflecting completed myocardial injury The patient developed cardiogenic shock, required Impella support, and suffered acute renal failure During Impella placement, the carotid artery was inadvertently cannulated, causing a large hematoma and airway compromise Key Insight Even in retrospect, multiple clinicians could
