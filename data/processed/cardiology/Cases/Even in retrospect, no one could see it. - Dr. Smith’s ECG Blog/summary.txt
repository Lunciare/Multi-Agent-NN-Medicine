A 60-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease presented with new chest pain. The case ECG was sent to Dr. Smith by a former resident who is highly skilled at ECG interpretation for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).

Presentation ECG (ECG #1) The initial ECG showed: Lateral precordial ST depression Large, bulky T-waves in the anterior precordial leads Overall appearance concerning for active ischemia By itself, the ECG could be interpreted as subendocardial ischemia. However, the anterior T-waves were disproportionately large and bulky, raising concern for acute LAD occlusion, particularly a pattern known as precordial swirl. Prior ECG (ECG #2, one week earlier) A comparison ECG from one week earlier was available. At that time: The patient presented with heart failure Troponins were negative ECG demonstrated: Sinus rhythm ~75 bpm Left anterior fascicular block Voltage criteria for LVH Poor R-wave progression Diffuse ST flattening and mild ST depression ST elevation in aVR This ECG was consistent with diffuse subendocardial ischemia (DSE) in the setting of severe multivessel coronary disease, but not acute coronary occlusion.
