A 60-year-old woman with known coronary artery disease presented with new chest pain. The case ECG was sent to Dr. Smith by a former resident who is highly skilled at ECG interpretation for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).

support, and suffered acute renal failure During Impella placement, the carotid artery was inadvertently cannulated, causing a large hematoma and airway compromise Key Insight Even in retrospect, multiple clinicians could not see the OMI, despite the devastating outcome. Recognition was possible only because the concept of precordial swirl had been previously described and studied. The Queen of Hearts AI did not diagnose OMI, but did identify ischemia. Importantly, refractory ischemia requires emergent angiography, even if OMI is not explicitly diagnosed. When Is Emergent Angiography NOT Required? Ischemia can be considered resolved only if both conditions are met: Chest pain is completely resolved ST depression is completely resolved In this case: Pain persisted at 1/10 ST depression was still present No repeat ECG was obtained to document resolution Summary and Learning Points Refractory chest pain + ischemic ECG = emergent cath, regardless of whether classic OMI criteria are met Subtle ECG patterns like precordial swirl can represent acute LAD occlusion Comparing ECGs side-by-side, lead-by-lead is essential Troponin elevation confirms injury but should not delay action Fear of false-positive cath lab activation can lead to catastrophic outcomes It is far better to activate unnecessarily than to miss an occlusive MI This case
