This was sent by a physician working at a hospital without PCI capabilities and far from one that does, so if there is OMI, thrombolytics are given.

in the presence of inferior OMI implies right ventricular myocardial infarction. Right ventricular myocardial infarction causes hypotension and is associated with high mortality if not reperfused. Right ventricular myocardial infarction is caused by proximal right coronary artery occlusion, proximal to the right ventricular marginal branch. Not all proximal right coronary artery occlusions cause right ventricular myocardial infarction because many patients have collateral flow from the left anterior descending artery. Hyperacute T-waves without Q waves indicate sufficient acuteness for thrombolysis. Diagnostic Considerations in Atypical Presentations Assessment is challenging due to atypical symptoms and prolonged symptom duration. A prior ECG would be invaluable for identifying new changes. Recurrence of pain during Emergency Department observation supports ongoing ischemia. Repeating the ECG and performing bedside echocardiography during symptoms to assess for regional wall motion abnormalities may remove diagnostic doubt.
