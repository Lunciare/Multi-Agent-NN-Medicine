This was sent by a physician working at a hospital without PCI capabilities and far from one that does, so if there is OMI, thrombolytics are given.

A very elderly patient with previous ejection fraction of 60% complained of shortness of breath for two weeks, with pleuritic chest pain. There was no pain on arrival, but the pain recurred while in the Emergency Department. Blood pressure was 90 systolic. Initial ECG The conventional computer interpretation claimed “nonspecific ST abnormality.” Interpretation: Diagnostic of inferior and right ventricular OMI. Inferior ST elevation and hyperacute T-waves, with reciprocally inverted hyperacute T-wave in aVL. There is minimal ST depression in lead V2, where there should be some ST elevation, which is highly suggestive of posterior OMI. Hypotension Explanation Lead V1 shows ST elevation and a hyperacute T-wave. This finding is especially significant in the presence of ST depression in V2, because the posterior wall should attenuate any ST elevation in V1. ST elevation in V1 in this context is diagnostic of right ventricular myocardial infarction. Right ventricular myocardial infarction causes hypotension. Atypical Presentation It is common for very elderly patients to have atypical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. In the absence of chest pain, diagnostic certainty may be reduced despite ECG findings. Biomarkers and Management The first troponin I returned very high at 14 ng/mL (fourth generation, equivalent to 14,000 ng/L).
