This was sent by a physician working at a hospital without PCI capabilities and far from one that does, so if there is OMI, thrombolytics are given.

of chest pain, diagnostic certainty may be reduced despite ECG findings. Biomarkers and Management The first troponin I returned very high at 14 ng/mL (fourth generation, equivalent to 14,000 ng/L). Thrombolytics were administered. The second troponin was lower at 12 ng/mL. The ECG showed high acuteness. Although there was subacute infarction with falling troponin, recurrent chest pain and hyperacute T-waves implied re-occlusion. Follow-Up Cardiology did not take the patient immediately to the cath lab due to concern that the patient would not tolerate lying flat. Echocardiography showed a dilated right ventricle with good left ventricular function, prompting concern for pulmonary embolism. Pain resolved and troponins trended down. The right ventricle was dilated due to right ventricular myocardial infarction, not pulmonary embolism. Next-day angiography showed a 90% proximal right coronary artery culprit lesion that was stented. The right coronary artery was reperfused, almost certainly due to thrombolytics. Learning Points Thrombolytics are beneficial in STEMI(–) OMI when clinical and ECG findings are specific for OMI. Any amount of ST elevation in V1 in the presence of inferior OMI implies right ventricular myocardial infarction. Right ventricular myocardial infarction causes hypotension and is associated with high mortality if not reperfused. Right ventricular myocardial infarction
