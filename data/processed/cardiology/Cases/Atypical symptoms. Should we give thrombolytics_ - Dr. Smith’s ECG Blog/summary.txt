This was sent by a physician working at a hospital without PCI capabilities and far from one that does, so if there is OMI, thrombolytics are given.

A very elderly patient with previous ejection fraction of 60% complained of shortness of breath for two weeks, with pleuritic chest pain. There was no pain on arrival, but the pain recurred while in the Emergency Department. Blood pressure was 90 systolic. Initial ECG The conventional computer interpretation claimed “nonspecific ST abnormality.” Interpretation: Diagnostic of inferior and right ventricular OMI. Inferior ST elevation and hyperacute T-waves, with reciprocally inverted hyperacute T-wave in aVL. There is minimal ST depression in lead V2, where there should be some ST elevation, which is highly suggestive of posterior OMI.
