A 40-something patient called emergency services for approximately 30 minutes of left-sided chest pain radiating to the right arm and shoulder. Radiation to the right shoulder (and especially to both shoulders) is a high-risk symptom for acute coronary occlusion.

Initial Prehospital ECG (22:38) The automated ECG interpretation reported “nonspecific ST-T abnormalities.” Expert interpretation identified acute occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). Key findings: Hyperacute T waves in inferior leads III and aVF Reciprocal inverted hyperacute T wave in aVL Subtle ST-segment flattening in V2 Pattern consistent with inferior OMI with associated posterior involvement These findings are subtle but diagnostic in the correct clinical context. AI Interpretation The PMCardio Queen of Hearts model identified inferior OMI and recommended an immediate invasive strategy, though it did not explicitly identify posterior involvement. Serial ECGs EMS recorded multiple serial ECGs: 22:44 (6 minutes after first ECG) 22:46 22:54 (16 minutes after first ECG) Over these recordings: Inferior T waves became progressively more hyperacute Reciprocal ST depression in aVL increased Inferior ST elevation became increasingly obvious After the fourth ECG, the cath lab was activated. Angiographic Findings Coronary angiography revealed a critical RCA stenosis with residual flow, which was successfully stented. Diagnostic Insights Acute OMI can be ECG-diagnostic while still extremely subtle, especially early in its course. Hyperacute T waves—disproportionately tall, bulky, and wide relative to QRS amplitude—may be the only early sign. Posterior OMI can be detected indirectly: Leads V2–V3 normally show mild ST elevation
