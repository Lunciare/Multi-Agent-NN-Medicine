A 40-something patient called emergency services for approximately 30 minutes of left-sided chest pain radiating to the right arm and shoulder. Radiation to the right shoulder (and especially to both shoulders) is a high-risk symptom for acute coronary occlusion.

course. Hyperacute T waves—disproportionately tall, bulky, and wide relative to QRS amplitude—may be the only early sign. Posterior OMI can be detected indirectly: Leads V2–V3 normally show mild ST elevation ST flattening or depression in these leads during chest pain is abnormal This supports the diagnosis of inferior-posterior OMI when inferior lead findings are subtle Role of Serial ECGs Serial ECGs are critical when: The first ECG is equivocal or under-recognized Dynamic ST-T changes evolve over minutes Convincing skeptical consultants of an acute occlusive process However, in this case, the initial ECG alone, combined with a high-risk history, was sufficient to justify immediate cath lab activation. Learning Points Acute OMI may be present despite “nonspecific” computer ECG interpretations Hyperacute T waves can be diagnostic even without clear ST elevation Reciprocal changes (especially in aVL) strongly support true ischemia Posterior OMI is often missed unless V2–V3 are carefully assessed Serial ECGs should always be compared side-by-side Troponin values do not guide the decision to activate the cath lab in ECG-diagnostic OMI Correlating ECG changes with pain severity provides insight into vessel occlusion and reperfusion
