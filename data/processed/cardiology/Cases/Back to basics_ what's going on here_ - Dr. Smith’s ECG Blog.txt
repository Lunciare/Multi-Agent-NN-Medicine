Back to basics: whatʼs going
on here?
Written by Pendell Meyers
A man in his 70s presented with history of pacemaker presented with
shortness of breath with exertion and presyncope.
Here is his triage ECG with minimal symptoms:
What do you think?
The ECG shows pacemaker failure with inability to capture or sense,
with either underlying atrial fibrillation or junctional escape rhythm.
The QRS shows LVH and there are diffuse ST-T abnormalities likely in
part appropriate for the LVH, though memory T waves are also a
consideration.

Smith: I think this is atrial fibrillation with a very slow ventricular
response. Junctional rhythm should be fairly regular. The QRS is not
wide, so it is not a ventricular escape.
The patient was found to have a fractured lead, which was replaced
successfully without complications and with resolution of symptoms.
He did well.
Smith: this can usually be seen on chest x-ray. Here are multiple
examples.
===================================
M Y Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/19/2024): 
===================================
“The patient has a pacemaker.” Awareness of this information means
that the emergency provided is immediately charged with assessing
whether or not the device is correctly functioning.
Given the ever increasing complexity of pacemakers (with an ever
increasing array of complex new features) — determining whether
the pacemaker is appropriately working is not always a simple task
— especially since emergency providers are rarely privilege to
knowing the parameters that the pacemaker has been programmed
for.
Adding to this challenge is the clinical reality that pacemaker
troubleshooting is not a common enough problem to provide
sufficient exposure to the full gamut of potential malfunctions to
most non-cardiology emergency providers.
Finally — Most of the time, the pacemaker will be working
correctly. This makes recognition of occasional malfunction that
much more difficult.
We’ve periodically reviewed cases
regarding Pacemaker Troubleshooting (See the February 18,
2024 post — the January 13, 2024 post — the October 19,
2022 post — the August 3, 2022 post — the May 21,
2023 post — the June 19, 2024 post — and the November 9,
2018 post, to name a number of them).
On many occasions when determining pacemaker function has
been difficult — the problem was that pacemaker spikes were not
readily evident. Suboptimal filter settings is a major reason this
may occur (See My Comment in the January 13, 2024 post).

Today’s CASE:
For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced today’s ECG. That there
is pacemaker malfunction is easy to diagnose.
Regular pacing spikes are seen throughout ECG #1 — at a rate
of ~70/minute (YELLOW lines highlighting pacer spikes in each of
the leads in which they are seen — with these pacer spikes being
regularly spaced at an interval of 4.3 large boxes).
However, there is complete pacer-ventricular dissociation — in
that there is no relation between pacer spikes and neighboring QRS
complexes. Instead — the narrow QRS complexes continue at their
inherent rate (ie, The pacemaker fails to sense and respond to
native beats).
No P wave and no QRS ever follows any of the regular pacing
spikes (a result of the fractured pacing lead). Regardless of whether
we are seeing atrial or ventricular spikes from the pacemaker
— there is failure to capture.
Figure-1: I’ve added YELLOW lines for those pacer spikes that are
seen.
LEARNING Points:
If having trouble seeing pacing spikes — Check the filter
settings (as per My Comment in the January 13, 2024 post). If filter
settings are not optimal — then repeat the ECG at the more
optimal 0.05 Hz-to-150 Hz setting.
Overall — pacing spikes are easy to see for most beats in today’s
tracing. But I never would have guessed that this patient had a
pacemaker if I wasn’t told and if all beats looked like beat #2 in the
3 long lead rhythm strips. It is only because I saw regular pacing
spikes everywhere else in each of the long lead rhythm strips, that I
knew to look more closely at simultaneously-recorded lead III —

which does show a subtle pacer spike (that darkens the terminal
descent of the QRS in this lead).
As is often the case — assessing pacemaker function becomes
easier as soon as we can identify all pacer spikes.
Finally — I find it insightful (and clinically useful) to always try to
determine WHY the patient has a pacemaker. As per Dr. Meyers —
the underlying rhythm is either slow AFib or a junctional escape
rhythm (There is a fairly-but-not-completely regular underlying
bradycardic rhythm — with narrow QRS — and no P waves). Given
the patient’s age (in his 70s) — and an underlying rhythm of either
slow AFib or slow junctional escape — the most likely reason for
pacing is SSS (Sick Sinus Syndrome). It appears from ECG #1 that
this patient will still need permanent pacing.
