History: A caretaker called 911 for altered mental status. The patient was lethargic, hypotensive, and bradycardic. ECG findings: Sinus bradycardia at approximately 47 bpm. Upright P waves preceding each QRS in inferior leads. Prolonged QT interval. Presence of Osborn (J) waves in lateral precordial leads. ST-T morphology characteristic of hypothermia. Diagnosis: Hypothermia. Additional findings: Rectal temperature measured at 29.2°C (84.5°F), consistent with moderate hypothermia. Repeat ECG: Similar findings with more pronounced shiver artifact. Management and course: The patient was externally rewarmed. Temperature normalized the following day. ECG after rewarming was not recorded but would be expected to show resolution of Osborn waves, shortening of QT interval, and increased heart rate. Conclusion: ECG findings were consistent with moderate hypothermia, which can mimic ischemic and conduction abnormalities. Repeat ECG after temperature correction is essential, as hypothermia may mask underlying cardiac pathology.
