Atypical symptoms. Should
we give thrombolytics?
This was sent by an old friend who works at a hospital
without PCI capabilities, and far from one that does. So if
there is OMI, he gives thrombolytics.
A very elderly patient with previous EF of 60% complained of
shortness of breath for 2 weeks, with pleuritic chest pain.
There was no pain on arrival. But the pain recurred while in
the ED.
His BP was 90 systolic.
He recorded an initial ECG:
 
What do you think? Is it “Nonspecific ST abnormality, as the
conventional computer algorithm claims?”
My friend thought there was inferior OMI. He applied the
PMCardio Queen of Hearts: 

The model output was 0.96, which is nearly 100% certain. (That is
found by clicking on the small encircled “i” next to “hide
explainability”.)

So the Queen agrees.
Smith interpretation: Diagnostic of inferor and RV OMI.
Inferior STE and hyperacute T-waves, with reciprocally
inverted hyperacute T-wave in aVL. There is minimal ST
depression in lead V2 (where there should be some STE!),
thus highly suggestive of posterior OMI.
Why is there hypotension??
—–Lead V1: There is STE and hyperacute T-wave in V1. We
showed that this is ESPECIALLY significant in the setting of
the STD in V2, because the posterior wall should be
attenuating any STE in V1. This STE in V1 is all but diagnostic
of right ventricular OMI (RVMI).This will cause hypotension.
Why does the Queen not highlight lead V1?Answer: we
have never coded, or annotated, “RVMI” for the Queen. Every
case of RVMI has been in the context of inferior OMI. So
every case of inferior OMI has been annotated only as OMI,
and only a fraction of those have had STE or HATW in V1. So
she does not correlate STE in V1 with OMI, UNLESS there is
STD in V5-6 (which is precordial swirl) from LAD OMI. In any
case: she recognizes OMI and that is the only output she is
allowed to give and the only really critical output.

It is very common for the very elderly to have atypical
symptoms of acute MI. Without chest pain, he was not
certain enough to act. I think I would have been convinced
by the ECG and the Queenʼs certainty, but I was not there.
If the question was “Cath Lab activations?”, then the answer
would be an unequivocal “YES” because the risk of an
angiogram is negligible. But the risks of thrombolytics are
real.
Then the first troponin I returned very high at 14 ng/mL (4th
generation, not high sensitivity, thus equivalent to 14,000
ng/L).
My friend gave thrombolytics. Then called the cardiologist at
the referral center. Response? “Cardiology not impressed
with ECG.”
My response: “Definitely an inferior OMI. Nice work! Hardly
any cardiologists understand ECGs like this“
There were no subsequent ECGs. The 2nd troponin was lower
at 12 ng/mL. The ECG is shows high “Acuteness,” so
although there was subacute infarction with falling troponin,
the recurrent chest pain and hyperacute T-wave implies re-
occlusion.
Follow up:
“Cardiology did not take my guy right to cath. They are
concerned he wonʼt tolerate lying flat, echo shows dilated RV
but good LV function so they want to rule out PE first and
cath tomorrow. Pain gone now and trops down trending”
Smith: The RV is dilated because of right ventricular MI
(RVMI)!!This is clearly not a pulmonary embolism.
Next day angiography showed a 90% proximal RCA culprit
that was stented. The RCA was reperfused, almost certainly
due to the thrombolytics.
Learning Points:
1. Trust the Queen, not the cardiologist.
2. Thrombolytics are beneficial in STEMI(-)OMI as long as
the clinical and ECG findings are specific for OMI.
3. Any amount of STE in V1 in the presence of inferior OMI
implies right ventricularl MI (RVMI). RVMI causes poor RV
output and hypotension, and is associated with high
mortality if not reperfused. It is caused by proximal RCA
occlusion (proximal to the RV marginal branch). Not all
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atypical-symptoms-should-we-give-thrombolytics/ 3/11
proximal occlusions cause RVMI because most patients
have collaterals to the RV from the LAD.
4. See our publication on Bayesian analysis of ACS
(pretest probability and post-test probability, how to
incorporate all info to make a decision: (Full text)
5. Here are many more cases of RVMI.
6. When is it too late for thrombolytics? See here for an
exhaustinve post on “Acuteness.” In this case, there are
hyperacute T-waves and no QS-waves, so there is
sufficient “acuteness” for thrombolysis.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (11/8/2025):
Todayʼs case illustrates the slightly different decision-making
process when a patient with new atypical symptoms (ie, a 2-
week history of dyspneawith pleuritic chest pain) presents
for emergency care.
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve labeled todayʼs initial ECG.
There are 2 parts to my thoughts: i) What I would do to
confirm the diagnosis; — and, ii) What Iʼd add to the
astute interpretation of the initial ECG by the clinician
contributing todayʼs case.
= = =
What Iʼd Do to Confirm the Diagnosis:
Assessment of todayʼs case is made challenging, not only by
the atypicalnature of this patientʼs symptoms — but because
symptoms occurred over a 2-week period — and the patient
was without chest pain on arrival in the ED.
Finding a previous ECG on this patient would be
invaluable for confirming which findings on ECG #1 were
“new”.
Recurrence of pain while in the ED — may prove
invaluable for assessing if acute ischemia is ongoing.
Although I was suspicious of an acute ongoing event on
seeing ECG #1 — I was not certain of this given the 2
week history of shortness of breath with “pleuritic” CP
(Chest Pain) as the symptoms that prompted this ED
visit.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atypical-symptoms-should-we-give-thrombolytics/ 4/11
That said — given the change in symptoms during
observation of the patient in the ED — immediately
repeating the ECG(as well as doing an Echo at the
bedside during symptomsto look for a localized wall
motion abnormality) — might be all that is needed to
remove any doubt
