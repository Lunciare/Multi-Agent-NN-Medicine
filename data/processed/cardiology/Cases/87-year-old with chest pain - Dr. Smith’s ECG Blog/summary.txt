This prehospital ECG was obtained from an elderly male with new onset chest pain. The pain was substernal 7/10, crushing in nature and radiating to the neck. He had a medical history significant for type II DM treated with insulin, DVT and abdominal surgery. How would you assess this ECG? Prehospital ECG (ECG #1) Interpretation: The ECG shows sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 50 beats per minute. The QRS duration is 110 ms, and in lead I the QRS morphology, along with absent significant R waves in V1–V2, is consistent with incomplete left bundle branch block.
