compared with baseline. The change from prior can only be caused by ischemia. Notice the concordant T wave in lead I, and the hyperacute T waves in leads V5 and V6 in the prehospital ECG when compared to baseline. The Queen of Hearts was not used in the patient management in this case. Had this AI model been used, she would have identified the occlusion myocardial infarction. See the below image for the QoH interpretation with explainability map for the initial ECG in today’s case. QoH with explainability for ECG #1 As you can see, the AI model highlights subtle concordant ST segment convexity in lead I, as well as hyperacute, prominent T waves in the lateral chest leads. Additionally, there is an inappropriately isoelectric ST segment in lead III, where one would typically expect slight ST elevation given the marked S wave. Collectively, these features are diagnostic for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). How certain can you be that this ECG represents OMI? I was sent this ECG by my colleague Dr. Vinje without clinical information. My response was, “OMI until proven otherwise.” The Queen of Hearts AI model classified this ECG as a STEMI-equivalent (OMI), outputting a value of
