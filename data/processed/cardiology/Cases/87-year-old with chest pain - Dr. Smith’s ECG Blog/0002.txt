ng/L). A repeat troponin I, drawn 3 hours later, showed a marked increase to 592 ng/L. The subsequent ECG was recorded after this second troponin result, though it is unclear if chest pain persisted at that time. Repeat ECG done in the ED (ECG #2) This ECG has some baseline wander, but essentially it shows the same findings as the initial one, strongly suggesting the patient likely remained symptomatic at the time this ECG was recorded. There are no clear signs of reperfusion. Despite the rising troponin levels (and probable ongoing chest pain), the patient was not taken to the catheterization lab but was admitted to the hospital instead. Troponin I levels increased to 23,076 ng/L overnight, and rose further to 35,906 ng/L in the morning. Both ECGs in this case independently meet criteria for diagnosing occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). Additionally, comparison with a previous baseline ECG, which was available for this patient, makes the changes even more evident. In the image below, selected leads from the prehospital ECG are compared with baseline. The change from prior can only be caused by ischemia. Notice the concordant T wave in lead I, and the hyperacute T waves in leads V5 and
