This prehospital ECG was obtained from an elderly male with new onset chest pain. The pain was substernal 7/10, crushing in nature and radiating to the neck. He had a medical history significant for type II DM treated with insulin, DVT and abdominal surgery. How would you assess this ECG? Prehospital ECG (ECG #1) Interpretation: The ECG shows sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 50 beats per minute. The QRS duration is 110 ms, and in lead I the QRS morphology, along with absent significant R waves in V1–V2, is consistent with incomplete left bundle branch block. There is minimal J-point elevation noted in the anterolateral and high-lateral leads. T waves in leads V3–V6 are notably hyperacute, with the most pronounced T wave changes seen in lead V5. These subtle ECG changes were not noticed or commented on by providers. The patient arrived in the emergency department with ongoing chest pain unresponsive to morphine and nitroglycerin. Initial high-sensitivity troponin I was mildly elevated at 35 ng/L (reference <34 ng/L). A repeat troponin I, drawn 3 hours later, showed a marked increase to 592 ng/L. The subsequent ECG was recorded after this second troponin result, though it is unclear
