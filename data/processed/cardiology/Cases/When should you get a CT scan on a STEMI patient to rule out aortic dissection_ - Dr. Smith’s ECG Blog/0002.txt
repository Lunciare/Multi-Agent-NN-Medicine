When should you get a CT scan on a STEMI patient to rule out aortic dissection?
KEYWORDS: dissection, omi, reperfusion, patient, delay, stemi, scanner, mediastinal, ecg, pain, chest, chest pain, portable, rare, benefit

worried about dissection → ordered CTA before thrombolytics Patient arrested in CT scanner and died Important Clarifications: Rotated portable CXRs frequently fake mediastinal widening SOB was due to heart failure from subacute MI, not dissection Troponin and BNP confirmed subacute OMI with pulmonary congestion Bottom line: The patient died because of delay and location (CT scanner), not because of missed dissection. Case 2 — True Dissection With OMI Very elderly woman Sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back Differential blood pressures ECG: large anterior OMI Bedside ultrasound showed flap → rupture → death Teaching Point: Even when dissection truly exists, outcome may not be alterable High suspicion does not automatically mean CT helps Why CT Is Usually the Wrong Move in STEMI Reperfusion benefit is time-critical By 4 hours, ~80% of thrombolytic mortality benefit is gone CT causes: Transport away from resuscitation area Delay in lytics / PCI High risk location if arrest occurs CT rarely changes management in true OMI When CT Might Be Reasonable (Very Rare) Only consider CT before reperfusion if multiple strong dissection features are present, such as: Abrupt tearing chest/back pain dominates the presentation Marked blood pressure differential Focal neurologic deficits Known connective tissue
