When should you get a CT scan on a STEMI patient to rule out aortic dissection?
KEYWORDS: dissection, omi, reperfusion, patient, delay, stemi, scanner, mediastinal, ecg, pain, chest, chest pain, portable, rare, benefit

consider CT before reperfusion if multiple strong dissection features are present, such as: Abrupt tearing chest/back pain dominates the presentation Marked blood pressure differential Focal neurologic deficits Known connective tissue disease Bedside ultrasound strongly suggestive of dissection Even then: risk–benefit must be explicit and conscious. Critical Learning Points OMI from dissection is rare Delaying reperfusion is common — and lethal Portable CXR is unreliable for mediastinal width (rotation matters) CT scanner is a terrible place to arrest Emergency medicine requires decisive action, not defensive overthinking Final Takeaway In STEMI/OMI, default to reperfusion. Do not let fear of a rare diagnosis delay treatment of a common, deadly one.
