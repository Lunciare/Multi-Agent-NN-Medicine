When should you get a CT scan on a STEMI patient to rule out aortic dissection?

Answer: Almost never. Central Thesis Acute OMI (STEMI) caused by aortic dissection is very rare (~0.5%). Any delay to reperfusion kills myocardium. Sending a STEMI/OMI patient to CT “just to be safe” is usually more dangerous than helpful. Key Epidemiology Best available data: ~5 per 1000 STEMI (0.5%) are due to acute aortic dissection. Reference cited: Zhu et al., Am J Emerg Med 2017. This means >99% of STEMI patients do NOT have dissection. Core Rule If the ECG shows OMI and the patient has ongoing symptoms → treat as OMI immediately. Do NOT delay reperfusion to rule out dissection unless there are very strong clinical features of dissection. Case 1 — Fatal Delay Due to CT Patient: 55-year-old woman, HTN, no CAD Symptoms: shortness of breath, nausea, no chest/back pain ECG: Inferior + lateral OMI, likely subacute and reperfused, but symptomatic → cath indicated Error Chain: ECG correctly identified as OMI Portable CXR appeared to show wide mediastinum Image was rotated, creating a false appearance of mediastinal widening Physician worried about dissection → ordered CTA before thrombolytics Patient arrested in CT scanner and died Important Clarifications: Rotated portable CXRs frequently fake mediastinal widening SOB was due to heart failure
