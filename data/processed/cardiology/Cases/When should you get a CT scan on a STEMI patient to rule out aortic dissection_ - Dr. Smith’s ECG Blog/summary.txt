When should you get a CT scan on a STEMI patient to rule out aortic dissection?

Answer: Almost never. Central Thesis Acute OMI (STEMI) caused by aortic dissection is very rare (~0.5%). Any delay to reperfusion kills myocardium. Sending a STEMI/OMI patient to CT “just to be safe” is usually more dangerous than helpful. Key Epidemiology Best available data: ~5 per 1000 STEMI (0.5%) are due to acute aortic dissection.
