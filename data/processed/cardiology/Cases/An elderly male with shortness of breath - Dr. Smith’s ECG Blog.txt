An elderly male with
shortness of breath
A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports
significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new
shortness of breath.

EARLY REPOLARIZATION
ABNORMAL ECG
ED final official overread: “early repol vs hyperacute T, minimal changes from
previous (previous shown below)”
What do YOU think?
Smith: there is some minimal ST elevation in V2-V6, but does not meet STEMI
criteria. Is it normal STE? The computer thinks so, and the physician thinks that
is quite possible. 

However, there is terminal QRS distortion in lead V3. We showed that this
NEVER happens in normal ST elevation!
There are also subtly hyperacute T-wave in I, aVL, and V2-V6.
There is also a very negative (reciprocally inverted) T-wave in lead III, and a
down-up T-wave in aVF, both of which are highly suggestive of occlusion of the
LAD or D1.
Previous many months ago when patient had vertigo:
Notice that the T-waves are far smaller, there is none of the
inferior findings, and there is a well-formed S-wave in V3
(absence of terminal QRS distortion)

These findings were very suspicious for the triage MD and so she
took the patient to the critical care area.
Then the patientʼs pain then resolved spontaneously after 2
sublingual nitroglycerine and another ECG was recorded
ECG 2 at 16 minutes
ST ELEVATION CONSISTENT WITH INJURY, PERICARDITIS, OR EARLY
REPOLARIZATION
Overread same
Smith: The T-waves are now MUCH smaller. The S-wave is reconstituted. The
inferior findings are much less pronounced. The T-wave and STE in V2 are still
very suspicious and much different from baseline, but the overall interpretation is
that it is consistent with reperfusion.
Thus, the LAD has reperfused (“recanalized”) spontaneously
Queen on ECG 2:
Not OMI, Low confidence
She is also worried about V2.

However, the ST segments are still relatively straight.

Smith: Upward concavity is restored
Here are V1-V3 of all ECGs side by side for comparison:
Time zero is with Occlusion, 16 minutes pain is resolving
Look at the subtle differences in T-waves, the terminal QRS
distortion in V3 at time 0, the restoration of the S-wave in V3
after pain resolution at 16 minutes, the decrease in total size

and height of T-waves at 16 minutes and thereafter, and the
restoration of upward concavity at 21 and 55 minutes.
Because the pain was gone and the ECG improving, the cath lab was not
activated. The chart says that “Cardiology agrees that the first ECG is early
repolarization and similar to previous,” but recommended giving aspirin and
starting heparin and to wait for the first troponin to discuss.
They also wanted an aortic CT which was negative.
This is a “Transient OMI”. Transient STEMI has been studied and many of
these patients will re-occlude in the middle of the night. If you are prepared for
this, they conclude that it is acceptable to wait until the morning for intervention.
The Proximal LAD thrombus lysed or partially lysed, restoring flow.
Here it is not at all clear that they recognized that this was a transient OMI.

Formal Echocardiogram
SUMMARY
The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74 %.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 27 mmHg + RA pressure.
Normal left ventricular cavity size.
Normal estimated left ventricular ejection fraction .
No wall motion abnormality
This shows that significant ACS can have ZERO WMA!!
Angiogram
–LAD is a large-caliber vessel that wraps around the apex
–There is a tubular 80% in the ostial LAD that was relatively smooth but did not
resolve with repeated doses of IC nitroglycerin
–There is a tiny D1, medium D2, and small D3
Lesion on Prox LAD: Ostial 80% stenosis. Pre-procedure TIMI III flow was
noted. Post Procedure TIMI III flow was present.

Now you see Wellensʼ waves!!
Terminal T-wave inversion in V2-V4 (Wellens Pattern A)
This was read as “Normal ECG” by the overreading
cardiologist
ECG 8 36 hours
Wellens’ waves here too, but less prominent.
V2 especially, V3 has artifact, and V4 has a sublte Wellens wave
This was read as “Normal ECG” by the overreading
cardiologist
Wellens described reperfusion T-waves, but he did not explicitly link them to his
own syndrome. See below.
Wellens’ waves and reperfusion T-waves are the same thing!
Wellen’s waves indicate that, when the patient was having chest pain, there was
occlusion. After spontaneous reperfusion, the ST and/or hyperacute T-waves
resolve and T-wave inversion evolves.
See these casese (and I have many others):
First ED ECG is Wellens’ (pain free). What do you think the prehospital
ECG showed (with pain)?

Why we need continuous 12-lead ST segment monitoring in Wellens’
syndrome
If you had recorded an ECG during chest pain, what would it have shown?
Evidence for Wellens as a reperfusion syndrome
To my knowledge, there is no research paper demonstrating this. From
my experience, I am confident that if it were formally studied, it would
be born out.
I believe that I was the first to represent Wellens as a reperfusion
syndrome, in my book, The ECG in Acute MI, pages 22-23 and 51,
and in chapter 27 on Reperfusion and Reocclusion.
My recognition of this was based papers by Wehrens and Doevendans on
terminal T-wave inversion as a sign of reperfusion after use of
thrombolytics. Notice that both papers have Wellens as senior author,
and it is very curious that he did not make the connection between
his own syndrome and the identical ECG he described in these
studies!

===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (9/7/2024):
===================================
The KEY to comparing to ECGs — is to put both ECGs next-to-
each-other! Doing so greatly facilitates appreciation of any
differences that might exist between the 2 tracings. Optimal
comparison consists of 2 Steps:
STEP #1: Make sure that lead-to-lead comparison will be
accurate — by comparing the frontal plane axis and R wave
progression in both tracings.
STEP #2: Look lead-by-lead for any ST-T wave differences
between the 2 tracings.
Today’s patient is an older man who present with shortness of
breath and chest pain at the base of his right scapula — so this

--- Страница 9 ---
22/01/2026, 15:33 An elderly male with shortness of breath - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
patient is having new symptoms (which means we need to pay
extra attention to any new ECG findings we see).
Figure-1 compares the initial ECG — with
a previous tracing done months earlier at a time when he
was not having cardiac symptoms.
Note that the frontal plane axis is different in the 2
tracings (The QRS is predominantly negative in lead III and
isoelectric in aVF in ECG #1 — whereas the QRS is all
positive in leads III and aVF in ECG #2). This may account
for the fact that the T wave in lead III of ECG #1 is
inverted (which it may sometimes normally be when the
QRS in this lead is predominantly negative) — whereas the
T wave in lead III of ECG #2 is upright.
R wave progression (and QRS
morphology) is also different in the 2 tracings. That said —
I did not think the ST-T wave changes I’m about to describe
in the chest leads were the result of this slight difference in
precordial lead QRS morphology.
Figure-1: Comparison between the initial ECG and
the previous ECG.
What is the Difference between ECG #1 and ECG #2?
The emergency care provider did compare the 2 ECGs in Figure-
1 — and wrote, “Early repolarization vs hyperacute T waves —
minimal changes from previous tracing.” Putting both ECGs next-
to-each-other as is done in Figure-1 suggests otherwise.
The most striking difference between ECG #1 and ECG #2
is in the 2 leads within the RED rectangle. The T wave
in lead V3 of ECG #1 is as tall as the R wave in this lead —
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/an-elderly-male-with-shortness-of-breath/ 9/15
--- Страница 10 ---
22/01/2026, 15:33 An elderly male with shortness of breath - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
or proportionately, much taller with respect to its associated
R wave than was present on the previous ECG. Isn’t this T
wave in lead V3 of ECG #1 also much bulkier (with a much
wider base) than it was in ECG #2?
The T wave in lead V2 of ECG #1 is also proportionately
taller and more hypervoluminous than it appeared in the
previous tracing (especially considering relative R wave
amplitude in lead V2 for these 2 tracings).
Leads V4, V5, and V6 in ECG #1 all show ST elevation —
which was not present in the prior tracing.
Finally — whereas the new T wave negativity in lead III
of ECG #1 is not necessarily an abnormal finding (because
of the more leftward frontal plane axis with predominant
QRS negativity in lead III of ECG #1) — the down-up T
wave that is seen in lead aVF of ECG #1 is clearly not a
normal finding (double BLUE arrows in this lead).
Impression: In a patient with new symptoms — early
repolarization is a diagnosis of exclusion to be made only
after you have ruled out the possibility of an acute event. In
ECG #1 — the ST-T wave appearance of the 2 leads within
the RED rectangle is not typical for a repolarization variant
— nor is the down-up T wave in lead aVF — nor is the
amount of ST elevation that we see in lead V4 which
is neighboring to clearly abnormal leads V2,V3. And
dynamic ST-T wave changes between ECG #1 and ECG
#2 confirm an acute event in progress.
Learning Point:
It does not take more time to put the 2 ECGs you are comparing
next-to-each-other. Doing so makes it so much easier to
recognize important ST-T wave differences that otherwise are
usually not detected.
