Baseline wander. But what
else do you see?
Written by Magnus Nossen
The below ECG was obtained from a 65 year old man with ongoing chest
pain. He has a history of hypertension and tobacco use. He is otherwise
healthy. There is no prior ECG for comparison. What do you think?
E CG #1 
Interpretation: The quality of the above ECG is not optimal. There is
significant baseline wander that does make it more challenging to interpret
ischemic changes. The ECG shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 bpm.
There is a slightly wide QRS (just about 120ms) consistent with a
nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD). The PR interval is on
the short side, but there are no clear delta waves.

 1/12
Despite the baseline wander there is appreciable concordant ST
segment elevation in lead III. There is likely some very slight concordant
ST elevation also in lead aVF. The lateral leads I and aVL show
reciprocal ST depression, with lead aVL showing concordant ST
depression. The S-wave in lead V2 measures 17mm and the ST segment
in lead V2 is isoelectric. With the slightly prolonged QRS and significant
S-wave one would expect some discordant ST elevation in lead V2. In
other words there is inappropriate isoelectric ST segment in V2.
Putting all the above findings together, the ECG is very concerning if not
diagnostic for inferior and posterior OMI. These findings were not
appreciated by providers. However, due to the nature of the symptoms,
the patient was treated for ACS and admitted to the hospital. The below
ECG was obtained 45 minutes after the first one with the patient being
free of chest pain at the time of recording of ECG #2.
What do you think now?
ECG #2
Again there is sinus rhythm, short PR and IVCD. The ECG now shows
resolution of the concordant ST segments in the inferior leads. There is
now a very slight ST elevation in V2, as one would expect appropriate
discordant ST Elevation, discordant (in the opposite direction) from the
preceeding majority negative QRS (S-wave).
The artery has re-perfused.
There was no comment by the providers on the dynamic ECG changes on
the repeat ECG.
The patient in today’s case was lucky to re-perfuse. He remained chest
pain free and underwent coronary angiography the following day. The
CAG showed a 99% thrombotic lesion of the proximal RCA, which was
stented. Due to rapid spontaneous reperfusion, high sensitivity troponin I
peaked at just under 5000 ng/L.
This OMI went unrecognized and, had the artery not re-perfused by itself,
the patient could have suffered a very large myocardial infarction. He was
diagnosed with NSTEMI.

What does the Queen of Hearts AI model say about the ECGs in
today’s case?
Below: Queen of Hearts interpretation ECG #1
Below: Queen of hearts interpretation ECG #2
Discussion: OMI findings can be subtle. Whenever there is a wide QRS
complex and baseline wander the interpretation is more difficult. The
Queen of Hearts AI model confidently identifies the first ECG in today’s
case as occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI HIGH confidence). The
repeat ECG, after reperfusion is equally confidently recognized as not
OMI.
The outcome in today’s case was good but that was not due to expert
ECG interpretation but rather a bit of luck. The OMI could have been
recognized if the QoH had been used.
Smith comment:
Approximately 33% of cases that everyone would call STEMI reperfuse
spontaneously (TIMI-1, 2, 3 flow) before they undergo emergent
angiogram (usually under 90 minute door to balloon time)
20% have TIMI-3 flow.
Of all OMI, approximately 43% present with diagnostic ST Elevation. 57%
do not and are called “NSTEMI.” But many of these OMI will
 3/12
spontaneously reperfuse by the time of next day angiogram so that, at
next day angiogram, 25% of NSTEMI have TIMI-0 flow and 34% have
TIMI 0-1 flow without collateral flow.
You don’t know which will reperfuse at the time they present with
OMI. So all must be treated emergently. Many subtle OMI do not get
diagnosed until their next-day angiogram, at which time much myocardium
is lost. They have much higher mortality and worse LV function than the
NSTEMI with open artery next day.
Therefore, you must find a way to recognize these subtle OMI at
arrival in order to get them rapid intervention. Expert or AI ECG
interpretation is the only way to do so.
A significant proportion of patients with OMI do not re-perfuse on their own
and the use of the QoH can provide more timely treatment and a better
outcome for these patients.

Learning points:
With training one can learn to identify OMI despite baseline wander
and a wide QRS complex.
The Queen of Hearts already does this very well and can improve
the management of ACS patients
We need to better identify patients with ongoing coronary occlusion
as we cannot count on patients being as lucky at the patient in
today’s case
Whenever the ECG has poor quality obtaining a repeat tracing is
advisable. Sometimes a poor quality tracing is all you have to make
your decision.

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (11/8/2024):
===================================
Todayʼs case by Dr. Nossen brings out a series of important
points:
As per comments by Drs. Nossen and Smith —
the initialECG is absolutely diagnostic of acute infero-
postero OMI.
As per Dr. Nossen — the presence of both QRS
wideningandbaselinewander + significant
 4/12
artifactmake assessment of acute OMI more
challenging. That said — this 65-year old man with risk
factors (smoking, hypertension) — was admitted to the
hospital for“ongoing CP”that apparently was severe
enough, such thatthis chest pain (andnot the initial
ECG) was the reason that cardiac cath was ultimately
performed (albeit cardiac cath was not done until the
next day).The point is that todayʼs patient was high-
risk for having an acute event.
KEY Point: Although it is understandable that providers may
have missed the subtle-but-real ST-T wave changes of acute
OMI on the initial ECG — given the high-risklikelihood for an
acute event — the technicalconcerns regarding the initial
ECG should have immediately prompted repeating the ECG:
Consider Figure-1 — in which I have labeled key findings
in the limb leads. The question that arises is which of the
8 beats in the limb leads of the initialECG accurately
convey ST-T wave appearance?
For example — IF the only 3 beats seen in the limb leads
were beats #5,6,7 (within the dotted RED rectangles
in Figure-1) — it would have been much clearer that
there is hyperacute ST elevation in lead III, and to
a lesser extent, also inlead aVF (RED arrows in these
leads) — with reciprocal ST depression in lead aVL
(PINK arrows).
On the other hand — I would not have been at all certain
about ST elevation in leads III and aVF (nor of reciprocal
ST depression in lead aVL) — if the only beats seen in
the limb leads looked like beats #3,4.
And, as per Dr. Nossen — in the presence of acute
inferior OMI — loss of the usual normal slight, gently
upsloping ST elevation in lead V3 indicates
associated posterior OMI (BLUE arrows in this lead
showing slight J-point ST depression).
NOTE: It may help to recognize that the reason for so
much artifact in the limb leads — is the result of some
disturbance or movement (ie, tremor? fidgeting?
scratching?) in the LA electrode.
As per My Comment in the February 18, 2024 post in
Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog — the LA (Left Arm) can be quickly
identified as the “culprit”extremity because baseline
artifact is maximal in leads I, III and aVL — present
but less in leads aVR and aVF — and not present at all in
lead II.
Being able to identify within seconds the “culprit”
extremity responsible for the artifact may suggest a
 5/12
“quick fix” (ie, Asking the patient to stop scratching or
moving the “culprit” extremity) — and
then repeating the ECG to clarify the true nature of ST-T
wave appearance.
Side NOTE: Did you notice how
much narrower the QRS in lead V4 looks compared to other
leads? This is because the subtle, terminal part of the QRS in
V4 goes undetected because it almost entirely lies on the
baseline (YELLOW arrows in this lead).
This finding illustrates the importance of always
using more than a single monitoring lead when
assessing QRS width in a tachyarrhythmia (since you
otherwise might mistake a wide tachycardia for an SVT
— if part of the QRS lies on the baseline in the single
lead of your 1-lead rhythm strip).
Figure-1:Iʼve labeled the initialECG in todayʼs case. (To improve
visualization — Iʼve digitized the original ECG usingPMcardio).
How Not to Miss “Dynamic” ST-T Wave Changes:
Not only were the acute ST-T wave findings missed in ECG
#1 — but the new limb lead ST-T wave changes in ECG
#2(compared to ECG #1) were also missed. Awareness of the
following points can avoid overlooking these
telltale “dynamic” ST-T wave changes:
We need to be looking for “dynamic” ST-T wave
changes in serial tracings — because when
found (especially if the nature of these
changes correlates with the clinical situation) — they
are diagnostic of an acute event!
In todayʼs case — this patient with “ongoing CP” at the
time of admission — no longer had CP 45 minutes later,
at the time ECG #2 was obtained. We need to be aware
that if ST elevation resolves in association with reduced
 6/12
(or relieved) CP, with replacement of ST elevation
by reperfusion T waves (ST depression and/or T wave
inversion) — that these “dynamic” ST-T wave
changes tell us that the “culprit” artery
has spontaneously reperfused!
PEARL: Unless serial ECGs are comparedside-by-
side — subtle-but-important ST-T wave changes will be
missed. These ST-T wave changes between ECG #1 and ECG
#2 were not seen in todayʼs case.
LOOK at Figure-2.
Isnʼt it much easier to recognize reperfusionST-T
wave changes now that I have placed the limb leads
from ECG #1 and ECG #2 next to each
other? (Comparison between RED/PINK vs BLUE arrows
in Figure-2).
BOTTOM Line: Even if the acute findings in ECG #1 went
unrecognized — the occurrence of reperfusionST-T
waves in association with resolution of CP at the
time ECG #2 was obtained — would
have confirmed acute OMIand the need for prompt
cath (instead of cath being delayed until the next day).

the limbleads in ECG #1 vs ECG #2. (To improve visualization —
