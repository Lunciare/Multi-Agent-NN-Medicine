Case Setup

ECG presented without patient information. Task: identify the rhythm and decide what to do in the ED.

Core ECG Description

Regular narrow-complex tachycardia at ~118 bpm

Normal axis

No sinus P waves (no upright P in lead II)

Atrial activity is present but subtle:

Negative P waves in inferior leads (hidden in ST segments)

Small upright P waves in V1 (high-frequency “sharper” than T waves)

Retrograde atrial activation: wavefront travels inferior → superior

RP interval ~120 ms → short-RP tachycardia

Retrograde P waves show constant RP′ interval and are 1:1 related to the preceding QRS

Differential Diagnosis (Short-RP SVT with retrograde P waves)

Low atrial tachycardia (possibly with long PR / 1° AV block)

Junctional tachycardia (JT) (automatic focus at AV junction)

Orthodromic AVRT (reentry via AV node down, accessory pathway back)

Slow–fast AVNRT (most common SVT mechanism; usually faster rates, but can be slower)

Fast–slow AVNRT is unlikely because that is typically a long-RP tachycardia (P wave appears just before QRS).

Key Interpretation Debate in the Case

One view: AVNRT is the first thought because it’s common, but 118 bpm is slow for typical AVNRT (often ~140–280).

Another view: JT fits the slower rate better, but true junctional tachycardia is rare in adults.

Ken Grauer’s position: the RP′ interval is relatively long (retrograde P waves occur past mid-ST segment) → favors orthodromic AVRT over AVNRT and over adult JT (which usually has a shorter RP′, when retrograde P waves are visible).

Bottom-line diagnostic reality: you often cannot know with absolute certainty from a single ECG snapshot, but the rhythm is best characterized as a regular SVT with 1:1 retrograde P waves (short-RP SVT).

Behavioral Clues That Help Distinguish Mechanism (when available)

Onset

Reentry (AVNRT/AVRT): often abrupt onset, triggered by PAC/PVC

Automatic (some AT, JT): “warm-up” period (gradual acceleration)

Regularity

Reentry: highly regular

Automatic: more variability / slight irregularity

Termination

Reentry: terminates when circuit interrupted (often abruptly)

Automatic: may slow/stop as focus loses dominance

Patient context

JT is mostly pediatric; adult “junctional” rhythms often reflect “something else” (illness, drugs, electrolytes, postop state, etc.)

ED Management (What to do)
Primary diagnostic–therapeutic maneuver: Adenosine

AVNRT / AVRT: usually terminates with adenosine (conversion to sinus rhythm)

Automatic atrial tachycardia: adenosine may cause transient AV block revealing atrial activity (P waves continue), no conversion

Junctional tachycardia (automatic): typically does not terminate with adenosine → if no termination, consider JT/automatic mechanism and search for underlying cause (myocarditis, infection, meds/drugs, electrolytes, etc.)

Practical ED takeaway in this case: treat as SVT and try adenosine; use the response to refine diagnosis and next steps.
