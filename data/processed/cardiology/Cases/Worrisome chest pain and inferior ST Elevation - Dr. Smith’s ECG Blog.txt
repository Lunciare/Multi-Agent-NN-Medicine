Worrisome chest pain and
inferior ST Elevation
This is a 30-something year old male with 1 week of constant
left substernal chest pressure. Patient states the pain is non-
radiating, it is not worse with breathing. It is not exertional and
may have a positional component. He endorses some
intermittent shortness of breath during this time and is using
his inhaler for asthma as needed.

Here is his first ECG:
What do you think?
This was sent to me by text message with the information that
the PMCardio Queen of Hearts had already opined that it was
Not OMI. Probably because of this, they had waited for a
troponin and it was undetectable, so with 7 days of chest
pain, that almost rules out acute MI.

the EU.
The Queen does not explain why she thinks an ECG is NOT
OMI.
My response was that it looked pretty scary and that I would
be on the fence about activating the cath lab.
Why do I not think it is diagnostic of inferior OMI? In spite of
STE meeting STEMI Millimeter criterial, it does not look
diagnostic to me due to the very small T wave in lead III and
the profound upward concavity in II and aVF. There is no
definite ST depression in aVL and none in V2-V4.
They recorded 2 more ECGs over 4 hours. Here is the 4 hour
ECG:

I think this one looks even scarier.
But the Queen is not disturbed:

There were 3 serial troponins and all were undetectable at < 3
ng/L.
With a truly DIAGNOSTIC ECG, do not trust even undetectable
troponins. See this case. And other cases of Unstable
Angina in the Era of High Sensitivity Troponin.
I trust the undetectable troponins this time because the ECG,
though worrisome, is NOT diagnostic.
Does the PMCardio Queen of Hearts decrease False Positive
Activations?
We will be presenting 2 studies at the Transcatheter
Therapeutics (TCT) conference in San Francisco. Stay tuned

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(10/6/2025):
As always — I looked at todayʼs initialECG before looking at
what Dr. Smith and QOH said, as itʼs best to be unbiased. My
impression was identical to that of Dr. Smith — namely my
uncertainty about whether or not this initialECG represented
an acute OMI.
Point #1: I thought todayʼs initial tracing was non-
diagnostic, in that I felt unable to rule out an OMI on the
basis of ECG #1 without additional evaluation. And, this
patient did present to the ED because of 1 week of
constant left substernal chest pressure — so in
addition to ruling out an acute event, priority should be
given to figuring out why this patientʼs CP (Chest Pain)
has persisted for this duration of time.

For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced and labeled todayʼs
initial ECG, together with a repeat tracing done ~4 hours later.
Of note — there is an S1Q3T3 pattern in ECG #1. This is
marked by an unusually deep S wave in lead I — with an
almost equally deep (albeit narrow) Q wave in lead III —
with subtle-but-present terminal T wave negativity in
lead III. To Emphasize — There is no indication of
pulmonary embolism in todayʼs case. The subtle rSrʼsʼ
pattern in lead V1 lacks the terminal s wave in lead V6
for incomplete rbbb — and the rest of this ECG is not
suggestive of PE (no RAA or RV strain). This highlights
that the simple presence of an S1Q3T3 pattern is not
indicative of acute PE in the absence of a suggestive
clinical history and other ECG signs.
That said — I interpreted the subtle terminal T wave
negativity in lead III — together with the subtle ST
segment flattening with ever-so-slight ST depression in
lead aVL of ECG #1 as the main reasons for my
uncertainty about this initial tracing.
Q wavesare present in each of the 3 inferior leads of
ECG #1 — albeit despite their size, these Q waves are
extremely narrow.
ST segments are elevated in the inferiorleads —
although (as per Dr. Smith) with an upward concavity
that is more often associated with a repolarization
variant. Typically when there is acute infarction — a
more comparable amount of ST depression will be seen
in oppositely positioned lead aVL than the trivial amount
of ST depression we see in ECG #1.
Finally — there is no clear sign of posterior infarction.
While transition is early (ie, the alreadytall R wave by
lead V2) — the ST segments in leads V2,V3 are upward
sloping and isoelectric instead of straightened and at
least slightly depressed as they usually are when there
is posterior involvement.
BOTTOM Line: I was not prepared to rule out the
possibility of an inferior OMI having occurred at some
time during the 1-week course of this patientʼs
symptoms on the sole basis of this initial ECG.
Did you notice the axis shift in ECG #2?
Whereas the nearly isoelectric QRS complex in lead I of
ECG #1 suggests a vertical frontal plane axis —
predominant positivity in lead I with equal positivity in
leads I and II in the repeat tracing indicates an axis much
closer to +30 degrees.
While we donʼt know the reason for this difference in
axis in the repeat tracing — the point is that assessment

22/01/2026, 15:21 Worrisome chest pain and inferior ST Elevation - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
for any changes in ST-T wave appearance between ECG
#1 and ECG #2 must take into account this axis shift with
resultant marked change in QRS morphology between
the 2 tracings. That said — I did not think there was
significant change between the 2 tracings.
= = =
Troponins ruled out an acute OMI …
As per Dr. Smith — the finding of 3 negative serial
Troponins ruled out an acute event, supported by a lack
of significant change on serial ECGs (an earlier repeat
tracing was also done, although not shown in this case).
But does this rule out the possibility of underlying
coronary disease in this patient whose ECG is non-
diagnostic but not “normal”?
Final Thought: We are not advised about further
assessment of this patientʼs symptoms. Given the
presence of “constant substernal chest pressure” for a
1-week period, severe enough to prompt ED evaluation
and this patientʼs non-diagnostic but not “normal” ECGs
— I would have considered CCTA (Chest CT
Angiography) as a non-invasive test that could have
been completed during the time this patient spent in the
ED getting serial ECGs and Troponins. Doing so would
have more definitively ruled out underlying coronary
disease (and if nothing else — would have made it less
likely that this patient would return to the ED if his
“constant substernal chest pressure” continued). If his
symptoms did continue — additional evaluation could
then be safely pursued on an outpatient basis.
