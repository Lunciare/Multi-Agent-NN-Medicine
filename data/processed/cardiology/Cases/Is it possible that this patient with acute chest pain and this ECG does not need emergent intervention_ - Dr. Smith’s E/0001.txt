84-year-old male with significant cardiac history (CABG + multiple stents) awoke at 05:00 with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. He arrived to a rural ED ~06:30. Because he was recovering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and screened positive at triage, his symptoms were initially attributed to viral illness, but an ECG was obtained at 06:49.

Initial ECG (06:49) — Why This Does Need Emergent Intervention Despite baseline artifact, findings were consistent with infero-posterior OMI: Sinus bradycardia Convex ST elevation in lead III Reciprocal ST depression in aVL Possible anterior ST depression (V2–V3) → posterior involvement Interpretation: Inferior + posterior occlusive event → inferoposterior OMI until proven otherwise. Key concept: STEMI criteria are insensitive for OMI; failure to meet STEMI thresholds does not mean “no cath”. Early Management Pitfalls Troponin error Initial hs-cTn negative (11 ng/L). This falsely reassured the team. Troponin can be normal in early OMI (especially <2 hours from onset). In the presence of a diagnostic ECG, an initial normal troponin is not actionable for ruling out occlusion. Nitroglycerin Two sprays of SL nitro did not improve pain but caused transient hypotension (SBP <90). Hypotension after nitro in suspected inferior MI raises concern for preload dependence (possible RV involvement). Right-sided leads may be considered clinically, but this does not change the need for cath when OMI is present. Objective Deterioration (Several Hours Later) Repeat troponin returned >600 ng/L. At this point, even without ECG interpretation skills: Persistent chest pain + elevated troponin = high-risk ACS needing urgent invasive strategy. Repeat ECG (11:19) —
