84-year-old male with significant cardiac history (CABG + multiple stents) awoke at 05:00 with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. He arrived to a rural ED ~06:30. Because he was recovering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and screened positive at triage, his symptoms were initially attributed to viral illness, but an ECG was obtained at 06:49.

to cardiac center Still had persistent 4/10 chest pressure, but appeared comfortable Underwent PCI: 100% RCA occlusion stented LCx open but small, supplied little posterior wall Receiving cardiologist described case as “challenging” Key ECG Pattern (Posterior OMI) This case demonstrates classic pattern: Inferior STE with reciprocal STD in aVL (may be subtle, not meeting STEMI criteria) ST depression maximal in V2–V3 → posterior OMI (high specificity) Increasing anterior R-wave progression can support posterior infarction Inferior T-wave inversion can indicate reperfusion or ongoing ischemia depending on symptoms System-Level Learning Points High pretest probability matters Elderly + known CAD + ischemic symptoms waking from sleep → assume acute coronary pathology. Do not anchor on ILI Viral illness does not exclude MI and can precipitate plaque rupture. Do not wait for troponin when ECG is diagnostic Early troponin can be negative even in true occlusion. Posterior leads can be falsely negative and can be placed wrong Posterior OMI is best diagnosed using V1–V3 mirror findings. “NSTEMI” label can delay life-saving cath Many NSTEMI patients have an occluded artery; delays lead to preventable myocardial loss. Bottom Line (One Sentence) In a high-risk chest pain patient, convex STE in III with reciprocal STD in aVL
