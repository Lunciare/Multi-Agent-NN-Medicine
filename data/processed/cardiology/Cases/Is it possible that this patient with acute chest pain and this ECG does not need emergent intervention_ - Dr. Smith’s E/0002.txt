84-year-old male with significant cardiac history (CABG + multiple stents) awoke at 05:00 with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. He arrived to a rural ED ~06:30. Because he was recovering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and screened positive at triage, his symptoms were initially attributed to viral illness, but an ECG was obtained at 06:49.

Repeat troponin returned >600 ng/L. At this point, even without ECG interpretation skills: Persistent chest pain + elevated troponin = high-risk ACS needing urgent invasive strategy. Repeat ECG (11:19) — Reperfusion Pattern But Ongoing Danger Repeat ECG showed evidence of reperfusion: Less ST elevation inferiorly More T-wave inversion in inferior leads Loss of T-wave bulk in V4–V6 But: patient still had pain → reperfusion ECG does not equal “safe” if symptoms persist. Posterior Leads (15-lead ECG at 12:10) — Not Required and Can Mislead A 15-lead ECG was obtained because posterior MI was suspected. Core message from the case: Posterior leads are not necessary to diagnose posterior OMI. Any ST depression in V1–V3 in chest pain is posterior OMI until proven otherwise. Posterior leads can be falsely negative due to reduced amplitudes through back musculature. In this case, V9 was misplaced, further reducing reliability. Best posterior OMI clue: Maximal ST depression in V2–V3 (very high specificity), plus mirror-test morphology. Treatment and Outcome Treated under “NSTEMI protocol” (ASA, enoxaparin, ticagrelor) Transferred to cardiac center Still had persistent 4/10 chest pressure, but appeared comfortable Underwent PCI: 100% RCA occlusion stented LCx open but small, supplied little posterior wall Receiving cardiologist described case
