84-year-old male with significant cardiac history (CABG + multiple stents) awoke at 05:00 with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and light-headedness. He arrived to a rural ED ~06:30. Because he was recovering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and screened positive at triage, his symptoms were initially attributed to viral illness, but an ECG was obtained at 06:49.

patients have an occluded artery; delays lead to preventable myocardial loss. Bottom Line (One Sentence) In a high-risk chest pain patient, convex STE in III with reciprocal STD in aVL plus maximal STD in V2–V3 is infero-posterior OMI until proven otherwise — and requires emergent cath regardless of initial troponin or symptom attribution to ILI.
