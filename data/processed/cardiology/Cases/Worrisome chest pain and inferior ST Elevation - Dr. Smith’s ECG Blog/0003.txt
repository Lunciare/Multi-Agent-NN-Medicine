Worrisome chest pain and inferior ST elevation — OMI or not?

uncertainty persists Bottom Line Inferior ST elevation can be scary without being OMI 7 days of constant pain + undetectable troponin ≠ acute MI AI saying “Not OMI” is supportive, not definitive This is a case where clinical reasoning overrides pattern recognition Key Takeaway Not every scary ECG is an occlusion. Not every negative AI is reassurance. Time course + biomarkers + symptoms decide the truth.
