Worrisome chest pain and inferior ST elevation — OMI or not?
KEYWORDS: ecg, troponin, acute, omi, inferior, pain, days, negative, elevation, symptoms, inferior elevation, undetectable, scary, constant, myocarditis

ST Elevation ≠ STEMI by Default Important non-OMI causes of inferior STE include: Pericarditis Benign early repolarization Normal variant Myocarditis GI or musculoskeletal pain with incidental ECG changes The absence of evolving biomarkers and lack of classic ischemic symptom pattern lowers MI probability. 3. AI Is an Aid, Not an Arbiter Queen of Hearts labeled this Not OMI But: AI does not explain reasoning AI is trained for acute occlusion, not every dangerous ECG Clinician discomfort is still valid A negative AI result should reduce confidence, not replace judgment. 4. Troponin Is a Time-Sensitive Test With 7 days of symptoms, a true MI should almost always have: Elevated or falling troponin A completely negative troponin at this stage makes: Acute MI very unlikely Practical Clinical Framing This ECG falls into the category of: “Concerning ECG + low probability acute MI” Which means: Do not reflexively activate cath lab Do not ignore the ECG either Appropriate actions: Serial ECGs Careful history for pericarditis/myocarditis clues Echocardiography Consider inflammatory markers Cardiology input if uncertainty persists Bottom Line Inferior ST elevation can be scary without being OMI 7 days of constant pain + undetectable troponin ≠ acute MI AI saying “Not OMI” is supportive,
