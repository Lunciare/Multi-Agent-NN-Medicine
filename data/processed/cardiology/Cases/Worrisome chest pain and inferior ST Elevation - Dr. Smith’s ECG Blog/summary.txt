Worrisome chest pain and inferior ST elevation — OMI or not?
KEYWORDS: ecg, troponin, acute, omi, inferior, pain, days, negative, elevation, symptoms, inferior elevation, undetectable, scary, constant, myocarditis

Clinical Context Patient: Male, ~30s 7 days of constant left substernal chest pressure Non-radiating, non-exertional Possible positional component Intermittent shortness of breath History of asthma Key detail: symptoms are prolonged (1 week) and ongoing, not episodic. Initial ECG Inferior ST elevation Sent with the note that PMCardio Queen of Hearts = NOT OMI Because of AI result, clinicians waited for troponin Troponin undetectable Given 7 days of chest pain, a negative troponin makes acute MI less likely, but does NOT make the ECG “safe.” Core Tension in This Case ECG looks concerning AI says NOT OMI Troponin negative Symptoms atypical for classic MI Dr. Smith’s reaction: “It looked pretty scary and I would be on the fence.” This is a gray-zone ECG where context matters more than any single test. Key Teaching Points 1. Duration of Symptoms Matters 7 days of continuous pain + undetectable troponin → argues strongly against acute ongoing infarction However: Could represent subacute, healed, or non-ischemic pathology ECG abnormalities may persist long after ischemia 2.
