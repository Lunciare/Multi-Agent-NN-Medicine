A man in his 50s had chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS arrived and recorded this ECG. There is sinus rhythm with preexcitation causing abnormal QRS complexes, and consequently abnormal repolarization. There is concordant STE in V2–V5, which can occasionally occur in WPW. The T waves are not hyperacute. WPW causing a STEMI mimic pattern is favored, though baseline WPW with superimposed anterior transmural injury is possible. Zoll interpretation on EMS monitor included “STEMI”. Queen of Hearts interpretation: no OMI. Cath lab activation was cancelled after discovering the patient had known WPW and a prior ECG was available. Troponins were negative. No dangerous cause of symptoms was discovered and the patient did well. Other WPW-related posts (cardiology-relevant): * 60-year-old with chest pain: abnormal QRS and repolarization. * ECGs wrongly interpreted as “normal” due to WPW. * Inferior STEMI vs lead reversal (V1/V2). * WPW mimicking and obscuring acute MI.
