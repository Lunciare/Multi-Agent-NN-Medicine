A man in his 50s had chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS arrived and recorded this ECG. There is sinus rhythm with preexcitation causing abnormal QRS complexes, and consequently abnormal repolarization. There is concordant STE in V2–V5, which can occasionally occur in WPW. The T waves are not hyperacute. WPW causing a STEMI mimic pattern is favored, though baseline WPW with superimposed anterior transmural injury is possible.
