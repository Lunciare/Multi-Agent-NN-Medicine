A woman in her 60s with chest pain and “No STEMI”

A woman in her 60s presented with acute chest pain and normal vital signs. Here is her triage ECG: It shows diagnostic findings of acute LAD occlusion, including the precordial swirl pattern (inappropriate STE and hyperacute T-waves in V1–V2/V3, and reciprocal STD in V5–V6). Smith: there are hyperacute T-waves in V2–3, down-up T-waves in III, aVF, and V6. These are all highly specific for LAD Occlusion MI (OMI).
