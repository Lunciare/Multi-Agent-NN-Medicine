Seizure and Tachycardia
This was written by one of our fantastic Emergency Medicine 3rd year residents,
Emily Ferrari:
 
A young man presented with AMS and seizure like activity. EMS called by PD
from a scene, where the patient had been seen ingesting powder and pills, then
began acting more erratically. He was seizing on arrival to the ED, but this ceased
after 5mg Versed given by medics.
Once on the monitor, he had an odd appearing QRS complex, consistent with
wide complex sinus tachycardia. We called for ECG, and while exposing the
patient during our secondary survey – he notably had a large amount of white
powder in a baggy but also free form around his genitalia…
His first ED ECG as below :
What do you think?


Sinus rhythm. Now borderline tachycardic. A very wide QRS (178ms), large
R-wave in aVR, and Brugada morphology in V1-V2.
This is typical Sodium channel blockade morphology. One might appropriately
be worried about hyperkalemai, but this ECG is so pathognomonic of Na channel
blockade that one should immediately administer the antidote, which is Na-
bicarbonate.
What specific drugs/medications do this?
1. Tricyclic antidepressants.
2. Type 1 antidysrhythmics, especially flecainide.
3. Cocaine
With the reported ingestion of the white powder, and seizure, there was strong
suspicion of cocaine toxicity in this patient (in other settings, we would need to be
cognizant of possible TCA overdose).
An IV was placed, and bloods were drawn, including a venous blood gas.
He was immediately given 2 “amps” of sodium bicarbonate (100 mL of 8.4%
NaHCO3 = 100 mEq of Na and 100 mEq of HCO3), with the resulting ECG:
The QRS is now 160 ms
The Brugada pattern persists
His initial venous blood gas returned with pH 6.96, pCO2 64, pO2 84, bicarb 14.
We continued with serial administration of 2 doses of bicarbonate, with the
following ECGs showing narrowing of his QRS to 130 ms:

Another VBG returned with 7.21/47/67/18
And with more bicarbonate, the QRS normalized:
QRS is now 110 ms, upper limit of normal
The patient required intubation for airway protection and concern for concomitant
respiratory acidosis and persistent stupor. A bicarbonate drip was ordered, but
subsequently not used as his QRS remained normal. Later, his urine drug screen
was positive for both cocaine and fentanyl, and he was discharged from the ICU
three days later.
Reminders about pathognomonic ECG patterns in Sodium Channel Blockade:
1.
R-wave in aVR that is > 3mm or an R:S > 0.7 is highly suspicious for
sodium channel blockade.
2.
In TCA overdoses, QRS duration > 100ms is 100% sensitive for detecting
patients that are high risk for seizure, though this is specifically noted in.
Notably this patient also had a drug-induced Brugada pattern in V1 and V2. Dr.
Smith has noted this phenomenon in a previous blog post.

===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (5/6/2025):
===================================
Today’s case by Dr. Smith is another “must know” for emergency
providers — in that the history of seizures and the initial ECG (that I’ve
reproduced in Figure-1) means that we need to immediately
consider any toxicity producing Sodium-Channel Blockade (ie, tricyclic
antidepressant overdose; proarrhythmia from antiarrhythmics such as
flecainide or procainamide — or other agent listed in the excellent reviews
by Dr. Ed Burns from Life-In-The-Fast-Lane or by Josh Farkas in
the Internet Book of Critical Care).
As shown above by Dr. Smith — serial treatment with Sodium
Bicarbonate typically produces rapid clinical improvement.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/seizure-and-tachycardia/ 4/9
As a visual reminder — ECG #1 shows the characteristic signs
of Sodium-Channel Blockade:
Sinus Tachycardia.
QRS prolongation to ≥0.10 second (It is especially the terminal
portion of the QRS that is prolonged with sodium channel blockade).
QRS morphology may look bizarre.
QT prolongation (the result of slowed ventricular depolarization).
Terminal RAD (Right Axis Deviation) — as is characteristically
manifest by a terminal S wave in lead I (that may be
wide) — and/or — a significant terminal R wave component to the
QRS complex in lead aVR (that is uaully ≥3 mm in amplitude).
These effects are thought to be due to slow conduction through the
myocardium, leading to delayed depolarization of the RV (therefore
the last vector of ventricular depolarization is directed to the right).
Brugada Phenocopy.
NOTE: The ECG of a patient with sodium channel blockade may resemble
that of hyperkalemia (bizarre, widened QRS, right axis, Brugada-1 ECG
pattern).
Both of these entities may be present at the same time — such that
both empiric IV Calcium and IV Bicarbonate may be tried until
definitive diagnosis is made.
Figure-1: I’ve labeled the initial ECG in today’s case. (To improve
visualization — the original ECGs have been digitized
using PMcardio).
