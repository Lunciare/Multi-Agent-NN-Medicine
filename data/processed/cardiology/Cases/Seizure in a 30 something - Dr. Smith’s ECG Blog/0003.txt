Case Summary

removal Normal QTc does NOT exclude congenital LQTS LQTS may only manifest after: Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Drugs CNS events (e.g., seizures) Genetic testing for congenital LQTS was ordered. The patient was referred for ICD evaluation, pending results. Key Learning Points All patients with seizures require an ECG Cardiac syncope and ventricular arrhythmias can mimic epilepsy QT prolongation is easy to miss without systematic ECG review Herbal remedies are not benign and can be proarrhythmic Borderline serum K⁺ and Mg²⁺ may reflect severe total body depletion TdP is treated with: Magnesium Potassium repletion Removal of offending agents Bottom Line This case demonstrates life-threatening Torsades de Pointes masquerading as seizures in a young, previously healthy patient. The cause was most consistent with acquired long QT from herbal remedies and electrolyte depletion, emphasizing the critical role of ECG screening in all seizure presentations and the hidden danger of “natural” supplements.
