Case Summary

a PVC Self-terminating Diagnosis: Torsades de Pointes (TdP) due to long QT. ECG #3: Degeneration to Ventricular Fibrillation TdP degenerates into ventricular fibrillation Episode self-terminated before defibrillation This confirms life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia as the cause of the apparent seizures. Immediate Management IV magnesium sulfate 10 mmol bolus Continuous magnesium infusion Potassium replacement started Admission labs: Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L (low-normal) Magnesium: 0.88 mmol/L (low-normal) Despite “near-normal” serum values, total body depletion of K⁺ and Mg²⁺ was suspected and clinically significant. After electrolyte repletion: No further TdP episodes Hemodynamic and rhythm stabilization Etiology Investigation Further history revealed the patient had recently started nine different herbal remedies for fatigue and vague neurologic symptoms. Exact agents and doses unknown Herbal preparations are well-documented causes of QT prolongation Drug–drug and herb–herb interactions likely contributed Follow-Up ECG (After Stopping Herbal Remedies) Significant QTc shortening QTc returned to normal range (~420–440 ms) ST-T wave abnormalities improved This strongly suggests acquired long QT due to herbal toxicity and electrolyte depletion. Important Diagnostic Nuances QTc can normalize after trigger removal Normal QTc does NOT exclude congenital LQTS LQTS may only manifest after: Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Drugs CNS events (e.g., seizures) Genetic testing for congenital LQTS was ordered. The patient was
