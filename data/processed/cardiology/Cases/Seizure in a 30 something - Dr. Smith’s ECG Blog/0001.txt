A 30-something woman with no known past medical history presented with new-onset seizure activity. Her husband called EMS after she experienced seizures associated with micturition. There was no known history of epilepsy, syncope, or sudden cardiac death in the family. Because cardiac syncope can masquerade as seizure, an ECG was obtained prehospital. Initial ECG Findings (ECG #1) Sinus rhythm, ~75–80 bpm Narrow QRS, normal axis Mild baseline wander and artifact Key abnormality: prolonged QT interval Measured values (paper speed 50 mm/s): RR ≈ 795 ms QT ≈ 450–475 ms QTc ≈ 500–530 ms (depending on correction formula) Although the ECG initially appears “near normal,” dangerous QTc prolongation is present and is easy to miss without a systematic approach. Clinical Course During Transport While en route to the hospital, the patient had multiple brief episodes of: Loss of consciousness Cramping / seizure-like activity Rapid spontaneous recovery between episodes Continuous 12-lead monitoring captured malignant arrhythmias. ECG #2: Torsades de Pointes Underlying sinus rhythm with marked QT prolongation Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Initiated by a PVC Self-terminating Diagnosis: Torsades de Pointes (TdP) due to long QT. ECG #3: Degeneration to Ventricular Fibrillation TdP degenerates into ventricular fibrillation Episode self-terminated before defibrillation This confirms life-threatening
