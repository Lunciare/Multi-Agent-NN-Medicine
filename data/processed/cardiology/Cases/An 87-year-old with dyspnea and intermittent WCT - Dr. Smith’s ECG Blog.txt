An 87-year-old with
dyspnea and intermittent
WCT
Written by Magnus Nossen
 
The patient in todayʼs case is an 87 year old female with a
history of dual chamber pacemaker and Afib. She presented
due to weakness and dyspnea that had progressed over a
number of weeks. At presentation, the patient was
tachycardic with a heart rate of about 120 BPM. Other vital
signs were unremarkable. A prehospital ECG was transmitted
and is shown below. What do you make of the ECG?
Prehospital ECG
The ECG was originally recorded with a paper speed of 50mm/s. Here it has
been “compressed” on the X-axis so that it appears that it was recorded at
25mm/s. The layout is in the CabreraFormat(See Dr. Grauer Comment in the
October 26, 2020 postof Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog for review on the Cabrera
Format).

This ECG displays a regular rhythm featuring two distinct
QRS morphologies. In the Cabrera format, the limb and
precordial leads are recorded simultaneously. The first three
beats show narrow QRS complexes, while the fourth beat
exhibits a QRS morphology that is intermediate between the
previous and the following complexes, which are wide. The
QRS axis in the frontal plane is normal during the first three
beats, but shifts to a superior and leftward axis thereafter.
I am used to looking at ECGs in 50mm/s. Especially for
rhythm interpretation, this faster paper speed can be
beneficial. The image below shows the precordial leads in
50mm/s, and has better resolution/quality than the above
compressed image. What is the rhythm and what accounts
for the varying QRS morphology?
Precordial leads in 50mm/s
This ECG shows a regular atrial rhythm, with an atrial rate of
about 240 beats per minute. The ventricular rate is half the
atrial rate. So this is 2:1 atrial flutter. But what about beat #4?
What accounts for the change in morphology of this beat
and the susequent QRS complexes?
Let us have a closer look at the last QRS complexes in leads
V1-V3. Below I have magnified these leads.
The orange markers encircle atrial actvity. Blue arrows are

So — this ECG shows initial 2:1 conducted atrial flutter, and
then subsequent ventricular pacing. This explains the axis
shift noted on the initial ECG (superior and leftward
compatible with right ventricular pacing). Beat #4 on the initial
ECG is a fusion beat (ventricles partly depolarized intrinsically
and by the pacemaker).
But why is the pacemaker pacing at a rate of 120/minute? Is
the pacemaker malfunctioning? Is this pacemaker-mediated
tachycardia?
See this case of Pacemaker Mediated Tachycardia.
Ventricular Fibrillation, ICD, LBBB, QRS of 210 ms, Positive
Smith Modified Sgarbossa Criteria, and Pacemaker-
Mediated Tachycardia
No, this is not a typical case of pacemaker-mediated
tachycardia (PMT), also known as endless loop tachycardia
(ELT). In PMT, a ventricular paced event results in retrograde
conduction through the AV node, producing an atrial
depolarization. This retrograde P wave is then sensed by the
pacemaker as though it was an intrinsic atrial event, which
subsequently triggers another ventricular paced event
followed by another retrograde P wave — creating a self-
perpetuating “endless loop” of pacing. This phenomenon was
more common with earlier generations of pacemakers.
Modern devices now have effective algorithms that
significantly reduce the risk of developing PMT.
What we observe in todayʼs tracing is functional 2:1
undersensing. This happens when the pacemaker “fails” to
detect every other P-wave because the atrial activity occurs
during the post-ventricular atrial blanking (PVAB) period.
“
Post ventricular atrial blanking (PVAB)
refers to a pacemaker timing interval after
a ventricular paced or sensed event in

which the PM completely ignores signals
on the atrial channel.
Post-ventricular atrial blanking (PVAB) is a feature in dual-
chamber pacemakers designed to prevent the atrial sensing
channel from detecting ventricular paced beats, far-field R
waves, intrinsic ventricular events, and retrograde P waves.
Both PVAB and the post-ventricular atrial refractory period
(PVARP) are programmed timing intervals intended to reduce
the risk of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. The PVAB
temporarily blocks the pacemaker from sensing any atrial
signals immediately following a ventricular event, whether
paced or sensed.
However, if an atrial depolarization from a tachyarrhythmia
like atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter occurs during the PVAB,
it will be undetected by the pacemaker. This leads to the
pacemaker sensing only every other atrial event, a situation
called 2:1 atrial blanking. For example, with an actual atrial
rate of 240 beats per minute, 2:1 atrial blanking causes the
pacemaker to perceive only 120 beats per minute, potentially
resulting in ventricular pacing as if sinus tachycardia is
present. This explains what happens in todayʼs case. The
pacemaker “sees” sinus tachycardia and paces the ventricles
at 120/minute.
This observation was verified by pacemaker interrogation.
The following screenshot from the pacemaker interrogation
summary illustrates this phenomenon.

Telemetry print-out showing ventricular pacing at half the atrial flutter rate.
Outcome
The pacemaker statistics showed that, since the last device
interrogation, tachycardia, with a heart rate of about 120
beats per minute, was present approximately 75% of the time
with ventricular pacing occuring for more than 80% of the
ventricular beats. Thus — 2:1 blanking was a significant issue
for this patient. The pacemaker was reprogrammed to VVIR
mode at 70 beats per minute. In VVI mode, the pacemaker will
ignore the atrial channel all together (and will therefore not
track any atrial activity). This programming feature in effect
turns a two-chamber pacemaker into a single chamber
ventricular pacemaker. In todayʼs patient, this change did not
immediately affect the heart rate, as the patient continued to
have 2:1 blocked atrial flutter due to intrinsic 2:1 AV block.
After increasing the beta-blocker dose, a higher degree of AV
block was achieved, and the the ventricular rate was well
controlled. If the beta-blocker dose had been increased
without adjusting the pacemaker settings — it is likely that
this patient would have continued to be paced at half the
atrial rate due to 2:1 blanking. This would have put her at risk
of both tachycardia-mediated and pacing-induced heart
failure.
A different management strategy would have been
appropriate if the patient had been younger with fewer
comorbidities. In such cases, rhythm control with
cardioversion followed by flutter ablation is a better option.
However, this patient was very elderly and frail, with
echocardiography revealing marked dilation of both the right
and left atria; these factors made rate control the more
suitable therapeutic approach.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/3/2025):
Credit to Dr Nossen for his explanation in todayʼs post of
PVAB(Post-Ventricular Atrial Blanking) — which is just one of
an ever increasing number of sophisticated pacemaker
concepts that these amazing devices are capable of. Gone
are the days when it was easy to determine if the pacemaker
is (or is not) working as it should. Fortunately — the option to
consult with cardiology for formal pacemaker interrogation is
now readily available to provide a definite answer.
Many of us (myself included) are not expert in
pacemaker troubleshooting (beyond an awareness of
the often forgotten but highly useful truism that most of
the time — the pacer is right!). As a result — most of
the time, our principal task is to figure out why despite
whatever unusual ECG findings are present — more
likely than not, the pacemaker is functioning correctly.
As emphasized by Dr. Nossen — even the previous
nemesis of pacemakers (= Pacemaker-Mediated
Tachycardia) has been largely eliminated by
sophisticated algorithms designed to counter the
retrograde atrial conduction that so often precipitated
PMT in the past.
= = =
Todayʼs Initial Tracing:
And so I found myself uncertain about what was going on
with todayʼs initial ECG (that for clarity — Iʼve reproduced
and labeled in Figure-1). We are told that todayʼs 87-year old
female patient had a history of AFib with implantation of a
dual-chamber pacemaker for some unknown indication.
QUESTIONS:
If this patient has a pacemaker — Why canʼt we see
pacemaker spikes on the initial ECG?
And, if the patient does have a pacemaker — Is the
pacemaker functioning correctly?

Figure-1: Iʼve labeled the initial ECG in todayʼs case.

MY Thoughts:
I would not have known from looking at Figure-1 that todayʼs
patient has a permanent pacemaker — because I simply do
not see pacemaker spikes.
Filter settings are not displayed on ECG #1. To
emphasize — it may be that the reason there is no
indication of filter settings used for recording this tracing
is that notation of filter settings was removed during the
process of compressing this ECG that was originally
recorded at 50 mm/sec. Regardless — the point is that
all-too-often the potential effect that a given filter setting
might have on the ECG feature you are seeking to
optimize is ignored!
Weʼve periodically reviewed the potential role of filter
settings in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog (See My Comment in
the March 4, 2019 post, among others). Pacing spikes
are a high frequecysignal. As a result pacing spikes
may be filtered out (and therefore not seen on the ECG)
if the low passfilter is set at too low of a value (ie,
below 150 Hz). In this case — a wide QRS rhythm
without P waves may be seen (and may easily be
misinterpreted as either a junctional rhythm with an
LBBB pattern or as a ventricular rhythm).
= = =
So, What is Going On in ECG #1?
As per Dr. Nossen — the same 10 beats are seen in both limb
leads and chest leads. I found awareness of this fact helpful
to appreciate — because no single lead provided all the
answers — such that seeing all 10 beats in each of the 12
leads allowed me to optimally reason out various
relationships.
As was Dr. Nossen — my “eye” was immediately drawn
to the presence of 2 distinctly different QRS
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/an-87-year-old-with-dyspnea-and-intermittent-wct/ 7/13
--- Страница 8 ---
22/01/2026, 15:19 An 87-year-old with dyspnea and intermittent WCT - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
morphologies (with this being best seen in lead aVL).
The QRS appears to be narrow for the first 3 beats in the
tracing. The QRS widens for beats #5-thru-10.
As per Dr Nossen — beat #4 manifests a QRS and T
wave morphology that is intermediate between the first
3 narrow beats and the last 6 wider beats. Therefore,
beat #4 is a fusion beat (“F“). But — What is it that is
“fusing”?
Significant baseline artifact (especially in the limb leads)
— makes determination of atrial activity difficult. As a
result — my “eye” was drawn to lead V1, as the best
lead in ECG #1 for assessing atrial activity. RED arrows in
this lead reveal 2:1 atrial activity (ie, The underlying
rhythm is Atrial Flutter, with flutter waves at a rate of
~240/minute).
Recognizing regular flutter activity in lead V1 — allowed
me to go back and take another look at potential atrial
activity in the limb leads. As per the BLUE arrows — I
believe that I now do see regular, 2:1 atrial activity — at
least for a portion of lead II (albeit baseline artifact had
just a moment ago suggested to me that atrial activity
was not consistent throughout this 10-beat rhythm
strip).
KEY Point: I carefully measured all intervals with
calipers. All intervals remain constant throughout the
tracing. Despite the change in QRS morphology — the
R-R interval does not change over the course of this 10-
beat rhythm strip. In the one lead in which 2:1 atrial
activity is clearly present ( = lead V1) — both the P-P
interval and the PR interval preceding each QRS
complex remain constant. This would not be the case if
these wide beats were of ventricular etiology. Therefore,
despite my inability to convince myself that there are
pacing spikes — the fusion beat and widening of the
QRS for beats #5-thru-10 has to be the result of paced
QRS complexes.
BOTTOM Line: Although I was unaware of the concept
of PVAB prior to reading Dr. Nossenʼs discussion — my
above “thought process” allowed me to strongly suspect
that widening of the QRS (that begins with beat #5) —
but without any change in R-R, P-P and PR intervals —
had to be indication of pacemaker activity, with
probable appropriate pacemaker function given
maintenance of a consistent (albeit rapid) ventricular
rate.
Fortunately — formal pacemakerinterrogation in
todayʼs case was able to confirm appropriate pacemaker
function. An increase in the ß-blocker dose, together
with pacemaker reprogramming to VVIR mode restored
an appropriate ventricular rate.

As is so often the case — the pacemaker was doing
precisely what its ingenious programming designed it to
do.
