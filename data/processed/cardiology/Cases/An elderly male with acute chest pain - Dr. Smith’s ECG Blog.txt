An elderly male with acute
chest pain
Written by Magnus Nossen
The patient in todayʼs case is a 90-something male with a
medical history of prostate cancer and chronic AFib, on oral
anticoagulants. The patient contacted EMS due to sudden
onset chest pain. Below is the prehostpial ECG recorded by
EMS.
This ECG was recorded with a paper speed of 25 mm/s. The
 
layout is in the CabreraFormat(See Dr. Grauer Comment in
the October 26, 2020 postof Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog for review
on the Cabrera Format). Below the ECG has been digitized
using the PMcardio App.

The on-call cardiologist described this ECG as “unusual and
challenging to interpret.” Due to the presence of typical
symptoms, the patient was deemed appropriate for urgent
coronary angiography. Although the ECG appears unusual, it
remains important to carefully analyze it to try to understand
the underlying pathology.
Interpretation
The rhythm is irregularly irregular, with an overall heart rate of
82 bpm. The rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes
are wide, showing a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern
accompanied by left axis deviation consistent with left
anterior fascicular block (LAFB). Hyperacute T waves are
seen in the lateral leads I and aVL. Leads V4, V5, and V6 also
demonstrate hyperacute T waves, but these are preceded by
ST-segment depression characteristic of De Winter
morphology. The inferior leads II, III, and aVF display
reciprocal changes with mild ST depression and T-wave
inversion.
This ECG is diagnostic of an occlusion of the left anterior
descending artery (LAD), indicated by hyperacute T waves
and De Winter pattern in the anterolateral leads. The RBBB
and LAFB makes these finding more difficult to identify.
If this ECG does not convince you, have a look below where
the precordial leads from the prehospital ECG have been
compared with an ECG from 12 years prior. Notice the
dramatic ST-T wave changes.

The Queen of Hearts was not used for ECG interpretation in
this case. But it would have identified the OMI if it had been
implemented. See the image below for the Queen of Heartʼs

Rhythm and conduction interpretation by the QoH
Outcome:
The patient was urgently taken to the catheterization lab,
where a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left anterior
descending artery (pLAD) was identified and stented. On
admission, the Troponin T level was 353 ng/L and

subsequently increased to 4409 ng/L (a very high troponin
T consistent with large MI, equivalent to a peak troponin I of
20,000-40,000 ng/L or higher). Echocardiography revealed
an apical wall motion abnormality consistent with the findings
observed on the ECG and during the catheterization
procedure.

The above echo-loop from the apical 4 chamber view shows
distal septal and apical wall motion abnormalitity, as expected
from the ECG and angiography findings.

The ECG was originally recorded with a paper speed of 50mm/s. Here it has
been “compressed” on the X-axis so that it appears that it was recorded at
25mm/s. The layout is in the CabreraFormat(See Dr. Grauer Comment in the
October 26, 2020 postof Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog for review on the Cabrera
Format).
Following the PCI procedure and restoration of flow in the
LAD, the ECG demonstrates classic signs of reperfusion. T-
wave inversion in the early precordial leads V1 and V2 is
typically seen in right bundle branch block (RBBB) as part of
secondary repolarization changes. However, in this ECG, the
T-wave inversion extends across all the precordial leads.
Additionally, the R wave amplitudes in leads V4 and V5 are
markedly reduced compared to the prehospital ECG,
indicating significant myocardial loss.
There is persistent right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left
anterior fascicular block (LAFB), which, if caused by the acute
infarction, would be associated with a poor prognosis.
However, since this bifascicular block was present on an ECG
recorded 12 years earlier, it does not carry the same
prognostic significance. The patient did well short term.
Learning Points:
RBBB and LAFB may complicate ECG interpretation of
acute ischemia. If in doubt always compare with old ECG
if available.
The Queen of Hearts is trained to detect ischemic
changes in the setting of conduction system
abnormalities and can be helpful in aiding clinicians in
identifying ischemia in the setting of a wide QRS.

As per Dr. Nossen — todayʼs initial ECG is characteristic of
deWinter T Waves, which given the history of new CP (Chest
Pain) in this 90-something man with known AFib — is
diagnostic of acute LAD OMI. I found this tracing remarkable
for the following reasons:
It provides an excellent example of deWinter T Waves —
with some modification of this pattern because of
preexisting bundle branch block and preexisting ST-T
wave changes.
The smooth transition from one limb lead to-the-next of
the Cabrera format is highlighted.
The fluctuating Low Voltage in the limb leads seems to
reflect a corresponding fluctuation of LV function.

Comparison of Todayʼs Initial ECG with the 2013
Tracing:
For ease of comparison in Figure-1 — Iʼve placed todayʼs
initial ECG together with a previous ECG from 2013. Note the
following:
Weʼve featured many varieties of deWinter T Waves in
recent years in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog (For review of this
syndrome, including description from the original 2008
deWinter manuscript — See My Comment in the
January 31, 2025 post).
As per Dr. Nossen — leads V4,V5,V6 in ECG #1 manifest
the characteristic J-point depression, from which arises
an abrupt takeoff of the ST segment that culmintes in
tall, hypervoluminous T waves in these 3 leads.
Surprisingly — there are no such hyperacute T waves in
the anterior leads of ECG #1. The prior (2013) ECG
suggests why this is so — as the GREEN arrows in ECG
#2 highlight preexisting J-point depression in leads
V2,V3 (and perhaps ever-so-slightly also in lead V1).
Compared to the 2013 tracing — I interpreted the ST
segment in lead V1 of ECG #1 as coved, and now slightly
elevated. I interpreted the unusually-shaped biphasic T
waves in leads V2,V3 in ECG #1 as the net result of the
deWinter T wave pattern — ST-T wave depression from
the preexisting RBBB — and the extensive evolving
anteroseptal infarction in process of “trying” to elevate
anterior lead ST segments.
Although not mentioned in the brief history we are
provided — the deep and wide Q wave in lead V1 of ECG
#2 suggests this patient had previous anteroseptal
infarction back in 2013. There now appears to be

extension of these anterior Q waves in todayʼs initial
tracing (within the dotted RED circles in ECG #1).
As per Dr. Nossen — lead aVL and lead I in ECG #1 both
manifest hyperacute T waves (“fatter”-at-their-peak and
wider-at-their-base than they should be) — with
reciprocal ST depression in each of the inferior leads
(BLUE arrows in leads II,III,aVF). These limblead
findings are typical of acute proximal LAD occlusion.
As I discuss in My Comment at the bottom of the page in
the October 26, 2020 post — the “beauty” of the
Cabreraformat is its much more logical display of limb
lead sequencing, in which there are equally spaced 30
degree intervals between each of the 6 limb leads (with
substitution of lead -aVR for lead +aVR allowing this to
happen). This is easy to appreciate in ECG #1, in which
leads -aVR and II serve as “transition leads” between the
hyperacute T waves of leads aVL and I — and the
marked reciprocal ST depression of leads aVF and III.
Finally — Note the low voltage that was already present
in the limb leads of the 2013 tracing. QRS amplitude in
the limb leads was slightly greater in todayʼs initial ECG
— but note how tiny QRS amplitude has become in
todayʼs final tracing recorded after the PCI procedure
(this final ECG shown abovein Dr. Nossenʼs discussion).
This extreme low voltage that is now evident in todayʼs
post-PCI ECG is relevant, as it almost certainly reflects
depressedLV function (“myocardial stunning”) from
this patientʼs extensive antero-lateral infarction (See the
review on Causes of Low Voltage that can be readily
accessed from the Menu on top of each page in this
Blog).
