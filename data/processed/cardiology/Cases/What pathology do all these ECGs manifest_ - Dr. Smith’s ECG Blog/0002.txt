Multiple ECGs showing the same pathology: Hyperkalemia, including a key teaching point that hyperkalemia T-waves may be small (not tall).

often with unusual morphology that may mimic ventricular rhythms. P waves may shrink or disappear → possible sinoventricular rhythm. Bradyarrhythmias and AV block are common and may behave atypically. Brugada phenocopy: hyperkalemia is described as a common cause of a Brugada-1–like pattern; it usually resolves after K correction. A regular wide rhythm without visible P waves may be VT, or may be sinus/junctional rhythm with P-wave loss from hyperkalemia. Selected ECG-specific Notes Mentioned ECG 1: HyperK recognized immediately. Example labs: K 6.3, ionized Ca 4.0 (slightly low); low Ca helps explain a long ST segment (noted as typical in dialysis context). Extra: right axis deviation + R/S > 1 in V1 → suggests RVH in addition to HyperK. ECG 3: HyperK 7.1; can mimic OMI (“pseudo-OMI”), leading to false cath activation. ECG 4: HyperK 6.3; interpreted as “normal”; patient arrested. ECG 5: HyperK 7.1; easier due to bradycardia; illustrates that even then, T waves may still not look “tall” in the usual way. Practical Recognition Clues (from the post) Look for diffuse T-wave peaking across many leads (often not limited to one territory). HyperK T waves tend to be symmetric, pointed, with a narrow base (“Eiffel Tower” appearance). T-wave peaking
