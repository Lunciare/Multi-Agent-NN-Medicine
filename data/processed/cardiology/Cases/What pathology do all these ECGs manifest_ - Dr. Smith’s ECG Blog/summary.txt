Core Diagnosis All ECGs in the post manifest hyperkalemia (HyperK). Lab potassium values referenced across examples include ~6.2–7.1 mmol/L (examples: 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1). Signature ECG Concept (Main Learning Point) The “peaked T-waves” of hyperkalemia are not always tall. They may appear as very small, sharply pointed symmetric triangles (“small triangles”). Smith: T-waves like this are essentially not seen in anything else and can be almost pathognomonic for hyperkalemia. Grauer: If you see multiple symmetrically peaked T waves (even if small) → strongly consider hyperkalemia, especially if clinically plausible.
