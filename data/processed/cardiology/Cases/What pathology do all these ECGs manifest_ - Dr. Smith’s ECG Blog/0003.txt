Multiple ECGs showing the same pathology: Hyperkalemia, including a key teaching point that hyperkalemia T-waves may be small (not tall).

for diffuse T-wave peaking across many leads (often not limited to one territory). HyperK T waves tend to be symmetric, pointed, with a narrow base (“Eiffel Tower” appearance). T-wave peaking can be negative in some leads (not always upright). Consider proportionality: even if the T waves are not tall in absolute size, they may be large relative to a tiny QRS, and still form symmetric triangles. Safety Message Failure to identify and treat significant hyperkalemia is potentially lethal. Hyperkalemia may be misread as normal or as ischemia/OMI, so diffuse symmetric triangular T waves (even small) should trigger urgent consideration of HyperK.
