Core Diagnosis All ECGs in the post manifest hyperkalemia (HyperK). Lab potassium values referenced across examples include ~6.2–7.1 mmol/L (examples: 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1). Signature ECG Concept (Main Learning Point) The “peaked T-waves” of hyperkalemia are not always tall. They may appear as very small, sharply pointed symmetric triangles (“small triangles”). Smith: T-waves like this are essentially not seen in anything else and can be almost pathognomonic for hyperkalemia. Grauer: If you see multiple symmetrically peaked T waves (even if small) → strongly consider hyperkalemia, especially if clinically plausible. Why HyperK Recognition Is Often Missed Classic teaching suggests a predictable progression (“sequence”) of ECG changes as K rises, but real patients vary; any combination may occur at many K levels. Severe hyperkalemia can present without obvious textbook findings, and may even present as cardiac arrest without classic warning patterns. HyperK can mask ischemia/infarction patterns because the ECG reflects the net effect of hyperK plus other active pathology. Subtle / Variable “ECG Identities” of Hyperkalemia (Grauer summary) QRS widening can occur, often with unusual morphology that may mimic ventricular rhythms. P waves may shrink or disappear → possible sinoventricular rhythm. Bradyarrhythmias and AV block are common and may behave atypically. Brugada
