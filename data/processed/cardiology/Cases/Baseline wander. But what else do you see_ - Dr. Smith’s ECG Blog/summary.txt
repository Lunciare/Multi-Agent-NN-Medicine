ECG #1 The quality of the ECG is not optimal due to significant baseline wander, which makes interpretation of ischemic changes more challenging. There is sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 bpm. The QRS is slightly wide (approximately 120 ms), consistent with a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. The PR interval is short, but there are no clear delta waves. Despite the baseline wander, there is appreciable concordant ST-segment elevation in lead III. There is likely very slight concordant ST elevation in lead aVF.
