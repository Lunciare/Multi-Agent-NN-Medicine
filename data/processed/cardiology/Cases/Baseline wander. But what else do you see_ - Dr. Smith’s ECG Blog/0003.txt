An ECG was obtained from a 65-year-old man with ongoing chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and tobacco use and is otherwise healthy. There was no prior ECG for comparison.

infarction with high confidence and ECG #2 as not occlusion myocardial infarction following reperfusion. Discussion Occlusion myocardial infarction findings can be subtle, especially when the QRS is wide and baseline wander is present. Approximately 33% of cases that would be called STEMI reperfuse spontaneously before emergent angiography. About 20% have TIMI-3 flow. Of all occlusion myocardial infarctions, approximately 43% present with diagnostic ST elevation, while 57% do not and are labeled NSTEMI. Many of these will have spontaneous reperfusion by the time of next-day angiography. At next-day angiography, 25% of NSTEMI have TIMI-0 flow and 34% have TIMI-0–1 flow without collateral circulation. It is not possible to know at presentation which patients will reperfuse spontaneously. Therefore, all occlusion myocardial infarctions must be treated emergently. Many subtle occlusion myocardial infarctions are not diagnosed until next-day angiography, at which point substantial myocardium is lost, resulting in higher mortality and worse left ventricular function. Recognition of subtle occlusion myocardial infarction at presentation requires expert or AI-assisted ECG interpretation. Learning Points With training, occlusion myocardial infarction can be identified despite baseline wander and a wide QRS complex. The Queen of Hearts AI model can identify these cases reliably and improve management of acute coronary
