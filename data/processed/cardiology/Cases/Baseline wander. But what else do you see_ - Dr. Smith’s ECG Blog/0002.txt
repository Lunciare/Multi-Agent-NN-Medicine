An ECG was obtained from a 65-year-old man with ongoing chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and tobacco use and is otherwise healthy. There was no prior ECG for comparison.

to the nature of the symptoms, the patient was treated for acute coronary syndrome and admitted. ECG #2 (45 minutes later, chest pain resolved) There is sinus rhythm with short PR interval and nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. The concordant ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads has resolved. There is now very slight ST elevation in V2, representing appropriate discordant ST elevation relative to the preceding predominantly negative QRS complex. The artery has reperfused. There was no comment by providers regarding the dynamic ECG changes. Clinical Outcome The patient remained chest-pain free and underwent coronary angiography the following day. Coronary angiography revealed a 99% thrombotic lesion of the proximal right coronary artery, which was stented. Due to rapid spontaneous reperfusion, high-sensitivity troponin I peaked at just under 5000 ng/L. This occlusion myocardial infarction went unrecognized and the patient was diagnosed with NSTEMI. Had spontaneous reperfusion not occurred, the patient could have suffered a very large myocardial infarction. AI Interpretation The Queen of Hearts AI model identified ECG #1 as occlusion myocardial infarction with high confidence and ECG #2 as not occlusion myocardial infarction following reperfusion. Discussion Occlusion myocardial infarction findings can be subtle, especially when the QRS is wide and baseline
