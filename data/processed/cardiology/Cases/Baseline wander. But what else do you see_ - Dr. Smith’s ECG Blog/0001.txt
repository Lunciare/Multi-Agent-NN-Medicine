An ECG was obtained from a 65-year-old man with ongoing chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and tobacco use and is otherwise healthy. There was no prior ECG for comparison.

ECG #1 The quality of the ECG is not optimal due to significant baseline wander, which makes interpretation of ischemic changes more challenging. There is sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 bpm. The QRS is slightly wide (approximately 120 ms), consistent with a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. The PR interval is short, but there are no clear delta waves. Despite the baseline wander, there is appreciable concordant ST-segment elevation in lead III. There is likely very slight concordant ST elevation in lead aVF. Leads I and aVL show reciprocal ST depression, with lead aVL showing concordant ST depression. The S-wave in lead V2 measures 17 mm, and the ST segment in lead V2 is isoelectric. With a slightly prolonged QRS and a significant S-wave, discordant ST elevation would be expected in lead V2. The presence of an isoelectric ST segment in V2 is inappropriate. Taken together, these findings are very concerning, if not diagnostic, for inferior and posterior occlusion myocardial infarction. These findings were not appreciated by providers. Due to the nature of the symptoms, the patient was treated for acute coronary syndrome and admitted. ECG #2 (45 minutes later, chest pain resolved) There is sinus rhythm with short
