myocardial infarction can be identified despite baseline wander and a wide QRS complex. The Queen of Hearts AI model can identify these cases reliably and improve management of acute coronary syndrome. Repeat ECG acquisition is advisable whenever ECG quality is poor, though sometimes clinical decisions must be made using imperfect tracings. Dynamic ST-T wave changes on serial ECGs are diagnostic of acute coronary occlusion and should be actively sought by comparing tracings side-by-side.
