breath. Interpretation of ECG #1: As per Dr. Meyers, in this woman with new chest pain, the ECG suggests acute LAD OMI until proven otherwise: * Rate ~100/min. * RBBB. * Hyperacute ST-T waves in I and aVL. * Biphasic ST-T wave in V2 (with abnormal STE given RBBB). * Marked reciprocal STD in II, III, aVF, V5, V6. But — Is there WPW? Magnified V1–V3 suggested: short PR, slurred initial QRS upstroke (delta-like). Key Point: Regardless of whether or not WPW is present, the magnitude of hyperacute ST-T wave abnormalities in multiple leads requires prompt cath. WPW can mask or mimic MI, but severe ischemic changes can still be visible despite WPW. WPW is unlikely: * Discovery first at age 60+ is rare. * QRS morphology consistent with RBBB (initial R then terminal S in left leads). * P waves in II negative, in III negative, in aVL positive → non-sinus rhythm possible → PR may not be short. * Most leads lack delta waves. * Apparent delta in V1/V3 may be baseline artifact. Bottom line: Failure to consider WPW can cause misdiagnosis, but in this case the ST-T abnormalities are clearly ischemic regardless of WPW. The correct action
