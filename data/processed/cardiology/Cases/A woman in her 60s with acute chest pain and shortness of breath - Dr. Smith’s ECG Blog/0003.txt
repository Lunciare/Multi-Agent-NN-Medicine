V1/V3 may be baseline artifact. Bottom line: Failure to consider WPW can cause misdiagnosis, but in this case the ST-T abnormalities are clearly ischemic regardless of WPW. The correct action is immediate cath. There is time later to determine WPW status by reviewing prior ECGs and history — but the decision to perform cath is time-sensitive. Providers recognized the OMI and performed emergent catheterization confirming proximal LAD occlusion, which was successfully stented.
