A woman in her 60s had acute chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS arrived and recorded this ECG (no baseline ECG available). Sinus rhythm, RBBB, and anterolateral OMI pattern with concordant STE in V2, inappropriate STD (precordial swirl pattern) in V5 and V6, hyperacute T waves in I and aVL, with reciprocal STD and negative hyperacute T waves in III and aVF. Proximal LAD OMI would be the most likely cause. This was expertly recognized, and she bypassed the ED and went straight to the cath lab, where a proximal total LAD occlusion was opened. She did well. How do we diagnose LAD OMI on the ECG in the presence of Right Bundle Branch Block? Acute coronary occlusion in a patient with prior known right bundle branch block: Another chink in the armor for the ST-elevation myocardial infarction criteria. Ann Emerg Med 2023;82(2):219–21. I reviewed the initial ECG knowing only that the patient was a woman in her 60s who contacted EMS for acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Interpretation of ECG #1: As per Dr. Meyers, in this woman with new chest pain, the ECG suggests acute LAD OMI until proven otherwise: * Rate ~100/min. * RBBB.
