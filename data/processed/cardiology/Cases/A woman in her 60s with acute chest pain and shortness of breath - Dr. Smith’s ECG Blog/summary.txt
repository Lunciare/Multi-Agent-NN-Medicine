A woman in her 60s had acute chest pain and shortness of breath. EMS arrived and recorded this ECG (no baseline ECG available). Sinus rhythm, RBBB, and anterolateral OMI pattern with concordant STE in V2, inappropriate STD (precordial swirl pattern) in V5 and V6, hyperacute T waves in I and aVL, with reciprocal STD and negative hyperacute T waves in III and aVF. Proximal LAD OMI would be the most likely cause. This was expertly recognized, and she bypassed the ED and went straight to the cath lab, where a proximal total LAD occlusion was opened. How do we diagnose LAD OMI on the ECG in the presence of Right Bundle Branch Block?
