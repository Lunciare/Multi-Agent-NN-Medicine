Repeat ECG During Amiodarone Infusion (ECG #2) The second ECG further confirmed the diagnosis: Irregularly irregular wide complex tachycardia Extremely wide QRS complexes (>160 ms) Persistent QRS polymorphism Shortest R–R interval ~170 ms (≈350 bpm) This ECG was considered diagnostic of AF with WPW. Pathophysiology Review In normal AF, the AV node limits ventricular rate due to decremental conduction In WPW, an accessory pathway (AP) bypasses the AV node AF impulses conduct rapidly over the AP, producing: Extremely short R–R intervals Very high ventricular rates Risk of R-on-T phenomenon and ventricular fibrillation Clinical Danger The shorter the R–R interval, the higher the risk of degeneration into VF. Management Considerations AV Nodal Blockers AV nodal blockers (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, adenosine, amiodarone): Reduce conduction through the AV node Force more impulses down the accessory pathway Increase VF risk Although limited data suggest IV amiodarone may be tolerated in select stable patients, it is not preferred. Preferred Acute Management Immediate sedation and synchronized cardioversion Safe Rapid Definitive Outcome The patient ultimately underwent synchronized DC cardioversion Post-cardioversion ECG showed: Sinus rhythm Short PR interval Delta waves consistent with WPW Definitive Treatment Electrophysiology study induced pre-excited AF Anterolateral left ventricular free-wall accessory pathway identified
