A young adult male presented with sudden-onset palpitations lasting approximately 3 hours. He was hemodynamically stable when the initial ECG was recorded by EMS and transmitted for expert interpretation. Vital signs were otherwise normal. Initial ECG (ECG #1) The ECG showed: Very rapid tachycardia (~200–204 bpm) Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) No clearly visible P waves Marked QRS polymorphism Subtle but real irregularity of R–R intervals In the ED, this rhythm was initially interpreted as ventricular tachycardia (VT), and theСM decision was made to treat with IV amiodarone, given the patient’s stability. Critical Re-Interpretation Closer analysis revealed key diagnostic features: The rhythm is irregularly irregular R–R intervals vary significantly, including very short intervals (~160–170 ms) QRS complexes are polymorphic, but frontal plane axis does not change Ventricular rates at times exceed 300–350 bpm These findings are pathognomonic for atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation (AF with WPW). Key Diagnostic Insight Nothing other than AF with WPW produces such short R–R intervals and extreme ventricular rates. This immediately rules out VT and polymorphic VT. Repeat ECG During Amiodarone Infusion (ECG #2) The second ECG further confirmed the diagnosis: Irregularly irregular wide complex tachycardia Extremely wide QRS complexes (>160 ms) Persistent QRS polymorphism Shortest R–R
