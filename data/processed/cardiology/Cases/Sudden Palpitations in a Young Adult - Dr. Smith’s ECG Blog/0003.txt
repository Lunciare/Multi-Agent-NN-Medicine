Case Summary

synchronized DC cardioversion Post-cardioversion ECG showed: Sinus rhythm Short PR interval Delta waves consistent with WPW Definitive Treatment Electrophysiology study induced pre-excited AF Anterolateral left ventricular free-wall accessory pathway identified Successful catheter ablation performed Follow-Up ECG Sinus rhythm Narrow QRS complexes No delta waves Key Learning Points Always assess regularity in wide complex tachycardia — use calipers if needed Irregular wide complex tachycardia with very short R–R intervals = AF with WPW Ventricular rates >220 bpm strongly suggest pre-excitation Do NOT reflexively treat WCT as VT Avoid AV nodal blockers in AF with WPW Synchronized cardioversion is the safest acute treatment Catheter ablation is definitive therapy Bottom Line This case illustrates how AF with WPW can masquerade as VT, even to experienced clinicians. Recognition hinges on detecting irregularity and extremely short R–R intervals. Rapid, correct diagnosis is critical, as inappropriate treatment can precipitate ventricular fibrillation, while appropriate management is highly effective and curative.
