An elderly woman presented with one day of chest and right arm pain, as well as abdominal pain. There was associated tingling and numbness in the right hand and generalized weakness, worse on the right side.

ramus intermedius is an occasional artery between the circumflex and the LAD and often takes the place of a large first diagonal, with the same myocardial distribution. The vessel was opened and stented. Biomarkers Serial troponins were markedly elevated. Echocardiography Left ventricular size was normal with hyperdynamic systolic function and an estimated ejection fraction of 77%. There was a regional wall motion abnormality with mid-anterior akinesis. Compared to transthoracic echocardiography from 7/3/24, the anterior regional wall motion abnormality was new and consistent with ischemia or infarction in the LAD territory. ECG Artifact Analysis Marked artifact in the initial ECG made limb lead assessment difficult, with lead III being the only undistorted lead. Artifact maximal in leads I and II with lead III spared indicates the right arm electrode as the source. In the repeat ECG, artifact was primarily baseline distortion and localized to the left arm electrode. Rhythm Findings on Repeat ECG The rhythm is ventricular bigeminy, with every other beat being a premature ventricular complex. Underlying sinus P waves continue throughout the tracing, confirming PVCs rather than aberrantly conducted PACs. In this case, the PVCs provided more incriminating evidence of acute ischemia than sinus-conducted beats. Learning Points Single-lead clarity
