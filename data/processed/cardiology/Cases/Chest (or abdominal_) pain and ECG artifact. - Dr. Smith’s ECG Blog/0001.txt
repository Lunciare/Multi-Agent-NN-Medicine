An elderly woman presented with one day of chest and right arm pain, as well as abdominal pain. There was associated tingling and numbness in the right hand and generalized weakness, worse on the right side.

Initial ECG There is widespread artifact, except in lead III. Since lead III is not artifactual, the artifact is caused by movement of the right arm electrode, and the ECG should be re-recorded. Despite artifact, there is ST depression in lead III. ST depression in lead III should raise concern for reciprocal ST elevation in aVL, suggestive of high lateral occlusion myocardial infarction. Leads aVL, I, and V2 must be scrutinized, but they are distorted by artifact. This finding is extremely easy to overlook unless there is high suspicion for occlusion myocardial infarction. Initial Clinical Course The provider recognized artifact but did not identify concerning findings and did not order a repeat ECG. Laboratory studies, including troponins, were ordered, and the patient was placed in the waiting room pending bed availability. The first troponin returned at 45,000 ng/L, indicating a large myocardial infarction that was subacute. Prior ECG A previous ECG showed baseline ST elevation in inferior leads, including lead III. At that time, there was no myocardial infarction, and this represented baseline ST elevation. This prior ECG confirms that the ST depression in lead III on the current ECG is abnormal. Repeat ECG The patient was brought to the
