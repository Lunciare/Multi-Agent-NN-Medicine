Initial ECG There is widespread artifact, except in lead III. Since lead III is not artifactual, the artifact is caused by movement of the right arm electrode, and the ECG should be re-recorded. Despite artifact, there is ST depression in lead III. ST depression in lead III should raise concern for reciprocal ST elevation in aVL, suggestive of high lateral occlusion myocardial infarction. Leads aVL, I, and V2 must be scrutinized, but they are distorted by artifact. This finding is extremely easy to overlook unless there is high suspicion for occlusion myocardial infarction.
