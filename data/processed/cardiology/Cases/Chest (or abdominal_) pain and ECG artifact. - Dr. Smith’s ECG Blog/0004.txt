An elderly woman presented with one day of chest and right arm pain, as well as abdominal pain. There was associated tingling and numbness in the right hand and generalized weakness, worse on the right side.

continue throughout the tracing, confirming PVCs rather than aberrantly conducted PACs. In this case, the PVCs provided more incriminating evidence of acute ischemia than sinus-conducted beats. Learning Points Single-lead clarity can be critical when artifact is present. ST depression in lead III should prompt scrutiny for reciprocal ST elevation in aVL. ECG artifact should always prompt immediate repeat ECG acquisition. Dynamic comparison of ECGs is essential. Premature ventricular complexes may reveal ischemic changes more clearly than sinus beats. Subacute occlusion myocardial infarction may already have extensive myocardial damage at presentation.
