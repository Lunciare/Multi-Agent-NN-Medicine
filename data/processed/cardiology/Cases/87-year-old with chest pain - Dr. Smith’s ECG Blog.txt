87-year-old with chest pain
Written by Magnus Nossen.
This prehospital ECG was obtained form an elderly male with
new onset chest pain. The pain was substernal 7/10, crushing
in nature and radiating to the neck. He had a medical history
significant for type II DM treated with insulin, DVT and
abdominal surgery. How would you assess this ECG?
Prehospital ECG (ECG #1)
Interpretation: The ECG shows sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of approximately 50 beats per minute. The QRS duration is 110
ms, and in lead I the QRS morphology, along with absent
significant R waves in V1-V2, is consistent with incomplete
left bundle branch block. There is minimal J-point elevation
noted in the anterolateral and high-lateral leads. T waves in
leads V3-V6 are notably hyperacute, with the most
pronounced T wave changes seen in lead V5. These subtle
ECG changes were not noticed or commented on by

providers.

The patient arrived in the emergency department with
ongoing chest pain unresponsive to morphine and
nitroglycerin. Initial high-sensitivity troponin I was mildly
elevated at 35 ng/L (reference <34 ng/L). A repeat troponin I,
drawn 3 hours later, showed a marked increase to 592 ng/L.
The subsequent ECG was recorded after this second troponin
result, though it is unclear if chest pain persisted at that time.

Repeat ECG done in the ED (ECG #2)
This ECG has some baseline wander, but essentially it shows
the same findings as the initial one, strongly suggesting the
patient likely remained symptomatic at the time this ECG was
recorded. There are no clear signs of reperfusion.
Despite the rising troponin levels (and probable ongoing
chest pain), the patient was not taken to the catheterization
lab — but was admitted to the hospital instead. Troponin I
levels increased to 23,076 ng/L overnight, and rose further to
35,906 ng/L in the morning. Both ECGs in this case
independently meet criteria for diagnosing occlusion
myocardial infarction (OMI). Additionally, comparison with a
previous baseline ECG, which was available for this patient,
makes the changes even more evident.
In the image below, selected leads from the prehospital ECG
are compared with baseline. The change from prior can only
be caused by ischemia.

Notice the concordant T wave in lead I, and the hyperacute T
waves in leads V5 and V6 in the prehospital ECG when
compared to baseline.
The Queen of hearts was not used in the patient management
in this case. Had this AI model been used, she would have
identified the occlusion myocardial infarction. See the below
image for the QoH interpretation with explainability map for
the initial ECG in todayʼs case.

As you can see, the AI model highlights subtle concordant ST
segment convexity in lead I — as well as hyperacute,
prominent T waves in the lateral chest leads. Additionally,
there is an inappropriately isoelectric ST segment in lead III —
where one would typically expect slight ST elevation given
the marked S wave. This is likely noticed by the AI model, but
does not meet the criteria for being reported in the
explainability map. Collectively, these features are diagnostic
for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).
How certain can you be that this ECG represents OMI?
I was sent this ECG by my colleague Dr. Vinje without clinical
information. My response was, “OMI until proven otherwise”.
Which was his impression as well. With practice — OMI
findings can be recognized. How sure can you be that this
patient is having an occluded coronary artery? I felt pretty
confident.
The Queen of Hearts AI model classified this ECG as a
STEMI-equivalent (OMI). As shown in the image below, the
model outputs a value of 0.981 for active OMI, which is very
close to the maximum score of 1.0. According to Dr. Meyers,
based on the training data — this corresponds to a specificity
of approximately 99-99,5%

Queenʼs Interpretation of ECG #1
(This model is not available to the public)
The AI model is very certain this ECG represents acute
coronary occlusion, assigning a score very close to 1.0 (the
maximal score). There are no features suggestive of
reperfusion, as reflected by the very low score in the
‘Reperfused OMIʼ category. Additionally, the score for
subendocardial ischemia (SEI) is even lower, further
supporting the diagnosis of active transmural ischemia.
Below is the QoH estimation for culprit vessel. As you can the
AI models indicates that the LAD is the most likely vessel
involved (with the RCA being the least likely culprit artery).
Discussion
This 87-year-old man was ultimately referred for coronary
angiography. During the procedure, a 100% occlusion of the
first diagonal branch (D1) was identified and successfully
stented. The rest of the voronary arteries only showed mild
atheromatosis without any significant obstructive lesions. The
angiogram took place more than 24 hours after symptom
onset. Opening a coronary artery that has been occluded fully
occluded for more than 24 hours provides little if any
prognostic benefit.
The first diagonal branch supplies the anterolateral wall of the
left ventricle. This anterolateral territory supplied by D1 lies
“between” the regions supplied by the LAD and the
circumflex artery, which is reflected in the AIʼs predicted likely
culprit — the LAD first, followed by the LCx.

Learning points
Smith: When you have a diagnostic ECG, DO NOT WAIT
FOR TROPONIN. MYOCARDIUM IS DYING!! USE THE
QUEEN OF HEARTS!
Smith: this patientʼs pretest probability (new crushing
chest pain in an 87 year old?!) is so high that you
should activate no matter what the ECG shows
A patient with rising troponin and ongoing refractory
chest pain needs to go to the cath lab as OMI will be the
most likely diagnosis.
Comparison to a baseline ECG should be done when
available.
“Subtle” ECG changes are often diagnostic. Even in the
case of minor changes as in todayʼs case, the Queen of
Hearts identified active OMI with an impressively high
specificity.
======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(7/30/2025):
Todayʼs case by Dr. Nossen is of an older man who presented
with severenew-onset CP (Chest Pain). Unfortunately — a
series of subtle-but-acute ECG abnormalities were not
recognized by health care providers on either the initial EMS
ECG — nor on the repeat ECG that was done ~3 hours later in
the ED.
I focus My Comment on a number of important ECG
findings that were overlooked on both tracings.
==================================
Why is the Initial EMS ECG Diagnostic of Acute
OMI?
KEY Point: The history in todayʼs case cannot be ignored:
The patient is an elderly man with risk factors who contacted
EMS for, “crushing substernal CP, radiating to the neck —
with a severity rating of 7/10″. This history automatically
places todayʼs patient in a higher-risk group for having an
acute cardiac event (meaning that any potentially acute ECG
findings should be accepted as indicating an acute OMI until
proven otherwise).
The rhythm in Figure-1 is sinus bradycardia — with
slightQRSwidening to 0.11 second. QRS morphology in
lead I looks like LBBB (Left Bundle Branch Block) —
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/87-year-old-with-chest-pain/ 5/13
except that the QRS complex is not wide enough to
qualify for this conduction defect (ie, Complete LBBB
should manifest a QRS duration of at least 0.12 second).
Regardless of whether todayʼs ECG qualifies as
“incomplete” LBBB — or is better referred to as a
nonspecific IVCD (IntraVentricular Conduction Defect)
— my “eye” was immediately drawn to lead aVL because
of the coved ST elevation with terminal T wave
inversion in this lead. In addition — the initial Q wave in
lead aVL is clearly too wide to be a normal septal q wave
(and if this conduction defect does represent incomplete
LBBB — then no Q wave at all should be seen in lateral
leads!).
BOTTOM Line: Even if nothing else of note was seen on
ECG #1 — in this older man with severe, crushing CP — I
already knew that this initial EMS ECG has to be
assumed to represent acute OMIuntil proven otherwise.
But there are multiple additional findings in ECG #1:
Regardless of whether the upright, widened R wave in
lead I is the result of incomplete LBBB or nonspecific
IVCD — the ST-T wave in left-sided leads with QRS
widening that resembles lbbb conduction should be
oppositely directed (ie, negative) to the upright R wave.
Instead, the upright T wave in lead I (BLUE arrow in this
lead) conveys a similar clinical significance as the coved
ST elevation in the other high-lateral lead ( = lead aVL).
That these high-lateral lead acute ST-T wave changes in
leads I and aVL are “real” — is supported by the
abnormal ST segment straightening in 2 of the inferior
leads ( = leads III and aVF).
More obvious abnormalities are seen in the chest leads.
As per Dr. Nossen — the most abnormal of the
hyperacute T waves is seen in lead V5 (RED arrow in
V5), where in addition to subtle ST elevation, the T wave
is clearly disproportionately “bulky” considering modest
amplitude of the R wave in this lead.
By the principle of neighboring leads — Blue arrows in
leads V3,V4 and V6 are all taller, “fatter-at-their-peak,
and wider-at-their-base than expected (ie, hyperacute)
given modest QRS amplitude in these leads.
KEY Point: The above described ST-T wave findings in
leads I, III and aVF are admittedly subtle. But the
abnormal coved ST elevation with terminal T wave
inversion in lead aVL — and the hyperacute T waves in
lead V5, and by extension (neighboring leads) in leads
V3,V4 and V6 in this patient with severe, new-onset
crushing CP have to be assumed indicative of acute
OMI until proven otherwise.

Figure-1: Iʼve labeled the initial EMS ECG.
==================================
What is Incomplete LBBB?
Beyond-the-Core — I have studied the concept of incomplete
LBBB for decades. Whereas incomplete RBBB is a common
and well-defined entity — incomplete LBBB is a rare,
nebulous entity for the reasons I review below in Figure-2.
The relevance of our consideration of incomplete LBBB
as the reason for QRS widening in ECG #1 — is that like
complete LBBB (in which the sequence of ventricular
depolarization is altered due to this conduction defect)
— the vector of ventricular repolarization with both
complete and incomplete LBBB should be opposite the
last QRS deflection in certain leads (which in lateral
leads like lead I — is the upright R wave). It is for this
reason that the upright T wave in lead I of ECG #1 is a
primary ST-T wave change, that in a patient with new
severe CP should be interpreted as an acute ischemic
ECG change.
P.S.: This is an advanced concept … (and since the ST-
T waves in leads aVL and V3-thru-V6 are clearly
abnormal in ECG #1 — the diagnosis of acute OMI
should be made in ECG #1 regardless of how you
interpret the ST-T wave in lead I).
Figure-2: Does incomplete LBBB exist? (Figure excerpted
from Grauer K — ECG Pocket Brain-EPub; KG/EKG Press,
2014).
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/87-year-old-with-chest-pain/ 7/13
Inappropriate Use of Morphine:
As we often emphasize in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog — Morphine
should not be given when considering the diagnosis of
acute OMI until the decision is made to perform prompt
cath. The reason for this word of caution is that analgesic
relief of symptoms with morphine may further delay the
decision to perform cardiac catheterization with needed PCI.
Unfortunately in todayʼs case — Morphine failed to
relieve this patientʼs CP (which of itself, even without
ECG changes — would be an indication for prompt cath
given this patientʼs worrisome history — not to mention
the increasing Troponin values).
==================================
What Does ECG #2 Show?
The reason I ask the question as to, What does ECG #2
show? — Is that I am uncertain from the tracing in Figure-3
what the answer to this question is.
ECG #2 (that Iʼve reproduced in Figure-3) — consists of
only 4 beats(ie, The same 4 beats are seen in all 12
leads). Awareness that only 4 beats are assessed in this
tracing is relevant — because we have to ask which of
the 4 complexes that Iʼve labeled “A”, “B”, “C” and “D”
is the real complex?
Focus on ST-T wave appearance in leads V5 and V6
(within the RED rectangle). Isnʼt the ST-T wave
appearance changing for each of the QRS complexes in
both of these leads?
For example — IF complex “B” were to represent the
“real” ST-T wave appearance in leads V5,V6 of ECG #2
— then weʼd have to interpret this as a dynamic ST
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/87-year-old-with-chest-pain/ 8/13
change compared to the ST-T waves in leads V5,V6 of
ECG #1 that did not look nearly as acute.
On the other hand — the ST-T waves in “C” and “D” of
leads V5,V6 in ECG #2 look far less acute.
Lesson-to-be-Learned: When the decision of whether
(and if so, when) to perform cardiac catheterization
hangs in the balance — if technical issues such as
artifactual distortion produce confusion as to what the
“real” ST-T wave appearance is — Repeat the ECG!
(Donʼt wait hours — as was done in this case — but
instead, simply repeat the ECG with efforts as best is
possible to minimize artifactual distortion on the repeat
tracing.
