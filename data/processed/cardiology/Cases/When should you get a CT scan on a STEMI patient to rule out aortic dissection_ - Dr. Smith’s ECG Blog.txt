When should you get a CT scan on a STEMI patient to rule out aortic dissection?
Answer: Almost never.

Central Thesis

Acute OMI (STEMI) caused by aortic dissection is very rare (~0.5%).

Any delay to reperfusion kills myocardium.

Sending a STEMI/OMI patient to CT “just to be safe” is usually more dangerous than helpful.

Key Epidemiology

Best available data: ~5 per 1000 STEMI (0.5%) are due to acute aortic dissection.

Reference cited: Zhu et al., Am J Emerg Med 2017.

This means >99% of STEMI patients do NOT have dissection.

Core Rule

If the ECG shows OMI and the patient has ongoing symptoms → treat as OMI immediately.
Do NOT delay reperfusion to rule out dissection unless there are very strong clinical features of dissection.

Case 1 — Fatal Delay Due to CT

Patient:

55-year-old woman, HTN, no CAD

Symptoms: shortness of breath, nausea, no chest/back pain

ECG: Inferior + lateral OMI, likely subacute and reperfused, but symptomatic → cath indicated

Error Chain:

ECG correctly identified as OMI

Portable CXR appeared to show wide mediastinum

Image was rotated, creating a false appearance of mediastinal widening

Physician worried about dissection → ordered CTA before thrombolytics

Patient arrested in CT scanner and died

Important Clarifications:

Rotated portable CXRs frequently fake mediastinal widening

SOB was due to heart failure from subacute MI, not dissection

Troponin and BNP confirmed subacute OMI with pulmonary congestion

Bottom line:

The patient died because of delay and location (CT scanner), not because of missed dissection.

Case 2 — True Dissection With OMI

Very elderly woman

Sudden severe chest pain radiating to the back

Differential blood pressures

ECG: large anterior OMI

Bedside ultrasound showed flap → rupture → death

Teaching Point:

Even when dissection truly exists, outcome may not be alterable

High suspicion does not automatically mean CT helps

Why CT Is Usually the Wrong Move in STEMI

Reperfusion benefit is time-critical

By 4 hours, ~80% of thrombolytic mortality benefit is gone

CT causes:

Transport away from resuscitation area

Delay in lytics / PCI

High risk location if arrest occurs

CT rarely changes management in true OMI

When CT Might Be Reasonable (Very Rare)

Only consider CT before reperfusion if multiple strong dissection features are present, such as:

Abrupt tearing chest/back pain dominates the presentation

Marked blood pressure differential

Focal neurologic deficits

Known connective tissue disease

Bedside ultrasound strongly suggestive of dissection

Even then: risk–benefit must be explicit and conscious.

Critical Learning Points

OMI from dissection is rare

Delaying reperfusion is common — and lethal

Portable CXR is unreliable for mediastinal width (rotation matters)

CT scanner is a terrible place to arrest

Emergency medicine requires decisive action, not defensive overthinking

Final Takeaway

In STEMI/OMI, default to reperfusion.
Do not let fear of a rare diagnosis delay treatment of a common, deadly one.
