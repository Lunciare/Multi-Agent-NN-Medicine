When should you get a CT
scan on a STEMI patient to
rule out aortic dissection?
Answer: Almost Never
2 cases
Case 1: This was sent to me by a reader whose partner
managed the case:
This was a 55 yo female non-smoker with a history of HTN.
No CAD. She presented with 3 hours of fluctuating cycles of
SOB that would worsen over 15 minutes then improve partly,
associated with Nausea. There was No chest or back
pain. Note: 1/3 of STEMI do not have chest pain.
Here is the presenting ECG:

This is clearly inferior and lateral OMI, though really it appears

as if it is 1) subacute, with well-formed Q-waves in inferior

and in lateral leads V3-V6, and 2) probably reperfused, with
inverted “reperfusion” T-waves in inferior leads and V3-6.
Even if the ECG suggests subacute OMI, reperfused OMI, or
both, the presence of active symptoms (whether chest pain,
SOB, or other) mandate emergent cath lab activation.
Aside: This may be a fully reperfused subacute OMI which
never had chest pain (was truly a silent MI) but over time, due
to decreased contractility or to valvular dysfunction
developed heart failure/pulmonary edema as a result of the
infarct. In other words, presence of symptoms might be due
to the consequences of infarction rather than the presence
of active coronary thrombosis.
The Queen of Hearts agrees with Reperfusion:
The physician (who is at a non-PCI hospital) recognized that
the EKG shows OMI (“STEMI subtype”). He sent it to his
consulting cardiologist at a PCI center and that cardiologist
appropriately recommended thrombolytics and transfer ASAP
for PCI.
The patient remained short of breath and systolic BP was 80
mmHg, so low dose norepinephrine was started. He decided
to order “screening CXR” prior to thrombolytics. This portable
chest X-ray was shot:

What do you think?
There is evidence of pulmonary congestion. There APPEARS
to be a wide mediastinum, but the image is ROTATED! The
trachea should be directly between the clavicular heads, but
the left clavicular head is rotated to the right and the right
clavicular head is far over to the right. This results in the
anterior part of the aortic arch being positioned far to the
right of where it should be and fools you into thinking there is
a wide mediastinum. There is no widened mediastinum.
The treating physicians thought that the mediastinum was not
normal, and therefore he worried that his acute MI was due to
aortic dissection. So he sent the patient for a chest CTA
before giving thrombolytics.
It was a difficult study with partial dye extravasation.
The patient had a cardiac arrest in the CT scanner
immediately after image acquisition. It was reported as a
nonshockable rhythm.
Interestingly the physician spoke to cardiology during 50
minutes of CPR and was told to give lytics if he achieved
ROSC, but only if CTA ruled out dissection.
–Initial troponin I = 3.12 ng/mL (confirms subacute OMI)
–NT-Pro-BNP > 30,000 pg/mL (very high, along with chest x-
ray, it confirms that pulmonary congestion is the etiology of
the SOB.
The patient was in heart failure due to subacute OMI.

CT Angiogram report: suboptimal contrast, no dissection,
ground glass lungs, cardiomegaly, distended hepatic veins
and IVC.
She was not resuscitated.
In the chart, it says that “due to aortic dissection on the
differential, TNK-tPA could not be safely administered.”
By trying to rule out aortic dissection, when this is entirely
unnecessary, the patient died in the CT scanner of her Occlusion MI.
Case 2
Case 2 has already published on this blog: A very elderly
woman with sudden severe chest pain radiating to her back
In this case, I had very high suspicion of dissection because
of back pain and differential blood pressures. There was a
large anterior OMI on the ECG. The patient was very elderly. I
realized that IF this acute anterior OMI was due to aortic
dissection, then there was nothing that could be done to save
her. So I simply assumed it was a vessel thrombosis and
treated as such. A bedside ultrasound showed what looked
like a flap, then she suddenly had dissection into the
pericardium and then free rupture into the chest, all
documented on ultrasound.
Discussion
Acute OMI as a result of acute aortic dissection is rare. The
best study is this one, in which 0.5% of acute STEMI were
due to aortic dissection. Of 1576 acute STEMI, 8 had aortic
dissection. 5 per 1000 STEMI. Rare.

Remember that ANY delay to reperfusion of Occlusiom MI
sacrifices myocardium!!

By 4 hours after chest pain onset, 80% of the mortality
benefit of thromboylitics is gone!

In this case, because the OMI was subacute, at which point
thrombolytics have much less benefit (but still some up to 12
hours), the delay is probably not what killed her.
What killed her was having a cardiac arrest far from the
resuscitation area. The CT scanner is a very bad place to
have an arrest.
Learning Point
Overthinking
The case contributor wrote that he thinks his partner was
overthinking:
“Overthinking in my experience as a medical director was
very difficult to address once a physician has finished
training. It can often become an engrained approach even, or
especially, in smart, thorough, and well-intentioned
physicians. These tend to be risk averse doctors, with a ready
rationale for their decision-making and they are often
defensive when things turn out poorly. I have tried and mostly
failed to help them overcome this. For these physicians, no
amount of thinking can be too much and the more of it they
do the better they think they are and the more cavalier the
rest of us appear to them. There are other specialties better
suited to this approach. In emergency medicine we should be
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/when-should-you-get-a-ct-scan-on-a-stemi-patient-to-rule-out-aortic-dissection/ 5/15
like Goldilocks – think just the right amount, be prepared to
quickly choose the right bed, and lie in it.”
One definition of overthinking: a negative thought pattern where
you get stuck analyzing thoughts, situations, or decisions excessively,
replaying them over and over without finding a resolution. This can
involve dwelling on past mistakes and worrying
