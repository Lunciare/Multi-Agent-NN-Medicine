When should you get a CT
scan on a STEMI patient to
rule out aortic dissection?
Answer: Almost Never
2 cases
Case 1: This was sent to me by a reader whose partner
managed the case:
This was a 55 yo female non-smoker with a history of HTN.
No CAD. She presented with 3 hours of fluctuating cycles of
SOB that would worsen over 15 minutes then improve partly,
associated with Nausea. There was No chest or back
pain. Note: 1/3 of STEMI do not have chest pain.
Here is the presenting ECG:

and in lateral leads V3-V6, and 2) probably reperfused, with
inverted “reperfusion” T-waves in inferior leads and V3-6.
Even if the ECG suggests subacute OMI, reperfused OMI, or
both, the presence of active symptoms (whether chest pain,
SOB, or other) mandate emergent cath lab activation.
Aside: This may be a fully reperfused subacute OMI which
never had chest pain (was truly a silent MI) but over time, due
to decreased contractility or to valvular dysfunction
developed heart failure/pulmonary edema as a result of the
infarct. In other words, presence of symptoms might be due
to the consequences of infarction rather than the presence
of active coronary thrombosis.
The Queen of Hearts agrees with Reperfusion:
The physician (who is at a non-PCI hospital) recognized that
the EKG shows OMI (“STEMI subtype”). He sent it to his
consulting cardiologist at a PCI center and that cardiologist
appropriately recommended thrombolytics and transfer ASAP
for PCI.
The patient remained short of breath and systolic BP was 80
mmHg, so low dose norepinephrine was started. He decided
to order “screening CXR” prior to thrombolytics. This portable
chest X-ray was shot:

What do you think?
There is evidence of pulmonary congestion. There APPEARS
to be a wide mediastinum, but the image is ROTATED! The
trachea should be directly between the clavicular heads, but
the left clavicular head is rotated to the right and the right
clavicular head is far over to the right. This results in the
anterior part of the aortic arch being positioned far to the
right of where it should be and fools you into thinking there is
a wide mediastinum. There is no widened mediastinum.
The treating physicians thought that the mediastinum was not
normal, and therefore he worried that his acute MI was due to
aortic dissection. So he sent the patient for a chest CTA
before giving thrombolytics.
It was a difficult study with partial dye extravasation.
The patient had a cardiac arrest in the CT scanner
immediately after image acquisition. It was reported as a
nonshockable rhythm.
Interestingly the physician spoke to cardiology during 50
minutes of CPR and was told to give lytics if he achieved
ROSC, but only if CTA ruled out dissection.
–Initial troponin I = 3.12 ng/mL (confirms subacute OMI)
–NT-Pro-BNP > 30,000 pg/mL (very high, along with chest x-
ray, it confirms that pulmonary congestion is the etiology of
the SOB.
The patient was in heart failure due to subacute OMI.

CT Angiogram report: suboptimal contrast, no dissection,
ground glass lungs, cardiomegaly, distended hepatic veins
and IVC.
She was not resuscitated.
In the chart, it says that “due to aortic dissection on the
differential, TNK-tPA could not be safely administered.”
By trying to rule out aortic dissection, when this is entirely
unnecessary, the patient died in the CT scanner of her Occlusion MI.
Case 2
Case 2 has already published on this blog: A very elderly
woman with sudden severe chest pain radiating to her back
In this case, I had very high suspicion of dissection because
of back pain and differential blood pressures. There was a
large anterior OMI on the ECG. The patient was very elderly. I
realized that IF this acute anterior OMI was due to aortic
dissection, then there was nothing that could be done to save
her. So I simply assumed it was a vessel thrombosis and
treated as such. A bedside ultrasound showed what looked
like a flap, then she suddenly had dissection into the
pericardium and then free rupture into the chest, all
documented on ultrasound.
Discussion
Acute OMI as a result of acute aortic dissection is rare. The
best study is this one, in which 0.5% of acute STEMI were
due to aortic dissection. Of 1576 acute STEMI, 8 had aortic
dissection. 5 per 1000 STEMI. Rare.

By 4 hours after chest pain onset, 80% of the mortality
benefit of thromboylitics is gone!

coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction: is the
slope of the curve the shape of the future? JAMA [Internet]

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?
cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=15728169
In this case, because the OMI was subacute, at which point
thrombolytics have much less benefit (but still some up to 12
hours), the delay is probably not what killed her.
What killed her was having a cardiac arrest far from the
resuscitation area. The CT scanner is a very bad place to
have an arrest.
Learning Point
Overthinking
The case contributor wrote that he thinks his partner was
overthinking:
“Overthinking in my experience as a medical director was
very difficult to address once a physician has finished
training. It can often become an engrained approach even, or
especially, in smart, thorough, and well-intentioned
physicians. These tend to be risk averse doctors, with a ready
rationale for their decision-making and they are often
defensive when things turn out poorly. I have tried and mostly
failed to help them overcome this. For these physicians, no
amount of thinking can be too much and the more of it they
do the better they think they are and the more cavalier the
rest of us appear to them. There are other specialties better
suited to this approach. In emergency medicine we should be

like Goldilocks – think just the right amount, be prepared to
quickly choose the right bed, and lie in it.”
One definition of overthinking: a negative thought pattern where
you get stuck analyzing thoughts, situations, or decisions excessively,
replaying them over and over without finding a resolution. This can
involve dwelling on past mistakes and worrying about worst-
case scenarios.
My summary of Overthinking: “Just because you can think
of other etiologies of the patientʼs critical illness does not
mean that those etiologies are remotely likely.”
As for STEMI/OMI in due to Aortic Dissection: If you have
any worry about aortic dissection, do a bedside ultrasound
and ONLY do a CT if:
1) the clinical presentation is suggestive of aortic dissection
and the ultrasound is supportive of AD, or
2) the Ultrasound is diagnostic of AD
Screening for aortic dissection with bedside cardiac
ultrasound is quite sensitive and specific. If there are no
findings of AD on bedside ultrasound, it should be extremely
rare for a STEMI (OMI) patient to undergo a CT scan before
reperfusion therapy.
These high sensitivities and specificities are among patients
who do not already have a diagnosis of acute OMI. Among
patients for whom you already have a diagnosis of OMI for
their symptoms, the diagnostic utility of a negative test rules
out the diagnosis of AD. See Bayesian analysis below.
Table of Sono findings of AD from Nazerian et al.:
Here is a Bayesian Guide to Aortic Dissection, by my friend
Jose Nunes de Alencar.
Letʼs look at these cases using Likelihood Ratios.

1. The “Rule Out” Power
This is where the true value of bedside ultrasound lies in this
scenario.
Pre-test Probability: 0.5% (Pre-test Odds approx
0.005).
The Test: Absence of any sonographic sign.
Likelihood Ratio (-LR): 0.2.
Calculation: 0.005 x 0.2 = 0.001 (Post-test odds).
Result: The risk drops from 0.5% (1 in 200) to 0.1% (1 in
1000).The risk is now negligible, effectively ruling out
dissection for the purpose of emergency management. It
gives you the green light to skip the CT and save the
myocardium.
2. The “Rule In” Power
The Test: Presence of a direct sonographic sign (flap).
Likelihood Ratio (+LR): ~9.0.
Calculation: 0.005 x 9.0 = 0.045.
Result: The risk rises from 0.5% to 4.5%.Although a
4.5% post-test probability seems “low,” look at the
relative increase: the risk has increased nearly 10-fold.
Therefore, even with a low absolute post-test
probability, this probability would be higher enough to
pause and at least consider a CT scan.
3. The “Synergistic” Scenario (Clinical suspicion + Positive
Echo)
Here is where the “patient as an individual” concept
changes everything. If the patient presents with specific
symptoms (e.g., tearing pain, pulse deficit), they are no
longer in the 0.5% baseline group.
Pre-test Probability: Letʼs conservatively estimate it at
20% (Pre-test Odds 0.25).
The Test: ADD risk score > 1 AND direct sonographic
signs.
Likelihood Ratio (+LR): 13.9.
Calculation: 0.25 x 13.9 = 3.47 (Post-test odds).
Result: The probability rise from 20% to ~78%.
In this specific subset, the ultrasound is not just a “pause”
button; it effectively becomes diagnostic. The post-test
probability is so high that we are shifting gears entirely from
“OMI suspicion” to “Aortic Dissection management” (calling
the surgeon, controlling BP, and getting a CT to confirm and
plan the repair, not just to rule it out).

This study was performed in a group of 281 patients

Detection of any FOCUS sign (direct or indirect) of
AD had a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 76–95 %) for
the diagnosis of type A AD. Presence of ADD risk
score >0 or detection of any FOCUS sign increased
diagnostic sensitivity to 96% (95 % CI 86–99 %).
Detection of direct FOCUS signs had a specificity of
94% (95% CI 90–97 %), while combination of ADD
risk score [1 with detection of direct FOCUS signs
had a specificity of 98 % (95 % CI 96–99 %).

group (P=0.023). Misdiagnosis was 0% (0/16) in the
EP FOCUS group vs 43.8% (7/16) in the non–EP
FOCUS group (P=0.028). Mortality, adjusted for do-
not-resuscitate status, for EP FOCUS vs non–EP
FOCUS was 15.4% vs 37.5% (P=0.24). Median
rooming time to disposition was 134 (IQR, 101-195)
minutes for EP FOCUS vs 205 (IQR,
114-342) minutes for non–EP FOCUS (P= 0.27).
Conclusions:
Patients who receive EP FOCUS are diagnosed
faster and misdiagnosed less compared with
patients
who do not receive EP FOCUS

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/11/2025):
Todayʼs discussion by Dr. Smith features 2 difficult cases for
which optimal management requires more than just ECG
interpretation. It especially features the need to balance the
pros and cons of various management strategies — with the
clinical likelihood of potential risk vs potential benefit
interventions. The PEARLS put forth in Dr. Smithʼs above
discussion are worthy of repetition:
Portablechest x-rays on “sick” patients are often
suboptimal in quality. Overlooking this clinical reality in
the above rotated and underexpanded AP CxR — led
providers in Case #1 to falsely conclude there was
mediastinal widening. (It could alsomislead as to
whether or not there is heart failure/pulmonary edema).
Acute OMI as a result of acute aortic dissection is rare
( = the rare 0.5% incidence of acute aortic dissection
among a study group of 1,500+ patients with an acute
STEMI, in whom the STEMI was caused by acute aortic
dissection— citation by Zhu et al above by Dr. Smith).
The decision to look for this 0.5% of STEMI patients
whose STEMI is due to acute aortic dissection is not
benign — because the clinical reality is that doing so
will significantly delaythrombolytics/PCI in the 99.5%
of STEMI patients who do not have aortic dissection (as
per Dr. Smithʼs Figure showing 80% of mortality benefit
from thrombolytics is lost by 4 hours after CP onset).
Spending a moment to check BP symmetry in both
extremities (as done by Dr. Smith in Case #2) — is far
quicker than having to do chest CTA.
If truly concerned about possible aortic dissection —
Use bedside cardiac ultrasound to screen for this! ( =
Doing bedside U/S is far quicker than chest CTA).

Relevant to the above PEARLS are details in the initial ECG
from Case #1:
The rhythm is sinustachycardia (rate = 100/minute),
with a PAC seen in simultaneously-recorded leads
V1,2,3. Most acute MIs are not associated with
tachycardia unless “something else” is going on(ie,
heart failure, impending cardiogenic shock or other
acute medical problem).
There is evidence of an extensiveSTEMI in Figure-1(ie,
YELLOW arrows highlighting Q waves in leads II,III,aVF;

and in V4,V5,V6 — with loss of r wave from V2-to-V3
leading to a QS in lead V3).
In addition — there isstillST elevation in 6 leads (RED
dotted lines) — in association with deep T wave
inversion in 7 leads (the BLUE “Tʼs”) — which as per Dr.
Smith, together with the terminal T wave positivity in
leads I,aVL — suggest ongoing reperfusion.
The ST segment flattening in lead V2 in the absence of
at least slight upsloping ST elevation in this lead
(especially given that neighboring lead V3 shows coved
ST elevation! ) — suggests posterior OMI.
In summary — I interpreted ECG #1 as indicative of an
extensive infero-postero-lateral STEMI — most
probably subabcute (as per Dr. Smith) given the above-
noted ECG signs of ongoing reperfusion. I thought
acute(or recent)occlusion of a dominantLCx vessel
might account for this ECG picture.
Alternatively, given the impossibility of determining from
a single tracing what is “new” vs “recent” superimposed
on top of “old” — I thought it likely that this patient may
well have significant underlying multi-vessel disease
with an unpredictable collateralization pattern resulting
in anterior injury ( = the QS with coved ST elevation in
lead V3 — with Q waves and ST elevation in the
remaining chest leads).
Regardless — The patient in Case #1 has clearly
suffered an extensive recent MI — now with clear ECG
signs of ongoing reperfusion plus tachycardia
suggesting the possibility of associated heart failure, if
not impending shock. Correlating these ECG findings to
the time sequence of this patientʼs presentation — I
suspect that IF this patientʼs extensive MI had been
caused by acute aortic dissection — that fatal cardiac
arrest would have occurred long before this point in
time(therefore further reducing the already low
likelihood that the extensive STEMI in Case #1 was the
result of acute aortic dissection).

Case #1.
