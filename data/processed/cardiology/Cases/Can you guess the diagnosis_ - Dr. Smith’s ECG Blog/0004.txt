An ECG was sent without clinical context for interpretation.

syndrome. Negative T waves in leads III and V1 are rare in ACS and common in acute pulmonary embolism. Anterior T-wave inversion is a common ECG finding in massive pulmonary embolism. Normal ECGs are uncommon in massive pulmonary embolism, but smaller emboli may present with minimal ECG changes. Interpretation Without History Without clinical history, ECG findings may appear nonspecific. When history reveals progressive dyspnea over two weeks, subtle ECG findings become clinically meaningful. Subtle ECG findings consistent with pulmonary disease include: Anterior T-wave inversion T-wave inversion in lead III S1Q3T3 pattern qR pattern in lead V1 Persistent precordial S waves Low QRS voltage Subtle ST-segment straightening or elevation in aVR These findings, taken together with clinical history, are consistent with acute submassive pulmonary embolism.
