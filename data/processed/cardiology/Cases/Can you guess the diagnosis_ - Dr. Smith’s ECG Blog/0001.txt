An ECG was sent without clinical context for interpretation.

ECG #1 The ECG shows sinus rhythm at just above 90 beats per minute. The QRS is narrow. T-wave inversions are present in leads V1–V3. QRS voltage is on the low side. Lead III shows small q waves and T-wave inversion. There is T-wave inversion in V1–V3 and T-wave inversion in lead III (S1Q3T3 pattern). When the differential is acute coronary syndrome versus pulmonary embolism, the presence of T-wave inversion in lead III together with precordial T-wave inversion has an extremely high likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism. Interpretation: Not diagnostic, but right heart strain must be ruled out. Clinical Correlation The patient is a 75-year-old overweight woman with subacute shortness of breath for two weeks. On the day of presentation, her dyspnea worsened and was accompanied by lightheadedness during exertion. Pulmonary CT angiography revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli with significant right heart strain. The right ventricle was markedly enlarged compared to the left ventricle. This patient had a large pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary Embolism Classification and Risk Submassive pulmonary embolism accounts for approximately 40% of all PE cases and is associated with mortality up to 25%. Patients with submassive PE are normotensive but usually tachycardic and show signs of myocardial injury or
