An ECG was sent without clinical context for interpretation.

The right ventricle normally receives coronary blood flow throughout systole and diastole. In severe pulmonary embolism, reduced cardiac output may lead to insufficient diastolic pressure to perfuse the right ventricle, resulting in right ventricular ischemia. These hemodynamic changes may lead to syncope, shock, or cardiac arrest. Learning Points Even large pulmonary embolism may show little or no ECG abnormality. The right ventricle dilates in response to acute afterload increase. Right ventricular dilation leads to left ventricular underfilling and decreased cardiac output. The right ventricle normally receives blood supply throughout the cardiac cycle. ECG Findings in Pulmonary Embolism The ECG is not sensitive for pulmonary embolism. However, findings such as sinus tachycardia, S1Q3T3, anterior T-wave inversions, new right bundle branch block, or incomplete right bundle branch block increase likelihood. S1Q3T3 is uncommon but increases the likelihood of PE. When troponin is positive, the differential includes myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. In patients with precordial T-wave inversion, concomitant T-wave inversion in leads III and V1 strongly favors pulmonary embolism over acute coronary syndrome. Negative T waves in leads III and V1 are rare in ACS and common in acute pulmonary embolism. Anterior T-wave inversion is a common ECG finding in massive pulmonary
