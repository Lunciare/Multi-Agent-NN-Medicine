approximately 40% of all PE cases and is associated with mortality up to 25%. Patients with submassive PE are normotensive but usually tachycardic and show signs of myocardial injury or dysfunction. They demonstrate right ventricular strain on ECG or imaging and often have elevated troponin and BNP levels. On presentation, the patient was hypoxemic with elevated hs-troponin I (1348 ng/L) and NT-proBNP (4555 pg/mL). She was normotensive with a heart rate in the 90s. She was treated with a heparin infusion and later transitioned to oral anticoagulation. The distinction between submassive and massive PE is often difficult, and deciding which patients require thrombolytics or thrombectomy is challenging. Hemodynamics of Acute Pulmonary Embolism The right ventricle is thin-walled and compliant and is poorly equipped for acute increases in afterload. In sudden afterload increase, the right ventricle dilates. As right ventricular stroke volume falls, blood accumulates in the right ventricle, leading to dilation. Severe dilation interferes with left ventricular filling due to pericardial constraint, reducing left ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output. The right ventricle normally receives coronary blood flow throughout systole and diastole. In severe pulmonary embolism, reduced cardiac output may lead to insufficient diastolic pressure to perfuse the right ventricle,
