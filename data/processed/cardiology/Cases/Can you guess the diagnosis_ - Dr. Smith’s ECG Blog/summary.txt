ECG #1 The ECG shows sinus rhythm at just above 90 beats per minute. T-wave inversions are present in leads V1–V3. QRS voltage is on the low side. Lead III shows small q waves and T-wave inversion. There is T-wave inversion in V1–V3 and T-wave inversion in lead III (S1Q3T3 pattern). When the differential is acute coronary syndrome versus pulmonary embolism, the presence of T-wave inversion in lead III together with precordial T-wave inversion has an extremely high likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
