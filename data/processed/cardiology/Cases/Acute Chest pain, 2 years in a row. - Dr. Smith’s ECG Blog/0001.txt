A man in his 30s presented twice, one year apart, with acute substernal chest pain. Visit 1 History: Acute substernal chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis within 3 hours of onset. Obesity, no other cardiac risk factors. Vitals normal. ECG findings: Multiple leads with ST elevation meeting STEMI criteria, but with non-hyperacute T waves, benign ST morphology, Spodick sign, and PR depression. No signs of OMI. ST elevation in lead II greater than in III, and no reciprocal ST depression in aVL. Emergent angiogram: Normal coronary arteries. Laboratory and imaging: Serial high-sensitivity troponin I mildly elevated. ESR and CRP elevated. Echocardiogram: normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities, no pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI: no myocardial infarction or myocarditis; patchy pericardial enhancement consistent with acute pericarditis. Visit 2 History and ECG similar to visit 1. Emergent angiogram: Normal coronary arteries. Laboratory and imaging: Troponins normal. ESR and CRP elevated. Echocardiogram: moderate pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI: circumferential pericardial effusion and pericardial enhancement consistent with acute pericarditis. Outcome: Diagnosed and treated as recurrent pericarditis. Key points: This was pericarditis, not OMI. Pericarditis is much rarer than OMI, and misdiagnosing OMI as pericarditis carries greater harm than unnecessary angiography.
