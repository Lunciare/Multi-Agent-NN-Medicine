Acute chest pain in a 50-something: resolves, recurs, resolves — Does the ED ECG show “Early Repol”?

but the S-wave has disappeared compared with prior ECGs, confirming terminal QRS distortion. Marked ST elevation (~5 mm) further argues against early repolarization. Conclusion: Findings are consistent with LAD occlusion myocardial infarction, not early repolarization.
