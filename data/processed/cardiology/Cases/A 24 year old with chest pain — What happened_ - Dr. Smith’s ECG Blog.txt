A 24 year old with chest
pain — What happened?
This was written up by one of our superb EM/IM residents,
Emily Syverud.
A 24-year-old man presented to the ED early in the morning
with burning chest pain that had started suddenly the night
before while watching TV, he also reported some associated
nausea and vomiting. He played soccer earlier in the evening
w ithout any chest pain at all. A week earlier he had been sick
with a URI-type illness, this had since resolved. Here is his
initial EKG:

What do you think?
The conventional (Veritas) computer interpretation was this:
SINUS BRADYCARDIA WITH SINUS ARRHYTHMIA
ST ELEVATION CONSISTENT WITH INJURY, PERICARDITIS,

OR EARLY REPOLARIZATION
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/a-24-year-old-with-chest-pain/ 1/13
But the final interpretation was changed by the physician to
this:
SINUS BRADYCARDIA WITH SINUS ARRHYTHMIA
Nonspecifc ST changes, inferior elevation.
Emily writes this:
There is STE in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal STD in
aVL, diagnostic for OMI. This was recognized as abnormal by
the team taking care of him, but characterized as nonspecific
ST changes. His initial high-sensitivity troponin was 248
ng/L. Given his age and the preceding URI symptoms, they
were concerned about pericarditis (which brings to mind one
of Dr. Smithʼs famous quotes “you diagnose pericarditis at
your peril”). They performed a bedside cardiac ultrasound
which did not show any large wall motion abnormalities. With
some concern for ACS they loaded the him with aspirin and
decided to trend troponins and repeat an EKG.
Smith: This is ACTIVE inferior OMI!!The cath lab should be
activated immediately based on the ECG alone without
waiting for troponin!!
There is virtually never reciprocal ST depression in
pericarditis, as there is here in aVL. We showed this years ago
in this study: ST depression in lead aVL differentiates
inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction from pericarditis
However, myocarditis can mimic OMI nearly perfectly, and
can indeed have reciprocal ST depression. (Moreover, if this
is inflammation (myopericarditis), it is myocarditis (not
pericarditis) if there is an elevated troponin.)
Here is the diagnosis of the PMCardio Queen of Hearts AI
Model (she of course diagnoses OMI (STEMI equivalent =
OMI).

Case continued by Emily:
His troponin continued to rise with a 2H repeat elevated at
601. A repeat EKG was then obtained:
Screenshot
Smith: this shows reperfusion of the inferior OMI. The ST
Elevation is resolved and the T-waves have inverted. There is
also T-wave inversion in V4-6, which tells us that this is also an area of
infarct that I did not see and neither did the Queen!! If the patient is
now completely chest pain free, then there is much less
urgency for immediate cath.
The Queen knows reperfusion:
Emily Continues:
The STE in II, III, and aVF is still present, though not as
obvious as before. He now has STE in V3-V5 and new TWI in
the inferior and lateral leads. With the dynamic changes and
rising troponin, cardiology was consulted. They collected
additional history during which the patient described a
possible positional and pleuritic component to his pain.

In my experience, if a cardiologist canʼt believe that a 24 year
old had an MI, they will interpret the history to conform to that
bias. So I do not believe that the chest pain was positional
and/or pleuritic.
This, along with his young age and lack of risk factors, led
them to also conclude that myocarditis or myopericarditis was
most likely, despite noting his rising troponin, dynamic EKG
changes, and possible wall motion abnormality on a formal
TTE. They did recommend starting a heparin drip as ACS
could not be ruled out. They recommended obtaining a CT
Coronary Angiogram (CTCA) to evaluate his coronary
arteries.
_______
Smith: Myocarditis is possible with this initial EKG, however,
you cannot differentiate OMI from myocarditis using troponin
or wall motion abnormality. Myocarditis will also have a rising
troponin. It will also have a wall motion abnormality. The only
way to differentiate on a EMERGENCY basis is using
angiogram.
Moreover, you donʼt get a RAPID reperfusion pattern
(decreased pain, resolving ST Elevation, and T-wave
inversion) with myocarditis. Myocarditis is more indolent, and
resolution is not so rapid.
So how else would you make the diagnosis of myocarditis?
If there is no culprit on angiogram, it can still be MINOCA
(Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary
Arteries). The interventionalist could verify Type 1 MI (plaque
rupture) with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or IVUS.
If none is found, then myocarditis or Type 2 MI are likely. In
order to differentiate the two, one would need MRI.
Inflammatory markers are also helpful.
___________
As it was now daytime hours, the CTCA was obtained
relatively quickly and notable for severe LAD stenosis. At this
point I went to collect a history as part of the admitting team
and was concerned when he told me that his chest pain was
much better, only a 1/10 compared to the 8/10 when he had
arrived.
With his ongoing chest pain and the CTCA results, I was very
concerned about ongoing ischemia – another thing Steve
Smith has taught me is that 1/10 pain is still refractory pain
and warrants more urgent PCI! I talked with his ED team who
started a nitroglycerin drip and when that did not immediately

resolve his pain, they conferred with cardiology who agreed
to take him for an angiogram.
His angiogram showed a culprit lesion in the mid-LAD with
embolization to the wraparound LAD which explains his
inferior findings on EKG. IVUS was used to characterize the
lesion given his young age and lack of any ACS risk factors, it
was NOT characteristic of SCAD and indicated True ruptured
atherosclerotic plaque. He underwent PCI with a DES and
aspiration thrombectomy in the LAD. His lab workup did not
show any hyperlipidemia, so he is currently being evaluated
for hypercoagulability as an etiology for his atherosclerosis.
He has not had a repeat TTE since his PCI, but has not had
any clinical signs or symptoms of heart failure.
This case was an important reminder for me that OMI can
occur in any patient, even those without clear risk factors.
This manʼs young age and his red herring URI symptoms led
really excellent providers to explain away symptoms, labs,
and EKG findings that would have likely triggered more urgent
intervention in an older patient. Fortunately for this young
man, he continues to recover well.
The highest troponin measured was 7500 ng/L, but it was not
measured to peak.
Smith: I always say that the second worst thing you can be if
you have an MI is to be a young man. The worst thing is to be
a young woman.
24 yo woman with chest pain the morning after binge
drinking: Is it Pericarditis?
Screenshot
I activated the cath lab for this patient and 5 cardiologists
came to the ED and pronounced that it is “pericarditis.” They
did a cardiac ultrasound and found multiple wall motion
abnormalities. Only then did they take her to the cath lab. This
was also a wraparound LAD, but was occluded proximally: so
the anterior, inferior, and lateral walls were all at risk.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(10/15/2025):
My thoughts on seeing todayʼs initial ECG were simply, When
the ECG is concerning ==> Believe the ECG until you prove
otherwise!
While totally understandable that providers might
question the likelihood that an active, previously healthy
24-year old man with a recent URI would suddenly
present to the ED with an acute MI — his initial ECG
(that Iʼve reproduced below in Figure-1) said otherwise.
In such cases — we need to prove that the ECG is
wrong, rather than the other way around.
And, when the initial Troponin is also significantly
elevated ==> We need to determine WHY …
= = =
The Lessons-to-be-Learned from todayʼs case are cogently
highlighted by Drs. Syverud and Smith. Among them:
Acute OMI can occur in any patient, including previously
healthy young adult men.
True acute pericarditis is rare — especially when the
ECG looks much more like an acute OMI or myocarditis.
The young age of todayʼs patient, his unremarkable prior
medical history, and the increased initial Troponin
combine to statistically favor acute myocarditis over
OMI. That said, as per Dr. Smith — acute myocarditis
may mimic perfectly the clinical findings of OMI, such
that the only way to acutely distinguish between these
2 conditions is by cardiac cath.

The 2 ECGs in Todayʼs CASE:
For ease of comparison in Figure-1 — Iʼve put todayʼs 2 ECGs
together.
Todayʼs initial ECGdoes not suggest acute pericarditis
because: i) ST elevation is localized to the inferior leads
— rather than being generalized, as it should be with
acute pericarditis; — ii) The ST-T wave pattern in lead II
looks similar to that in lead III, and does not at all look
like the pattern in lead I (whereas the opposite tends to
be true with acute pericarditis); — iii) Acute pericarditis
does not produce reciprocal ST depression — whereas
this invaluable finding is convincingly present in lead
aVL; — and, iv) The ST/T wave ratio in lead V6 is normal
(ie, There is no more than minimal ST elevation in lead
V6 vs a much taller T wave in this lead). — (See My
Comment at the bottom of the page in the September 7,
2025 postfor review of the ECG findings of acute
pericarditis.)
Instead — todayʼs initial ECG strongly suggests an acute
OMI:
In a patient with newCP (Chest Pain) — my “eye” was
immediately drawn to the straightened ST segment
takeoff, in association with definite ST elevation in each
of the inferior leads (within the RED rectangles).
In addition — Q waves are present in each of the inferior
leads, with the Q in lead III being surprisingly deep
relative to modest R wave amplitude in this lead. And
while inferior lead Q waves are not necessarily an
abnormal finding — it is much less common to see such
Q waves when the frontal plane axis is relatively
horizontal, as it is in ECG #1.
Reciprocal ST depression is definitely present in lead
aVL (BLUE arrow in this lead).
Acuteposterior OMI is also suggested in ECG #1 —
because there is loss of the gentle, slight upward
concavity ST elevation that is normally seen in both
leads V2 and V3 (Note that this gently upsloping ST
elevation is present in lead V3 — whereas the ST
segment in lead V2 is flat and isoelectric!).
P.S.: The final point that Iʼll note is the suggestion of T-
QRS-D(Terminal QRSDistortion) in leads III and aVF. To
emphasize that the diagnostic significance of this
finding in the inferior leads is uncertain — however, it
does occur here in association with other convincing
findings of OMI (See My Comment in the November 14,
2019 post for more on T-QRS-D).

Figure-1: The 2 ECGs in todayʼs case.
= = =
The Repeat ECG in Todayʼs CASE:
Of note — the initial ECG in todayʼs case was apparently not
repeated until ~2 hours had passed (and then, seemingly
because of the increase in Troponin). In a patient who
presents with new, severe CP (rated 8/10 by this patient on
arrival in the ED) about whom there is uncertainty as to
whether there is an ongoing acute OMI — no more than 15-
20 minutes should pass before repeating the initial ECG.
Doing so might have expedited cardiac cath in todayʼs case.
Comparison between serial ECGs is most easily
accomplished when the 2 tracings are placed side-by-
side, as they are in Figure-1.
The persistent size of the Q wave in lead III now looks
even more like an infarction Q wave next to its small R
wave and terminal T wave inversion.
Appeciation of just how abnormal the ST segment
straightening was in each of the inferiorleads on the
initial ECG — is now readily apparent in comparison with
the deflation and change in ST-T wave shape seen in
ECG #2.
Note that S waves have now reformed in leads III and
aVF(whereas they were absent in ECG #1).
Reciprocal ST segment flattening and depression in lead
aVL has now totally resolved.

The flattened isoelectric ST segment in lead V2 is no
longer seen in the repeat ECG.
Finally(as per Drs. Syverud and Smith) — reperfusion T
waves(in association with improved but not completely
resolved CP) are now seen in multiple leads (T wave
inversion in leads III,aVF; V3,V4,V5— alongwith ST
segment flattening in leads II and V6 that are probably
in transition toward T wave inversion given their
previous appearance in ECG #1).
