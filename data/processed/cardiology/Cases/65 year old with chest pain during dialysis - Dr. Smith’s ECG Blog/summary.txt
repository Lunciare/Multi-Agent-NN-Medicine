A 65 year old with history of CABG and end stage renal disease developed sudden chest pain and diaphoresis during routine dialysis, and was given three nitro sprays and then sent to the emergency department. On arrival, heart rate was 145 and BP 75/50. There’s a wide complex tachycardia which is regular (so not AF) and without preceding P waves (so not sinus tach). There is an LBBB appearance in the precordial leads, but the limb leads have rS complexes in I/aVL rather than monophasic R waves – making it non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD). There are no obvious features of hyperkalemia. Instead, there’s fast septal depolarization in V1-3 suggesting supraventricular origin.
