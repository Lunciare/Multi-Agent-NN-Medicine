A 65 year old with history of CABG and end stage renal disease developed sudden chest pain and diaphoresis during routine dialysis, and was given three nitro sprays and then sent to the emergency department. On arrival, heart rate was 145 and BP 75/50. There’s a wide complex tachycardia which is regular (so not AF) and without preceding P waves (so not sinus tach). There is an LBBB appearance in the precordial leads, but the limb leads have rS complexes in I/aVL rather than monophasic R waves – making it non-specific intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD). There are no obvious features of hyperkalemia. Instead, there’s fast septal depolarization in V1-3 suggesting supraventricular origin. With the abnormal depolarization there’s expected discordant repolarization abnormalities producing diffuse ST depression with reciprocal STE in aVR. But there’s unexpected concordant STE in III. Bottom line: unstable non-sinus tachy-arrhythmia: cardiovert and reassess. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and systolic BP increased to the 90s, but had ongoing chest pain. Repeat ECG: Sinus rhythm with PVC, first degree AV block, and same QRS morphology as during tachy-arrhythmia – confirming it was supraventricular. There is still ongoing inappropriate concordant ST elevation III and reciprocal ST depression I/aVL, as well as
