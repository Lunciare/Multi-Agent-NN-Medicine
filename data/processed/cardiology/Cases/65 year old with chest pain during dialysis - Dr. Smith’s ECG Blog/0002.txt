65 year old with chest pain during dialysis

block, and same QRS morphology as during tachy-arrhythmia – confirming it was supraventricular. There is still ongoing inappropriate concordant ST elevation III and reciprocal ST depression I/aVL, as well as mild concordant ST depression in V2 – indicating superimposed primary ischemic changes from inferior +/- posterior OMI. Cath lab was activated. The patient was immediately taken to cath lab. There was a 95% left circumflex occlusion which was stented. First troponin I was 80 ng/L, which rose to 500, then 2,000 and then a peak of 8,000 ng/L. Follow up ECG showed resolution of the primary ischemic ST changes, and subtle infero-posterior reperfusion T wave inversion compared with baseline: Take home If a patient is unstable from a WCT and the differential is narrowed to VT vs SVT with aberrancy, then the treatment is immediate cardioversion regardless Tachy-arrhythmias can cause secondary ST/T changes due to supply/demand mismatch that can be reassessed after cardioversion Inappropriate concordant STE can identify OMI in both LBBB and IVCD First troponin is an unreliable marker of OMI in acute chest pain and can’t differentiate chronic myocardial injury and demand ischemia from Type 1 MI (ACS) OMI or NOMI
