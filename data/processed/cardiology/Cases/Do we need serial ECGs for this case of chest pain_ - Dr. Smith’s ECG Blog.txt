A 40-something patient called emergency services for approximately 30 minutes of left-sided chest pain radiating to the right arm and shoulder. Radiation to the right shoulder (and especially to both shoulders) is a high-risk symptom for acute coronary occlusion.

Initial Prehospital ECG (22:38)

The automated ECG interpretation reported “nonspecific ST-T abnormalities.”
Expert interpretation identified acute occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI).

Key findings:

Hyperacute T waves in inferior leads III and aVF

Reciprocal inverted hyperacute T wave in aVL

Subtle ST-segment flattening in V2

Pattern consistent with inferior OMI with associated posterior involvement

These findings are subtle but diagnostic in the correct clinical context.

AI Interpretation

The PMCardio Queen of Hearts model identified inferior OMI and recommended an immediate invasive strategy, though it did not explicitly identify posterior involvement.

Serial ECGs

EMS recorded multiple serial ECGs:

22:44 (6 minutes after first ECG)

22:46

22:54 (16 minutes after first ECG)

Over these recordings:

Inferior T waves became progressively more hyperacute

Reciprocal ST depression in aVL increased

Inferior ST elevation became increasingly obvious

After the fourth ECG, the cath lab was activated.

Angiographic Findings

Coronary angiography revealed a critical RCA stenosis with residual flow, which was successfully stented.

Diagnostic Insights

Acute OMI can be ECG-diagnostic while still extremely subtle, especially early in its course. Hyperacute T waves—disproportionately tall, bulky, and wide relative to QRS amplitude—may be the only early sign.

Posterior OMI can be detected indirectly:

Leads V2–V3 normally show mild ST elevation

ST flattening or depression in these leads during chest pain is abnormal

This supports the diagnosis of inferior-posterior OMI when inferior lead findings are subtle

Role of Serial ECGs

Serial ECGs are critical when:

The first ECG is equivocal or under-recognized

Dynamic ST-T changes evolve over minutes

Convincing skeptical consultants of an acute occlusive process

However, in this case, the initial ECG alone, combined with a high-risk history, was sufficient to justify immediate cath lab activation.

Learning Points

Acute OMI may be present despite “nonspecific” computer ECG interpretations

Hyperacute T waves can be diagnostic even without clear ST elevation

Reciprocal changes (especially in aVL) strongly support true ischemia

Posterior OMI is often missed unless V2–V3 are carefully assessed

Serial ECGs should always be compared side-by-side

Troponin values do not guide the decision to activate the cath lab in ECG-diagnostic OMI

Correlating ECG changes with pain severity provides insight into vessel occlusion and reperfusion
