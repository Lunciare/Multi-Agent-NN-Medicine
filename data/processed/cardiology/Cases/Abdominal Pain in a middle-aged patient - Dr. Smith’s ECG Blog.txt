Abdominal Pain in a middle-
aged patient
I was texted this case by Ankur Kalra, an interventional cardiologist
at the University of Indiana. He also did his cardiology fellowship at
my institution, Hennepin County Medical Center.
He runs the Parallax podcast, and he inteviewed me on that Podcast
this year.
He says the podcast had over 3000 downloads and “Itʼs our season 6
topper”
Here it is:
Ep 121: OMI/NOMI: A Paradigm Shift in Myocardial Infarction
Diagnosis With Dr Stephen Smith
By the way, also donʼt miss this new OMI review article

Case
Dr. Kalra texted me this ECG on a Sunday Morning:
Patient with abdominal pain. No chest pain. hs Trop I is 15,000. I
think it is OMI. Taking her to the cath lab.
My response: “This looks like a subacute (possibly spontaneously
reperufused) first diagonal. Could be LAD. But it is definitely OMI. T-
wave inverted in aVL and starting to invert in V2.”
This ECG has the “South Africa Flag Sign”
This image below illustrates the “South Africa Flag Sign” (Image is
from this previous post). It is a sign of STE or Hyperacute T-wave in
V1, I, aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in lead III.
It is a sign of first diagonal occlusion, or sometimes of LAD occlusion
proximal to the first diagonal.
Quiz post: do either or both of these patients have high lateral OMI / South African flag
sign?

I sent the ECG to the Queen of Hearts PMCardio AI Model for her
diagnosis:
His response:
“Wow! I will let you know”
The interventionalist sent this image back:

You can see the cut off of the artery near the top, just below
that tortuous vessel.
He wrote:
OMI it was. Large diagonal. Now opened.
Dr. Smith—youʼll change MI care, if you havenʼt already. Iʼm changed.
===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (1/18/2025):
===================================
It’s not often that we see a clinical entity for which it seems that the
patient “read the textbook” before the ECG was recorded. By this, I mean
that most of the time with well described entities (ie, Brugada patterns,
repolarization variants, “shark fin” ST deviations, conduction defects,
etc.) — there are a variety of possible ECG patterns that often manifest
differences in some way from the textbook description.
In contrast — Today’s initial ECG (as per Dr. Smith) is
clearly diagnostic of an acute OMI that at the stage shown in
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/abdominal-pain-in-middle-aged-patient/ 4/11
the BOTTOM tracing in Figure-1, very clearly suggests a “culprit”
artery in the 1st or 2nd Diagonal Branch of the LAD.
As per the schematic picture at the top of Figure-1 — the South
African Flag Sign is present in a patient with new CP (Chest Pain)
when there is: i) ST elevation in leads I, aVL and V2;
— ii) Reciprocal ST depression in lead III (ST depression is also
often seen to a lesser degree in neighboring inferior leads II and
aVF); — and, iii) No ST elevation in any chest leads except for
lead V2 (The principal leads with ST elevation or depression are
highlighted in GREEN in Figure-1 — following the distribution of the
S. African Flag).
The TOP ECG in Figure-1 is from the April 8, 2022 post in Dr.
Smithʼs ECG Blog — and illustrates the above noted findings
of the S. African Flag Sign (ie, ST elevation in leads I,aVL,V2
— reciprocal ST depression in lead III ).
PEARL #1: As per Dr. Smith — Sometimes acute proximal LAD
OMI will initially look like a Diagonal Branch OMI — because ST
elevation may initially be limited to lead V2, and only later be seen in
leads V1,V3,V4. A tincture of time and serial ECGs will usually
clarify the situation.
PEARL #2: The clinical significance of being aware of
a Diagonal Branch “culprit” — is that: i) Since only 1 chest lead
shows ST elevation (ie, lead V2) — this pattern will not “fit” the
definition of a STEMI, because only 1 chest lead shows ST
elevation (and the definition of an anterior STEMI requires 2
contiguous chest leads to show ST elevation); and, ii) Recognizing
the S. African Flag Sign alerts the angiographer where to look for
the “culprit” artery. We have seen cases in which a capable
angiographer initially missed the cath finding of Diagonal Branch
occlusion — BUT — seeing this ECG pattern conveyed the need
for another LOOK at the cath film, with focus on the expected area
for Diagonal Branch takeoff then revealing subtle-but-
complete occlusion in one of the Diagonals.
QUESTION:
How does today’s initial ECG differ from the TOP tracing in Figure-
1?
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/abdominal-pain-in-middle-aged-patient/ 5/11
Figure-1: The South African Flag Sign — with comparison of the
ECG from the April 8, 2022 post — with today’s initial ECG.
Comparison between the 2 ECGs in Figure-1:
Both tracings in Figure-1 are consistent with the S. African Flag sign — in
that the leads with the most prominent ST-T wave changes are leads
I,III,aVL and V2 — which correspond to the arrangement of GREEN
coloring in the horizontal “Y” of the South African Flag.
It is difficult to date the onset of the MI in today’s case because this
patient never had CP — yet the initial Troponin was markedly
elevated.
The principal difference in the interpretation of the 2 tracings
in Figure-1 — is that in addition to ST elevation in leads I,aVL,V2
with ST depression in lead III — there are now reperfusion T
waves in ECG #1 (RED arrows indicating T wave inversion in leads
I,aVL,V2 — and peaking of the terminal T wave in lead III. This
suggests that acute occlusion of the 1st Diagonal occurred some
time before this ECG was recorded — and that there has now been
some spontaneous reperfusion.
