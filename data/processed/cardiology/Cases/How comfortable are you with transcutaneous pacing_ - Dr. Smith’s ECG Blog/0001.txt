A woman in her 70s was hospitalized with undifferentiated shock after being found down. Several days into hospitalization, she had intermittent sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia, with periods of Mobitz I AV block and 2:1 AV block. Her care team initiated transcutaneous pacing (TCP).

Telemetry Findings Telemetry strips (lead V1) showed: Regular pacing spikes at ~70/min Sharp electrical artifacts following each pacing spike Native P waves and native QRS complexes continuing independently of pacing When the arterial pressure waveform was displayed alongside the ECG, it became clear that: The arterial waveform correlated only with the patient’s native QRS complexes There was no hemodynamic response to pacing spikes This indicates complete failure of capture. Key Error Identified The pacing spikes produced electrical artifact that was mistakenly interpreted as QRS complexes. In reality: The pacing output was below capture threshold The myocardium was not depolarized The patient received painful electrical shocks with no benefit Meanwhile, the patient’s native sinus bradycardia was providing adequate perfusion. When pacing was turned on: The native rhythm continued unaffected Later, the native rate exceeded the pacing rate Cardiology discontinued TCP and recommended observation only. Clinical Implication This patient did not require pacing. However: If she had required pacing, failure to recognize non-capture could have been fatal How to Confirm True Capture During Transcutaneous Pacing Electrical capture alone is insufficient. Mechanical capture must be confirmed. Reliable methods: Arterial line: Each pacing spike should produce a corresponding arterial pulse Bedside ultrasound: Visualize myocardial
