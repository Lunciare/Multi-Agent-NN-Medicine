A woman in her 70s was hospitalized with undifferentiated shock after being found down. Several days into hospitalization, she had intermittent sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia, with periods of Mobitz I AV block and 2:1 AV block. Her care team initiated transcutaneous pacing (TCP).

During Transcutaneous Pacing Electrical capture alone is insufficient. Mechanical capture must be confirmed. Reliable methods: Arterial line: Each pacing spike should produce a corresponding arterial pulse Bedside ultrasound: Visualize myocardial contraction synchronized with pacing Palpation of a pulse: Prefer femoral artery Skeletal muscle twitching can mimic pulses It is safe to touch a patient during TCP Important note: TCP can be painful even without capture Practical Troubleshooting Guidance Do not confuse pacing artifact with myocardial capture If capture is uncertain: Increase output (mA) aggressively Outputs up to 200 mA may be required Always confirm perfusion: Blood pressure Pulse oximetry waveform End-tidal CO₂ (should rise with effective pacing) ECG-Based Clues to True vs False Capture True capture: Wide QRS complex following pacing spike Broad, discordant T wave Hemodynamic response present False capture (artifact): Narrow deflection after spike No T wave No pulse or BP change Electrical artifact may persist beyond pacer “blanking” periods and masquerade as capture. Learning Points Pacing artifact ≠ myocardial capture Always confirm mechanical capture Pain does not indicate effectiveness When in doubt, increase output Failure to recognize non-capture during TCP can be lethal
