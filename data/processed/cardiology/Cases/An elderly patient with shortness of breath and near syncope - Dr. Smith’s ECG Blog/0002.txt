An elderly patient experienced a week of shortness of breath on exertion, with acute worsening including near syncope and severe fatigue. She called EMS, who recorded an ECG on the way to the hospital.

most marked for even-numbered beats in the limb leads. Prior ECG (months earlier) No electrical alternans was present. Diagnostic Findings A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion, with tamponade physiology confirmed clinically and ultrasonographically. An emergent pericardiocentesis was performed in the cath lab, with 700 cc of fluid removed, resulting in immediate improvement in hemodynamics. The effusion was felt to be related to the patient’s known cancer. The patient improved during hospitalization and returned to her previous state of health. Teaching Commentary and Interpretation This is a “must know” entity for emergency care providers. The patient is an elderly woman with a one-week history of worsening dyspnea on exertion, severe fatigue, and near syncope, who was markedly hypotensive and critically ill on ED arrival. Recognition of the cause of this patient’s acute critical illness should be suspected within one minute of seeing the patient and seeing the ECG. The alternating QRS morphology represents electrical alternans. Electrical alternans is frequently misunderstood and often overlooked. Electrical alternans is most commonly encountered in association with supraventricular tachycardias, especially AVRT and AVNRT, where it may suggest a reentry mechanism. In this case, the importance of recognizing electrical alternans relates to its association with
