An elderly patient experienced a week of shortness of breath on exertion, with acute worsening including near syncope and severe fatigue. She called EMS, who recorded an ECG on the way to the hospital.

On arrival at the Emergency Department, she appeared critically ill, with severe hypotension but was alert and oriented and able to follow commands. There is sinus rhythm at around 100 bpm. The QRS morphology alternates between two morphologies. The P waves are regular, the PR intervals are similar, and the QRS duration is similar throughout. This is electrical alternans. Initial ED ECG The long lead II rhythm strip shows a rapid sinus rhythm at ~90–95/minute, with a narrow QRS complex and alternating QRS morphology every other beat. P wave morphology and the PR interval do not change throughout the tracing, which argues against intermittent preexcitation or late-cycle premature junctional or ventricular beats. T wave morphology does not change from beat to beat, which argues against intermittent bundle branch block. Each even-numbered beat manifests decreased R wave amplitude with a prominent J-wave that is not present in odd-numbered beats. There is a pendulum-like movement from the peak of the QRS from one odd-numbered beat to the next. Low voltage is present, most marked for even-numbered beats in the limb leads. Prior ECG (months earlier) No electrical alternans was present. Diagnostic Findings A bedside echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion, with tamponade
