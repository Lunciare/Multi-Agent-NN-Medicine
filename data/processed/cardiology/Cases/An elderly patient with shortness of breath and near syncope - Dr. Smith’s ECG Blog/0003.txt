An elderly patient experienced a week of shortness of breath on exertion, with acute worsening including near syncope and severe fatigue. She called EMS, who recorded an ECG on the way to the hospital.

in association with supraventricular tachycardias, especially AVRT and AVNRT, where it may suggest a reentry mechanism. In this case, the importance of recognizing electrical alternans relates to its association with a large pericardial effusion. The sensitivity of electrical alternans for smaller pericardial effusions is poor, and even with larger effusions sensitivity is limited. The likelihood of a large pericardial effusion is increased by the presence of low voltage and pendulum-like variation in QRS amplitude. Verification of a large pericardial effusion was immediately obtained by bedside echocardiography. Concern for cardiac tamponade was raised by the patient’s severe dyspnea, near syncope, marked hypotension, and echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology. Emergent pericardiocentesis with removal of 700 cc of fluid relieved the patient’s symptoms. Malignancy is the most common non-traumatic cause of cardiac tamponade. The pendulum-like variation in QRS amplitude reflects the “swinging heart” pathophysiology seen in large pericardial effusions.
