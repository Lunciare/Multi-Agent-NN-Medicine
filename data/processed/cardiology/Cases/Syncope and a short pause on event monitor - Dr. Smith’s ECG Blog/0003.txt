Against Vagal Block No progressive sinus slowing before block No increasing PR interval No prodrome Block behavior depends on extrasystoles, not autonomic tone Evidence from Vasovagal Pacemaker Trials VPS (1999) Showed dramatic reduction in syncope with pacing Flawed due to lack of sham control VPS II (2003) Properly blinded, sham-controlled trial No benefit of pacing Demonstrated strong placebo effect Clinical Implication Vasovagal syncope ≠ indication for pacing Intrinsic paroxysmal AV block = pacing indicated Management and Outcome Patient instructed to avoid driving and operating machinery Diagnosis: Paroxysmal AV block due to intrinsic His-Purkinje disease Permanent pacemaker implantation scheduled Key Learning Points Even a single episode of intrinsic AV block with syncope warrants pacing Phase 4 (pause-dependent) AV block is: Rare Underdiagnosed Potentially fatal Recognize the difference between: Vagal AV block (usually benign) Intrinsic paroxysmal AV block (malignant) Long-term monitoring can be lifesaving Absence of frequent events does not imply low risk Bottom Line This case highlights a high-risk but easily missed cause of syncope. A single captured episode of phase 4 paroxysmal AV block is sufficient to justify permanent pacing, as failure to intervene may result in sudden and preventable death.
