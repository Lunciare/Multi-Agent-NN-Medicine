Case Summary

A middle-aged man experienced sudden syncope after a brief episode of light-headedness while standing at home. He awoke on the ground, uncertain of the duration of loss of consciousness. Initial inpatient evaluation and telemetry were unremarkable, and he was discharged with a 4-week event monitor and EP follow-up. During nearly the entire monitoring period, no significant abnormalities were recorded — except for one short rhythm strip capturing a brief pause. Event Monitor Finding The monitor captured: A single episode with 3 consecutive blocked P waves Resulting in a ventricular pause of several seconds Onset and termination of AV block triggered by ventricular extrasystoles No significant change in sinus rate before or during the block Key Question Is one short episode of AV block on a 4-week monitor enough to justify permanent pacing? Answer YES. Even a single episode of cardiac syncope, if it occurs at the wrong moment (e.g., while driving), can be fatal. The goal of pacing is prevention of catastrophic recurrence, not frequency reduction. Differential Diagnosis of AV Block with Syncope 1. Vagotonic (Vagal) AV Block Due to transient parasympathetic surges Typically associated with: Progressive sinus slowing Lengthening PR interval Prodromal symptoms (nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness) Often benign Permanent
