Block with Syncope 1. Vagotonic (Vagal) AV Block Due to transient parasympathetic surges Typically associated with: Progressive sinus slowing Lengthening PR interval Prodromal symptoms (nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness) Often benign Permanent pacing usually not indicated 2. Intrinsic Paroxysmal AV Block (Phase 4 Block) This is the mechanism in this case. Also called: Phase 4 AV block Pause-dependent AV block Bradycardia-dependent block This form is: Due to diseased His–Purkinje system Potentially lethal Indication for permanent pacemaker Mechanism: Phase 4 (Pause-Dependent) AV Block A premature ventricular or atrial beat partially depolarizes the His-Purkinje system This occurs at a vulnerable time during phase 4 diastolic depolarization The His-Purkinje system becomes refractory Subsequent sinus P waves fail to conduct AV block persists until another extrasystole resets conduction ECG Hallmarks AV block initiated by an extrasystole AV block terminated by an extrasystole Minimal or no sinus rate slowing Often associated with: Wide QRS First-degree AV block during conducted beats (though up to one-third of patients have normal baseline ECGs) Why This Is Not Vasovagal Syncope Evidence Against Vagal Block No progressive sinus slowing before block No increasing PR interval No prodrome Block behavior depends on extrasystoles, not autonomic tone Evidence from Vasovagal Pacemaker Trials VPS (1999)
