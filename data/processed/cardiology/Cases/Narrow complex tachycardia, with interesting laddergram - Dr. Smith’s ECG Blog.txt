Narrow complex
tachycardia, with interesting
 
laddergram
A woman in her late 70s presented with nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea. Her emergency department ECG is shown below:
ECG 1
What do you think?
This was interpreted as atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The
patient received metoprolol 5 mg IV and converted to sinus
rhythm.

Do we still believe the diagnosis of atrial flutter? Remember
that metoprolol has no ability to cardiovert atrial fibrillation
or flutter. It helps those patients by slowing conduction
through the AV node and preventing rapid ventricular rate, but
it does nothing for the underlying arrhythmia.
It is possible that a person could spontaneously convert after
receiving metoprolol, but it is more likely the rhythm was not
atrial flutter in the first place. Other possibilities for regular,
narrow complex tachycardia are the usual suspects —
AVNRT, AVRT, and atrial tachycardia. When you are
considering an SVT diagnosis, it is useful to compare the QRS
complexes between sinus rhythm and SVT to inspect for any
morphologic differences that could be concealing atrial
activity.
In this case, V3 is very useful to inspect side by side. Do you
see any differences?
Lead V3 side by side
One difference you might notice is the loss of R wave during
tachycardia. This may be due to differences in electrode
positioning (for example if the electrode was positioned
higher or more medial during tachycardia vs sinus). The other
difference is the terminally positive wave at the end of the
QRS.

This difference cannot be explained by lead positioning, and
the more likely explanation is that it reflects atrial activity. We
can prove it is not 2:1 activity by using marching calipers to
look for an additional P wave halfway in between those we
have identified above.
V3 with marching calipers
This finding is referred to as a “pseudo Rʼ.” It is
characteristically seen best in V1, but in this case we see it in
V3. It is strongly suggestive of typical AVNRT.
What is typical AVNRT? It is a supraventricular
tachyarrhythmia where the AV node contains a fast (regular)
pathway, and a slow pathway. Most of the time in patients
with dual AV nodes of this type, sinus beats arrive at the AV
node and enter BOTH pathways. The fast pathway wins the
race through the node, and depolarizes the ventricles via the
His-Purkinje system (HPS). The slow pathway arrives a bit
later when the HPS is refractory, and has no effect on the
ECG.
Back to the case:
The patient was started on amiodarone and therapeutic
anticoagulation, and discharged with outpatient follow up.
Several days later, she presented with dizziness. ECG showed
junctional bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s. Amiodarone
was held and she was admitted.
On review of her telemetry, her heart rate trend showed an
abrupt change. The heart rate trend line is a very powerful
tool to find interesting portions of telemetry, especially when
there are abrupt rate changes.

The rhythm at this change is shown below. Have a look and
see if you can explain it to yourself before scrolling further.
Rhythm change
Here is my interpretation with a ladder diagram. Please note
that this is just one educated guess. There are other possible
reasonable interpretations.
Explanation in words:
The first four beats are junctional escape beats which
conduct antegrade into the ventricle, and retrograde up
the fast pathway (green). They also conduct up the slow
pathway (orange), but since the fast pathway wins the
race, the atrium is refractory and there is no evidence of
slow pathway conduction on surface ECG. In the
language of EP, we call this “concealed conduction.”
All of a sudden, the atrium spits out a few beats, P
waves 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Probably a burst of ectopic atrial
tachycardia (i.e. a few consecutive PACs).
P5 conducts rapidly down the fast pathway giving
rise to a ventricular beat. It also conducts down the
slow pathway but loses the race.
P6 comes quickly, and as a result, the fast pathway
(green) is refractory, hence it conducts to the
ventricle via the slow pathway (orange) with long
PR.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/narrow-complex-tachycardia-with-interesting-laddergram/ 4/15
P7-9 conduct similarly, but with decrement each
beat. This is normal physiologic AV node behavior.
The faster that impulses arrive, the slower it
conducts.
After P9, we donʼt see any additional UPRIGHT P waves
originating from the atrium. Instead, P9 conducts VERY
slowly down the slow pathway (the PR is longer than the
RR!). By the time it finally arrives at the bottom of the AV
node and conducts to the ventricle, the fast pathway has
recovered, and this initiates re-entry.
Since the total rate is less than 100, you cannot even call this
atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Instead, this is
atrioventricular nodal reentrant arrhythmia.
This patient went for EP study, and was proven to have easily
inducible AVNRT in lab, which was successfully ablated.
Learning points:
Compare the QRS in sinus rhythm and SVT for any
subtle differences which may reflect atrial activity, in
particular the “pseudo R prime.”
The heart rate trend line on telemetry is very helpful for
learning arrhythmia mechanisms by studying onset and
termination.
Abrupt termination of a narrow complex with AV nodal
blockers strongly favors node-dependent tachycardia,
e.g. AVNRT or AVRT.

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/26/2025):
Regular readers of My Comments in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog
know that I often cite this quote by Rosenbaum — “Every
self-respecting arrhythmia has at least 3 possible
interpretations.” Todayʼs case certainly qualifies as
displaying several “self-respecting” ( =challenging)
arrhythmias — for which Iʼll offer another perspective to that
provided above by Dr. Frick in his excellent discussion..

MYThoughts on the Initial Rhythm:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/narrow-complex-tachycardia-with-interesting-laddergram/ 5/15
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced the initial ECG —
with the repeat tracing below it (recorded after 5 mg IV
Metoprolol successfully converted the rhythm to sinus).
I interpreted ECG #1 as showing a regular SVT
(SupraVentricular Tachycardia)rhythm at ~135/minute,
but without clear sign of sinus P waves. This description
should prompt the usual differential diagnosis of: i)
Sinus tachycardia (highly unlikelyin Figure-1, since the
upright deflection in the middle of the R-R interval in
lead II looks to be a T wave; It would be very unusual for
there to be such a long PR interval in sinus tachycardia
when the rate is this fast); — ii) AFlutter (which it is not
— as per the above demonstration by Dr. Frick that none
of the 12 leads demonstrate any sign of 2:1 AV
conduction); — iii) ATach (Atrial Tachycardia) — which
might be possible (albeit this would entail a very long PR
interval); — or, iv) A reentry SVT (ie, either AVNRT or
orthodromic AVRT — depending on whether the reentry
circuit was contained within the AV Node, or extended
beyond the AV Node with inclusion of an Accessory
Pathway).
I suspected the answer was iv) = a reentry SVT — with
the KEY to further distinction between AVNRT vs
orthodromic AVRT residing with whether retrograde
atrial activity might be present, and if so — the nature
of such atrial activity.
KEY Point: In general — retrograde P waves are
recognized by the presence of negative deflections in
one or more of the inferior leads (II,III,aVF) that occur
after the QRS complex. With AVNRT (in which the
reentry circuit is entirely contained within the AV Node)
— the RPʼ interval ( = distance from the QRS until the
retrograde P wave) tends to be very short, such that we
either do not see retrograde negative deflections
(because they are “concealed” within the QRS) or we
see retrograde P waves occurring at the very end of the
QRS (often distorting the S wavein lead II, III and/or
aVF).
In contrast — with orthodromic AVRT (in which the
complete path of the reentry circuit will be greater
becausethe circuit extends outside of the AV Node to
include a portion of an AP) — there tends to be a longer
RPʼ interval, in which the negative retrograde deflection
will usually be seen after the end of the QRS, within the
ST segment. Exceptions exist! — but the above
generalities with respect to the length of the RPʼ interval
often provide an insightful clue as to whether or not the
patient is likely to have a “concealed” AP that
participates in the retrograde limb of a reentry SVT
rhythm.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/narrow-complex-tachycardia-with-interesting-laddergram/ 6/15
So how do we know if the tiny deflections that we see during
a fast SVT rhythm represent retrogradeP waves?
The best way to tell — is to scrutinize the QRS complex
in the repeat ECG obtained after conversion to sinus
rhythm, to see if the deflections we were questioning
during the SVT are no longer seen. This is where the
long lead II rhythm strips at the bottom of each tracing in
Figure-1 are so helpful — because they provide us with
multiple consecutive beats that reveal what was
happening in lead II.
As suggested in the magnified insert view in lead II of
ECG #1 — I thought there was a biphasic retrograde P
wave(REDarrow highlighting a small initial pointed
upright deflection immediately after the QRS — followed
by a BLUE arrow highlighting a wider negative
deflection seen just before the T wave). To Emphasize: I
was not at all certain
