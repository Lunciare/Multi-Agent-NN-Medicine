A man in his 70s with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute chest pain that awakened him from sleep around midnight. The pain was substernal, non-radiating, and rated 7/10 in intensity. An ECG was obtained at approximately 4:00 AM.

troponin I was mildly elevated (0.049 ng/mL, reference <0.033). Clinical Deterioration At 8:10 AM, repeat troponin I was 3.788 ng/mL, indicating a substantial infarction. A repeat ECG (ECG #2) showed improvement compared to ECG #1, but remained clearly abnormal, raising concern for ongoing ischemia. Despite this: The ECG was again described as showing only ST depression Pain was documented as “2/10” and later “resolved” The distinction between partial improvement and complete resolution was not acted upon Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated: Apical akinesis LVEF approximately 45% The pattern could superficially resemble takotsubo, but ECG and clinical context were diagnostic of LAD OMI. Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization was delayed approximately 8 hours after the initial diagnostic ECG. Findings: Severe LAD vasospasm involving septal perforators and a major diagonal branch Very poor flow in the LAD No acute plaque rupture This was classified as a Type 2 MI (ischemia due to vasospasm rather than atherosclerotic plaque disruption). Intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered around 12:30 PM, resulting in resolution of vasospasm. Troponin continued to rise, reaching 6.607 ng/mL. Final Diagnosis Acute LAD occlusion myocardial infarction due to coronary vasospasm Mechanism: non-atherosclerotic (vasospastic OMI) Resulted in a supervised, in-hospital anterior wall infarction due to delayed intervention
