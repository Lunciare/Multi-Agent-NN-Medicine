A man in his 70s with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute chest pain that awakened him from sleep around midnight. The pain was substernal, non-radiating, and rated 7/10 in intensity. An ECG was obtained at approximately 4:00 AM.

reaching 6.607 ng/mL. Final Diagnosis Acute LAD occlusion myocardial infarction due to coronary vasospasm Mechanism: non-atherosclerotic (vasospastic OMI) Resulted in a supervised, in-hospital anterior wall infarction due to delayed intervention Key Clinical Insights ST depression is not a diagnosis; it is a finding that must be interpreted in pattern and context Precordial swirl and South African Flag patterns are STEMI-equivalents Symptom improvement is not sufficient to defer cath unless: Chest pain is completely resolved Ischemic ECG changes are completely resolved “Much better” or “2/10 pain” still represents refractory ischemia The initial ECG alone is sufficient to mandate cath when clearly abnormal Troponin values do not guide the initial decision to cath in suspected OMI Vasospastic and microvascular causes of MI are frequently missed without angiography Learning Points Acute coronary occlusion can present without classic STEMI criteria Coronary vasospasm often occurs at night or early morning Failure to recognize OMI patterns leads to preventable myocardial injury If a patient presents with ACS symptoms and a diagnostic ECG for OMI, they belong in the cath lab Delay based on symptom improvement or fear of false activation can result in large, avoidable infarctions
