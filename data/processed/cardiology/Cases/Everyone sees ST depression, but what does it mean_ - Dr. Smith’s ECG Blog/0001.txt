A man in his 70s with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute chest pain that awakened him from sleep around midnight. The pain was substernal, non-radiating, and rated 7/10 in intensity. An ECG was obtained at approximately 4:00 AM.

Initial ECG (ECG #1) The initial ECG was clearly abnormal, though it did not meet classic STEMI criteria. Key findings: ST depression in inferolateral leads (II, III, aVF, V4–V6) ST elevation and hyperacute T waves in V1, V2 ST elevation and hyperacute T wave in aVL Reciprocal ST depression in III Loss of normal gentle ST elevation in V3 Pattern consistent with a combination of: Precordial swirl South African Flag sign This constellation of findings is diagnostic of acute LAD occlusion, involving: Septal perforators (precordial swirl) A major diagonal branch (South African Flag pattern) This ECG represents acute occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) and warrants immediate cardiac catheterization, regardless of troponin level or symptom improvement. The Queen of Hearts AI diagnosed OMI with very high confidence (0.99). Initial Management and Misinterpretation The ECG was interpreted clinically as showing only “mild ST depression”. The patient received: Aspirin 325 mg Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Documentation stated that the patient’s pain “resolved,” but no short-interval repeat ECG was obtained to confirm electrical resolution. Initial troponin I was mildly elevated (0.049 ng/mL, reference <0.033). Clinical Deterioration At 8:10 AM, repeat troponin I was 3.788 ng/mL, indicating a substantial infarction. A repeat ECG (ECG #2) showed
