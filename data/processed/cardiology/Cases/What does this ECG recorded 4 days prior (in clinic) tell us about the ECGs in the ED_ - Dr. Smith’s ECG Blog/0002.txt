conduction delay (IVCD) ST-T changes: Subtle ischemic ST depression in V3–V6, described as concordant with deep/wide S waves (especially V3; also V4–V6) ST depression in I and aVL looked non-ischemic, consistent with LVH/IVCD repolarization abnormalities Not classic for acute OMI; more consistent with subendocardial ischemia (SEI) in this snapshot AI: Queen of Hearts: negative for OMI Smith notes a newer internal model output consistent with SEI and highlights pseudonormalization of T waves in III and aVF compared with the clinic ECG. Clinical pearl: Even if not diagnostic for occlusion on this frame, sleep-awakening chest pain carries very high pretest probability, and a single ECG can look “too normal” depending on timing. ECG 2 (Clinic, 4 days prior) — “Baseline” but Highly Informative Although recorded when the patient was reportedly without symptoms, the fact that it was obtained and a nuclear stress test was ordered suggests possible antecedent concern. Interpretive significance in the context of today’s presentation: Described as extremely suspicious (bordering on diagnostic) for reperfused inferoposterior occlusion MI Key pattern described: Terminal T-wave inversion in lead III Reciprocal “down-up” T waves in I and aVL Overly upright T waves in V1–V2 consistent with posterior reperfusion (reciprocal changes) Concept: Likely unstable
