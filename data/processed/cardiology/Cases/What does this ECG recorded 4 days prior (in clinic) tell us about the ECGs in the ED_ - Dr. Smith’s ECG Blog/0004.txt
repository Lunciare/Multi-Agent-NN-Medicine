Case Summary

that moment). Patient underwent successful PCI to RCA. TTE showed inferior wall motion abnormality with EF ~35–40%. Discharged on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, DAPT, and rosuvastatin, with close outpatient follow-up. ECG 4 (Post-PCI) Showed more reperfusion evolution: inferior biphasic T waves progressed to deep T-wave inversion, consistent with reperfusion progression. Learning Points (Condensed) Pretest probability can outweigh a “negative” ECG, especially with classic high-risk chest pain history. OMI can present with unimpressive or even near-normal ECGs, depending on timing (pseudonormalization window). Always obtain serial ECGs (ideally within 15–20 minutes when concern is high) plus serial troponins. Recognize reperfusion evolution: biphasic T waves → progressively deeper inversion overly upright anterior T waves (V2–V3) can be reciprocal posterior reperfusion T waves (“posterior Wellens-type” concept).
