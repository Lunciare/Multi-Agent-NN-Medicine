Case Summary

An 84-year-old male (HTN, HLD; never smoker) awoke at 02:30 with new, severe (8/10), pressure-like chest pain radiating across the chest and toward the epigastrium, with shortness of breath. Pain was unrelenting until arrival to the ED (~05:00). Initial vitals were hypertensive (~160/80). Symptoms improved on arrival and fully resolved after nitroglycerin + aspirin 325 mg + clopidogrel 600 mg + heparin infusion. Workup for “can’t miss” diagnoses: CXR: no acute findings CT PE: negative CT abdomen/pelvis: no acute findings Incidental findings: penetrating aortic atherosclerotic ulcer at renal level, bilateral aneurysmal common iliac arteries. Initial hs-troponin T at 06:09: 21 ng/L (within male reference threshold used in the case). Key Question of the Case What does an ECG recorded 4 days earlier in cardiology clinic tell us about the ED ECGs today? Core concept: ACS is dynamic, and symptom improvement before the first ED ECG may reflect spontaneous reperfusion, producing deceptively modest ECG findings (including pseudonormalization). ECG 1 (ED, 05:18) — Chest Pain Improving Main features: High voltage with intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) ST-T changes: Subtle ischemic ST depression in V3–V6, described as concordant with deep/wide S waves (especially V3; also V4–V6) ST depression in I and aVL looked non-ischemic,
