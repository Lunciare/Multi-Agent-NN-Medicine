An 84-year-old male (HTN, HLD; never smoker) awoke at 02:30 with new, severe (8/10), pressure-like chest pain radiating across the chest and toward the epigastrium, with shortness of breath. Pain was unrelenting until arrival to the ED (~05:00). Initial vitals were hypertensive (~160/80). Symptoms improved on arrival and fully resolved after nitroglycerin + aspirin 325 mg + clopidogrel 600 mg + heparin infusion. Workup for “can’t miss” diagnoses: CXR: no acute findings CT PE: negative CT abdomen/pelvis: no acute findings Incidental findings: penetrating aortic atherosclerotic ulcer at renal level, bilateral aneurysmal common iliac arteries. Initial hs-troponin T at 06:09: 21 ng/L (within male reference threshold used in the case).
