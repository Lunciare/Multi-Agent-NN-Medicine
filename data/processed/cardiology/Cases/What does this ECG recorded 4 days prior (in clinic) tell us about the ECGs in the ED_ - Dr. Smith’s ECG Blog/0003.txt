Case Summary

described: Terminal T-wave inversion in lead III Reciprocal “down-up” T waves in I and aVL Overly upright T waves in V1–V2 consistent with posterior reperfusion (reciprocal changes) Concept: Likely unstable lesion with recurrent occlusion and spontaneous reperfusion (“stuttering” course). ECG 3 (ED, 05:53) — After NTG + DAPT + Heparin This ECG showed dynamic reperfusion changes, and is treated as the “diagnostic moment” in the narrative: Inferior biphasic reperfusion T-wave changes Overly upright T waves in V2–V3, interpreted as reciprocal posterior reperfusion T waves Queen of Hearts identified a reperfusion pattern Interpretation: Inferoposterior pattern, suggestive of RCA culprit, now reperfusing. Troponin Trend (hsTnT) Demonstrated evolving infarction despite initial “normal” value: 09:36: 77 ng/L 14:45: 309 ng/L 17:53: 532 ng/L Next day 01:11: 647 ng/L Key lesson: initial troponin can be normal early in ACS, especially if the patient is in a transient reperfusion phase at first sampling. Angiography / Outcome Coronary angiography showed a critical RCA lesion with TIMI 3 flow (consistent with reperfusion rather than fully persistent occlusion at that moment). Patient underwent successful PCI to RCA. TTE showed inferior wall motion abnormality with EF ~35–40%. Discharged on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, DAPT, and rosuvastatin, with close outpatient follow-up.
