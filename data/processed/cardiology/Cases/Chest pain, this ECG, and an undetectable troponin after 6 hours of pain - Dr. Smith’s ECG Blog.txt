Chest pain, this ECG, and an
undetectable troponin after
6 hours of pain
These ECGs were texted to me by one of our former
ultrasound fellows, Will Smoot
A Middle-aged male presented with acute chest pain. 
This initial ECG was recorded:
Smith: there are definite hyperacute T-waves in V4-5. So this
is diagnostic of LAD Occlusion.

It sure looks like the T-waves on the top ECG are now
hyperacute compared to this prior ECG.
A repeat ECG was recorded:
Now the T-waves look bulkier and fatter. This is unequivocally
diagnostic of LAD Occlusion (OMI)

The physician activated the cath lab, which required transfer
to another hospital far away.
It is great that he did not wait for a troponin!
Shortly after, the initial troponin returned undetectable.
Now he was worried that it was a false activation. The
angiogram had not shown an unequivocal OMI. It showed an
80% LAD “stenosis” (a “stenosis” does not necessarily mean
a culprit — stenosis can be a chronic condtion) andappeared
to be an acute culprit(“unstable appearing plaque”), but he
was still skeptical that this was OMI, mostly because of the
undetectable troponin.
He called me and I assured him that an initial undetectable
troponin is not unusual in acute OMI.
He said, “Yes, but the patient had had pain for 6 hours.”
Later a 2nd troponin I returned at 4461 ng/L. No further
troponins were measured.
A post-PCI ECG was recorded:
There are residual hyperacute T-waves. The Queen sees
them:

And another 3 hours later:
Smith: This one actually looks like it could represent re-
occlusion (there are again hyperacute T-waves and new ST
Elevation in V4-6 that meets criteria!), but I have no more
information on that.
The Queen agrees:
Did the LAD Re-occlude? Not sure, but it did ultimately
reperfuse:
Shows T-wave inversion in the affected leads (reperfusion T-
waves)
Peak troponin I was 10,220 ng/L (typical of a STEMI).
Echo showed good EF of 60-65% with mild hypokinesis of
the septal wall.

1. When you have an ECG diagnostic of OMI, do NOT wait
for troponin because:
A) myocardium dies while you wait
B) It might come back negative and make you wait
even longer for the next one.
2. 6 hours of pain does NOT necessarily mean 6 hours of
infarction. There may be on and off ischemia not
resulting in infarction. Often it is only after the pain
becomes unrelenting that the patients seeks care. At that
point, the duration of ischemia may not be sufficient to
result in an elevated troponin.
3. An undetectable initial troponin only has a very high
negative predictive value in the setting of a normal or
non-diagnostic ECG. In the setting of a diagnostic ECG, it
is nearly worthless
We studied the sensitivity and NPV of undetectable
troponin (below the Limit of Detection – “LoD”) in these 2
studies:

CI, 98.9%-100%) and 98.8% (95% CI, 97.2%-100%),
respectively (Table 2). Using hs-cTnI<LoD alone, 2 of 170
patients with acute myocardial infarction were missed,
corresponding to a miss rate of 1.2% (or 2 of 444 patients
with an hs-cTnI<LoD, 0.5%).”
“In comparison with hscTnI<LoD alone, the addition of a
normal ECG (16% of patients) offered a NPV of 99.6% (95%
CI, 98.9%-100%) and sensitivity of 99.4% (95% CI,
98.3%-100%) for acute myocardial infarction. Using hs-

infarction was missed, corresponding to a miss rate of 0.6%
(or 1 of 254 patients with an hs-cTnI<LoD and a normal ECG,
0.4%).”
“In the validation cohort, 22% had hs-cTnI LoD, with an NPV
and diagnostic sensitivity for acute myocardial injury of
98.8% (97.9–99.7) and 99.3% (98.7–99.8) and an NPV for AMI
or cardiac death at 30 days of 99.1% (98.2–99.8).”
In the setting of an ECG diagnostic of OMI, that sensitivity and NPV are
far lower!

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (8/5/2025):
The question I asked more than any other during my years on
faculty was, “Will the results of the test(s) that you order
change your management?” Todayʼs case provides an
optimal example of why I so often asked this question.
The treating physician in todayʼs case questioned his
decision to activate the cath lab because the initial
Troponin came back negative. But as emphasized in Dr.
Smithʼs Learning Points — the results of the initial
Troponin in todayʼs case should not in the least alter
management.
This is because todayʼs patient presented with new CP
(Chest Pain) — and, in this context the initial ECG that
Iʼve reproduced in Figure-1 indicates the need to
activate the cath lab regardless of what the initial
Troponin value is (because up to 25% of STEMI+
infarctions fail to satisfy ‘rule-inʼ values on the initial
Troponin — Wereski et al — JAMA Cardiology, 2020).
= = =
Why is todayʼs Initial ECG Diagnostic of an Acute
OMI?
I focus my comment on todayʼs initial ECG — as well as on
how the 2nd and 3rd tracings shown above in Dr. Smithʼs
discussion solidify our impression of that 1st tracing.
In a patient with new CP (such as the middle-aged man
in todayʼs case) — my “eye” was immediately drawn to
lead V4 (within the RED rectangle in ECG #1). Given
modest size of the QRS complex in this lead — the
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/chest-pain-this-ecg-and-an-undetectable-troponin-after-6-hours-of-pain/ 6/13
--- Страница 7 ---
22/01/2026, 15:23 Chest pain, this ECG, and an undetectable troponin after 6 hours of pain - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
overly tall and “bulky” T wave in V4 (that is large
enough, with a “fat” enough peak and wide enough
base to “swallow” the diminutive R wave) is clearly
hyperacute.
In the context of knowing that lead V4 is hyperacute until
proven otherwise — neighboring leads V3 and V5 also
both manifest disproportionately large T waves (albeit
lead V3 is harder to assess given our inability to know
how deep the S wave in this lead truly is).
KEY Point: The lead V1 and V2 electrodes were almost
certainly placed too high on the chest because: i) Both
of these leads manifest a terminal rʼ (which is
uncommon in V1 and highly unusual in lead V2); — ii)
The P wave in lead V1 is all negative; — and, iii) QRS
morphology of both leads V1 and V2 resemble the QRS
appearance in lead aVR (See our page onTechnical
Misadventures fornumerous examples of leads V1,V2
misplacement).
The reason recognition of lead V1,V2 misplacementis
so relevant in todayʼs case is our finding of hyperacute
T waves for leads V3,V4,V5. Since the limb leads in
ECG #1 are non-diagnostic — correct placement of the
V1,V2 electrodes would add support to our strong
suspicion of acute LAD OMI.
BOTTOM Line: Given the history of new CP and the
hyperacute T waves in leads V3,V4,V5 — even without
the ability to assess leads V1,V2 — the need for prompt
cath is already established.

What about ECG #2?
Access to a previous ECG will not always be readily available
at the time that you need it. But it was available in todayʼs
case.
As per Dr. Smith — lead-by-leadcomparison between
ECG #1 and ECG #2(done 9 months earlier) confirms
beyond doubt the acuity of ST-T waves findings in leads
V3,V4,V5 of the initial ECG.
Also of note in ECG #2 are the following findings:
ECG #2 tells us that not only are the T waves in leads
V3,V4,V5 of ECG #1 hyperacute — but the T wave in
lead V6 of ECG #1 is also much more voluminous
(therefore also hyperacute) than it was in the prior
tracing.
The limb leads in ECG #1 were indeed non-diagnostic
(albeit there is impressive artifact distorting the ST-T
waves for the first 2 complexes in leads II and III of ECG
#2).
Note how leads V1 and V2 in the prior ECG displayed
normal upright P waves — a normal initial r wave in lead
V1, and a relatively tall R wave in lead V2 (vs Q waves in
leads V1,V2 of ECG #1) — and an upright T wave in lead
V1 of the prior tracing. This confirms my suspicion of
too high V1,V2 electrode placement in ECG #1.

What about ECG #3?
PEARL: Be sure that when you review serial ECGs — that you
do so by going lead-by-lead (as is easy to do in Figure-1, in
which Iʼve put these 3 tracings together). Failure to compare
lead-by-lead the 2 tracings you are reviewing makes it all too
easy to overlook subtle findings.
Once again — the lead V1,V2 electrodes have been
placed too high on the chest in ECG #3(Remember that
ECG #3 was still done in the ED a bit after ECG #1 —
therefore probably recorded by the same technician. In
contrast — ECG #2 was done 9 months earlier, so
clearly recorded by a different technician who correctly
placed the V1,V2 electrodes on the chest).
KEY Point: As per Dr. Smith — a number of leads in ECG
#3 look more acute than they did in ECG #1 (There is
now subtle-but-real increased ST segment covingin all
3 inferior leads in ECG #2 compared to ECG #1 — as
well as an increase in ST segment “volume” with ST
segment straightening in leads V4,V5,V6).
