An elderly woman summoned EMS for generalized weakness and multiple vague complaints. She was confused and ill-appearing. Her EMS ECG: Without other ECGs, the rhythm differential could include junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, or ventricular paced rhythm with small or filtered-out pacing spikes. Most importantly, the QRS duration is **greater than 200 msec** (computer QRSd = 218 msec). When QRS > 200 msec, even during ventricular pacing, the differential is very small: 1. Preexisting severe cardiomyopathy with baseline QRSd > 200 2. Acute hyperkalemia and/or acute sodium channel blockade No common BBB pattern or paced rhythm should cause a QRS duration > 200 msec. Hyperkalemia or sodium channel blockade should be assumed until proven otherwise. The T waves have a peaked hyperkalemic morphology in many leads. Her ED ECG: Now pacer spikes are visible, with the same QRS morphology as the first ECG, meaning the initial ECG was also paced. A prior ECG from one month ago: This showed ventricular pacing with QRS duration 186 msec—on the wider end for baseline paced rhythms. Today, something (likely hyperkalemia) has caused further QRS widening. Potassium returned at **7.4 mEq/L**. QRS duration improved after hyperkalemia treatment (follow-up ECG unavailable). She was diagnosed with
