A sick elderly patient with nonspecific symptoms

baseline paced rhythms. Today, something (likely hyperkalemia) has caused further QRS widening. Potassium returned at **7.4 mEq/L**. QRS duration improved after hyperkalemia treatment (follow-up ECG unavailable). She was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Final outcome unavailable. Key Point: When QRS duration exceeds **200 msec** and is not known to be baseline, assume **severe hyperkalemia and/or sodium channel blockade toxicity** until proven otherwise. Other cardiology-related hyperkalemia cases: * Cardiac arrest with ROSC and RBBB * Elderly patient with syncope, dyspnea, weakness, mild hyperK * “Simple paced rhythm?” — actually a paced sine wave with K = 6.8 * RBBB with K = 7.9 and QRS 194 ms * Dialysis patient with vomiting and LBBB (QRS 220 ms) * Weakness and dyspnea with sine-wave pattern (not hyperK)
