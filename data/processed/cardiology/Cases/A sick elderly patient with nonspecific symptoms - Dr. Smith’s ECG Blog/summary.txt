An elderly woman summoned EMS for generalized weakness and multiple vague complaints. She was confused and ill-appearing. Her EMS ECG: Without other ECGs, the rhythm differential could include junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, or ventricular paced rhythm with small or filtered-out pacing spikes. Most importantly, the QRS duration is **greater than 200 msec** (computer QRSd = 218 msec). When QRS > 200 msec, even during ventricular pacing, the differential is very small: 1. Preexisting severe cardiomyopathy with baseline QRSd > 200 2.
