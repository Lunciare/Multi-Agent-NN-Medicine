Initial ECG (Triage) The ECG shows pacemaker failure with inability to capture or sense, with either underlying atrial fibrillation or junctional escape rhythm. The QRS shows left ventricular hypertrophy with diffuse ST-T abnormalities, likely in part appropriate for LVH, though memory T waves are also a consideration. Interpretation: Atrial fibrillation with a very slow ventricular response. A junctional rhythm should be fairly regular. The QRS is not wide, so this is not a ventricular escape rhythm. Clinical Course The patient was found to have a fractured pacemaker lead.
