34 weeks pregnant. Heart rate of 180

| Pulse (!) 181 | Resp (!) 29 | SpO2 (!) 92% Narrow Complex, Fast (174), No P-waves, Irregularly Irregular = Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR). There is no evidence of ischemia. OB was present. A bedside ultrasound showed good ejection fraction, possibly dilated RV, no B lines. Fetal Exam showed movement and heart rate of 160. Adenosine was given. The patient became hypotensive and an arterial line was placed. Magnesium, and fluids were given. Metoprolol of unknown dose was given and HR decreased to 140. CT did not show PE. Adenosine 12 mg was repeated. Esmolol was attempted, with a drop of systolic BP to 40s. As pt was now unstable, they administered synchronized cardioversion at 200J using etomidate for sedation, with conversion to NSR. Learning Point: This irregularly irregular rhythm is atrial fibrillation, NOT PSVT. This ECG cannot be anything other than Atrial fibrillation!! Adenosine does not convert Atrial fibrillation! It is safe to electrically cardiovert in pregnancy. From a stroke perspective, in a patient who is not anticoagulated, it is VERY safe to cardiovert AF RVR if the time since onset is < 12 hours. It is even safe to cardiovert if time since onset
