The patient began feeling SOB with fast heart rate and dizziness the previous evening (approximately 12 hours prior). Since it continued, she presented to a smaller hospital, where her EKG showed possible AF RVR with rates as high as 180 bpm, then down to 140s after metoprolol. Her d-dimer was also elevated at nearly 2000, so she was transferred to a tertiary center for management of AF RVR in the setting of high risk pregnancy. On arrival, she reported no new complaints, and stated that she can still feel the baby moving, that she has not felt contractions, and she has not had any leakage of fluid. She had not sought prenatal care due to anxiety surrounding previous pregnancy ending in stillbirth.
