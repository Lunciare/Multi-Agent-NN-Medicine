A 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a benign brain tumor was awakened from sleep by chest pain and dyspnea. She reported similar but transient episodes over several months, but this time the symptoms persisted. Her primary care physician noted ST-segment depression (initial ECG not available) and referred her to the emergency department. Vital signs on arrival: BP: 159/87 mmHg SpO₂: 99% RR: 19/min Afebrile An ECG was recorded in the ED. ECG Interpretation (ECG #1) The ECG showed sinus rhythm. Key ischemic features: ST-segment depression maximal in V3–V4 Inferior ST depression Reciprocal pattern suggesting subtle ST elevation in aVL Distribution consistent with posterior and high lateral ischemia This pattern is not diffuse, but regional and anatomically coherent.
