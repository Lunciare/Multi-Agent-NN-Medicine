Case Summary

A 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a benign brain tumor was awakened from sleep by chest pain and dyspnea. She reported similar but transient episodes over several months, but this time the symptoms persisted. Her primary care physician noted ST-segment depression (initial ECG not available) and referred her to the emergency department. Vital signs on arrival: BP: 159/87 mmHg SpO₂: 99% RR: 19/min Afebrile An ECG was recorded in the ED. ECG Interpretation (ECG #1) The ECG showed sinus rhythm. Key ischemic features: ST-segment depression maximal in V3–V4 Inferior ST depression Reciprocal pattern suggesting subtle ST elevation in aVL Distribution consistent with posterior and high lateral ischemia This pattern is not diffuse, but regional and anatomically coherent. Diagnostic Reasoning This ECG pattern is strongly suggestive of Occlusion MI (OMI) rather than subendocardial ischemia (SEI): Maximal ST depression in V3–V4 is highly suspicious for posterior OMI Inferior ST depression appears reciprocal, not global Subtle high-lateral involvement (aVL) supports a circumflex (LCx) culprit Clinical presentation (persistent chest pain awakening the patient from sleep) has high pretest probability for acute coronary occlusion Smith’s interpretation: This represents a posterior and high lateral OMI, most consistent with acute circumflex artery occlusion, and
