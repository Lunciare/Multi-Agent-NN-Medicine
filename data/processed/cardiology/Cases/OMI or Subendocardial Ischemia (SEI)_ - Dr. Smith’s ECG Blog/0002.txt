Case Summary

the patient from sleep) has high pretest probability for acute coronary occlusion Smith’s interpretation: This represents a posterior and high lateral OMI, most consistent with acute circumflex artery occlusion, and should prompt emergent cath lab activation. OMI vs Subendocardial Ischemia (SEI) Key distinctions in this case: Findings supporting OMI: Regional ST depression with a clear anatomic pattern Maximal STD in V3–V4 (posterior wall) Reciprocal changes (inferior ↔ high lateral) Persistent ischemic symptoms Findings arguing against SEI: No diffuse, global ST depression No clear ST elevation in aVR dominating the pattern Symptoms are not transient or supply–demand related No obvious non-coronary trigger (e.g., sepsis, anemia, tachyarrhythmia) Key Learning Points Posterior OMI often presents as ST depression in V1–V4, not ST elevation Maximal STD in V3–V4 is posterior OMI until proven otherwise SEI typically produces diffuse ST depression, often with ST elevation in aVR Persistent chest pain + regional ischemic ECG changes = treat as OMI Do not wait for troponin when the ECG and symptoms are diagnostic Circumflex occlusions are frequently missed because they often do not meet STEMI criteria Bottom Line This ECG pattern represents posterior and high lateral Occlusion MI, most likely due to acute circumflex artery occlusion, and
