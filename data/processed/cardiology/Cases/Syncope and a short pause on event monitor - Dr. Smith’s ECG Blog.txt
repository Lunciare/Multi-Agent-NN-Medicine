Syncope and a short pause
on event monitor
Written by Willy Frick
A middle aged man was inspecting the food in his (closed) oven
when he felt a few moments of light-headedness. He subsequently
woke up on the ground, unsure how long he had been unconscious.
He presented for evaluation where inpatient workup including
monitoring on telemetry was unremarkable. He was discharged with
an event monitor and electrophysiology follow up.
The event monitor lasted for four weeks and showed almost no
abnormalities, but the following strip was recorded.
 
What do you think?
Is the finding of just 3 blocked P waves on a 4 week event monitor
enough to warrant permanent pacing?

Answer: YES. Remember that even a single episode of cardiac
syncope at the wrong time (e.g. while driving) is enough to kill.
If the block is not vagal in nature, the patient should receive a
pacemaker. Why do I make this distinction?
There was a randomized trial to determine whether pacemakers
could benefit patients with vasovagal syncope, aptly named The
North American Vasovagal Pacemaker Study (VPS). Patients with 6+
episodes of syncope and positive tilt table test were randomized 1:1
to pacemaker versus no pacemaker. What did they find?
(From VPS — Connolly et al — JACC, 1999 )
Major benefit to pacing! The relative risk of syncope was reduced by
over 85%! The number needed to treat was 2. We almost never see
benefit this profound! So…Why donʼt we pace patients with vasovagal
syncope?
Answer: There was no sham control. Half the patients in VPS knew
they had a fancy implanted computer to help the heart beat and
prevent passing out. And half the patients knew they did NOT get
such a device. Fortunately, this study was repeated with sham
control. In the repeat study (VPS II), EVERY patient had an implanted
pacemaker. Half of the pacemakers had pacing enabled, and half the
pacemakers were set to sensing only without pacing. Most
importantly, neither the patients nor the doctors knew which patients
got which treatment, maintaining appropriate blinding. What did the
authors find in VPS II?

(From VPS II — Connolly et al — JAMA, 2003 )
Answer: No significant reduction in syncope!! A stunning result. One
of many examples in medical history that remind us of the importance
of blinding in clinical trials. Why was there no benefit? Perhaps
because the bradycardia in vasovagal syncope is only one part of the
autonomic response. There is also systemic vasodilation resulting in
transient hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. This is why we do
not routinely pace patients with vasovagal syncope.
Back to the case:
Can we say any more about the cause of block here? Could it be
vagal?
This is known as “paroxysmal atrioventricular block” due to a
phenomenon called “phase 4 aberrancy.” The short explanation is
that a premature beat resets the His. The ensuing (very slight)
prolongation in cycle length prolongs the duration of spontaneous
diastolic depolarization in phase 4 of the action potential, rendering it
refractory. Phase 4 block is also referred to as “bradycardia
dependent block.” It remains refractory until another extrasystole
(escape beat, PVC, PAC, etc.) resets the His, allowing it to resume
conduction. If you wish to read more about this, check out the
references section at the bottom, especially the articles by Lee and
Pillai.

In the example above, the first PVC (boxed in red below) depolarizes
the His at an unfavorable time rendering it refractory. Then three
sinus P waves (black arrows) are blocked. Finally, a second
ventricular extrasystole (boxed in blue) resets the His, and the next
sinus P wave (orange arrow) marks the resumption of 1:1 AV
conduction.
The way to recognize this type of block is that it both
initiates and terminates with an extrasystole, and there is typically
very little change in the underlying sinus rate. By contrast, vagal
blocks are accompanied by slowing of the sinus rate.
The patient was given strict guidance not to drive, operate
machinery, etc. and was scheduled for pacemaker implantation.
Learning points:

syncope

===================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (2/4/2025):
===================================
Enlightening case by Dr. Frick — with lifesaving chance occurrence of
a single short pause over a 4-week period of monitoring, without which
the probable result would have been a preventable sudden (and
unexplained) death of the patient.
Looking Closer: The Single Short Pause …
It is indeed uncanny that an otherwise negative 4-week period of
monitoring captured such a “textbook picture” of PAVB
(Paroxysmal AtrioVentricular Block) — in which we see both the onset of
the several second ventricular pause precipitated by a slightly early
ventricular beat (labeled “X” in my Figure-1) — as well as the offset of
the pause prompted by a 2nd earlier-than-expected ventricular
beat (labeled “Y” in my Figure-1).
As per Dr. Frick — the primary cause of one or more abrupt pauses
with PAVB is a result of a diseased His-Purkinje system. That
today’s patient may be predisposed to this disorder is suggested
in Figure-1 by: i) Obvious QRS widening on this single-lead ECG
monitoring strip (suggesting some form of bundle branch block);
— and, ii) 1st-Degree AV Block of conducted beats (PR interval
~0.26 second).
Although the continuous rhythm strip in Figure-1 does not manifest
slowing of the atrial rate prior to onset of the ventricular
pause (ie, the atrial rate is fairly constant at ~66/minute in the first 2
lines of the rhythm strip) — there is a change in the atrial rate after
the return of 1:1 AV conduction (in the form of slight acceleration of
the atrial rate to ~81/minute for 6 beats — until resumption of the
slower atrial rate at the end of the 3rd line). So, perhaps a
component of vagal influence may be operative after all? (ie, 1st-
degree AV block — and some rate variability).
“Devil’s Advocate” — Beat “Y” actually looks like a fusion beat
(intermediate in morphology between sinus-conducted beats and
early ventricular beat “X” ) — which if true, would make for an
immediate “reset” of His-Purkinje conduction.

Figure-1: I’ve labeled today’s continuous rhythm strip.
Paroxysmal AtrioVentricular Block (PAVB):
As suggested by Dr. Frickʼs discussion — and described by
Bansal et al (J Arrhythmia 35:870-872, 2019) and Bosah et
al (Cureus 14[7]: e27092, 2022) — the entity known as PAVB
is a potential cause of syncope that is easily overlooked, and
which is potentially lethal (probably more often than is
commonly realized).
PAVB is characterized by the sudden, unexpected onset
of complete AV block with delayed ventricular escape —
therefore resulting in a
potentially prolonged period without any QRS on ECG.
Prior to the prolonged pause — the patient manifests 1:1
AV conduction without other evidence of AV
block (which is why onset of PAVB is typically so
unsuspected! ).
Because of its totally unexpected onset and propensity
to result in sudden death — PAVB is difficult to
document and significantly underdiagnosed.
Three mechanisms for producing PAVB have been
described: i)Vagally mediated (ie, Vagotonic Block —
as described in the January 31, 2019 post, — and in
more detail HERE —with the references listed at the
end this Blog post citing instances of transient asystole
from excessive vagal tone!); ii) Intrinsic (Phase 4 =
pause- or bradycardic-dependent) PAVB;
— and, iii) Idiopathic.
i) Vagotonic AV Block:
This form of PAVB is potentially benign when it results from a transient
profound surge of parasympathetic tone in an otherwise healthy
individual (as might occur with an episode of severe vomiting; a fit of
severe coughing; vasovagal reaction from a blood draw).

22/01/2026, 15:29 Syncope and a short pause on event monitor - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
The problem with vagotonic PAVB is localized
to within the AV Node.
There will often be a “prodome” of diaphoresis, nausea,
dizziness — with the patient aware of imminent fainting.
Characteristic ECG findings of vagotonic PAVB include
progressive sinus rate slowing — often associated with
an increasing PR interval and a narrow-QRS escape
focus — followed by recovery with progressive return to
a normal sinus rate and normal PR interval.
ii)Intrinsic PAVB:
Several names have been attached to this mechanism of
PAVB — including most commonly “Phase 4 AV
block” and/orPD-PAVB (Pause-Dependent PAVB).
PD-PAVB appears to be the primary mechanism for the
cardiac rhythm in todayʼs case (albeit potential for some
vagal contribution given variability in the atrial rate in
Figure-1). As per Dr. Frick — the underlying pathology of
PD-PAVB is severe His-Purkinje System
disease(supported by the finding of QRS widening with
conducted beats in todayʼs rhythm strip). This form of
PD-PAVB is likely to be fatal unless the patient receives
a permanentpacemaker.
As is superbly shown by Dr. Frickʼs case — the
interesting pathophysiology of PD-PAVB results from
chance occurrence of an “appropriately-timed” PAC or
PVC that partially depolarizes the diseasedHPS (His-
Purkinje System) at a specific point in the cycle that
renders the poorly-functioning HPS unable to complete
depolarization. The resultant prolonged pause in
ventricular depolarization may only resolve if another
“appropriately-timed” PAC or PVC occurs at the precise
point needed to “reset” the HPS depolarization
cycle (which presumably explains why the patient in
todayʼs case spontaneously recovered).
Of note — although QRS widening and 1st-degree AV
block is seen for conducted beats in todayʼs case — up
to 1/3 of patients with PD-PAVB do not show evidence
of conduction defects on ECG. This complicates
documentation and explains why it is so easy to miss the
diagnosis.
iii)Idiopathic PAVB:
This is the most recently described form of PAVB — in which
findings are not fully consistent with either of the other 2
forms.

22/01/2026, 15:29 Syncope and a short pause on event monitor - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
The baseline ECG before idiopathic PAVB tends to be
normal.
No “trigger” for PAVB is evident (ie, no source of
excessive vagal tone — and no precipitating PACs/PVCs
are seen).
============================
BOTTOM Line: It’s important to be aware of the various forms of PAVB —
that up until recently were all-too-often undetected, especially in patients
without evidence of conduction defect on their baseline ECG.
It is fortunate that this patient was monitored over an extended
period of time ( = 4 weeks). It is humbling for me to see how easily
the diagnosis could have been missed in today’s patient.
