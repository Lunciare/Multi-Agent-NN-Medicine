Electrophysiology: Wide
Complex Tachycardia in a
70-something
Written by Magnus Nossen
A 70-year-old man experienced sudden onset of palpitations
 
and nausea while at rest. He immediately called EMS. Upon
EMS arrival he was alert with GCS 15, denied chest pain and
could inform the paramedics that he has a history of
mechanical heart valve placement and multiple prior cardiac
surgeries. An ECG (shown below) was obtained and
transmitted to local ED which was a five-minute drive away.
On arrival in the ED, his respiratory rate was 28/min, oxygen
saturation 90%, and blood pressure 112/73 mmHg. He
appeared diaphoretic. How would you manage this patient?
ECG # 1
Standard lead lay out. Paper speed 25mm/s.
This patient is clearly hemodynamically compromised with
low oxygen saturation and diaphoresis. Best option is to

urgently electrically cardiovert.
 1/14
If possible, as in this case, a 12-lead ECG should always be
recorded prior to cardioversion in order to LATER make a
diagnosis after cardioversion.
This ECG documenting the arrhythmia has already been
obtained and can be scrutinized at a later point in time. The
patient was sedated and successfully cardioverted. After
cardioversion, the patient stabilized quickly with the repeat
ECG shown below.
ECG # 2
Standard lead layout. Paper speed 25mm/s.
Now after the patient is stabilized, there is time to have
another look at the presenting ECG and the post conversion
ECG.
Interpretation ECG #1. The initial ECG in todayʼs case shows a
WCT. The heart rate is aproximately 200 beats per minute.
QRS complexes are negative in leads III and aVF, close to
biphasic in lead II and positive in leads I and aVL. This gives
an axis toward the left shoulder, perpendicular to lead II.
Limb leads from WCT
 2/14
Limb leads during WCT. Red ovals highlighting the QRS complexes.
During the WCT, in the precordial leads there are QS-waves
in the right-sided leads (V1-V2) (indicating that it depolarizes
from right to left, and thus is initiating in the right ventricle),
and R-waves in the lateral leads (I, aVL V5-V6), with the QRS
manifesting an LBBB-like morphology. Putting the QRS axis
and morphology together — the WCT seen in ECG #1 is
consistent with ventricular tachycardia originating from the
inferior part of the right ventricle.
There are several different causes of WCT originating from
the RV. The most common cause is RVOT VT. In RVOT VT
there is an inferior axis, which we do not see in todayʼs case.
For an example of RVOT VT — have a look at this case.
Because the axis is NOT inferior, it is very unlikely that this
is RVOT VT.
Let us have another look at the ECG following cardioversion.
Below I have reproduced ECG #2. What do you see?
 3/14
Interpretation ECG #2 The first QRS is likely to be a junctional
escape beat. For the remaining ECG, there is clearly atrial
activity before each QRS. There is an RBBB conduction
pattern and borderline right axis deviation. The RBBB is not,
however, typical in appearance. In every lead there are not-
so-subtle deflections toward the end of the QRS. This
deflection is most easily appreciated in lead V2. In the figure
below, red arrows mark what I believe to be epsilon waves in
leads V1-V3, as well as in leads I, II and III.
Excerpt from ECG #2
Red arrows point to deflections that occur at the end of the QRS complex and
before the start of the ST-segemnt. These deflections are consistent with
epsilon waves. Epsilon waves appear as distortions, notches, or small “blips”
buried at the terminal portion of the QRS.
Lead V2 (50mm/s)
Lead V2 shown with a paper speed of 50mm/s makes the epsilon waves even
more apparent.
Clinical course: The patient had an uneventful hospital stay.
Echocardiography showed a chronically dilated RV Outflow
Tract, mechanical pulmonary prosthetic valve, VSD patch with
a small residual VSD, and a dilated and dysfunctional right
ventricle. The echocardiographic findings were consistent
with prior examinations. A dual-chamber ICD was implanted,
and the patient will continue to undergo regular follow-up in
accordance with established protocols for adults with
congenital heart disease (ACHD). It is likely that he has
developed ARVC phenocopy.
 4/14
Discussion: This patient was born with Tetralogy of Fallot
(ToF), a congenital heart defect composed of ventricular
septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right
ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with ToF typically undergo
staged corrective heart surgery during childhood. Over time,
due to pressure and/or volume overload — the RV might
dilate and develop fibrosis which together with surgical
scarring may lead to arrhythmic subtrates.
Some patients following corrective surgery of ToF may
develop a clinical syndrome marked by right ventricular
failure, ventricular tachycardia, and epsilon waves on the
ECG. This condition is referred to as ARVC phenocopy,
reflecting an acquired arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy that mimics the familial form seen in genetic
ARVC.
ARVC phenocopy usually appears decades after intial surgery
in ToF patients in the absence of familial gene mutations. (See
Figure 1 for a comparison between genetic ARVC and ARVC
Phenocopy).

For an extensive review on arrhythmias following ToF Surgical
repair this article is excellent. For more examples of
ventricular tachycardia seen in ARVC have a look at these
three cases:

Learning points
ARVC phenocopy is an uncommon cause of epsilon
waves and ventricular tachycardia.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(12/13/2025):
I found todayʼs case by Dr Nossen serves as a powerful
reminder to us of a series of important concepts in
emergency care. These include:
That the initial ECG in todayʼs case is almostcertain to
be VT(greater than 90-95% statistical likelihood), with
this being a conclusion we can arrive at within seconds
because: i) This patient is “older” (70 years old); — ii)
This patient has known heart disease (Thepatient
telling the paramedics he has had heart valve
replacement + multiple prior heart surgeries); — and,
iii) The amorphous QRS morphology during the
presenting regularWCTrhythm ( = Wide-Complex
Tachycardia) not resembling any known form of
conduction defect, and with “extreme”axis deviation
(all negative QRS complex in lead aVF) is strongly
predictive of VT.
The above said — todayʼs case reminds us that optimal
treatment of a fast (~200/minute in todayʼs case)
regular WCT in a patient with signs of hemodynamic
instability — is immediate cardioversion without need to
consider potential causes until after the patient has been
converted to a normal rhythm. As per Dr. Nossen — this
KEY conceptwas appreciated in todayʼs case, with
successful conversion to sinus rhythm accomplished in
timely fashion!
In addition to the history(of valvular disease and
multiple prior cardiac surgeries) — the post-conversion
ECG(which Iʼve reproduced and labeled below in
Figure-1) provides further clues to the etiology of this
patientʼs VT.

Adult emergency care providers will continue to see an
increasing number of emergency cardiac conditions in
adults with CHD (Congenital Heart Disease).
Epsilon waves do exist — and not only in patients with
ARVC (Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular
Cardiomyopathy).

Adults with “Congenital” Heart Disease
Tremendous progress has been made in recent decades in
the field of Congenital Heart Disease. Consider the following:
Today — 97% of children born with CHD will survive
until adulthood — and 70% of those alive at 18 years, will
live to age 70 (as was the case for todayʼs patient). As a
result — there are now more people over the age of 20
with CHD than under that age! BOTTOM Line: We all will
continue to see an increasing number of adults who
present for acute cardiac problems as a result of CHD
(Dellborg: Circulation 149:1397-1399, 2024 — and —
Moodie:Tex Heart Inst J: 38(6):705, 2011).
To cite the above Dellborg reference — ~60% of CHD is
mild (ASD; VSD; pulmonary stenosis) — ~30% is
moderate (coarctation of the aorta; Tetralogy of Fallot;
aortic stenosis; Ebstein anomaly) — and ~10% are
complex cases (single ventricle; pulmonary atresia;
transposition of the great arteries). A surprising increase
in survival to adulthood is now seen even with many of
the most serious complex CHD cases.
With this increased longevity of CHD patients of all
severities — comes the challenge of managing these
patients who face substantial increased risk from being
predisposed to developing heart failure, coronary
disease, endocarditis, stroke — and especially
supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (as in
todayʼs patient).

The Post-Conversion ECG:Epsilon Waves …
Epsilon waves are not common. I never saw them during my
30 years as a primary care Attending, despite interpreting all
outpatient ECGs for 35 providers, as well as many of our in-
patient ECGs (or at least — I did not recognize any Epsilon
waves that may have passed my way). Even now, in the 15+
years since I retired from academics and receive tracings that
puzzle emergency providers from all over the world — my
 7/14
experience seeing actual cases with Epsilonwaves is few
and far between.
The reason for my lack of experience seeing Epsilon
waves outside of the medical literature is twofold: i)
Epsilon waves are rare! — and, ii) Even when patients
are encountered who have Epsilon waves — they are
often (usually) not recognized because of either
technical shortcomings in the ECG recording process
that are overlooked — or the provider(s) are uncertain
