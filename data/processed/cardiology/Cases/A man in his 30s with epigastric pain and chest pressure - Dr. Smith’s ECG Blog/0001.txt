A man in his 30s presented with acute upper midline abdominal pain and nausea. He described it as radiating into his chest, like “pressure”, and “burning”. Vitals were within normal limits except bradycardia. Here is his triage ECG: What do you think? Sinus bradycardia, normal QRS. There is STE in several leads including I, aVL, and V2, with STD in II and aVF. The question is whether this is due to OMI, or not. If it were due to OMI, it would fulfill the “South African Flag” pattern. Unfortunately, presence of reciprocal depression does not ensure that STE is due to OMI. I sent this ECG with zero other information to Dr. Smith and Dr. Frick, both said it was an OMI mimic (meaning they do not think that the STE in I, aVL, V2, etc, is due to acute coronary occlusion, but rather a normal variant). I agreed, there is something about the morphology (including the J waves, but not limited to that) that doesn’t match prior OMIs in my experience, and does match prior normal variants. PM Cardio QOH says No signs of OMI. The ECG meets STEMI criteria objectively. The ED physician did not think the ECG
