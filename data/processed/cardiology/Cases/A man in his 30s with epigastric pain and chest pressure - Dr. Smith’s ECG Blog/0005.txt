A man in his 30s with epigastric pain and chest pressure

J-point with smooth, upsloping ST elevation in lead aVL. Finally, though not more than minimally depressed — the flattened ST segment in lead V6 could be complementary to the ST depression seen in lead III. Putting It All Together: I thought the initial ECG in today’s case was not “normal” for a man in his 30s. I did not think this initial tracing represented an acute OMI — because of the benign-looking appearance of J-point notching with upward sloping ST elevation in leads I, aVL. I wondered if some of the unusual QRS features in the limb leads could be the result of LA-LL reversal — so I would verify lead placement. That said — a form of limb lead reversal would not alter the 4-component rSR’s’ complex in lead V1, so the leads may be correctly placed. I’d want to know about the patient’s body habitus (as possible explanation for some of the less usual ECG features). And then, I am left with that shelf-like ST segment depression in lead aVF — that is not usually part of the picture of a repolarization variant. And this patient did present to an ED with new symptoms of a “pressure” that
