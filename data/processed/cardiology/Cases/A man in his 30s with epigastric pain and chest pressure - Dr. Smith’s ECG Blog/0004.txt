slender, but unusually deep Q wave in lead III (that is over 5 mm deep). Narrow Q waves are also seen in leads aVF and V6. Prominent J-point notching in leads I and aVL. These look a bit unusual, because we are not accustomed to seeing such deep S waves in these high-lateral leads. That said — this notching is usually a benign feature of repolarization variants, especially when associated with no more than modest ST elevation associated with an upward concavity (ie, “smiley” configuration), as seen here. From the perspective of a patient presenting to the ED with abdominal pain radiating to the chest — I found the flat (shelf-like) ST depression in lead aVF to be the most concerning feature in this tracing. J-point depression with a downsloping ST segment and biphasic T wave in lead III would have added to my concern if this ST-T wave picture in lead III was not the exact mirror-image opposite of what I perceived to be a benign picture of prominent J-point with smooth, upsloping ST elevation in lead aVL. Finally, though not more than minimally depressed — the flattened ST segment in lead V6 could be complementary to the ST
