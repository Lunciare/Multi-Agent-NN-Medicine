lead aVF — that is not usually part of the picture of a repolarization variant. And this patient did present to an ED with new symptoms of a “pressure” that radiates to the chest. Primarily for this reason — I was less than 100% certain about the diagnosis. BOTTOM LINE: I did not think ECG #1 represented an acute OMI. That said — I was less than 100% certain of that on the basis of the single initial ECG. As a result — I would: i) Repeat the ECG after verifying lead placement; ii) Rule out acute OMI with 2 serial Troponins, as was done; and iii) Get an Echo to rule out any unexpected underlying structural disease.
