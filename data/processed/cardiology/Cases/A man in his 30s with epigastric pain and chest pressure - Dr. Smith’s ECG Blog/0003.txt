send the patient home without further evaluation. For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve labeled today’s initial ECG to highlight the findings that “caught my eye”. Figure-1: I’ve labeled the initial ECG in today’s case. Today’s Initial ECG: For an otherwise presumably healthy 30-year old man — there are some unusual findings in ECG #1. These include the following: A fairly marked sinus arrhythmia with bradycardia, and almost the pattern of “group” beating in the long lead rhythm strip. P wave amplitude is reduced in virtually all leads — with comparable small size of the upright P waves in lead I as in lead II, making me question whether this truly is a sinus rhythm? — vs a low atrial rhythm? — vs the possibility of LA-LL Reversal. The above said — this is not necessarily an abnormal rhythm in a young adult. A 4-component rSR’s’ complex in lead V1. This is not a simple incomplete RBBB pattern, which should only consist of 3 components without a terminal s’ deflection. A slender, but unusually deep Q wave in lead III (that is over 5 mm deep). Narrow Q waves are also seen in leads aVF and V6. Prominent J-point notching in
