Case Summary

A 30-something woman with no known past medical history presented with new-onset seizure activity. Her husband called EMS after she experienced seizures associated with micturition. There was no known history of epilepsy, syncope, or sudden cardiac death in the family.

Because cardiac syncope can masquerade as seizure, an ECG was obtained prehospital.

Initial ECG Findings (ECG #1)

Sinus rhythm, ~75–80 bpm

Narrow QRS, normal axis

Mild baseline wander and artifact

Key abnormality: prolonged QT interval

Measured values (paper speed 50 mm/s):

RR ≈ 795 ms

QT ≈ 450–475 ms

QTc ≈ 500–530 ms (depending on correction formula)

Although the ECG initially appears “near normal,” dangerous QTc prolongation is present and is easy to miss without a systematic approach.

Clinical Course During Transport

While en route to the hospital, the patient had multiple brief episodes of:

Loss of consciousness

Cramping / seizure-like activity

Rapid spontaneous recovery between episodes

Continuous 12-lead monitoring captured malignant arrhythmias.

ECG #2: Torsades de Pointes

Underlying sinus rhythm with marked QT prolongation

Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

Initiated by a PVC

Self-terminating

Diagnosis: Torsades de Pointes (TdP) due to long QT.

ECG #3: Degeneration to Ventricular Fibrillation

TdP degenerates into ventricular fibrillation

Episode self-terminated before defibrillation

This confirms life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia as the cause of the apparent seizures.

Immediate Management

IV magnesium sulfate 10 mmol bolus

Continuous magnesium infusion

Potassium replacement started

Admission labs:

Potassium: 3.5 mmol/L (low-normal)

Magnesium: 0.88 mmol/L (low-normal)

Despite “near-normal” serum values, total body depletion of K⁺ and Mg²⁺ was suspected and clinically significant.

After electrolyte repletion:

No further TdP episodes

Hemodynamic and rhythm stabilization

Etiology Investigation

Further history revealed the patient had recently started nine different herbal remedies for fatigue and vague neurologic symptoms.

Exact agents and doses unknown

Herbal preparations are well-documented causes of QT prolongation

Drug–drug and herb–herb interactions likely contributed

Follow-Up ECG (After Stopping Herbal Remedies)

Significant QTc shortening

QTc returned to normal range (~420–440 ms)

ST-T wave abnormalities improved

This strongly suggests acquired long QT due to herbal toxicity and electrolyte depletion.

Important Diagnostic Nuances

QTc can normalize after trigger removal

Normal QTc does NOT exclude congenital LQTS

LQTS may only manifest after:

Hypokalemia

Hypomagnesemia

Drugs

CNS events (e.g., seizures)

Genetic testing for congenital LQTS was ordered.
The patient was referred for ICD evaluation, pending results.

Key Learning Points

All patients with seizures require an ECG

Cardiac syncope and ventricular arrhythmias can mimic epilepsy

QT prolongation is easy to miss without systematic ECG review

Herbal remedies are not benign and can be proarrhythmic

Borderline serum K⁺ and Mg²⁺ may reflect severe total body depletion

TdP is treated with:

Magnesium

Potassium repletion

Removal of offending agents

Bottom Line

This case demonstrates life-threatening Torsades de Pointes masquerading as seizures in a young, previously healthy patient. The cause was most consistent with acquired long QT from herbal remedies and electrolyte depletion, emphasizing the critical role of ECG screening in all seizure presentations and the hidden danger of “natural” supplements.
