Seizure in a 30 something
Written by Magnus Nossen — with edits by Grauer.
The patient in today’s case is a 30-something female. She has no known
previous medical history. Her husband called EMS when the patient
experienced new onset seizures accompanied by micturition. The ECG
below was recorded by EMS. What is your assessment?
ECG #1

Interpretation: ECG #1 shows sinus rhythm at a heart rate of 77 bpm.
The QRS is narrow with a normal PR interval. QRS axis is normal. There
is some baseline wander. At first glance, the ECG does not look too
abnormal. However, cardiac syncope is always a differential diagnosis
when someone presents with first time seizures. In my experience, the
pathologic finding in the above ECG is the easiest one to overlook —
especially if you are in a rush and do not do a systematic review.
There are a number of things to look for in an ECG that can hint at
arrhythmia as the cause of an apparent seizure. Below are some of the
conditions to be aware of:
1.
Preexcitation
2.
Brugada syndrome.
3.
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
4.
Long QT syndrome
5.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

I find it is easier to measure the QTc when the paper speed is 50mm/s, as
it is in the image above. I measure the RR interval at 795ms and the QT
interval at 475ms. The QTc comes out at 533ms, dangerously prolonged.
En route to the hospital the patient experienced multiple short-lasting
episodes, with cramping and loss of consciousness. She quickly regained
consciousness — and was alert in between episodes. One episode was of
longer duration. The ECGs below were captured on continuous 12-lead
monitoring during transport!

Interpretation of ECG #2:
Underlying sinus rhythm. The sinus beats have a very prolonged QT-
interval that seems even longer than in the first ECG. There is a run
of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia — which given the QT prolongation,
qualifies as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). This run of TdP is initiated by a
PVC — but it then self-terminates.
ECG #3
Interpretation of ECG #3:
This rhythm begins as Torsades de Pointes — that then becomes V-Fib.
This episode self terminated before defibrillation was possible.
====================================
Discussion: The patient in today’s case presented with “seizures”. This
case illustrates why all patients with seizures should have an ECG done.
This patient was having recurrent episodes of polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia with an underlying long QT interval ( = Torsades de Pointes).
In the stabilizing area she received 10mmol magnesium sulfate IV,
followed by a mantenance drip. Potassium chloride drip was also started.
Potassium on admission was 3.5mmol/L (Ref 3.6-4.6) and magnesium
0.88 mmol/L (Ref 0.71-0.94). She stabilized after electrolyte administration
with no further episodes of TdP.
Following more detailed questioning — it turned out the patient had
started taking 9 different herbal remedies to ease lethargy and
unspecific neurological symptoms. It is unknown exactly what
specific herbal medicine and what doses that had been ingested.

Below is a follow up ECG after discontinuation of the herbal remedies.
The QTc is significantly shorter. It is very likely that the herbal remedies
caused a lengthening of the QT-interval and led to Torsades de Pointes.
In today’s case — the QTc shortened after discontinuation of herbal
remedies. It is important to be aware that this does not rule out congenital
long QT syndrome (LQTS). The QT interval can be normal in patients with
LQTS, and sometimes only manifests after a trigger such as hypokalemia
or certain drugs.
The patient did not have a positive family history of epilepsy, sudden
cardiac death (SCD) or recurrent syncope.
Results from genetic testing for LQTS are pending — and the
patient has been referred for evaluation of ICD placement.
Learning Points:
LQTS can have normal QTc.
All patients with seizures needs an ECG.
Herbal remedies can potentially be life threatening
See this case for another example of ventricular arrhythmia secondary to
herbal medicine.

Today’s case by Dr. Nossen is fascinating in its complexity — as the
patient is a previously healthy young adult woman, whose presentation
was with a new-onset Seizure.
As noted above — the patient had cardiac syncope following a
series of episodes of TdP (Torsades de Pointes) — raising the
question of whether TdP caused her 1st Seizure — or — if it was
the seizure itself that precipitated her malignant arrhythmia? (See
Costagliola et al — Ann Clin Transl Neurol 8(7): 1557-1568,
2021 — for more on the complex “Brain-Heart Interaction” in
Epilepsy).
Today’s case is further complicated by what
I suspect represents body (therefore myocardial) K+ and Mg++
depletion — given the at best “borderline” serum (ECF) levels of
these cations reported above in today’s case (ie, 3.5 mEq/L for K+
and 1.76 mEq/L for Mg++) — given that ECF levels of these
cations comprise only ~1-2% of total body stores (Jahnen-Dechent
and Ketteler — Clin Kidney J 5(Suppl 1):i3-i14, 2012 — and —
Udensi and Tchounwou — Int J Clin Exp Physiol 4(3): 111-122,
2017).
Added to this is the fact that today’s patient had been
taking multiple herbal products for an unknown period of time,
with it not known which herbal products were being taken, thereby
also being unknown the potential for interactions by possible herbal
combinations (See Déléaval et al — HeartRhythm Case Rep
8(5), 2022— and — Kawatani et al — Oxford Med Case Rep
2023(9), 2023 — for more on potential proarrhythmic effects,
including QTc prolongation of herbal products).
For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced the initial ECG in today’s case.
As per Dr. Nossen — it would be all-too-easy to brush over this ECG as
being “unremarkable” — IF one was not routinely systematic in the
interpretation of all ECGs they encounter.
For review of how Systematic 12-Lead ECG Interpretation not only
increases accuracy, but also speeds you up — Please check out
ECG Podcast #1, with outline and link to my talk on this subject in
theJuly 24, 2024 post in Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog.
Regarding my Systematic assessment of ECG #1:
There is significant baseline artifact, as well as baseline
wander. Keep in mind that your interpretation of the ECGs of your
patients is part of the medical record. I therefore feel
it relevant to document (in your dictation/on the medical
chart) when significant artifact potentially impairs the accuracy of
your interpretation. Given the importance of accurate measurement
of the QT interval in this case — noting there is artifact in ECG
#1 is relevant!
The rhythm in ECG #1 is sinus at ~75/minute.

22/01/2026, 15:33 Seizure in a 30 something - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
Intervals: The PR interval is slightly prolonged (I measure ~0.22
second). The QRS complex is normal (ie, not more than 0.10
second). The QT interval looks to be prolonged (SEE below for
details).
The frontal plane axis is normal (about +70 degrees).
There is no chamber enlargement.
RegardingQ–R–S–T Changes:
There appears to be a Q wave in lead aVL (vs an rSr’ ) — which as
an isolated finding is of uncertain (if any) significance.
R wave progression is appropriate — with Transition (where the R
wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep) occurring normally by
lead V4.
Assessment of ST-T Waves — is challenging, because of the
baseline wander and artifact (resulting in changing morphology from
1 beat-to-the-next) — and — because of the nonspecific ST-T wave
flattening in multiple leads. However, as shown within the BLUE
rectangle in Figure-1 — the end limit of the T wave is clearly seen in
leads V4,V5,V6 (the vertical BLUE line in these leads).
KEY Point: The QT interval should be measured in THAT lead in which
you most clearly see the end of the QT interval, and, in which lead the QT
is longest.
As shown in Figure-1 — By my calculation, the measured QT = 450
msec. To determine the QTc — We need to correct this 450 msec.
value for the patient’s heart rate of ~75/minute.
There are many ways to estimate the QTc (ie, I illustrate a user-
friendly method I developed and have used for decades in
the October 25, 2023 post).
PEARL #1: Alternatively — MD CALC is a handy link that
provides near instant correction of the measured QT according to
heart rate — allowing you to calculate the QTc by any of the 5 most
commonly used corrective formulas ( = Bazett — Fridericia —
Framingham — Hodges — Rautaharju). Plugging in the above
numbers into MD CALC for a heart rate of 75/minute yields
results between 476-to-503 msec. for the QTc (depending on which
of these 5 formulas you choose). All of these values are clearly over
the ~450 msec. that I favor as a “ballpark” upper normal QTc level.
My Impression of ECG #1: Sinus rhythm at ~75/minute — with
nonspecific ST-T wave changes and a prolonged QTc. Because of
the baseline artifact and marked variability in ST-T wave
morphology from 1 beat-to-the-next — I found it hard to determine if
there were (or were not) U waves in ECG #1. That said — in a
patient who develops TdP — the overall ECG appearance of this
initial ECG is consistent with low K+ and/or low Mg++ (See My

Comment in the May 9, 2020 post — for more on the ECG
diagnosis of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia).
PEARL #2: The principal abnormal finding on this ECG is QT
prolongation, here with generalized nonspecific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Over the years, I have found recall of
a short LIST of Causes of QT Prolongation to be of invaluable
assistance. As per My Comment in the March 19, 2019 post of Dr.
Smith’s ECG Blog — Assuming there is no bundle branch block,
ischemia or infarction (as these entities can prolong the QT) —
THINK OF: i) DRUGS (many drugs [including herbal preparations]
may prolong the QT interval — and combinations of drugs can result
in marked prolongation); ii) LYTES (ie, Think of low K+, low Mg++,
low Ca++); and/or, iii) a CNS Catastrophe (ie, stroke, bleed, coma,
seizure, trauma, brain tumor).
Application of the above LIST to Today’s Case: All 3 of the
categories in the above LIST may be contributing to the QTc
prolongation we see in ECG #1: i) Drugs (This patient was taking a
number of herbal medications); — ii) Lytes (Probable body
depletion of K+ and Mg++ — given low normal serum levels of
these cations and generalized nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities
with QTc [or QT-U] prolongation on ECG); — and, iii) CNS (Seizure
activity).
P.S.: For another clinical example of how EASY-it-is to overlook a
long QTc if one is not systematic in approach — Please check out
the May 3, 2020 post in Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog.
Figure-1: I labeled the initial ECG in today’s case.
The Follow-Up ECG in Figure-2:

22/01/2026, 15:33 Seizure in a 30 something - Dr. Smith’s ECG Blog
The patient in today’s case stopped her herbal remedies. Some time after
doing so — the ECG shown in Figure-2 was obtained (this being the 4th
ECG that was shown above in Dr. Nossenʼs discussion).
QUESTION:
Dr. Nossen interpreted ECG #4 as showing significant reduction of the
QTc after the patient stopped her herbal preparations.
Instead of a decrease in the QTc — Doesnʼt return of the T wave
to the baseline in lead V3 (at the point just over the RED arrow
in this lead) suggest that the QTc is increasing?
Figure-2: The follow-up 12-lead ECG after the
patient discontinued all herbal remedies. Has the QTc decreased? —
or is there an increase in the QTc (as suggested by the RED arrow
in lead V3)?
ANSWER:
Rather than highlighting the end of the T wave in lead V3 — I believe
the RED arrow in this lead marks the end of a fairly large U wave.
Surprisingly — a distinct U wave is not seen in any other lead, which
makes it hard to determine what (if any) meaning this single U wave in
lead V3 has.
Determination of the QTc is made by measurement of the longest
QT interval that you can clearly see in any of the 12 leads.
In Figure-2 — we can clearly delineate the end point of the T wave
in most leads. I once again used the last 3 chest leads (within the
BLUE rectangle) — with the vertical BLUE line illustrating
my measured QT = 370 msec.

Correcting this measured QT value for
a heart rate of ~85/minute — and plugging in these values into MD
CALC results between 414-to-440 msec. for the QTc (depending
on which of the 5 formulas in MD CALC that you choose).
CASE Conclusion: The QTc in follow-up ECG #4 shows return of
the QTc to normal (as per Dr. Nossen’s assessment). Electrolyte
replacement — cessation of seizure activity — and stopping herbal
preparations all contributed to normalization of this patient’s QTc,
with improvement of ST-T wave appearance in most leads.
As per Dr. Nossen — results of genetic testing for LQTS are
pending.
Perhaps this patient may not need ICD placement? — since what
appears to be a major causative factor (simultaneous ingestion of 9
herbal preparations) is no longer operative. Further evaluation
should help provide an answer.
==============================
P.S. — for “Purists”: As a longterm “student of French” — I have
wondered for decades what the “correct” spelling for TdP is. French
grammar is beautiful and challenging — and I have seen numerous
versions in anglo texts regarding the spelling of this fascinating
arrhythmia.
First described by the French physician, François Dessertenne in
1966 — the French version of Wikipedia allows for 2 potential
spellings: i) Torsades de Pointes; and, ii) Torsades de Pointe.
The English version of Wikipedia adds: iii) Torsade de Pointes and,
iv) Torsades des Pointes.
It does gets confusing … So I contacted Dr. Pierre Taboulet (French
cardiologist with special expertise in the intricacies of ECG interpretation
— and creator of the wonderful e-cardiogram ECG Blog — that I highly
recommend for French-speaking clinicians).
Dr. Taboulet acknowledges that even French-speaking clinicians
use different terms for TdP. That said, in his words — it really is
much simpler than it may seem because — “Il y a une “torsade
de(s) pointes”, ce qui est le phénomène de base — mais quand il y
en a plusieurs (ce qui en est presque toujours le cas), il y a des
“torsades de pointes”!
Loosely TRANSLATED — The basic phenomenon regarding TdP is
that there is one episode of a “twist” (around the baseline) of the
QRS tip (or point) — but if a given patient has several runs of TdP
(which is almost always the case) — then there will be multiple
episodes with “twist(s)” (around the baseline) of the points (the ups
& downs of the QRS).

My sincere THANKS to Dr. Taboulet for explaining this concept that
I’ve wondered about for decades. His explanation strengthens my
preference to continue uniformly using “Torsades de Pointes” as the
written form of TdP. But the reality is that clinicians around the world
(and in the literature) will continue to use multiple other spellings.
