A patient presented to the emergency department from a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he waited until his convenient appointment with his primary doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.

we recorded another ECG: Now there is significant worsening of ST elevation inferiorly and of the ST depression in the precordial leads. Accordingly, there is increased reciprocal ST depression in aVL. This is now clearly a hyperacute Occlusion MI. The artery is actively re-occluding without any pain! 5 minutes later we record a right sided ECG: Limb leads are not placed differently in a right sided ECG (only precordial leads are reversed). The limb leads now show pseudonormalization of the inferior T-waves [re-occlusion results in the previously inverted reperfusion T-waves becoming upright (“pseudonormalizing”)]. V4-6 are now V4R, V5R, V6R on the right chest. Comment on right sided ECGs: all leads for Right sided ECG are reversed: [V1 = V2R to the right of the sternum; V2 = V2R to the left of the sternum, etc.] Q-waves are normal in right chest leads because they are opposite of the electrically dominant LV. Note the slight ST elevation in V4R, V5R, and V6R highly suggestive of RV infarction. Grauer: Did YOU recognize the “technical misadventure” in the recording of the right-sided ECG? With the progression of ECG changes and concerning history, even without chest pain at this moment, patient was fortunately taken
