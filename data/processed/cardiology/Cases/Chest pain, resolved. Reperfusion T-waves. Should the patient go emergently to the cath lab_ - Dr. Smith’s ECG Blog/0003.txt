A patient presented to the emergency department from a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he waited until his convenient appointment with his primary doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.

the “technical misadventure” in the recording of the right-sided ECG? With the progression of ECG changes and concerning history, even without chest pain at this moment, patient was fortunately taken to the catheterization lab. Angiogram: 90% distal LM 90% ostial proximal LAD Subtotal occlusion of LADD1 and LADD2 Subtotal occlusion of OM-1 70-80% mid and distal RCA OM-1 was the probable culprit. Since the proximal RCA was not involved, the ST Elevation in right leads is probably a false positive. Echo: Estimated LV ejection fraction lower limits of normal-51%. Regional wall motion abnormalities : mid-apical inferior and inferior. Septal walls are dyskinetic, and likely aneurysmal. Normal right ventricular size and function. (This verifies that RV MI is very unlikely). Management: Due to severe multi-vessel disease including proximal LAD, a temporizing intra-aortic balloon pump was placed while a CABG was planned for the next day to augment coronary perfusion pressure and allow for safer induction of anesthesia the next day. No percutaneous intervention was done on the OM1 culprit. First hs troponin I returned at 3443 ng/L. Next trop was not measured until 6 hours later and was 2987 ng/L. I suspect it rose a bit and then fell, the peak
