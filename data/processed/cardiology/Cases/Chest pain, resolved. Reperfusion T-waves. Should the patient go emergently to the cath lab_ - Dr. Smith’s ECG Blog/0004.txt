A patient presented to the emergency department from a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he waited until his convenient appointment with his primary doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.

troponin I returned at 3443 ng/L. Next trop was not measured until 6 hours later and was 2987 ng/L. I suspect it rose a bit and then fell, the peak occurring sometime in the interval.
