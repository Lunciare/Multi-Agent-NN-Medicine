A patient presented to the emergency department from a clinic for a “STEMI activation”. He had been having stuttering exertional chest pain and exercise intolerance for nearly 1 week. However, he had been out of the country and told us that he “didnʼt want to go to the hospital there,” so he waited until his convenient appointment with his primary doctor in clinic in Minnesota. His physician astutely assessed the concerning history, obtained the initial ECG, which he recognized as very worrisome, and so transferred him to the ED after giving 324mg of aspirin.

Here is that clinic ECG, recorded while pain-free: This is diagnostic of acute vs. subacute OMI, almost certainly reperfused. There is inferior ST elevation (II, III, aVF) and anterior precordial ST depression (V2, V3), diagnostic of inferior-posterior occlusive event. But also note the T-wave inversions inferiorly, which strongly suggest some element of reperfusion, especially in the context of resolved chest pain (pain free). There are also well-formed Q-waves that suggest that the infarct was subacute (several hours old) at the time it reperfused. Smith: I am surprised that she does not say “Repefused OMI”.
