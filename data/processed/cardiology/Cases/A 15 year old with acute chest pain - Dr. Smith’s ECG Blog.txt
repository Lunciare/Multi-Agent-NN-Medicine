A 15 year old with acute
chest pain
This was sent to me real time by an outstanding former EM
resident, Quin Stevens.
Quin wrote that a 15 year old presented with sudden onset
chest pressure one hour prior. There were no symptoms of
viral illness.
Here is his ED ECG:
 
What do you think?
There is quite a bit of ST Elevation in I and aVL, with
reciprocal ST depression in lead III, as well as V1-V3. In an
adult, one would need to assume OMI until proven otherwise.
Interestingly, the Queen of Hearts said “Not OMI with low 
confidence.” The model output was 0.35 and it must be
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/a-15-year-old-with-acute-chest-pain/ 1/10
above 0.50 to have 98% specificity. Iʼm not certain what the
specificity is at 0.35.
I sent the ECG real time to my EKG Nerdz friends without any
info. The response was “OMI”.
When I told them it was from a 15yo, they wrote that “it could
be myocarditis, but doesnʼt look like pericarditis.” Those were
my exact thoughts. “I would have a low threshold for
angiogram.” Also my exact thoughts.
So I texted back to encourage an angiogram.
So she called cardiology.
Then the first troponin I returned at 11,000 ng/L. This is typical
of subacute OMI or of myocarditis. Both would have
reciprocal ST depression. Both would have wall motion
abnormalities.
Now it is OMI until proven otherwise. There is simply no way
to tell the difference with this data between acute OMI and
myocarditis. Only angiogram can tell you if intervention is
necessary. Only MRI can make the definitive diagnosis of MI
vs. myocarditis, but that takes time.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/a-15-year-old-with-acute-chest-pain/ 2/10
To not do an angiogram is to play Russian Roulette with a
childʼs heart. Maybe the probability is 20:1 for myocarditis
over OMI, but children do get acute MI. They can have
atherosclerosis (just because it is rare does not mean it is
impossible — it is especially likely in an adolescent with acute
chest pain, an ischemic ECG, and a very high troponin). They
can also have coronary spasm, coronary aneurysms
(especially if they had Kawasaki disease, which can go
undiagnosed), coronary dissection.
So my ex-resident called cardiology and transferred the
patient to a pediatric hospital. The cardiologist said that they
will “Trend Troponins,” and not do an emergent cath
“because it is so exceedingly rare.”
“Trending troponins” is the most useless management
imaginable. Is there any way that this is going to aid in the
diagnosis? And if they keep going up, isnʼt that just waiting for
myocardium to die? That is like saying: “Letʼs wait until the
heart is dead to invervene.”
Quin, now 2 months out of residency, is now having to deal
with the skepicism of consultants. She wrote:
“I felt helpless when talking to both the Peds EM doc and
peds cardiologist when I was trying to explain my worry and
concern. Because I have read enough of your blogs to know
how these conversations go and the consequences. I kinda
wish I would have asked… “out of curiosity, what would
make you activate the cath lab in an adolescent? Because if
not this then… nothing? And the other thing that came to
mind is… anything is “exceedingly rare” if you never look for
it!”
I added that “And rare does not mean non-existent. How will
you find the rare case and treat it on time if you donʼt look?”
I looked for literature on this, and the pediatricians in the
literature on elevated troponin make the final diagnosis of
myocarditis without using angiogram or MRI. I donʼt think they
have any idea how many might have acute MI. See references
below.
They did not do an angiogram. I received no more info on the
“trended troponins”.
Pendell wrote sarcastically: “Always nice to risk a young life
instead of doing a procedure that has close to zero risk for a
young healthy patient.“

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(8/25/2025):
My impression on seeing todayʼs case was similar to that of
Dr. Smith, and to those of our EKG Nerdz colleagues:
IF the patient is an adult — then acute OMIuntil proven
otherwise.
IF an adolescent — then probably myocarditis.
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced todayʼs tracing from
this presumably healthy 15-year old who presented with
sudden onset chest pressure of 1 hour duration. The
abnormalities are undeniable:
There is ST elevation in high-lateral leads I and aVL,
which especially in lead aVL with its high J-point takeoff
and ST segment straightening looks acute (RED arrows
in these leads). The small narrow q waves in these high-
lateral leads are of uncertain significance.
While one might attribute ST elevation in an adolescent
to “repolarization abnormalities” — the ST depression
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/a-15-year-old-with-acute-chest-pain/ 4/10
seen in leads III,aVF and in the anterior leads (BLUE
arrows) is not a finding of benign repolarization in
patients with new symptoms.
Iʼve highlighted the lateral chest lead ST elevation in
leads V5,V6 with GRAY arrows — since as isolated
findings, this would be consistent with repolarization
changes (but it isnʼt in association with the above-noted
findings in 7 other leads).

Figure-1: Iʼve labeled todayʼs initial tracing.
= = =
As per Dr. Smith — acute MI can occur in otherwise healthy
adolescents (Ramphul et al — Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis
8(1):177-181, 2023 — and — Lande and Ben Shachar —
Pediatrics 120(4):e938-43, 2007 — and — Rakash et al —
JACC 81(8), 2023).
Assuming no cocaine/illicit drug use — Anomalous Coronary
Artery is a rare but potentially life-threatening congenital
defect in which the first symptom may be an acute MI or
sudden death (Borns et al — Front Cardiovasc Med
22(7):559794, 2020).

BOTTOM LINE
We all know and accept that acute OMI is rare in otherwise
healthy adolescents. And, the literature I was able to find
suggests from retrospective studies that cardiac
catheterization in otherwise healthy adolescents with chest
pain and abnormal ECGs usually does not change
management. But rare ≠ never.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/a-15-year-old-with-acute-chest-pain/ 5/10
At the least — todayʼs 15-year old patient has acute
myocarditis (despite no symptoms of acute viral
illness).
That said — I donʼt know how to rule out an acute OMI or
some rare congenital abnormality (like an anomalous
coronary artery) in an adolescent with new acute
symptoms — a clearly abnormal ECG — and a serum
Troponin value = 11,000 ng/L.
I donʼt know how “trending Troponins” will possibly
change the situation in todayʼs case (ie, What will be
different regardless if serial Troponins trend toward
normal — or increase to 50,000?).
