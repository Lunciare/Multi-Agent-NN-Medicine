A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new shortness of breath.

ECG 1 at time zero EARLY REPOLARIZATION ABNORMAL ECG ED final official overread: “early repol vs hyperacute T, minimal changes from previous (previous shown below)” Smith: there is some minimal ST elevation in V2–V6, but does not meet STEMI criteria. Is it normal STE? The computer thinks so, and the physician thinks that is quite possible. However, there is terminal QRS distortion in lead V3. We showed that this NEVER happens in normal ST elevation. There are also subtly hyperacute T-waves in I, aVL, and V2–V6. There is also a very negative (reciprocally inverted) T-wave in lead III, and a down-up T-wave in aVF, both of which are highly suggestive of occlusion of the LAD or D1. Previous ECG many months ago (patient had vertigo) Notice that the T-waves are far smaller, there is none of the inferior findings, and there is a well-formed S-wave in V3 (absence of terminal QRS distortion). Queen of Hearts on first ECG: OMI with High Confidence Queen of Hearts interpretation of this prior ECG: Not OMI with High Confidence These findings were very suspicious for the triage MD and so she took the patient to the critical care area. The patient’s pain resolved spontaneously
