A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new shortness of breath.

prior occlusion during chest pain followed by spontaneous reperfusion with resolution of ST elevation or hyperacute T-waves and subsequent T-wave inversion. Evidence and Interpretation There is no formal paper proving Wellens as a reperfusion syndrome, but clinical experience strongly supports it. Recognition was based on papers describing terminal T-wave inversion as a reperfusion marker after thrombolysis. Wehrens XH et al., Am Heart J. 2000;139(3):430–6. Doevendans PA et al., Am J Cardiol. 1995;75(17):1206–10. ECG Comparison Principles The key to comparing ECGs is placing them side by side. Step 1: Ensure accurate lead-to-lead comparison by checking frontal plane axis and R-wave progression. Step 2: Compare ST–T wave morphology lead by lead. In this patient with new symptoms, early repolarization is a diagnosis of exclusion. Dynamic ST–T changes between ECGs confirm an acute event in progress.
