A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new shortness of breath.

troponin I peak: 1849 ng/L ECG 5 at 143 minutes No significant change ECG 6 at 261 minutes Same Formal Echocardiogram Estimated LVEF: 74% Pulmonary artery systolic pressure: 27 mmHg + RA pressure Normal left ventricular cavity size No wall motion abnormality This shows that significant ACS can have ZERO WMA. Angiogram LAD is a large-caliber vessel wrapping around the apex Tubular 80% ostial LAD stenosis, smooth, did not resolve with IC nitroglycerin Tiny D1, medium D2, small D3 Lesion on proximal LAD: Ostial 80% stenosis Pre-procedure TIMI III flow Post-procedure TIMI III flow ECG 7 at 24 hours Wellens’ waves: terminal T-wave inversion in V2–V4 (Wellens Pattern A) Read as “Normal ECG” by the overreading cardiologist ECG 8 at 36 hours Wellens’ waves persist but less prominent V2 especially; V3 has artifact; V4 subtle Wellens wave Read as “Normal ECG” by the overreading cardiologist Wellens described reperfusion T-waves but did not explicitly link them to his syndrome. Wellens’ waves and reperfusion T-waves are the same thing. Wellens’ waves indicate prior occlusion during chest pain followed by spontaneous reperfusion with resolution of ST elevation or hyperacute T-waves and subsequent T-wave inversion.
