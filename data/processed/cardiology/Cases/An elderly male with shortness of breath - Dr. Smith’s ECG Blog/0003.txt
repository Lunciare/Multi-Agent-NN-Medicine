A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new shortness of breath.

Smith: Upward concavity is restored. Comparison of V1–V3 across ECGs shows terminal QRS distortion in V3 at time zero, restoration of the S-wave at 16 minutes, decrease in T-wave size, and restoration of upward concavity at 21 and 55 minutes. Because the pain was gone and the ECG improving, the cath lab was not activated. Cardiology agreed the first ECG was early repolarization and similar to previous, but recommended aspirin, heparin, and waiting for the first troponin. An aortic CT was negative. This is a “Transient OMI”. Transient STEMI has been studied and many of these patients will re-occlude in the middle of the night. If prepared for this, it is acceptable to wait until morning for intervention. The proximal LAD thrombus lysed or partially lysed, restoring flow. It is not clear that this was recognized as a transient OMI. Lemkes et al.
