ECG 1 at time zero EARLY REPOLARIZATION ABNORMAL ECG ED final official overread: “early repol vs hyperacute T, minimal changes from previous (previous shown below)” Smith: there is some minimal ST elevation in V2–V6, but does not meet STEMI criteria. The computer thinks so, and the physician thinks that is quite possible. However, there is terminal QRS distortion in lead V3. We showed that this NEVER happens in normal ST elevation. There are also subtly hyperacute T-waves in I, aVL, and V2–V6. There is also a very negative (reciprocally inverted) T-wave in lead III, and a down-up T-wave in aVF, both of which are highly suggestive of occlusion of the LAD or D1.
