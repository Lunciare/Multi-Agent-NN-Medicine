A 70-something y.o. male presents to triage with shortness of breath. He reports significant chest pain at the base of his scapula on the right side along with new shortness of breath.

Not OMI with High Confidence These findings were very suspicious for the triage MD and so she took the patient to the critical care area. The patient’s pain resolved spontaneously after 2 sublingual nitroglycerine and another ECG was recorded. ECG 2 at 16 minutes ST ELEVATION CONSISTENT WITH INJURY, PERICARDITIS, OR EARLY REPOLARIZATION Smith: The T-waves are now MUCH smaller. The S-wave is reconstituted. The inferior findings are much less pronounced. The T-wave and STE in V2 are still very suspicious and much different from baseline, but the overall interpretation is that it is consistent with reperfusion. Thus, the LAD has reperfused (“recanalized”) spontaneously. Queen on ECG 2: Not OMI, Low confidence She is also worried about V2. ECG 3 at 21 minutes SINUS RHYTHM WITH FIRST DEGREE AV BLOCK Smith: Look at V2. All findings are now resolved. However, the ST segments are still relatively straight. ECG 4 at 55 minutes SINUS RHYTHM WITH FIRST DEGREE AV BLOCK Overread: previous in the same day, resolution of hyperacute T wave Smith: Upward concavity is restored. Comparison of V1–V3 across ECGs shows terminal QRS distortion in V3 at time zero, restoration of the S-wave at 16 minutes, decrease in T-wave size,
