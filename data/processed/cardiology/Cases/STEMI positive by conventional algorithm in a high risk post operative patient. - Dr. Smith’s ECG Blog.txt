STEMI positive by
conventional algorithm in a
high risk post operative
patient.
A man in his late 60s was convalescing in the hospital
following bilateral lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis.
Medical history is also significant for rheumatoid arthritis and
chronic steroid use (a risk factor for coronary artery disease).
On postoperative day 2, ECG was obtained.
ECG 1
What do you think?
The GE algorithm interpretation was ** ** ACUTE MI / STEMI
** **
Looking closely at this ECG we see:
Sinus tachycardia (uncommon in OMI in the absence of
cardiogenic shock)

Concave ST segments, even with an initial downslope in
some leads
Marked asymmetry to the T waves (more gentle
upslope, sharper downslope)
Smith: Unfortunately, in LAD OMI, concavity can be present in
all leads with ST elevation. So that alone does not rule out the
diagnosis. However, in this case, the concavity is extreme, as
it is preceded by a very flat ST segment that rapidly turns
upward, creating a narrow base to the T-wave. Although there
is a lot of area under the curve of the T-wave, if measured
from the J-point, there is NOT a lot of area under the curve if
measured from the point where the complex turns upward
into the T-wave. In fact, from this point, the T-wave has a very
narrow base. Moreover, the STE in I and aVL, which might
indicate proximal LAD occlusion, is not associated with
inferior ST depression; in fact, there is STE in lead II. This
would be very unusual in proximal LAD OMI. When I was
shown this with no information, I said “pericarditis”
Smith SW. Upwardly concave ST segment morphology is
common in acute left anterior descending coronary
occlusion
When this ECG was run through the Queen of Hearts for
clinical decision making purposes, the Queen of Hearts saw
no OMI but with low confidence (meaning OMI must still be
guarded against aggressively). When I run it through, very
subtle changes in digitization result in a barely positive
reading. The AI model puts out a score between 0 and 1
where 0 is no evidence of OMI and 1 is highest possible risk
for OMI. The calibration is set so that 0.5 is the cut point for
“positive” result. When I run the ECG through, the reading is
0.53.
Smith: the Queen is amazing at recognizing false positives.
This recent study showed a decrease in false positive cath
lab activations from 42% to 8%, while identifying OMI
correctly on the first ECG in 92% (vs. 70% for standard of
care). AI-Enabled ECG Analysis Improves Diagnostic
Accuracy and Reduces False STEMI Activations: A
Multicenter U.S. Registry
Case continued: On evaluation, documentation indicates that
the patient denied chest pain. Bedside echocardiogram
showed normal wall motion. Physical exam revealed
prominent friction rub. In this context, the combination of
history and ECG support refraining from immediate cath lab
activation.

Smith: a Friction rub is rarely heard in pericarditis (not
sensitive) but when it is heard, the diagnosis quite certain
(high specificity). Other ways to confirm pericarditis:
pericardial effusion is quite specific. Absence of wall motion
abnormality is very specific, if they are high quality images.
Repeat ECG the following day is shown:
ECG 2
Trying to read through some of the motion artifact affecting
some of the leads we wouldʼve been most interested in, this
ECG shows improvement compared to ECG 1, with ST
segments still abnormal but on the path to normalization.
Initial high sensitivity troponin I was elevated at 2676 ng/L,
but improved to 2080 ng/L on repeat.
This is likely immunologically mediated post-cardiac injury
syndrome following pericardiotomy as part of the lung
transplant, which can be treated with colchicine to reduce the
risk of recurrence.
Smith: so although this is not proven by negative troponins
and/or negative angiogram, the entire clinical picture,
including the ECG, point toward pericarditis/myocarditis.

======================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (1/21/2026):
Todayʼs case by Dr. Frick features a series of interesting ECG
findings — that take on a very different significance once the
history of this patient is known.
Viewed without the benefit of any history — the 12-lead
tracing in Figure-1 would clearly raise suspicion of an

unusual distribution acute injury pattern.
= = =
Todayʼs history is enlightening:
The ECG in Figure-1 was presumably obtained as routine
on this patientʼs 2nd-post operative day following major
open-chest surgery for bilateral lung transplantation.
The patient was not having chest pain.
Bedside echo showed normal wall motion.
A prominent pericardial friction rub was heard.
My Impression: As per Dr. Frick — the above clinical
scenario strongly suggests PCIS (Post-Cardiac Injury
Syndrome) as the etiology for the worrisome ECG
findings in Figure-1(and not acute infarction! ).
= = =
What are the ECG Findings?
As per the Platek at al reference recommended above by Dr.
Frick (JACC Adv 4(10), 2025) — PCIS entails a group of
inflammatory pericardial syndromes that occur following
cardiac injury, as may occur following the extensive bilateral
lung transplantation procedure that todayʼs patient
underwent. These syndromes encompass: i) Post-MI
Syndrome; — ii) Post-pericardiotomy syndrome; — and, iii)
Post-traumatic pericarditis.
My Thoughts: I see no reference citing any specific ECG
picture to expect with PCIS — with ECG findings likely to
vary depending on the source of cardiac “injury” (PCIS
may be seen following cardiac surgery with
pericardiotomy, after pacemaker insertion, ablation
procedures, PCI, and/or blunt or penetrating chest
trauma).
Iʼd therefore expect the ECG to show findings of
pericarditis combined with those of cardiac injury
(similar to the array of ECG findings that might be
seen with acute myopericarditis — depending on
how diffuse the involved area was).
= = =
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced and labeled todayʼs
initial ECG.
The rhythm is sinus tachycardia — with a PVC as the last
beat.

As per Dr. Frick — there is concave up (“smiley”-
configuration) ST elevation in multiple leads ( = leads
I,aVL; V3,V4,V5,V6) — with ST segment straightening for
the ST elevation in lead II.
The amount of this ST elevation is especially marked in
the chest leads. The shape of this ST elevation is
consistent with that seen in acute pericarditis, albeit a
little less generalized (Simple acute pericarditis often
also results in similar ST elevation in leads aVF and V2).
Two features I always look for when assessing ECGs for
possible perricarditis are:
i) The ST elevation pattern in lead II looks more like that
in lead I with acute pericarditis (whereas with acute MI
— the ST segment in lead II is more likely to look like that
in lead III, which is not the case here);
ii) With pericarditis — the RATIO of the amount of ST
elevation to T wave amplitude in lead V6 is
usually more than 0.25 (ie, height of the ST elevation, as
measured from the end of the PR segment to the J-point
— should be more than 1/4 of the height of the T wave in
lead V6). As shown in Figure-1 — the ST/T wave ratio =
0.6, which clearly satisfies this criterion.
NOTE: I review and illustrate these 2 clues (and other
clues) to the diagnosis of pericarditis in My Comment at
the bottom of the page in the September 28, 2025 post
in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog.
Finally — There are impressive “reciprocal”changes to the
multiple lead ST elevation we see from pericardial
inflammation:
Specifically, in right-sidedleads aVR and V1 — there is
PR segment elevation, T wave inversion, and marked J-
point ST depression (comparable to the surprisingly
large amount of ST elevation in the chest leads).
The remaining right-sided lead ( = lead III) — shows ST
segment flattening, with subtle T wave inversion.
= = =
Concluding Thought: We continually emphasize in Dr. Smithʼs
ECG Blog how when a patient presents to the ED with new
cardiac-sounding chest pain — pericarditis is rare. Such
patients are far more likely to have acute ischemic heart
disease.
Todayʼs history is very different. In this different clinical
context — the ECG in Figure-1 is completely consistent
with what one might expect with PCIS (Post-Cardiac
Injury Syndrome) following bilteral lung transplantation.
