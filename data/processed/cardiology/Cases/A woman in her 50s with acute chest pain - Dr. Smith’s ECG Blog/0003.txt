was unlikely. I suspected acute LCx occlusion. For clarity, I reproduced the initial ECG. The ECG shows sinus rhythm ~90 bpm, normal intervals and axis, and extensive ST elevation. A 50-something woman awakened from sleep with severe new chest pain should be assumed to be having acute MI until proven otherwise. Findings suggesting acute MI: * Q waves present in multiple leads with ST elevation * ST elevation pattern consistent with acute inferolateral infarction * Reciprocal changes in aVL * Hyperacute-appearing T waves in V3 and V4 * Possible (initially suspected) terminal QRS distortion in V4 Bottom line: ECG #1 looked like acute inferolateral STEMI needing prompt cath. * Q waves in almost all STE leads (could represent early infarction) * Inferior Q waves not consistent with normal septal q waves * ST-T in lead II does not resemble lead I (expected in pericarditis) * No reciprocal change expected, yet seen in aVL * Flat ST in V2 (not typical for pericarditis) * Hyperacute-appearing ST-T in V3 and V4 inconsistent with pericarditis NOTE #1: Myocarditis could mimic this ECG, but normal cath, troponins, echo, and MRI ruled it out. NOTE #2: No pericardial friction rub reported (which would confirm diagnosis).
