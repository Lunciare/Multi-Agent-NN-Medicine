inflammation. There is a small circumferential effusion, no tamponade physiology. Mild septal bounce demonstrates ventricular interdependence. IVC dilated to 2.9 cm with <50% collapse, suggesting early constrictive physiology. No myocardial LGE to suggest myocarditis or infarction. Two troponins were <6 ng/L. She was treated with colchicine and ibuprofen. Rheumatologic and infectious workups were negative. ECG recorded on day 4 of hospitalization. ECG recorded on day 6 of hospitalization. She was diagnosed with recurrent idiopathic pericarditis and discharged. Here is her ECG 6 months later, without symptoms. The “four stages of pericarditis on ECG” are taught as: Stage 1: widespread STE and PR depression Stage 2: ST segments return to baseline with T-wave flattening Stage 3: T-wave inversion Stage 4: Normalization This patient fulfills the classic sequence. Actual pericarditis is rare compared to normal variant baseline ST elevation. The harm of missing OMI is far greater than the harm of mislabeling pericarditis. “You diagnose pericarditis at your peril.” Medicine is humbling. I included pericarditis in the differential but thought pure pericarditis was unlikely. I suspected acute LCx occlusion. For clarity, I reproduced the initial ECG. The ECG shows sinus rhythm ~90 bpm, normal intervals and axis, and extensive ST elevation. A
