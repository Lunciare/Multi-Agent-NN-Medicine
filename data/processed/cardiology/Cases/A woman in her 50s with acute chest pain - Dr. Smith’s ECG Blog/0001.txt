A woman in her 50s with no significant past medical history experienced acute anterior chest pain that woke her from sleep and radiated to her back. She described it as “stabbing”, 8/10, constant, and associated with nausea. She denied preceding symptoms or recent illnesses. Here is her triage ECG during active pain: What do you think? This ECG was recorded 30 minutes later with ongoing pain. The physician was worried about possible acute coronary occlusion and activated the cath lab. The angiogram showed no significant coronary disease. First troponin I was 10 ng/L. Second troponin was 23 ng/L. Echocardiogram showed normal EF, no wall motion abnormalities, no pericardial effusion. Here is the ECG the next day. She was given colchicine and discharged. She returned with similar symptoms about 1 month later. Repeat echocardiogram revealed a small pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI was read as: Acute pericarditis with signs of early constrictive physiology. The pericardium is diffusely thickened. There is diffuse late gadolinium enhancement of parietal and visceral layers consistent with pericardial inflammation. There is a small circumferential effusion, no tamponade physiology. Mild septal bounce demonstrates ventricular interdependence. IVC dilated to 2.9 cm with <50% collapse, suggesting early constrictive physiology. No myocardial
