Abdominal Pain in a middle-aged patient
KEYWORDS: ecg, omi, sign, diagonal, iii, lad, lead, flag, flag sign, avl, elevation, diagonal branch, south, proximal, occlusion

Kalra texted me this ECG on a Sunday morning: Patient with abdominal pain. hs-Trop I is 15,000. Taking her to the cath lab. My response: “This looks like a subacute (possibly spontaneously reperfused) first diagonal. But it is definitely OMI. T-wave inverted in aVL and starting to invert in V2.” This ECG has the “South Africa Flag Sign.” The sign indicates STE or hyperacute T-wave in V1, I, aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in lead III.
