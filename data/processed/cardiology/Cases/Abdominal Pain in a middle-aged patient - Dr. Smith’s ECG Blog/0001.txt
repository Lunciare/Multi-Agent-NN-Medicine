Dr. Kalra texted me this ECG on a Sunday morning: Patient with abdominal pain. No chest pain. hs-Trop I is 15,000. I think it is OMI. Taking her to the cath lab. My response: “This looks like a subacute (possibly spontaneously reperfused) first diagonal. Could be LAD. But it is definitely OMI. T-wave inverted in aVL and starting to invert in V2.” This ECG has the “South Africa Flag Sign.” The sign indicates STE or hyperacute T-wave in V1, I, aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in lead III. It is a sign of first diagonal occlusion, or sometimes LAD occlusion proximal to the first diagonal. I sent the ECG to the Queen of Hearts PMCardio AI Model for diagnosis. Today’s initial ECG is clearly diagnostic of an acute OMI that very strongly suggests a culprit in the 1st or 2nd diagonal branch of the LAD. The South African Flag Sign is present when there is: i) ST elevation in leads I, aVL, V2 ii) Reciprocal ST depression in lead III (and often II, aVF) iii) No ST elevation in any chest lead except V2 PEARL #1: Acute proximal LAD OMI may initially look like diagonal branch OMI because early STE
