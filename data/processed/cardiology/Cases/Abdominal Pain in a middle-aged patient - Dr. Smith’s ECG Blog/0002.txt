(and often II, aVF) iii) No ST elevation in any chest lead except V2 PEARL #1: Acute proximal LAD OMI may initially look like diagonal branch OMI because early STE may be limited to V2 and only later spread to V1–V4. PEARL #2: Only V2 shows ST elevation — therefore it fails STEMI criteria requiring 2 contiguous anterior leads. Recognizing the South African Flag Sign alerts the angiographer where the culprit is likely to be. Comparison between the reference ECG and today’s ECG: Both show the S. African Flag Sign, but today’s ECG also shows reperfusion T-waves (T-wave inversion in I, aVL, V2; peaked terminal T wave in III), indicating spontaneous reperfusion after earlier occlusion.
