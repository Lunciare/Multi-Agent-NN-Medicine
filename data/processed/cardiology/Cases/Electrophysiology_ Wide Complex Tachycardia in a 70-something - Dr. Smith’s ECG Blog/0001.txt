A 70-year-old man experienced sudden-onset palpitations and nausea while at rest and immediately called emergency services. On EMS arrival, he was alert (GCS 15) and denied chest pain. He reported a history of mechanical heart valve placement and multiple prior cardiac surgeries. An ECG was obtained prehospital and transmitted to the emergency department, which was approximately five minutes away.

On ED arrival, vital signs showed respiratory rate 28/min, oxygen saturation 90%, and blood pressure 112/73 mmHg. The patient appeared diaphoretic, indicating hemodynamic compromise. Initial ECG (ECG #1) The presenting ECG showed a regular wide complex tachycardia (WCT) at approximately 200 beats per minute. Key ECG features: Wide QRS complexes QRS negative in leads III and aVF Nearly biphasic QRS in lead II Positive QRS complexes in I and aVL Frontal plane axis directed toward the left shoulder Precordial leads showed QS complexes in V1–V2 and R waves in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6) Overall morphology consistent with LBBB-like pattern The axis and morphology together are consistent with ventricular tachycardia originating from the inferior right ventricle. Given the patient’s age, history of structural heart disease, and signs of instability (hypoxia, diaphoresis), the rhythm was presumed to be ventricular tachycardia, and immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion was indicated. A 12-lead ECG was appropriately obtained prior to cardioversion to allow later diagnostic review. Management The patient was sedated and successfully cardioverted. Hemodynamic status rapidly improved after cardioversion. Post-Conversion ECG (ECG #2) Following cardioversion: Initial beat likely represented a junctional escape Subsequent rhythm showed atrial activity preceding each QRS Conduction pattern demonstrated atypical RBBB
