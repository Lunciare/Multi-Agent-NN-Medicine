A 70-year-old man experienced sudden-onset palpitations and nausea while at rest and immediately called emergency services. On EMS arrival, he was alert (GCS 15) and denied chest pain. He reported a history of mechanical heart valve placement and multiple prior cardiac surgeries. An ECG was obtained prehospital and transmitted to the emergency department, which was approximately five minutes away.

phenocopy, occurring decades after surgical repair of Tetralogy of Fallot. ARVC phenocopy represents an acquired arrhythmogenic substrate caused by chronic right ventricular dilation, fibrosis, and surgical scarring, mimicking genetic ARVC in the absence of familial mutations. Learning Points In older patients with known structural heart disease, regular WCT should be assumed to be VT until proven otherwise Hemodynamic instability mandates immediate cardioversion, without delay for rhythm differentiation A pre-cardioversion ECG is invaluable for retrospective diagnosis Epsilon waves are rare but real, and not exclusive to genetic ARVC Adults with repaired congenital heart disease are at increasing risk for ventricular arrhythmias ARVC phenocopy should be considered in patients with prior right-sided cardiac surgery and VT of right ventricular origin
