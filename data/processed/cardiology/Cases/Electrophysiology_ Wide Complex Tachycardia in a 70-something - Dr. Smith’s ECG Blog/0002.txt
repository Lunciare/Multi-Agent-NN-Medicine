A 70-year-old man experienced sudden-onset palpitations and nausea while at rest and immediately called emergency services. On EMS arrival, he was alert (GCS 15) and denied chest pain. He reported a history of mechanical heart valve placement and multiple prior cardiac surgeries. An ECG was obtained prehospital and transmitted to the emergency department, which was approximately five minutes away.

rapidly improved after cardioversion. Post-Conversion ECG (ECG #2) Following cardioversion: Initial beat likely represented a junctional escape Subsequent rhythm showed atrial activity preceding each QRS Conduction pattern demonstrated atypical RBBB Subtle deflections were present at the terminal portion of the QRS complex Careful inspection revealed epsilon waves, best seen in: Leads V1–V3 Limb leads I, II, and III Epsilon waves appeared as small notches or blips at the end of the QRS complex, preceding the ST segment. These findings were more evident when leads were viewed at higher paper speed (50 mm/s). Clinical Course Echocardiography demonstrated: Chronically dilated right ventricular outflow tract Mechanical pulmonary valve prosthesis Ventricular septal defect patch with a small residual shunt Dilated and dysfunctional right ventricle These findings were consistent with prior imaging. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. The patient had an otherwise uneventful hospital course and was enrolled in long-term follow-up for adult congenital heart disease. Final Diagnosis The patient was determined to have ventricular tachycardia due to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) phenocopy, occurring decades after surgical repair of Tetralogy of Fallot. ARVC phenocopy represents an acquired arrhythmogenic substrate caused by chronic right ventricular dilation, fibrosis, and surgical scarring, mimicking genetic ARVC
