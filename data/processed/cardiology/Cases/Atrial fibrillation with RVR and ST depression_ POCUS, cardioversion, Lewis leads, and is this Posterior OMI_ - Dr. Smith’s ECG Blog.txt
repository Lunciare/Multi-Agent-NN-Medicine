and is this Posterior OMI?
Steve Smith onNovember 23, 2025
Atrial fibrillation with RVR
and ST depression: POCUS,
cardioversion, Lewis leads,
and is this Posterior OMI?
 
An elderly man with a history of diabetes and HTN presented
with lethargy and weakness, decreased urine output, and
hypotension. There was no history of any GI bleeding or
other hemorrhage. There was no fever.
He had no CP or SOB, and it was unknown if there was a
previous history of atrial fibrillation. He was on atenolol, but it
was not known if this was simply for hypertension, or for atrial
fib.
He was not anti-coagulated.
Blood pressures ranged from 83/45 to 125/83, lower than
usual. HR ranged from 110 to 145.
He had an ECG recorded upon arrival:

What do you think?
= = =
There is atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response
(rate of approximately 120). There are aberrantly conducted
beats (Ashmannʼs phenomenon–see Kenʼs analysis below),
which are easily confused with PVC couplets. There is ST
depression in V2-6 that is clearly ischemic.
Is it OMI?
The ischemia on the ECG could be of several possible
etiologies:
1. New or Old Atrial fibrillation with posterior OMI.
2. New atrial fib with RVR causing demand ischemia (but
the rate is not terribly fast).
3. Old atrial fib with poor rate control causing demand
ischemia.
4. OMI or ACS causing Subendocardial ischemia with
possible additional ischemia from atrial fib with RVR
5. Hemorrhage/dehydration/sepsis/etc., with new or old
atrial fib, resulting in reflexive tachycardia and demand
ischemia.
PEARL from Smith: although ST depression maximal in V1-4
is extremely specific for acute OMI, in the presence of atrial
fibrillation with RVR it is NOT!!
Does the PMCardio Queen of Hearts know whether it is OMI
or not?= =
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 2/18
She thinks it is not. That is very interesting. She
understands that in the context of atrial fibrillation with RVR
(tachycardia), ST depression in V1-V4 is most likely
subendocardial ischemia.
As you will see below, this turned out to NOT be OMI, but
rather it was supply demand subendocardial ischemia. The
Queen is very good at detecting mimics, as this paper
shows. In this study, she decreased false positive activations
from 42% to 8%!! All the while diagnosing true OMI on 92%
of first ECGs, compared to 71% for the standard of care.

Case Continued
To find the answer, it is wise to assess volume status, which
can be done with ultrasound:
A bedside ultrasound was done from the subcostal view,
concentrating on the IVC. If this is due to etiologies 1-4, one
would expect a full IVC. If etiology 5, then one expects a flat
and/or collapsing IVC:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 3/18
00:00
This shows a collapsing inferior vena cava (IVC), consistent
with volume depletion
Another with a better view of the heart. RV is on upper part
of the view, next the liver:
00:00
RV is quite small. LV is also small and has reasonably good
contractility. This supports volume depletion.
The appropriate therapy would be fluids and further workup
for hemorrhage/dehydration/sepsis/etc.
However, BOTH an esmolol bolus and drip, and IV fluids were
started.
But beta blockade should NOT be given, at least not yet. In
a volume depleted state, this patient needs the reflexive
tachycardia for cardiac output.
By the time I arrived and was involved, the esmolol had not
been at a high enough dose to do any harm.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 4/18
His lactate returned as 3.3 mEq/L and first troponin at 0.139
ng/mL. I was quite certain that this was a type II (demand
ischemia) MI and that this patient was not having ACS.
I assume that cardioversion was appropriatelynot done
because the risk of thromboembolism, but other reasons not
to do it are: 2) if the patient is in chronic atrial fib, it is unlikely
to work and 3) the etiology of mild shock is NOT the atrial fib
with RVR, but some other illness that can be at least partly
alleviated with IV fluids.
I stopped the esmolol and gave the patient 2 liters of fluid.
After fluids, the IVC was less collapsing:
00:00
The volume status is now better, at least relatively. It still may
not be enough: when patients are in atrial fib, they usually
need higher filling pressures for good cardiac output, so
some IVC fullness would be good, as long as it does not lead
to pulmonary edema, best evaluated with B-lines.
There were no B-lines.
But the patient monitor then showed a regular tachycardia
without any P-waves. In other words, there was
spontaneous conversion out of atrial fib to a regular narrow
complex rhythm. The rate was very constant at 140 and so I
wondered if this was SVT or sinus tach. Another 12-lead ECG
was recorded:
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 5/18
Now there is a regular supraventricular rhythm. There are
probable P-waves, but I wasnʼt entirely certain.
What to do?
Lewis leads.
= = =
I went into the patientʼs room, and, according to the
instructions on LifeintheFastLane, I changed the monitor
leads around (this is not a 12-lead!)
Right Arm (RA)electrode on manubrium
Left Arm (LA) electrode over 5th ICS, right sternal
border.
Left Leg (LL) electrode over right lower costal margin.
Right Leg (RL) electrode in standard position on right leg
Monitor Lead I or II
I printed out the monitor strip. This is what I recorded:
Now the P-waves are obvious.
= = =So the patient now has sinus tachycardia.
I gave more fluids and the heart rate came down. Here is the
next ECG:
Normal.
= = =
Later, the second troponin I returned at 0.562 ng/mL. When
the third returned, it was 2.165 ng/mL.
He developed a fever and urine showed WBCʼs. He was
treated for urosepsis and did well. He did not have ACS.
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 6/18
Learning Points:
1. Not all myocardial infarction is due to ACS. This was a Type
2 MI. See here for a recent Delphi article on Type 2 MI.
2. Subendocardial supply demand ischemia in the setting of
AF with RVR may be maximal in V1-V4
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR may be a consequence, not a
cause of, illness
3. Volume status is critical in the management of Atrial
fibrillation with RVR
4. If you are not certain of a source of SVT, do Lewis leads.

=====================================
MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD
(11/23/2025):
I found todayʼs case a masterful demonstration by Dr. Smith
of the following attributes:
— i) Optimal ECG interpretation (ie, No acute OMI — but
rather DSI = Diffuse Subendocardial Ischemia);
— ii) Clinical correlation (The history being much more
suggestive sepsis/dehydration — without any chest pain
to suggest recent MI );
— iii) Astute use of diagnostic modalities readily
available to emergency physicians, albeit all-too-often
notthought of (ie,Bedside Echo to confirm volume
depletion as a major problem, and potential precipitant
of AFib — and then application of a Lewis Lead to
confirm sinus rhythm after treatment, but with the
regular ECG too equivocal to allow identification of P
waves);
— iv) Moment-to-moment follow-up of the patient to
test your clinical deductions and ensure that your
treatment is working (with confirmation that there was
no acute coronary occusion — but instead that
treatment of volume depletion and urosepsis was
sufficient for patient improvement and restoration of
sinus rhythm).

https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 7/18
I focus My Comment on a few additional points regarding the
initial ECG:
For clarity in Figure-1 — Iʼve reproduced and have
labeled todayʼs initial ECG.
Iʼve added an ADDENDUM below with brief review on
the concept of aberrant conduction and illustration for
Lewis Lead placement.
= = =
Todayʼs Initial ECG:
As per Dr. Smith — todayʼs initial ECG shows AFib with a
moderately rapid ventricular response.
And, as per Dr. Smith — there clearly is ischemia, with
ST depression in 9 leads (BLUE arrows in Figure-1) —
with subtle ST elevation in lead aVR (RED arrow). As
emphasized often in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog (See My
Comment in the July 25, 2024 post) — this combination
of diffuse ST depression with ST elevation in aVR is most
conveniently classified as DSI (Diffuse Subendocardial
Ischemia) — which practically speaking means either: i)
Severe underlying coronary disease (but most often not
acute coronary occlusion); — ii) “Something else” (ie, a
sustained tachycardia; shock; profound hypotension; GI
bleeding; septicemia; anemia; etc.); — or — i) and ii)
together.
Mechanisms by which AFib may precipitate DSI include:
i) Loss of the “atrial kick” (which may account for
between 5-40% of cardiac output) — with this effect
being especially impactful if the onset of AFib is new; —
and; ii) The rapid rate of new AFib, which
disproportionately shortens the period of diastolic filling
(thereby greatly reducing cardiac output) — with this
effect especially impactful if associated with
hypovolemia or acute MI.
= = =
Are the FLBʼs aberrantly conducted or PVCs?
Iʼve labeled beats #9,10 and #18,19 in Figure-1 as FLBʼs
(Funny-Looking Beats) — because in this AFib rhythm, these
4 beats are wide and clearly look different than the underlying
normally conducted QRS complexes (That these FLBs are
truly different from the other QRS complexes is best seen by
looking at simultaneously-recorded leads aVR,aVL,aVF; and
V5,V6).
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 8/18
To Emphasize: Whether beats #9,10 and #18,19 are
PVCsoraberrantly conducted supraventricular
complexes is admittedly academic — with the “good
news” being that regardless of what the etiology of
these beats is, they do not need to be treated, and they
will probably go away once this patientʼs hypovolemia
and septicemia are treated, and once the heart rate
slows. That said — itʼs worth discussing assessment of
these FLBʼs in the setting of AFib, since a longer run of
FLBʼs might simulate VT.
Assessment of wide beats in association with AFib is
often challenging because we donʼt see P waves. While
true that the rapid rate of new AFib predisposes to
aberrant conduction — the occurrence in similar-looking
pairs to me suggests that they are more likely to be
ventricular couplets.
To facilitate defining the beginning and end of the QRS
for these FLBʼs — I added vertical time lines (the BLUE
lines for the beginning of the QRS — and the RED lines
for the end of the QRS). The all upright R wave in lateral
leads aVL and V6 with predominantly negative QRS in
lead V4 could be consistent with LBBB aberration.
That said — cycle-sequence comparison is inconsistent
for aberrant conduction. The concept is that aberrant
conduction results when early beats occur during the
RRP (Relative Refractory Period). The shorter the
couplinginterval(double YELLOW arrow) — the greater
the chance that an early supraventricular impulse will fall
within the RRP and be conducted with aberration. The
longer the preceding R-R interval(double PINK arrow)
— the more the RRP of the next beat will be prolonged
(This is the Ashman phenomenon — which I address in
the ADDENDUM, and discuss in detail in the Sept. 16,
2024 post).
Against aberrant conduction in Figure-1 — are the beats
with the BLUE question marks — since, if beats #9,10
and #18,19 are aberrantly conducted supraventricular
impulses — then beats #4 and #17 should also have
been conducted with aberrancy given their cycle-
sequence features.
BOTTOM Line: I donʼt think we can conclude whether
the FLBʼs in Figure-1 are PVCs or aberrantly conducted
— in which case I favor the default of assuming them to
be ventricular couplets. But as stated above in my 1st
bullet — these beats do not need to be treated — and
these FLBʼs will probably go away once this patientʼs
underlying problems can be addressed (Please check
out my 5-minute ECG Video on aberrant conduction in
the ADDENDUMbelow).

ADDENDUM:
1) The “Whys” of Aberrant Conduction:
In this 4:45 Minutes video (63 MB- mp4) — I review
WHY some early beats and some SVT rhythms are
conducted with Aberration (and why the most common
form of aberrant conduction manifests RBBB
morphology).
NOTE: In addition to QRS morphology and the coupling
interval of early beats — is the effect of the R-R interval
preceding the wide beat(which with bradycardia,
predisposes to aberrant conduction by prolonging the
refractory period of the next beat). I review this
important additional concept with my user-friendly
approach to the Ashman phenomenon (See My
Comment at the bottom of the page in the September
16, 2024 post in Dr. Smithʼs ECG Blog).

2 Regarding Lewis Lead Configurations:
)
Over the years there have been multiple versions of “the
Lewis Lead”. The original version was put forth by Sir
Thomas Lewis in 1931 — when he was looking for the best
way to view atrial activity during atrial flutter (Beuscher —
FOAMfrat, 4/19/2018).
In Figure-2 — I show the 2 most common among many
versions that I saw referenced on the internet (Meyering
— MMEM, 5/17/2020). Iʼll add that each time I asked AI
for its “answer” — the placements I received would
differ slightly.
The alternative Lewis Lead Placement (which is the
method I cited for years) — is actually the original lead
placement described in 1931 by Lewis (Illustration below
in Figure-3 — as well as in YELLOW in Figure-2).
The common Lewis Lead Placement (in BLUE in Figure-
2) — appears to have become the most frequently used
method in recent years. It is often described as “the S5
Lead”(as advocated by Marriott).
Final Thoughts: You have more than one option for anatomic
placement when attempting a Lewis lead. I donʼt know if any
one placement is superior to any other (It probably depends
on the patient).
The alternativeLewis Lead Placement (as shown in
Figure-3) is simplest — because you only need to adjust
the RA and LA electrodes.
The goal of any of these placements is to try to
maximize the size of atrial activity on your recorded
tracing. The “result” of your Lewis Lead placement is
viewed in Lead I — which records the electrical
difference between the LA and RA electrodes. In your
https://drsmithsecgblog.com/atrial-fibrillation-with-rvr-use-pocus/ 11/18
mindʼs eye (as you look at the pictures of the chest in
Figures-2 and -3) — We can imagine the electrical
difference between LA and RA electrodes as attempting
as much as possible, to isolate the recording of atrial
activity that anatomically lies beneath these 2
electrodes.
With either approach — Try to adjustcalibration to
1mV=20 mm(which is twice normal size) — as this may
maximize atrial size in recording.
Bottom Line: Lewis lead placements are easy to apply.
In a hemodynamically stable patient with a perplexing
arrhythmia for which standard lead placement fails to
reveal atrial activity — We should consider a Lewis Lead
more often than has been done.
