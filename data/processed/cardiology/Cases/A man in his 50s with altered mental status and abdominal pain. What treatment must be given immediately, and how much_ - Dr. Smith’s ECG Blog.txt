must be given immediately, and how much?

A man in his 50s with
altered mental status and
abdominal pain. What
treatment must be given
immediately, and how
much?
 
50 year old male with PMH of ESRD, heart failure, pancreatitis
and previous MI presents to the ED with chief complaint of
epigastric pain. He was described as “altered” with limited
history able to be obtained due to mental status on arrival.
Here is his triage ECG:
What are your initial thoughts? – This EKG looks sinusoidal
and highly concerning for hyperkalemia – Wide complex –
Rate too slow to be Vtach
Patient then divulges that he has not been dialyzed in 5 days, 

hyperkalemic treatment started with albuterol, insulin,
dextrose, loklema and only 2g calcium gluconate.
(Meyers note: this is a common and important initial
mistake, 2g calcium gluconate is not nearly enough for this
peri-arrest hyperkalemia).
Smith: remember that to equal 1 “amp” of Calcium chloride,
you must give 3 of calcium gluconate. That is the molar
equivalent, since the molecular weight of gluconate is far
larger than that of chloride.
Initial K returned at 8.4 mEq/L
Repeat EKG shortly after initial treatment:
This ECG looks even worse than the first! 2gm calcium
gluconate was not enough. This was realized, and next 6
more gm of calcium gluconate were given.
Here is the ECG shortly after that:
As hoped, the QRS has improved somewhat, the rate has
increased, and P waves have become more clear.
The patient underwent dialysis and a repeat EKG was
obtained:

The QRS has narrowed. There is likely underlying LVH, maybe
also LAFB. The most concerning hyperkalemic findings have
resolved.
The patient did well.
See this case of cardiac arrest from HyperK, in which
Pendell gave 13 g of calcium chloride (= 39 g of calcium
gluconate!!)
See this case of Ventricular Tachycardia from Hyperkalemia
which required 15 grams of Ca Gluconate for Stabilization.
In this case, the providers thought that 1 g of calcium
gluconate had fixed the hyperK. But what really happened?
Tachycardia and hyperkalemia. What will happen after
therapy with 1 gram of Ca gluconate and some bicarbonate?
General hyperkalemia cases:
A 50s year old man with lightheadedness and
bradycardia
Patient with Dyspnea. You are handed a triage ECG
interpreted as “normal” by the computer. (Physician also
reads it as normal)
Severe shock, obtunded, and a diagnostic prehospital
ECG. Also: How did this happen?
A woman with near-syncope, bradycardia, and
hypotension
What happens if you do not recognize this ECG instantly?
A woman in her 50s with dyspnea and bradycardia
A patient with cardiac arrest, ROSC, and right bundle
branch block (RBBB).
Is this just right bundle branch block?
Is This a Simple Right Bundle Branch Block?
A 60-something who has non-specific generalized
malaise and is ill appearing.
HyperKalemia with Cardiac Arrest.

Peaked T waves: Hyperacute (STEMI) vs. Early
Repolarizaton vs. Hyperkalemia
What will you do for this altered and bradycardic patient?
I saw this computer “normal” ECG in a stack of ECGs I was
reading
What is the diagnosis?
Found comatose with prehospital ECG showing
“bigeminal PVCs” and “Tachycardia at a rate of 156”
An elderly woman found down with bradycardia and
hypotension
A middle aged man with unwitnessed cardiac arrest
Test almost all of your most important ECG rhythm
interpretation skills with this case.
Sinus rhythm with a new wide complex QRS
This ECG is pathognomonic and you must recognize it.
A Very Wide Complex Tachycardia. What is the Rhythm?
Use Lewis Leads!!
A Very Wide Complex
Are these peaked T-waves the patientʼs baseline T-
waves?
Bradycardia, SOB, in a Dialysis Patient
Cases of hyperkalemia mimicking
OMI:
Acute respiratory distress: Correct interpretation of the
initial and serial ECG findings, with aggressive
management, might have saved his life.
“Steve, what do you think of this ECG in this Cardiac
Arrest Patient?”
Hyperkalemia and ST Segment Elevation, Post 1
A Tragic Case, related to the last post
A patient with chest pain and ST Elevation in V1 and V2
You MUST recognize this pattern, even if it is not common
ST Elevation. What is it?
This ECG Pattern Told the Story When the Patient Could
Not
What are these ST elevations, ST depressions, and tall T
waves diagnostic of?
Another Shark Fin. With a twist.
Do you recognize this ECG yet?
Right Bundle Branch Block with ST Elevation in V1?

ST elevation in aVL with reciprocal ST depression in the
inferior leads
Shock, bradycardia, ST Elevation in V1 and V2. Activate
the Cath Lab?
Another deadly and confusing ECG. Are you still one
of the many people who will be fooled by this ECG, or
do you recognize it instantly?

Todayʼs case by Dr. Meyers brings ECG recorded in Dr. Meyers discussion.

The Need for Instant Recognition and Treatment:

The “ECG picture” in Figure-1 — should instantly tell you
that some toxicity is operative. Once you verify that the
recording speed is 25 mm/sec. (and not 50 mm/sec.) — you
will know that this ECG appearance is the result of some
toxicity (which most commonly is hyperK+) until proven
otherwise because:
i) The QRS is so wide that I donʼt even know how to
measure it.
ii) The QRS is of an amorphous (totally formless)
morphology.
As per Dr. Meyers — the importance of instant recognition of
this “ECG picture” — is not to delay treatment because you
are awaiting lab confirmation of the serum K+ level. Instead —
Immediately treat with IV calcium gluconate (realizing that 2
gm IV Ca++ gluconate may not be enough to stabilize the
patient in this life-threatening situation).
The “beauty” regarding clinical management of this pre-
lethal serum K+ level (as shown above by Dr. Meyers
with sequential ECGs) — is that youʼll know within
minutes if you are giving enough IV Ca++ by progressive
improvement in ECG parameters.
iii) BONUS: Once we learn that todayʼs patient has
ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease), and that he has not
been dialyzed for 5 days — any doubt
