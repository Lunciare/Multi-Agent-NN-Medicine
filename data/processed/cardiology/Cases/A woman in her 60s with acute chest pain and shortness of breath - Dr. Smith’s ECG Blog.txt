A woman in her 60s with
acute chest pain and
shortness of breath
Written by Pendell Meyers
 
A woman in her 60s had acute chest pain and shortness of breath.
EMS arrived and recorded this ECG (no baseline ECG available):
What do you think?
Sinus rhythm, RBBB, and anterolateral OMI pattern with concordant
STE in V2, inappropriate STD (precordial swirl pattern) in V5 anv V6,
HATW in I and aVL, with reciprocal STD and negative HATW in III and
aVF. Proximal LAD OMI would be the most likely cause.
Here is the Queen of Hearts interpretation: STEMI / STEMI equivalent
(OMI) with high confidence

This was expertly recognized, and she bypassed the ED and went
straight to the cath lab, where a proximal total LAD occlusion was
opened.
She did well.
How do we diagnose LAD OMI on the ECG in the presence of Right
Bundle Branch Block?
Here is a nice case of chest pain and RBBB, with references, and
discussion of RBBB and LAD OMI, written mostly by Smith:

patient with prior known right bundle branch block: Another chink in
the armor for the ST-elevation myocardial infarction criteria. Ann

MY Comment, by KEN GRAUER, MD (5/13/2025):
===================================
I reviewed today’s initial ECG knowing only that the patient was a woman
in her 60s who contacted EMS for acute CP (Chest Pain) and shortness
of breath.

For clarity in Figure-1 — I’ve reproduced and have labeled
this initial ECG.
Interpretation of ECG #1:
As per Dr. Meyers, in this 60s woman with new CP — the ECG in Figure-
1 suggests acute LAD OMI until proven otherwise:
The rate is a bit fast (about 100/minute).
There is RBBB (Right Bundle Branch Block).
There are obvious hyperacute ST-T waves in leads I and aVL —
as well as an unusual biphasic ST-T wave in lead V2 (double RED
arrows in this lead — with the ST elevation in the initial part of the
ST segment clearly abnormal given the RBBB that typically results
in ST-T wave depression).
There is equally marked reciprocal ST depression in each of
the inferior leads (II,III,aVF) — as well as in lateral chest leads
V5,V6.
Figure-1: I have labeled the initial ECG in today’s case.
BUT — Is there WPW?
And then I looked closer at the P wave, PR interval and QRS complex
in leads V1,V2,V3 (See BLUE arrows in these leads in Figure-2, in which
I have magnified selected leads from ECG #1).
Doesn’t the PR interval in these anterior chest leads look short? —
with in addition, slurring of the initial upward slope of the
QRS (simulating a delta wave?).
KEY Point: Regardless of whether or not today’s patient has WPW
— the magnitude of hyperacute ST-T wave changes in multiple
leads in this 60s woman with new CP merits prompt cath to define
the anatomy.
WPW is notorious for its potential to manifest pseudo-
infarction patterns. And, in those uncommon situations in which a
patient with WPW does develop acute MI — alterations in the
widened QRS complex and resultant changes in ST-T wave
morphology often serve to mask acute ECG findings, making it
much more difficult to recognize acute MI on the ECG of a patient
with WPW.

The above said — at times the magnitude of ST-T wave abnormality
resulting from an acute MI will be marked enough to suggest an
acute event despite the associated presence of WPW (See the July
11, 2014 post — and My Comment at the bottom of the page in
the October 13, 2022 post for illustration of these concepts
regarding pseudo-infarction vs recognition of acute MI in association
with WPW).
Figure-2: I’ve magnified selected leads from ECG #1.
WPW is Unlikely . . .
While important to consider the possibility of WPW from the appearance of
atrial activity in relation to neighboring QRS complexes in leads V1,V2,V3
— I do not think the ECG in Figure-1 represents WPW.
While I had no idea about the medical history of today’s patient at
the time I reviewed ECG #1 — it’s helpful to keep in mind that
discovery of WPW for the 1st time at age 60+ would be rare.
While the QRS complex in lead V1 of Figure-1 is
monophasic (ie, lacking the triphasic rsR’ morphology characteristic
of typical RBBB) — there is a slender initial R wave, followed by a
wide, terminal S wave in left-sided leads I and V6 — such that QRS
morphology in today’s 12-lead tracing is consistent with RBBB.
The magnified view in Figure-2 — suggests that the P wave in lead
II is not upright (RED arrow in this lead). The P wave is also
negative in lead III — and positive in lead aVL (PINK arrows in
these leads) — which suggests a non-sinus rhythm. As a result —
the PR interval might not be short after all, if the site of the atrial
impulse arises from a site close to the AV node.
While the number of leads that manifest definite delta waves in a
patient with WPW is variable — most leads in Figure-1 do not seem
to have delta waves.
Finally, looking closer — it may be that delta waves are
simulated (and not present) in leads V1 and V3 because the initial
part of the QRS lies near the baseline.
Bottom Line:

Failure to consider WPW (especially in the presence of monophasic
QRS widening in lead V1 with uncertain atrial activity, and uncertain
PR interval) — will result in overlooking WPW when it does occur.
Acutely, in this 60s woman with new CP — regardless of whether or
not WPW is present, prompt cath is indicated because of the
extreme ST-T wave changes in multiple leads that would be
abnormal even if WPW was present.
There is time to determine if today’s patient has WPW (ie, Review of
this patient’s previous medical history and prior ECGs should be
enlightening). In contrast — the decision to perform prompt cath is
time dependent. Fortunately, this patient’s providers immediately
recognized the acute ECG findings and expedited cardiac cath —
that confirmed proximal total LAD occlusion, which was
successfully stented.
