also be associated with other causes such as cocaine use. Cardiac chest pain can also be precipitated by anemia, bradycardias or tachycardias. Classification • Traditionally, ACS has been classified into: • Unstable angina (UA) • Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) • ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). • According to this classification, unstable angina was defined as clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of an elevated troponin level. • However, the widespread use of the high-sensitivity troponin assays made UA and NSTEMI indistinguishable since it was shown that almost all patients previously named UA actually have increased high-sensitivity troponin levels. • In other words, it is very unlikely that patients with clinical and ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia have normal high-sensitivity troponin levels. [1] • Consequently, in recent guidelines, the acute coronary syndromes are classified into two broad categories: [2] [3] • Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), encompassing : • Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) • Unstable angina • ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) • Therefore, acute coronary syndromes can be classified as follows: Acute coronary syndromes Non-ST-elevation acute coronary ST elevation myocardial syndrome (NTE-ACS) infarction Non-ST-segment elevation Unstable angina myocardial infarction Defining Lesion Severity.
