In high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS and CKD, it is reasonable to perform coronary angiography and revascularization, with adequate measures to reduce the risk of AKI (Level of Evidence B-NR)". " 4. In low-risk patients with NSTE-ACS and CKD, it is reasonable to weigh the risk of coronary angiography and revascularization against the potential benefit(Level of Evidence C-EO)'' [4] Class III (No Benefit) "5. In asymptomatic patients with stable CAD and CKD, routine angiography and revascularization are not recommended if there is no compelling indication. (Level of Evidence:B-R) " [4] Revascularization in Patients Before Noncardiac Surgery Class III (No Benefit) "1. In patients with non–left main or noncomplex CAD who is undergoing noncardiac surgery, routine coronary revascularization is not recommended solely to reduce perioperative cardiovascular events. (Level of Evidence:B-R) " [4] Revascularization in Patients to Reduce Ventricular Arrhythmias Class I "1. In patients with ventricular fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), or cardiac arrest, revascularization of significant CAD is recommended to improve survival.

In patients with CAD and suspected scar-mediated sustained monomorphic VT, revascularization is not recommended for the sole purpose of preventing
