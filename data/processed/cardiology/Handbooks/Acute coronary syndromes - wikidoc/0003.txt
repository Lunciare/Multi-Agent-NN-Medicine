Therefore, acute coronary syndromes can be classified as follows: Acute coronary syndromes Non-ST-elevation acute coronary ST elevation myocardial syndrome (NTE-ACS) infarction Non-ST-segment elevation Unstable angina myocardial infarction Defining Lesion Severity. 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization. (Please do not edit). Angiography to Define Anatomy and Assess Lesion Severity The standard procedure for defining coronary anatomy and assessing the degree of coronary artery stenosis is still coronary angiography[4]. • Severe Stenosis: diameter stenosis severity of 70% for non-left main disease and 50% for left main illness [4]. • A diameter stenosis severity of 40% to 69% is referred to as an angiographically intermediate coronary stenosis, and it usually necessitates further examination to determine its physiological significance [4]. • Longer lesions may cause more ischemia than a single severe lesion [4]. Causes • ACS is characterized by a sudden imbalance between myocardial oxygen consumption and demand, which is usually the result of coronary artery obstruction.
