The most common symptom prompting diagnosis of ACS is chest pain, often radiating to the left arm or angle of the jaw, pressure-like in character, and associated with nausea and sweating. ACS should be distinguished from stable angina, which is chest pain that develops during exertion and resolves at rest. Traditionally, ACS has been classified into non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and unstable angina. Unstable angina is differentiated from NSTEMI by the absence of elevated cardiac biomarkers. The basic pathology in both conditions involves a non-occlusive thrombus formation from a previously disrupted atherosclerotic plaque causing an inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle. Though ACS is usually associated with coronary thrombosis, it can also be associated with other causes such as cocaine use. Cardiac chest pain can also be precipitated by anemia, bradycardias or tachycardias. Classification • Traditionally, ACS has been classified into:
