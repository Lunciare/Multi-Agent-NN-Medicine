Acute coronary syndromes

[4] Class IIa " 2. In patients who require revascularization for multivessel CAD with complex or diffuse CAD (eg, SYNTAX score >33), it is reasonable to choose CABG over PCI to confer a survival advantage (Level of Evidence B-R)". [4] Patients with Diabetes Class I "1. In patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD with the involvement of the LAD, who are appropriate candidates for CABG, CABG (with a LIMA to the LAD) is recommended in preference to PCI to reduce mortality and repeat revascularizations(Level of Evidence: A) " [4] Class IIa " 2. In patients with diabetes who have multivessel CAD amenable to PCI and an indication for revascularization and are poor candidates for surgery, PCI can be useful to reduce long-term ischemic outcomes (Level of Evidence B-NR)". [4] Class IIb " 3. In patients with diabetes who have left main stenosis and low- or intermediate-complexity CAD in the rest of the coronary anatomy, PCI may be considered an alternative to CABG to reduce major adverse cardiovascular out-comes. (Level of Evidence B-R)". [4] Patients With Previous CABG Class IIa " 1. In patients with previous CABG with a patent LIMA to the LAD who need repeat revascularization, if PCI is
