glycosuria and lowering plasma glucose; they may also have effects on the myocardium and vasculature. These medications had previously been shown to prevent the onset of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. The SGLT2i dapagliflozin and empagliflozin were subsequently shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HRrEF who are symptomatic (New York Heart Association Class II to IV). Thus, SGLT2i therapy is recommended for all HRrEF patients with symptoms. SGLT2i therapy also appears beneficial in patients with HRpEF. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin may be given 10 mg orally once a day. With treatment, there is a mild (10 to 15%) reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which does not progress, glucosuria, and a small reduction in body weight. Risks include genital fungal infection, and in patients with diabetes, a very small risk of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. These medications are generally 2 not indicated in patients with type I diabetes, low blood pressure, or low eGFR (< 30 mL/min/1.73 m ). Digoxin Digoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase), causing weak positive inotropy, reduces sympathetic activity, blocks the atrioventricular node (slowing the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or prolonging the PR interval in sinus rhythm),
