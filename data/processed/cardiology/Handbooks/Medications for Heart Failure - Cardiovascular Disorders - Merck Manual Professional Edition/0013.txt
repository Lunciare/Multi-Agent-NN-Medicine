Medications for Heart Failure

sodium-potassium pump (Na+, K+-ATPase), causing weak positive inotropy, reduces sympathetic activity, blocks the atrioventricular node (slowing the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or prolonging the PR interval in sinus rhythm), reduces vasoconstriction, and improves renal blood flow. Digoxin has no proven survival benefit but, when used in addition to standard guideline-directed medical therapy, may help control symptoms and reduce the likelihood of hospitalization in patients with HFrEF (1, 2). Digoxin may also be used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and both HFrEF and HFpEF. 5/9 In patients with normal renal function, digoxin, 0.125 to 0.25 mg orally once a day depending on age, sex, and body size, achieves full digitalization in about 1 week (5 half-lives). More rapid digitalization can be achieved but, unlike in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, there is typically little reason to rapidly digitalize (ie, digoxin load) patients with heart failure. Thus, simply starting digoxin at 0.125 mg orally once a day (in patients with normal renal function) or digoxin 0.125 mg orally every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (in patients with abnormal renal function) is sufficient in patients with heart failure. Digoxin toxicity is a concern given its narrow therapeutic window, especially in
