Medications for Heart Failure

ACE inhibitors are not typically initiated unless they are already being used for other indications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy. The starting dose typically should be low (usually one-fourth to one-half of the target dose depending on blood pressure and renal function); the dose is gradually adjusted upward over 8 weeks as tolerated, then continued indefinitely. Usual target doses of representative medications include enalapril 10 to 20 mg twice a day, lisinopril 20 to 30 mg once a day, and ramipril 5 mg twice a day; there are many others. 3/9 Serum electrolytes and renal function should be measured before an ACE inhibitor is initiated, at 1 month, and after each significant increase in dose or change in clinical condition. If dehydration or poor renal function due to acute illness develops, the ACE inhibitor dose may need to be reduced or temporarily discontinued. Contraindications include plasma creatinine > 2.8 mg/dL [> 250 micromol/L], bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, or previous angioedema due to ACE inhibitors. The hypotensive effect (more marked in patients with hyponatremia or volume depletion), if troublesome, can often be minimized by separating administration of other blood pressure–lowering medications, reducing
