patients with chronic HFrEF, including those with severe symptoms. After initial treatment, heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption decrease, and stroke volume and filling pressure are unchanged. With the slower heart rate, diastolic function improves. Ventricular filling returns to a more normal pattern (increasing in early diastole), which appears less restrictive. Improved myocardial function is measurable in some patients after 6 to 12 months but may take longer; ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac output increase, and LV filling pressure decreases. Exercise capacity improves. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), beta-blockers are not generally recommended, although they can be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or for control of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease or prior myocardial infarction (1, 2). The starting dose should be low (one-fourth of the target daily dose), then the dose is gradually increased over 8 weeks as tolerated. The acute negative inotropic effects of beta-blockade may initially cause cardiac depression and fluid retention. In such cases, a temporary increase in diuretic dose and slower upward titration of the beta-blocker dose is warranted. Tolerance may improve over time, and efforts should be made to reach target
