each increase in infusion rate. Loop diuretics (particularly when used in combination with thiazide diuretics) may cause hypovolemia with hypotension, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypokalemia. The dose of diuretic required acutely can usually be gradually reduced; the target is the lowest dose that maintains stable weight and controls symptoms. When heart failure improves, the diuretic may be stopped if other medications improve heart function and relieve symptoms of heart failure. Using diuretic doses that are larger than required lowers cardiac output, impairs renal function, causes hypokalemia, and increases mortality. Serum electrolytes and renal function are monitored, initially daily (when diuretics are given IV) and subsequently as needed, particularly after a dose increase. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) receptor antagonists are not frequently used though they may be helpful in cases of severe refractory hyponatremia in patients with heart failure. Inotropes Various positive inotropic medications have been evaluated in heart failure but, except for digoxin, they increase mortality risk. These medications can be grouped by mode of action as: Adrenergic (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, dopamine) Nonadrenergic (enoximoneand milrinone [phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitors], levosimendan [calcium sensitizer]) Inotropic support is important for treatment of acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock. The choice of inotrope depends on
