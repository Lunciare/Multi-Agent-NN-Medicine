are: Furosemide 20 to 40 mg orally once a day or twice a day Bumetanide 0.5 to 1.0 mg orally once a day Torsemide 10 to 20 mg orally once a day If needed, loop diuretics can be titrated up to doses of furosemide 120 mg orally twice a day, bumetanide 2 mg orally twice a day, and torsemide 40 mg orally twice a day based on response and renal function. Bumetanide and torsemide have better bioavailability than furosemide. If patients are 6/9 switched between different loop diuretics, they should be placed on equivalent doses. Furosemide 40 mg is equivalent to bumetanide 1 mg, and both are equivalent to torsemide 20 mg. In refractory cases, IV loop diuretics or metolazone 2.5 to 10 mg orally can be used for an additive effect. IV infusion of furosemide (5 to 10 mg/hour) or other loop diuretics may be helpful in selected patients with severe pulmonary edema. A bolus dose of loop diuretic should be given before starting an IV infusion and before each increase in infusion rate. Loop diuretics (particularly when used in combination with thiazide diuretics) may cause hypovolemia with hypotension, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypokalemia. The dose of diuretic required
