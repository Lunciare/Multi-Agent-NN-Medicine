to ACE inhibitors. The hypotensive effect (more marked in patients with hyponatremia or volume depletion), if troublesome, can often be minimized by separating administration of other blood pressure–lowering medications, reducing the dose of concomitant diuretics, using a longer acting ACE inhibitor (eg, perindopril), or giving the dose at bedtime. ACE inhibitors often cause mild to moderate reversible serum creatinine elevation due to vasodilation of the efferent glomerular arteriole. An initial 20 to 30% increase in creatinine is not a reason to stop the medication but does require closer monitoring, slower increases in dose, reduction in diuretic dose, or avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because aldosterone’s effect is reduced, potassium retention (hyperkalemia) may result, especially in patients receiving potassium supplements. Cough occurs in many patients, probably because bradykinin accumulates, but other causes of cough should also be considered. If cough limits use, an ARB is a reasonable alternative. Occasionally, rash or dysgeusia occurs. Angioedema is rare but can be life threatening and is a contraindication to ACE inhibitors. Alternatively, ARBs can be used, although rarely cross-reactivity is reported. Both are contraindicated in pregnancy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) ARBs target the angiotensin II receptor rather than the angiotensin converting enzymes.
