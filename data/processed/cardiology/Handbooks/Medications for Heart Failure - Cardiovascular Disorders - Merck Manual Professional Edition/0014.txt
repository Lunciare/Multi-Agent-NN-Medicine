every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (in patients with abnormal renal function) is sufficient in patients with heart failure. Digoxin toxicity is a concern given its narrow therapeutic window, especially in patients with renal dysfunction and perhaps in women. These patients may need a lower oral dose, as may older patients, patients with a low lean body mass, and patients also taking amiodarone. The most important toxic effects are life-threatening arrhythmias (eg, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, complete atrioventricular block). Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia in the presence of atrial fibrillation, and hyperkalemia are serious signs of digitalis toxicity. Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, confusion, amblyopia, and, rarely, xerophthalmia may also occur. If hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (often due to diuretic use) is present, lower doses and serum levels can still cause toxicity; thus, electrolyte levels should be monitored in patients taking diuretics and digoxin. Diuretics While spironolactone is recommended for all patients with HRrEF and used for many with HRpEF, additional diuretics are given to patients with heart failure (regardless of underlying ejection fraction) who have current or previous volume overload; dose is adjusted to the lowest dose that stabilizes weight and relieves symptoms (1, 2). Chronic diuretics may be scheduled or
