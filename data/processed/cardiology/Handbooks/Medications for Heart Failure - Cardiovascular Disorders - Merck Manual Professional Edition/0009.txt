Medications for Heart Failure

can be used, although rarely cross-reactivity is reported. Both are contraindicated in pregnancy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) ARBs target the angiotensin II receptor rather than the angiotensin converting enzymes. They are less likely to cause cough and angioedema than ACE inhibitors, and may be used when these adverse effects prohibit ACE inhibitor use (Heidenreich). In patients with HFrEF, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely equally effective. In patients with HFpEF, ARBs (as with ACE inhibitors) are not typically initiated unless they are already being used for other indications such as hypertension, diabetic kidney disease, or microalbuminuria. Usual oral target doses are valsartan 160 mg twice a day, candesartan 32 mg once a day, and losartan 50 to 100 mg once a day. Introduction, upward dose adjustment, and monitoring of ARBs and ACE inhibitors are similar. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs can cause reversible renal dysfunction, and the dose may need to be reduced or stopped temporarily during an acute dehydrating illness. Adding an ARB to a regimen of an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is unlikely to be helpful and should be avoided given the risk of hyperkalemia. If a patient who is taking an ACE inhibitor or
