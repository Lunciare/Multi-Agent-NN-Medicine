cases, a temporary increase in diuretic dose and slower upward titration of the beta-blocker dose is warranted. Tolerance may improve over time, and efforts should be made to reach target doses. Usual oral target doses are carvedilol 25 mg twice a day (50 mg twice a day for patients ≥ 85 kg), bisoprolol 10 mg once a day, or metoprolol succinate (extended-release) 200 mg once a day. Renin-angiotensin system inhibiting medications Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) ARNIs are a combination medication for the treatment of heart failure. They include an ARB and a neprilysin inhibitor (eg, sacubitril). The ARB portion blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis at the level of the angiotensin II receptor. Neprilysin is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of vasoactive substances such as brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP) and other peptides. By inhibiting the breakdown of BNP and other beneficial vasoactive peptides, these medications lower blood pressure, decrease afterload, and enhance natriuresis. Because neprilysin inhibitors increase BNP levels, NTproBNP levels (which are not increased by the medication) should be used instead to help diagnose and manage heart failure. In patients with HFrEF, the ARNI sacubitril/valsartan reduces all-cause mortality and should be considered in all patients with HFrEF (1, 2).
