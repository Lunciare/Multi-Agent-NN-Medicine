that acts at the sinus node f to slow the heart rate. Since these channels are present primarily in cardiac pacemaker cells, these medications are not useful for treatment in patients who are not in sinus rhythm. Ivabradine is recommended for use in patients with HFrEF who have symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart 7/9 Association Class II or III), normal sinus rhythm, and heart rate > 70 beats/minute despite guideline- directed medical therapy (at target beta-blocker dose or cannot tolerate a further increase in beta- blocker dose) (1, 2). Initial dose of ivabradine is 2.5 to 5 mg orally twice a day, titrated at 2-week intervals to a heart rate of 50 to 60 beats/minute; maximum dose is 7.5 mg twice a day. Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator Vericiguat is an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that enhances the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) pathway and sensitizes soluble guanylate cyclase to endogenous nitric oxide, resulting in pulmonary vasodilation. Vericiguat is an option to improve outcomes for patients with HFrEF with worsening heart failure symptoms despite maximal guideline-directed medical therapy, with the potential to reduce mortality or hospitalization. Vasodilators Hydralazine and nitrates (such as isosorbide dinitrate) are direct vasodilators, which can improve
