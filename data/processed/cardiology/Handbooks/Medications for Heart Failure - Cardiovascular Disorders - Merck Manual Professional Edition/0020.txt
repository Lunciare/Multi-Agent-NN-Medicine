Medications for Heart Failure

heart failure symptoms despite maximal guideline-directed medical therapy, with the potential to reduce mortality or hospitalization. Vasodilators Hydralazine and nitrates (such as isosorbide dinitrate) are direct vasodilators, which can improve hemodynamics, reduce valvular regurgitation, and increase exercise capacity without causing significant renal impairment. The combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may be considered in patients with HRrEF who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (usually because of significant renal dysfunction) (1, 2). Additionally, in patients of African ancestry, this combination, when added to standard therapy, may reduce mortality and hospitalization, and improve quality of life. When used instead of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, hydralazine is started at 25 mg orally 4 times a day and increased every 3 to 5 days to a target total dose of 300 mg/day; however, many patients cannot tolerate > 200 mg/day because of hypotension. Isosorbide dinitrate is started at 20 mg orally 3 times a day (with a 12-hour nitrate-free interval) and increased to a target of 40 to 50 mg 3 times a day. When added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, hydralazine plus nitrate therapy is started at 37.5 mg and isosorbide dinitrate at 20 mg orally 3 times a
