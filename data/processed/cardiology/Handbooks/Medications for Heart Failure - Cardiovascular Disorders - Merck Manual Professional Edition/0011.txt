heart failure therapy in patients at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum and are also routinely used in patients with preexisting hypertension or coronary artery disease. Typical medications include spironolactone 25 to 50 mg orally once a day and eplerenone (which does not cause gynecomastia in males as spironolactone can). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can reduce mortality, including from sudden death, in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% and chronic heart failure, or acute heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction. Potassium supplements should be stopped. Serum potassium and creatinine should be checked every 1 to 2 weeks for the first 4 to 6 weeks and after dose changes. Dose is lowered if potassium is between 5.0 and 5.5 mEq/L ( 5.5 mmol/L) and stopped if potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L (5.5 mmol/L), if creatinine increases above 2.5 mg/dL (220 micromol/L), or if ECG changes of hyperkalemia are present. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) SGLT2i were originally used in treatment of diabetes to block glucose reabsorption, thus causing glycosuria and lowering plasma glucose; they may also have effects on the myocardium and vasculature. These medications had previously been shown to prevent the onset of heart failure in patients
