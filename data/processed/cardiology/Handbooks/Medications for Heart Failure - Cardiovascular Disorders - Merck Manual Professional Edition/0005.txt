Medications for Heart Failure

used instead to help diagnose and manage heart failure. In patients with HFrEF, the ARNI sacubitril/valsartan reduces all-cause mortality and should be considered in all patients with HFrEF (1, 2). It is preferred over an ACE inhibitor or ARB if tolerated, and evidence supports early transition of patients from an ACE inhibitor or ARB to ARNI, even in the hospital setting. In patients with HFpEF, sacubitril/valsartan may be considered, particularly in specific subgroups (women and patients with left ventricular ejection fraction below 57%). The starting dose of sacubitril/valsartan is 49/51 mg orally twice a day for patients previously taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB, and 24/26 mg for patients previously taking a low dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB (eg, ≤ 10 mg enalapril daily) or in those patients who have not taken an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or who have low or borderline blood pressure. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued 36 hours before initiation of sacubitril/valsartan. Patients previously taking an ARB can simply switch to sacubitril/valsartan without a washout period. Complications associated with use of ARNI include hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, and angioedema. Sacubitril is coupled with valsartan (an ARB) because of the increased risk of angioedema
