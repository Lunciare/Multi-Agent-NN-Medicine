Medications for Heart Failure

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the body due to a structural and or functional cardiac abnormality, leading to low cardiac output, elevated ventricular filling pressure, or both (see Heart Failure). The primary medications for long-term management and improved survival in patients with heart failure, particularly heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, are: Beta-blockers Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) (or angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists Additional medication classes used in patients with heart failure include: Digoxin Diuretics Inotopes Sinus node inhibitors Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator Vasodilators (nitrates) All patients should be given clear and explicit information about their medications, including the following: The importance of timely prescription renewal The importance of adherence to therapy How to recognize adverse effects When to contact their physician (See also Acute Heart Failure - Treatment, Chronic Heart Failure - Treatment, and Right Heart Failure for more information about medication selection.) Classes of Medications for Heart Failure Beta-blockers Beta-blockers act by competitively inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors. Bisoprolol and metoprolol are considered cardioselective beta-blockers, primarily acting on beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol, a
