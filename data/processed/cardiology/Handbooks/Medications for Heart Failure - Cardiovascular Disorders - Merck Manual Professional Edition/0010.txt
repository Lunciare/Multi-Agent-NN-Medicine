Medications for Heart Failure

inhibitor, beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is unlikely to be helpful and should be avoided given the risk of hyperkalemia. If a patient who is taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB still has symptoms, an mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist should be started, and/or an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) should be used. ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (aldosterone antagonists) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists block aldosterone receptors in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney. They are considered potassium-sparing diuretics due to their relatively weak diuretic effect and the fact that, unlike most other diuretics, they do not waste serum potassium. 4/9 For patients with heart failure, these agents offer blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that is complementary to the mechanism of ACE inhibitors and ARBs. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA, also termed aldosterone antagonists) is recommended for patients with HRrEF, particularly those with symptoms (New York Heart Association Class II to IV) (1, 2). In patients with HRpEF, MRAs appear to have the most benefit as primary heart failure therapy in patients at the lower end of the ejection fraction spectrum and are also routinely used in patients with preexisting hypertension or coronary artery disease.
