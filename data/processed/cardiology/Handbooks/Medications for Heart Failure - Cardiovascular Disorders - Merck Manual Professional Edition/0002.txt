Medications for Heart Failure

selection.) Classes of Medications for Heart Failure Beta-blockers Beta-blockers act by competitively inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors. Bisoprolol and metoprolol are considered cardioselective beta-blockers, primarily acting on beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker, is also a vasodilator with alpha-blocking and antioxidant effects. Beta- blockers produce a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect that reduces myocardial oxygen demand, modestly reduces left ventricular afterload, and moderates the release of catecholamines in response to stress. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), beta-blockers, unless otherwise contraindicated (by asthma, second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block, or previous significant intolerance), are a mainstay of treatment (1, 2). In acute decompensated HFrEF, beta-blockers are best started once the patient has stabilized and has no evidence of pulmonary congestion. For patients with HFrEF and acute heart failure exacerbation who are already taking a beta-blocker, the dose should not be decreased or stopped unless necessary. Specific beta-blockers such as carvedilol and metoprolol succinate (ie, long-acting metoprolol) improve left ventricular ejection fraction, survival, and other major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic HFrEF, including those with severe symptoms. After initial treatment, heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption decrease, and stroke volume and filling pressure are unchanged. With the slower
