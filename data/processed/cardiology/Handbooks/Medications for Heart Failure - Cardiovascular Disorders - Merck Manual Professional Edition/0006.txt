a washout period. Complications associated with use of ARNI include hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency, and angioedema. Sacubitril is coupled with valsartan (an ARB) because of the increased risk of angioedema with the use of sacubitril alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor. For this reason, combined ACE inhibitor plus ARNI therapy is absolutely contraindicated. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors All patients with HFrEF should be given oral ACE inhibitors unless contraindicated. ACE inhibitors reduce production of angiotensin II and breakdown of bradykinin, mediators that affect the sympathetic nervous system, endothelial function, vascular tone, and myocardial performance. Hemodynamic effects include: Arterial and venous vasodilation Sustained decreases in LV filling pressure during rest and exercise Decreased systemic vascular resistance Favorable effects on ventricular remodeling ACE inhibitors prolong survival and reduce hospitalizations due to heart failure (1, 2). In patients with HRrEF, their current role is as a second-line agent for those who cannot tolerate ARNi or those for whom ARNi is not available, cost-prohibitive, or otherwise unfeasible. For patients with HRpEF, ACE inhibitors are not typically initiated unless they are already being used for other indications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy. The starting dose typically should be low (usually
