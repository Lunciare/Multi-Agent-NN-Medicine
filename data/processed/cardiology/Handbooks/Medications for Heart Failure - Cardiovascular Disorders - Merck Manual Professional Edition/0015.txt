Medications for Heart Failure

ejection fraction) who have current or previous volume overload; dose is adjusted to the lowest dose that stabilizes weight and relieves symptoms (1, 2). Chronic diuretics may be scheduled or used as needed by patients based on peripheral edema or changes in weight. Diuretics are a primary therapy in symptomatic HRpEF. They are used with caution in right heart failure, particularly in cor pulmonale, due to sensitivity to small changes in preload. Loop diuretics should be used initially for control of volume overload, but their dose should be reduced when possible in favor of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Thiazide diuretics are not normally used alone unless being given as treatment of hypertension; however, a thiazide diuretic may be added to a loop diuretic for additional diuresis and to reduce the loop diuretic dose. Hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and chlorthalidone can be used in this manner. Commonly used loop diuretics include furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide. The starting dose of these medications depends on whether the patient has previously received loop diuretics. Common starting doses are: Furosemide 20 to 40 mg orally once a day or twice a day Bumetanide 0.5 to 1.0 mg orally once a day Torsemide 10 to 20 mg orally once
