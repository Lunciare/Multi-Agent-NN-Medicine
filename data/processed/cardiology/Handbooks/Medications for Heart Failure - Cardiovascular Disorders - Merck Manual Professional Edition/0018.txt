dopamine) Nonadrenergic (enoximoneand milrinone [phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitors], levosimendan [calcium sensitizer]) Inotropic support is important for treatment of acute heart failure with cardiogenic shock. The choice of inotrope depends on availability, local practice, and afterload. For example, in a patient with severely reduced LV ejection fraction, peripheral vasoconstriction, and high or normal blood pressure, initial inotropic support may be combined with an IV vasodilator such as nitroprusside, and then transitioned to milrinone (which has mild vasodilatory effects). On the other hand, a patient with reduced ejection fraction and hypotension with peripheral vasodilation may require an inotrope with vasopressor effects (norepinephrine, high dose epinephrine), or a combination of an inotrope and a pure vasoconstricting agent. Synergy can be obtained by using both an adrenergic and nonadrenergic inotrope. In patients with advanced (Stage D) HRpEF refractory to standard therapies, long-term continuous inotropic infusions may be used as a bridge to transplantation or as palliative therapy (2). Sinus node inhibitors Ivabradine is an I channel (inward "funny" channel in the sinus node) blocker that acts at the sinus node f to slow the heart rate. Since these channels are present primarily in cardiac pacemaker cells, these medications are not useful for treatment in
