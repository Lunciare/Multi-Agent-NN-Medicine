Cardiac Imaging Tests

a gadolinium contrast agent, is used to assess blood volumes of interest (eg, blood vessels in the chest or abdomen); all blood flow can be assessed simultaneously. MRA can be used to detect aneurysms, stenosis, or occlusions in the carotid, coronary, renal, or peripheral arteries. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) can be used as an alternative to ultrasonography to detect deep venous thrombosis; however, MRV is less well studied and more expensive than ultrasonography. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Cardiac Diagnosis PET with CT (PET-CT) can demonstrate myocardial perfusion and metabolism and is increasingly being used to assess myocardial viability or to assess myocardial perfusion after an equivocal single-photon emission CT (SPECT) study or in patients with severe obesity. Perfusion agents are radioactive nuclides that are used to trace the amount of blood flow entering a specific region and are therefore useful in unmasking myocardial perfusion deficits not evident at rest. They include carbon-11 (C-11) carbon dioxide, oxygen-15 (O-15) water, nitrogen-13 (N-13) ammonia, and rubidium-82 (Rb-82). Only Rb-82 does not require an on-site cyclotron. Metabolic agents are radioactive analogs of normal biologic substances that are taken up and metabolized by cells. They include Fluorine-18 (F-18)–labeled deoxyglucose (FDG) C-11 acetate FDG detects
