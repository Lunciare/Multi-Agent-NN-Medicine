are indicated by the green and blue arrows respectively 5/9 and the right coronary artery is indicated by the purple arrow. Contrast CT Showing Normal Coronary Arteries – Slide 6 This contrast CT shows normal coronary arteries. The left main is indicated by the red arrow. The left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries are indicated by the green and blue arrows respectively and the right coronary artery is indicated by the purple arrow. Contrast CT Showing Coronary Artery Disease IMAGE Electron beam CT, formerly called ultrafast CT or cine CT, unlike conventional CT, does not use a moving x-ray source and target. Instead, the direction of the x-ray beam is guided by a magnetic field and detected by an array of stationary detectors. Because mechanical motion is not required, images can be acquired in a fraction of a second (and recorded at a specific point in the cardiac cycle). Electron beam CT is used primarily to detect and quantify coronary artery calcification, an early sign of atherosclerosis. However, spatial resolution is poor and the equipment cannot be used for noncardiac disorders, so newer standard CT techniques are becoming preferred for cardiac use. 6/9 Multidetector CT (MDCT), with ≥ 64
