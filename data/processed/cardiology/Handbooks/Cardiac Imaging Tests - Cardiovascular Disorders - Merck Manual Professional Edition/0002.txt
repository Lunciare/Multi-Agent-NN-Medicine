a starting point in a cardiac diagnosis and should always be done when a diagnosis of heart failure is considered. Posteroanterior and lateral views provide a gross view of atrial and ventricular size and shape and pulmonary vasculature, but additional tests are almost always required for precise characterization of cardiac structure and function. 1/9 Chest Radiograph (Prosthetic Heart Valve) IMAGE ZEPHYR/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Computed Tomography (CT) in Cardiac Diagnosis Spiral (helical) CT may be used to evaluate pericarditis, congenital cardiac disorders (especially abnormal arteriovenous connections), disorders of the great vessels (eg, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection), cardiac tumors, acute pulmonary embolism, chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Noncontrast CT can be used to look for coronary artery calcification; the calcium load is sometimes used to refine estimates of cardiac risk. The use of CT to evaluate most other cardiac conditions requires a radiopaque contrast agent, which may limit its use in patients with renal impairment. 2/9 Cardiac CT Angiogram IMAGE LIVING ART ENTERPRISES, LLC/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Abnormal CT of the Heart Noncontrast CT Showing Coronary Artery Calcification This image shows dense coronary calcifications in the left main (red arrow) and left anterior descending artery (green arrow). 3/9 Cardiac
