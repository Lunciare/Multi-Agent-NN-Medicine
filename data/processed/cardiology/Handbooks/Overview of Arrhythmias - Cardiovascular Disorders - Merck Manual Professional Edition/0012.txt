jugular venous pulse. There are few other physical findings of arrhythmias. Diagnosis of Arrhythmias ECG Ambulatory rhythm monitoring (eg, Holter, event, or other monitors) 8/14 History and physical examination may detect an arrhythmia and suggest possible causes, but diagnosis requires a 12-lead ECG or, less reliably, a rhythm strip, preferably obtained during symptoms to establish the relationship between symptoms and rhythm. The ECG is approached systematically; calipers measure intervals and identify subtle irregularities. The key diagnostic features are Rate and regularity of atrial activation Rate and regularity of ventricular activation The relationship between the two Irregular activation signals are classified as regularly irregular or irregularly irregular (no detectable pattern). Regular irregularity is intermittent irregularity in an otherwise regular rhythm (eg, premature beats) or a predictable pattern of irregularity (eg, recurrent relationships between groups of beats, as in sinus arrhythmia and second-degree heart blocks). A narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 seconds) indicates a supraventricular origin (above the His bundle bifurcation). A wide QRS complex (≥ 0.12 seconds) indicates a ventricular origin (below the His bundle bifurcation), or a supraventricular rhythm conducted with an intraventricular conduction defect or with ventricular preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ambulatory rhythm monitoring methods such as Holter
