and after partial but incomplete repolarization, a subsequent depolarization is possible but occurs slowly (relative refractory period). There are 2 general types of cardiac tissue: Fast-channel tissues Slow-channel tissues Fast-channel tissues (working atrial and ventricular myocytes, His-Purkinje system) have a high density of fast sodium channels and action potentials characterized by Little or no spontaneous diastolic depolarization (and thus very slow rates of pacemaker activity) Very rapid initial depolarization rates (and thus rapid conduction velocity) Loss of refractoriness coincident with repolarization (and thus short refractory periods and the ability to conduct repetitive impulses at high frequencies) Slow-channel tissues (SA and AV nodes) have a low density of fast sodium channels and action potentials characterized by More rapid spontaneous diastolic depolarization (and thus more rapid rates of pacemaker activity) Slow initial depolarization rates (and thus slow conduction velocity) Loss of refractoriness that is delayed after repolarization (and thus long refractory periods and the inability to conduct repetitive impulses at high frequencies) Normally, the SA node has the most rapid rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization, so its cells produce spontaneous action potentials at a higher frequency than other tissues. Thus, the SA node is the dominant automatic tissue (pacemaker) in a normal
