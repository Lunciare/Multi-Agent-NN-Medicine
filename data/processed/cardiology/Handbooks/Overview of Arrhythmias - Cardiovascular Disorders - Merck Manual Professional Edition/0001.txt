Overview of Arrhythmias

The heart beats in a regular, coordinated way because electrical impulses generated and spread by myocytes with unique electrical properties trigger a sequence of organized myocardial contractions. Arrhythmias and conduction disorders are caused by abnormalities in the generation or conduction of these electrical impulses or both. Any heart disease, including congenital abnormalities of structure (eg, accessory atrioventricular connection) or function (eg, hereditary ion channelopathies), can disturb rhythm. Systemic factors that can cause or contribute to a rhythm disturbance include electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), hypoxia, hormonal imbalances (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism), and medications and toxins (eg, alcohol, caffeine). Anatomy of the Cardiac Conduction System At the junction of the superior vena cava and high lateral right atrium is the sinoatrial (SA) or sinus node, a cluster of cells that generates the initial electrical impulse of each normal heart beat. Electrical discharge of these pacemaker cells stimulates adjacent cells, leading to stimulation of successive regions of the heart in an orderly sequence. Impulses are transmitted through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node via both preferentially conducting internodal tracts and unspecialized atrial myocytes. The AV node is located on the right side of the interatrial septum. It has a slow conduction
