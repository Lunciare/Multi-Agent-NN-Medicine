restricted from driving until response to treatment has been assessed. Surgery for cardiac arrhythmias Surgery to remove a focus of a tachyarrhythmia has become less necessary due to advances in less invasive ablation techniques. But surgery is indicated when an arrhythmia is refractory to ablation or when another indication requires a cardiac surgical procedure, most commonly when patients with atrial fibrillation require valve replacement or repair or when patients with ventricular tachycardia require revascularization or resection of a left ventricular aneurysm.
