Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia). Normally, reentry is prevented by tissue refractoriness following stimulation. However, 3 conditions favor reentry: Shortening of tissue refractoriness (eg, by sympathetic stimulation) Lengthening of the conduction pathway (eg, by hypertrophy or abnormal conduction pathways) Slowing of impulse conduction (eg, by ischemia) Pathophysiology reference 1. Antzelevitch C, Burashnikov A. Overview of Basic Mechanisms of Cardiac Arrhythmia. Card Electrophysiol Clin 2011;3(1):23-45. doi:10.1016/j.ccep.2010.10.012 Symptoms and Signs of Arrhythmias Arrhythmia and conduction disturbances may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations (sensation of skipped beats or rapid or forceful beats), symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort, presyncope, syncope), or cardiac arrest. Occasionally, polyuria results from release of atrial natriuretic peptide during prolonged supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs). Palpation of pulse and cardiac auscultation can determine ventricular rate and its regularity or irregularity. Examination of the jugular venous pulse waves may help in the diagnosis of AV blocks and tachyarrhythmias. For example, in complete AV block, the atria intermittently contract when the AV valves are closed, producing large ("cannon") a waves in the jugular venous pulse. There are few other physical findings of arrhythmias. Diagnosis of Arrhythmias ECG Ambulatory rhythm monitoring (eg, Holter, event, or other monitors) 8/14 History and physical examination may
