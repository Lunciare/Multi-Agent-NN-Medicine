refractory and is blocked, but it can be conducted on pathway A because its refractory period is shorter. On arriving at 2, the impulse continues forward and retrograde up pathway B, where it is blocked by refractory tissue at 3. A premature supraventricular beat with an increased PR interval results. III. If conduction over pathway A is sufficiently slow, a premature impulse may continue retrograde all the way up pathway B, which is now past its refractory period. If pathway A is also past its refractory period, the impulse may reenter pathway A and continue to circle, sending an impulse each cycle to the ventricle (4) and retrograde to the atrium (5), producing a sustained reentrant tachycardia. 7/14 Initiation of an Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia There is an abnormal P wave (P′) and atrioventricular nodal delay (long P′R interval) before onset of the tachycardia. Under certain conditions, typically precipitated by a premature beat, reentry can cause continuous circulation of an activation wavefront, causing a tachyarrhythmia (see figure Initiation of an Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia). Normally, reentry is prevented by tissue refractoriness following stimulation. However, 3 conditions favor reentry: Shortening of tissue refractoriness (eg, by sympathetic stimulation) Lengthening of the conduction
