Overview of Arrhythmias

most common forms of paroxysmal SVT (AV nodal reentry and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia) must terminate if AV block occurs. Regular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include The above 4 regular, narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias conducted with bundle branch block or ventricular preexcitation Monomorphic VT Vagal maneuvers can help distinguish among them. ECG criteria to distinguish between VT and SVT with an intraventricular conduction defect are often used (see figure Modified Brugada Criteria for Ventricular Tachycardia). When in doubt, the rhythm is assumed to be VT because some medications for SVTs can worsen the clinical state if the rhythm is VT; however, the reverse is not true. Pearls & Pitfalls Assume a regular, wide-complex tachyarrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise. 11/14 Modified Brugada Criteria for Ventricular Tachycardia *With RBBB QRS: 12/14 In V1, monophasic R, or QR, or RS In V6, R/S < 1 or monophasic R or QR *With LBBB QRS: In V1, R > 30 milliseconds wide or RS > 60 milliseconds wide In V6, QR or QS AV = atrioventricular; LBBB = left bundle branch block; msec = millisecond; RBBB = right bundle branch block; VT = ventricular tachycardia.
