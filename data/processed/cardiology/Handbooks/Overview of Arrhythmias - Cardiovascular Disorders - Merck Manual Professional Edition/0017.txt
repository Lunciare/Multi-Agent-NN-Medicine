Overview of Arrhythmias

Discrete P waves that vary from beat to beat with at least 3 different morphologies Irregular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include 10/14 The above 4 irregular, narrow atrial tachyarrhythmias conducted with either bundle branch block or ventricular preexcitation Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) Differentiation is based on atrial ECG signals and the presence in polymorphic VT of a very rapid ventricular rate (> 250 beats/minute). Regular, narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include Sinus tachycardia Atrial flutter with a consistent AV conduction ratio True atrial tachycardia with a consistent AV conduction ratio Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias ([SVT] such as AV nodal reentrant SVT, orthodromic reciprocating AV tachycardia in the presence of an accessory AV connection, and SA nodal reentrant SVT) Vagal maneuvers or pharmacologic AV nodal blockade can help distinguish among these tachycardias. With these maneuvers, sinus tachycardia is not terminated, but it slows or AV block develops, disclosing normal P waves. Similarly, atrial flutter and true atrial tachycardia are usually not terminated, but AV block discloses flutter waves or abnormal P waves. The most common forms of paroxysmal SVT (AV nodal reentry and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia) must terminate if AV block occurs. Regular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include The above 4 regular, narrow
