complex represents ventricular depolarization, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization. The PR interval (from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) is the time from the beginning of atrial activation to the beginning of ventricular activation. Much of this interval reflects slowing of impulse transmission in the AV node. The R-R interval (time between 2 QRS complexes) is inversely related to the ventricular rate by the formula 60/RR interval (in seconds) = heart rate. The QT interval (from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave) represents the combined duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Normal values for the QT interval are slightly longer in women; they are also longer in patients with a slower heart rate. The QT interval is corrected (QTc) for the influence of heart rate. The most common formula (all intervals in seconds) (5) is CLINICAL CALCULATORS QT Interval Correction (EKG) The corrected QT interval should be interpreted with caution with particularly high, low, or variable heart rates and with medication-induced QT changes. Pathophysiology of Arrhythmias Rhythm disturbances result from abnormalities of impulse formation, impulse conduction, or both. Bradyarrhythmias result from decreased intrinsic pacemaker
