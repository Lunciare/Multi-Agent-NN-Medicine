coexists with other conditions that do. In second-degree AV block, some normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but some are not. Bradycardia may or may not be present. In Mobitz type I second-degree AV block (also called Wenckebach second-degree AV block), the PR intervals prolong progressively during the conducted atrial events prior to each nonconducted atrial event and are typically the result of AV nodal dysfunction. In Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, the PR remains constant during conducted atrial events and is typically the result of His-Purkinje system dysfunction. 9/14 Third-degree AV block is indicated by a bradyarrhythmia with no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes and more P waves than QRS complexes; the escape rhythm can be Junctional with normal AV conduction (narrow QRS complex) Junctional with aberrant AV conduction (wide QRS complex) Ventricular (wide QRS complex) A regular QRS bradyarrhythmia with a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes indicates a sinus or other supraventricular bradycardia without second- or third-degree AV block. If P waves are normal, this is sinus bradycardia, even if first-degree AV block is present; if P waves are abnormal, the rhythm is sinus arrest/bradycardia with an atrial escape bradycardia.
