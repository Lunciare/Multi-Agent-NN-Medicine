Overview of Arrhythmias

sympathetic neural and circulating catecholamine drive. Normally, a marked diurnal variation in heart rate occurs, with lowest rates just before early morning awakening. A slight increase in rate during inspiration with a decrease in rate during expiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) is also normal; it is mediated by oscillations in vagal tone and is particularly common among healthy children and adolescents. The oscillations lessen but do not entirely disappear with age. Absolute regularity of the sinus rhythm rate is pathologic and occurs in patients with autonomic denervation (eg, in advanced diabetes) or any heart disorder severe enough to decrease parasympathetic cardiac (vagal) tone and activate sympathetic tone. Thus, measures of heart rate variability have been suggested, but not conclusively demonstrated, to be useful general measures of cardiovascular health (2). Most cardiac electrical activity is represented on the electrocardiogram (ECG—see figure Diagram of the Cardiac Cycle), although SA node, AV node, and His-Purkinje depolarization do not involve enough tissue to be detected (3, 4). The P wave represents atrial depolarization. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization. The PR interval (from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) is the
