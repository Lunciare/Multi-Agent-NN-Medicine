(below the His bundle bifurcation), or a supraventricular rhythm conducted with an intraventricular conduction defect or with ventricular preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ambulatory rhythm monitoring methods such as Holter or event monitors are also used to diagnose arrhythmias. The methods or devices are selected based on the frequency, duration and nature of the patient's symptoms as well as the potential consequences of worsening of the, as yet, undiagnosed arrhythmia. Bradyarrhythmias Bradyarrhythmias have a slow ventricular rate (< 60 beats/minute in adults). ECG diagnosis of bradyarrhythmias depends on the presence or absence of P waves, morphology of the P waves, and the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes (1, 2). Atrioventricular (AV) block is partial or complete interruption of impulse transmission from the atria to the ventricles. There are 3 degrees of AV block: first, second, and third. In first-degree AV block, each P wave is followed by a QRS complex but the PR interval is > 0.2 seconds. First-degree AV block does not itself cause bradycardia but often coexists with other conditions that do. In second-degree AV block, some normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but some are not. Bradycardia may or may not be present.
