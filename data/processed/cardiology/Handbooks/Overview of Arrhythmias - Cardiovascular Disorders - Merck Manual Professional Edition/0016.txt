Overview of Arrhythmias

morphology of the preceding T wave), sinus arrest or sinus exit block, as well as by second-degree AV block. Tachyarrhythmias Tachyarrhythmias have a rapid ventricular rate (> 100 beats/minute in resting adults) and may be divided into 4 groups, defined by the QRS complexes: Visibly regular vs irregular QRS complexes Narrow vs wide QRS complexes Irregular, narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include the following 4 rhythms. Differentiation is based on atrial ECG signals, which are best seen in the longer pauses between QRS complexes. Atrial fibrillation (AF): Atrial ECG signals (usually best seen in lead V1) that are continuous, irregular in timing and morphology, and very rapid (> 300 beats/minute) without discrete P waves (3) Atrial flutter with variable AV conduction: Regular, discrete, uniform atrial signals (usually best seen in leads II, III, and aVF) without intervening isoelectric periods, usually at rates > 250 beats/minute True atrial tachycardia with variable AV conduction: Regular, discrete, uniform, abnormal atrial signals with intervening isoelectric periods (usually at rates < 250 beats/minute) Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Discrete P waves that vary from beat to beat with at least 3 different morphologies Irregular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include 10/14 The above 4 irregular, narrow atrial tachyarrhythmias conducted
