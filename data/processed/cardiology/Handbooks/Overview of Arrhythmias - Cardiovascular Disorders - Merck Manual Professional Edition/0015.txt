Overview of Arrhythmias

P waves are normal, this is sinus bradycardia, even if first-degree AV block is present; if P waves are abnormal, the rhythm is sinus arrest/bradycardia with an atrial escape bradycardia. P waves after QRS complexes indicate sinus arrest with a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm and retrograde atrial activation. A ventricular escape rhythm results in a wide QRS complex; a junctional escape rhythm usually has a narrow QRS (or a wide QRS with bundle branch block or pre-excitation). When the QRS rhythm is irregular, P waves usually outnumber QRS complexes; some P waves produce QRS complexes, but some do not (indicating second-degree AV block). An irregular QRS rhythm with a 1:1 relationship between P waves and the following QRS complexes usually indicates sinus arrhythmia with gradual acceleration and deceleration of the sinus rate (if P waves are normal). Pauses in an otherwise regular QRS rhythm may be caused by blocked premature P waves (an abnormal P wave can usually be discerned just after the preceding T wave or distorting the morphology of the preceding T wave), sinus arrest or sinus exit block, as well as by second-degree AV block. Tachyarrhythmias Tachyarrhythmias have a rapid ventricular rate (> 100 beats/minute in
