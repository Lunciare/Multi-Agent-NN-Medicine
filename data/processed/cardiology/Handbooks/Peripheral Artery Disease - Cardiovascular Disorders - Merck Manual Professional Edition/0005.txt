Peripheral Artery Disease

be surrounded by black, necrotic tissue (dry gangrene). They are usually painful, but patients with peripheral neuropathy (eg, due to diabetes or alcohol use disorder) may not feel them. Infection of ischemic ulcers (wet gangrene) occurs frequently, typically leading to rapidly progressive cellulitis. The level of arterial occlusion influences location of symptoms. Aortoiliac PAD may cause buttock, thigh, or calf claudication; hip pain; and, in men, erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome). In femoropopliteal PAD, claudication typically occurs in the calf; pulses below the femoral artery are weak or absent. In PAD of more distal arteries, femoropopliteal pulses may be present, but foot pulses are absent. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia typically have multisegment disease (eg, aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and tibial occlusions). Peripheral artery disease occasionally affects the arms, especially the left proximal subclavian artery, causing arm fatigue with exercise and occasionally embolization to the hands. Diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Disease Ankle-brachial index Ultrasound Angiography (includes magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, or invasive angiography) CT Scan of a Patient with Occlusion of Superficial Femoral Arteries Peripheral artery disease is underrecognized because many patients have atypical symptoms or are not active enough to have symptoms. Spinal stenosis may also cause leg pain during walking
