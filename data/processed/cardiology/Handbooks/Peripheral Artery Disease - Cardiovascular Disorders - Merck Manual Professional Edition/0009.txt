recommended at least 3 times per week. Supervised exercise programs are probably superior to home-based exercise programs. Exercise can increase symptom-free walking distance and improve quality of life. Mechanisms probably include increased collateral circulation, improved endothelial function with microvascular vasodilation, decreased blood viscosity, improved red blood cell filterability, decreased ischemia-induced inflammation, and improved oxygen extraction. Preventive foot care is crucial, especially for patients with diabetes. It includes daily foot inspection for injuries and skin breakdown; treatment of calluses and corns by a podiatrist; daily washing of the feet in lukewarm water with mild soap, followed by gentle, thorough drying; and avoidance of thermal, chemical, and mechanical injury, especially that due to poorly fitting footwear. Foot ulcer management is discussed elsewhere. 7/11 Pharmacotherapy Statins, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and aspirin are given to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (see Treatment of Atherosclerosis). Antiplatelet monotherapy is recommended for all patients with lower extremity PAD who have symptoms (3, 4). Antiplatelet medications may modestly lessen symptoms and increase walking distance in patients with PAD; more importantly, these medications modify atherogenesis and help prevent acute coronary syndromes and transient ischemic attacks. Options for patients with symptomatic PAD include aspirin or clopidogrel orally. Randomized
