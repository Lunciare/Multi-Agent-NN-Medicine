and occlusion, fibromuscular dysplasia, mesenteric ischemia, and ischemic stroke resulting from carotid artery stenosis are presented elsewhere. Etiology of Peripheral Artery Disease The global prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is between 2 and 6% overall; prevalence increases to 15 to 20% after age 80 (1, 2, 3). Risk factors are the same as those for atherosclerosis (4, 5): Cigarette smoking (including passive smoking) or other forms of tobacco use Dyslipidemia (high low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol) Family history of atherosclerosis High homocysteine level Hypertension Increasing age Male sex Obesity Atherosclerosis is a systemic disorder; the majority of patients with PAD also have clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) or cerebrovascular disease (6). Symptoms and Signs of Peripheral Artery Disease Peripheral artery disease may be categorized into 4 subsets: asymptomatic, chronic symptomatic, chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), and acute limb ischemia (ALI) (1). Symptoms of occlusive peripheral artery disease may not occur until the luminal diameter is narrowed by 50 to 70%, depending on the specific artery and patient. More than 20% of patients with peripheral artery disease have no symptoms, and nearly the same percentage of patients have atypical symptoms (eg, nonspecific exercise intolerance, hip or
