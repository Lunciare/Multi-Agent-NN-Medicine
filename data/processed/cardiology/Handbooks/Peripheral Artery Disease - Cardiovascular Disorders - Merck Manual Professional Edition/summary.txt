Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerosis of the extremities that leads to impaired perfusion and ischemia. Lower extremity PAD, may be asymptomatic or patients may have atypical symptoms, claudication, or chronic limb-threatening ischemia (ischemic rest pain, ulceration or tissue loss, and gangrene). Diagnosis is typically made by history, physical examination, and measurement of the ankle-brachial index. Treatment of all patients with lower extremity PAD includes risk factor modification, lifestyle modification, including exercise. Antiplatelet medications are recommended for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD. For patients with claudication, treatment with cilostazol and referral for supervised exercise training are recommended.
