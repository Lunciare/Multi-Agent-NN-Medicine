Peripheral Artery Disease

and patient. More than 20% of patients with peripheral artery disease have no symptoms, and nearly the same percentage of patients have atypical symptoms (eg, nonspecific exercise intolerance, hip or other joint pain) (1). Patients with asymptomatic PAD may have functional impairment, as well as symptoms unmasked during objective walking tests (despite experiencing no exertional symptoms in daily life) (1). Intermittent claudication is the typical manifestation of chronic symptomatic PAD. Intermittent claudication is a painful, aching, cramping, uncomfortable, or tired feeling in the legs that occurs during walking and is relieved by rest (1). Claudication usually occurs in the calves but can occur in the feet, thighs, hips, buttocks, or, rarely, arms. Claudication is a manifestation of reversible, exercise-induced ischemia, and it is typically relieved by rest. With mild claudication, patients are able to perform exertional activities with few limitations. As PAD progresses, the distance that can be walked without symptoms may decrease. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia may experience ischemic rest pain, which is usually worse distally, is aggravated by leg elevation (often causing pain at night), and lessens when the leg is below heart level (1). The pain may be described as burning, tightness, or aching, although this
