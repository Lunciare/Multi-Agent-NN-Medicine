with PAD; more importantly, these medications modify atherogenesis and help prevent acute coronary syndromes and transient ischemic attacks. Options for patients with symptomatic PAD include aspirin or clopidogrel orally. Randomized trials have shown that the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin reduced cardiovascular events, including death, and major adverse limb events, including amputation (5, 6). Some data, however, suggest that the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally 2 times a day also increases the risk of bleeding (7). Cilostazol taken orally may be used to relieve intermittent claudication by improving blood flow and enhancing tissue oxygenation in affected areas; however, cilostazol is not a substitute for risk factor modification and exercise. The most common adverse effects of cilostazol are headache and diarrhea. Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with systolic heart failure. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have several beneficial effects. They are antiatherogenic and are potent vasodilators. Among patients undergoing vascular intervention for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, those on ACE inhibitors or ARBs had improved amputation-free and overall survival (8). Beta-blockers are also safe in patients with lower extremity PAD (3). Other medications that may relieve claudication are being studied but are not available in the United States; they include L-arginine
