ABI can be measured using treadmill walking or ankle lifts. After exercise, a drop in the ABI by 20% is diagnostic of lower extremity PAD. A high resting ABI index (> 1.40) may indicate noncompressible leg vessels (as occurs in Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis with calcification of the arterial wall). If the index is > 1.40 but suspicion of PAD remains high, a toe-brachial index and toe pressure are performed to check for arterial stenoses or occlusions. Ischemic lesions are unlikely to heal when the toe systolic BP is < 30 mm Hg, while healing potential is considered likely if toe pressure is > 60 mm Hg. Lower extremity PAD and the likelihood of ulcer healing can also be assessed by transcutaneous oximetry (TcO2). A TcO2 level < 40 mm Hg (5.32 kPa) is predictive of poor healing, and a value < 20 mm Hg (2.66 kPa) is consistent with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Angiography provides details of the location and extent of arterial stenoses or occlusions; it is a prerequisite for endovascular and/or surgical revascularization procedures. It is not a substitute for noninvasive testing because it provides no information about the functional significance of abnormal findings. Arterial duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography,
