Peripheral Artery Disease

Gangrene 8/11 Complications of endovascular revascularization include thrombosis at the site of dilation, distal embolization, vessel dissection, vessel perforation, and bleeding complications. Studies have shown similar limb salvage rates in patients undergoing endovascular and surgical revascularization (13, 14), and patient preferences and patient risk should be considered prior to embarking on either endovascular or surgical revascularization. Surgical revascularization Surgical revascularization is indicated for patients: Who can safely tolerate a major vascular procedure With acute limb ischemia With chronic limb-threatening ischemia With symptomatic intermittent claudication that does not respond to noninvasive treatments (eg, similar to the indications for endovascular revascularization) The goal is to relieve symptoms, prevent or decrease tissue loss, and avoid amputation. While some patients are at high risk for acute coronary syndrome and other complications of surgical revascularization, the empiric use of coronary revascularization is not recommended prior to vascular surgery. Thromboendarterectomy (surgical removal of an occlusive lesion) is used for short, localized lesions in the aortoiliac, common femoral, and/or deep femoral arteries. Lower extremity bypass (eg, femoropopliteal bypass grafting) uses synthetic or natural materials (often the saphenous or another vein) to bypass occlusive lesions. Lower extremity bypass is often used to prevent limb amputation and relieve claudication.
