bypass grafting) uses synthetic or natural materials (often the saphenous or another vein) to bypass occlusive lesions. Lower extremity bypass is often used to prevent limb amputation and relieve claudication. Sympathectomy may be effective in patients who cannot undergo major vascular surgery, when a distal occlusion causes severe ischemic pain. Chemical sympathetic blocks are as effective as surgical sympathectomy, so the latter is rarely performed. Amputation is a procedure of last resort, indicated for uncontrolled infection, unrelenting rest pain, and progressive gangrene. Amputation should be as distal as possible, preserving knee and ankle function (if possible) to permit ongoing ambulation. If more severe PAD is present, below knee amputation is preferred over above knee amputation so that patients can be considered for limb prosthesis after amputation (8). Key Points Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs most frequently in the lower extremities. Most patients also have significant cerebral or coronary atherosclerosis or both. When symptomatic, PAD causes intermittent claudication, which is discomfort in the legs that occurs during walking and is relieved by rest; it is a manifestation of exercise- induced reversible ischemia, similar to angina pectoris. More severe perfusion abnormalities in PAD may cause ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene
