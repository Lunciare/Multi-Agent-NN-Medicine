Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerosis of the extremities that leads to impaired perfusion and ischemia. Lower extremity PAD, may be asymptomatic or patients may have atypical symptoms, claudication, or chronic limb-threatening ischemia (ischemic rest pain, ulceration or tissue loss, and gangrene). Diagnosis is typically made by history, physical examination, and measurement of the ankle-brachial index. Treatment of all patients with lower extremity PAD includes risk factor modification, lifestyle modification, including exercise. Antiplatelet medications are recommended for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD. For patients with claudication, treatment with cilostazol and referral for supervised exercise training are recommended. Additional treatments for refractory claudication or chronic limb-threatening ischemia include endovascular or surgical revascularization. Some patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia require amputation. Prognosis is generally good with treatment, although morbidity and mortality rates are high due to concomitant diseases, including coronary artery disease. Peripheral artery disease of the upper and lower extremities is discussed below.. Other vascular diseases, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, renal artery stenosis and occlusion, fibromuscular dysplasia, mesenteric ischemia, and ischemic stroke resulting from carotid artery stenosis are presented elsewhere.
