are also safe in patients with lower extremity PAD (3). Other medications that may relieve claudication are being studied but are not available in the United States; they include L-arginine (the precursor of endothelium-dependent vasodilator), nitric oxide, vasodilator prostaglandins, chelation therapy, and angiogenic growth factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) (4, 9). Endovascular revascularization Endovascular revascularization has advanced significantly over the past few decades. The use of multiple modalities in endovascular revascularization, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy, and/or stenting, has been proven to improve durability and intermediate- and long- term clinical outcomes. Success for patients undergoing endovascular revascularization is quite high (procedural success> 90%, 3-year patency 58 to 82% depending on type and location of stent) (10, 11). More than 80% of all patients undergoing revascularization undergo endovascular revascularization as the first-line treatment (12). Indications for endovascular revascularization include: Intermittent claudication that limits daily activities and does not respond to risk factor modification and noninvasive treatments Rest pain Ischemic ulceration or tissue loss Gangrene 8/11 Complications of endovascular revascularization include thrombosis at the site of dilation, distal embolization, vessel dissection, vessel perforation, and bleeding complications. Studies have shown similar limb salvage rates in
