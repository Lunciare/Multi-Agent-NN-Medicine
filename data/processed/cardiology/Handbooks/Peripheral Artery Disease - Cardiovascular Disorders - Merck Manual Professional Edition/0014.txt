Peripheral Artery Disease

by rest; it is a manifestation of exercise- induced reversible ischemia, similar to angina pectoris. More severe perfusion abnormalities in PAD may cause ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulcers, or gangrene of the toes or elsewhere on the feet. A low (≤ 0.90) ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure) is diagnostic of lower extremity PAD. Modify atherosclerosis risk factors; give statins, antiplatelet medications, and sometimes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, rivaroxaban, or cilostazol. Endovascular revascularization and surgical revascularization are both options for patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD.
