by leg elevation (often causing pain at night), and lessens when the leg is below heart level (1). The pain may be described as burning, tightness, or aching, although this finding is nonspecific. When below heart level, the foot may appear dusky red or darker than usual (called dependent rubor). In some patients, elevating the foot causes loss of color and worsens ischemic pain; when the foot is lowered, venous filling is prolonged (> 15 seconds). Edema is usually not present unless the patient has kept the leg immobile and in a dependent position to relieve pain. Patients with chronic PAD may have thin, pale (atrophic) skin with hair thinning or loss. Distal legs and feet may feel cool. The affected leg may sweat excessively and become cyanotic, probably because of sympathetic nerve overactivity. Sudden, complete occlusion is discussed in Acute Limb Ischemia. As ischemia worsens, ischemic ulcers may appear (typically on the toes or heel, occasionally on the leg or foot), especially after local trauma. The ulcers tend to be surrounded by black, necrotic tissue (dry gangrene). They are usually painful, but patients with peripheral neuropathy (eg, due to diabetes or alcohol use disorder) may not feel them. Infection
