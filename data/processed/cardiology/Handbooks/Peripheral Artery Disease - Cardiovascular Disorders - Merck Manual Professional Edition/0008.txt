Peripheral Artery Disease

and/or surgical revascularization procedures. It is not a substitute for noninvasive testing because it provides no information about the functional significance of abnormal findings. Arterial duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, and CT angiography are noninvasive testing options that can facilitate planning for invasive angiography and help plan for revascularization (1, 2). Treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease Risk factor management (eg, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension) Lifestyle modification (eg, exercise, smoking cessation, weight management) Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications Cilostazol for claudication Antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) Endovascular or surgical revascularization for symptomatic disease Preventive care All patients require aggressive lifestyle and risk factor modification for relief of peripheral artery disease symptoms and prevention of cardiovascular disease, including: Smoking cessation, which is essential Control of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension Structured exercise therapy Dietary changes Both supervised and home-based exercise training are recommended for patients with lower extremity PAD (1, 2). Approximately 30 to 60 minutes of treadmill or track walking in an exercise-rest- exercise pattern is recommended at least 3 times per week. Supervised exercise programs are probably superior to home-based exercise programs. Exercise can increase symptom-free walking distance and improve quality of life. Mechanisms probably
