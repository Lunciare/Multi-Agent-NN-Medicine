Femoral Arteries Peripheral artery disease is underrecognized because many patients have atypical symptoms or are not active enough to have symptoms. Spinal stenosis may also cause leg pain during walking but can be distinguished because the pain (called pseudoclaudication) requires sitting, not just rest, for relief, and distal pulses remain intact. Diagnosis is confirmed by noninvasive testing. First, bilateral arm and ankle systolic blood pressure (BP) is measured using Doppler probes and a manual blood pressure cuff. Segmental blood pressure measurements are often used, because pressure gradients and pulse volume waveforms can help distinguish isolated aortoiliac PAD from femoropopliteal PAD and below-the-knee PAD. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the highest ankle systolic BP (on the right and left) divided by the highest arm systolic BP. A low (≤ 0.90) ankle-brachial index is diagnostic of lower extremity PAD, a value from 0.91 to 0.99 is borderline (1). If the index is normal (1.00 to 1.40) or borderline (0.91 to 0.99) but suspicion of PAD remains high, an exercise ABI can be measured using treadmill walking or ankle lifts. After exercise, a drop in the ABI by 20% is diagnostic of lower extremity PAD. A high resting ABI index
