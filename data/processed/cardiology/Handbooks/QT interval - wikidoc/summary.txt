The QT interval is a general measure of how long it takes for the heart to recharge or repolarize itself electrically. The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate such that the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval. As a result, the QT interval must be adjusted for the heart Schematic representation of normal ECG trace rate for accurate interpretation. This adjustment is (sinus rhythm), with waves, segments, and called the corrected QT interval or QTc. A lengthened intervals labeled.
