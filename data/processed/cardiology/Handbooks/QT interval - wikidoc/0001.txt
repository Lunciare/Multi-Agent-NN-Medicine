Synonyms and keywords: QT; QTc; corrected QT interval; corrected QT Overview The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. The QT interval is a general measure of how long it takes for the heart to recharge or repolarize itself electrically. The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate such that the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval. As a result, the QT interval must be adjusted for the heart Schematic representation of normal ECG trace rate for accurate interpretation. This adjustment is (sinus rhythm), with waves, segments, and called the corrected QT interval or QTc. A lengthened intervals labeled. QT interval is a biomarker for ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes and is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Historical Perspective The standard clinical correction is to use Bazett's formula,[1] named after physiologist Henry Cuthbert Bazett, calculating the heartrate-corrected QT interval QTc. The formula is as follows: <math>QTc = \frac{QT}{\sqrt {RR} }</math>, where QTc is the QT interval corrected for rate, and RR is the interval from the onset of one QRS complex to
