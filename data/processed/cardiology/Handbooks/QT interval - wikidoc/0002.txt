is as follows: <math>QTc = \frac{QT}{\sqrt {RR} }</math>, where QTc is the QT interval corrected for rate, and RR is the interval from the onset of one QRS complex to the onset of the next QRS complex, measured in seconds. However, this formula tends to not be accurate, and over-corrects at high heart rates and under-corrects at low heart rates. In the same year, Fridericia [2] published an alternative adjustment: <math>QT_F = \frac{QT}{RR^{1/3} } </math>. There are several other methods, but a regression based approach is the most accurate according to the current knowledge. An example of the regression-based approach is that developed by Sagie et al.,[3] as follows: <math>QT_S = QT + 0.154(1-RR)</math>. Measurement Normal values for the QT interval are between 0.30 and 0.44 (0.45 for women) seconds. QT interval can be measured by different methods such as the threshold method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline or the tangent method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line which touches
