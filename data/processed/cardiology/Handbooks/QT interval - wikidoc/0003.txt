the tangent method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line which touches the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximium downslope.[4] Shown below is an example of normal QT interval. The QT interval is an important ECG parameter and the identification of ECGs with long QT syndrome is of clinical importance. Considering the required standards for precision, the measurement of QT interval is subjective.[5] This is because the end of the T wave is not always clearly defined and usually merges gradually with the baseline. QT interval in an ECG complex can be measured manually by different methods such as the threshold method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline or the tangent method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line, which touches the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximum downslope.[4] 2/7 With the increased availability
