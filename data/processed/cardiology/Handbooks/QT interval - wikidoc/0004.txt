line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line, which touches the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximum downslope.[4] 2/7 With the increased availability of digital ECGs with simultaneous 12-channel recording, QT measurement may also be done by the 'superimposed median beat' method. In the superimposed median beat method, a median ECG complex is constructed for each of the 12 leads. The 12 median beats are superimposed on each other and the QT interval is measured either from the earliest onset of the Q wave to the latest offset of the T wave or from the point of maximum convergence for the Q wave onset to the T wave offset.[6] Natural History, Complications and Prognosis If the QT interval is abnormally prolonged or shortened, there is a risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias. Genetic Causes An abnormal prolonged QT interval could be due to Long QT syndrome, whereas an abnormal shortened QT interval could be due to Short QT syndrome. Due to adverse drug reactions Prolongation of the QT interval may be due to an adverse drug reaction.[7] Many drugs such as haloperidol[8] can prolong the QT interval. Prolongation of the QT Interval: 1. •
