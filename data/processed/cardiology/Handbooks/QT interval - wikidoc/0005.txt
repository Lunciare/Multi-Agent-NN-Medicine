Prolongation of the QT interval may be due to an adverse drug reaction.[7] Many drugs such as haloperidol[8] can prolong the QT interval. Prolongation of the QT Interval: 1. • Represents an excess time required for completion of ventricular depolarization and repolarization. 2. • Abnormal when the QTc is > 0.44 seconds. Shown below are examples of prolonged QY interval. 3/7 Shown below is an example of prolonged QT interval with bradycardia.
