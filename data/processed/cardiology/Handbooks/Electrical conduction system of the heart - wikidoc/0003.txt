Electrical conduction system of the heart

ions entering the cell cause the depolarization characteristic of an action potential. Like skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the opening of voltage- gated calcium channels and release of Ca2+ from the t-tubules. This influx of calcium causes calcium- induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and free Ca2+ causes muscle contraction. After a delay (the absolute refractory period), Potassium channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization to the resting state. Note that there are important physiological differences between nodal cells and ventricular cells; the specific differences in ion The EKG complex. P=P wave, channels and mechanisms of polarization give rise to unique PR=PR interval, QRS=QRS properties of SA node cells, most importantly the spontaneous complex, QT=QT interval, depolarizations necessary for the SA node's pacemaker activity . ST=ST segment, T=T wave Conduction pathway Signals arising in the SA node stimulate the atria to contract and travel to the AV node. After a delay, the stimulus is conducted through the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibers and the endocardium at the apex of the heart, then finally to the ventricular epicardium. Microscopically, the wave of depolarization propagates to adjacent cells via gap junctions located on
