Electrical conduction system of the heart

particularly resistant to ischemic damage. Purkinje fibers/ventricular myocardium: QRS complex The two bundle branches taper out to produce numerous Purkinje fibers, which stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract. The spread of electrical activity through the ventricular myocardium produces the QRS complex on the ECG. Ventricular repolarization: T wave The last event of the cycle is the repolarization of the ventricles. Normal Sinus Rhythm and Junctional Rhythms An impulse (action potential) that originates from the SA node at a rate of 60 - 100 beats/minute (bpm) is known as normal sinus rhythm. If SA nodal impulses occur at a rate less than 60 bpm, the heart rhythm is known as sinus bradycardia. If SA nodal impulse occur at a rate exceeding 100 bpm, the consequent rapid heart rate is sinus tachycardia. Sinus bradycardia may not always be indicative of Cdoioskeiaess hee.l pT urs adienliveedr oaurt hselrevticeess,.

If the SA node fails to initialize the AV Junction can take over as the main pacemaker of the heart. The AV Junction "surrounds" the AV node (the AV node
