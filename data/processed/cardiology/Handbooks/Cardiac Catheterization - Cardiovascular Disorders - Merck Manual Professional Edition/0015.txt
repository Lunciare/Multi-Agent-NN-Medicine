within a short period of time, and infusion of a total 10 to 15 mL/kg normal saline IV beginning 4 to 6 hours before angiography and 6 to 12 hours afterward reduces this risk substantially. In patients at risk of impaired renal function, assess serum creatinine 48 hours after injection of contrast. Contrast agent complications reference 1.

If it occurs, direct current cardioversion (DC cardioversion) is administered immediately. Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque by the catheter can release a shower of atheroemboli. Emboli from the aorta may cause stroke or nephropathy. Emboli from proximal to distal coronary arteries may cause myocardial infarction. Coronary artery dissection is also possible. Access site complications Access site complications include Bleeding Hematoma Pseudoaneurysm Arteriovenous (AV) fistula Limb ischemia Bleeding from the access site may occur and usually resolves with compression. Mild bruises and small hematomas are common and do not require specific investigation or treatment. A large
