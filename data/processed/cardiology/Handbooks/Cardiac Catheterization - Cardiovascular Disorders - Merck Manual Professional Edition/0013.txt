management of these drugs. Complications of Cardiac Catheterization The incidence of complications after cardiac catheterizations ranges from 0.8 to 8%, depending on patient factors, technical factors, and the experience of the operator. Patient factors that increase risk of complications include Chronic kidney disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Diabetes Heart failure Increasing age Peripheral arterial disease Valvular heart disease 11/14 Most complications are minor and can be easily treated. Serious complications (eg, cardiac arrest, anaphylactic reactions, shock, seizures, renal toxicity) are rare. Mortality rate is 0.1 to 0.2%. Myocardial infarction (0.1%) and stroke (0.1%) may result in significant morbidity. Incidence of stroke is higher in patients > 80 years. In general, complications involve The contrast agent Effects of the catheter The access site Contrast agent complications Injection of radiopaque contrast agent produces a transient sense of warmth throughout the body in many patients. Tachycardia, a slight fall in systemic pressure, an increase in cardiac output, nausea, vomiting, and coughing may occur. Rarely, bradycardia occurs when a large amount of a contrast agent is injected; asking the patient to cough often restores normal rhythm. More serious reactions (see also Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions) include Allergic-type contrast reactions Contrast-induced kidney
