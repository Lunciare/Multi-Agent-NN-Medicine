Cardiac Catheterization

can be passed into either ventricle, usually the right. Three to 5 samples of myocardial tissue are removed from the septal endocardium. The main complication of endomyocardial biopsy, cardiac perforation, occurs in 0.3 to 0.5% of patients; it may cause hemopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade. Injury to the tricuspid valve and supporting chordae may also occur and can lead to tricuspid regurgitation. Contraindications to Cardiac Catheterization Relative contraindications to cardiac catheterization include Acute kidney injury Chronic kidney disease Coagulopathy Fever Radiopaque contrast agent allergies in patients who have not been appropriately premedicated Systemic infection Uncontrolled arrhythmia Uncontrolled hypertension Uncompensated heart failure Relative contraindications balance the urgency of the procedure (eg, in an acute myocardial infarction vs an elective case) and the severity of the contraindicating disorder. Periprocedural management of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs is individualized based on the type of procedure (ie, arterial vs venous access), the urgency of the procedure, the indication for the drug, and the patient's risk of bleeding. Catheterization laboratories frequently have policies for the periprocedural management of these drugs. Complications of Cardiac Catheterization The incidence of complications after cardiac catheterizations ranges from 0.8 to 8%, depending on patient factors, technical factors, and the experience of
