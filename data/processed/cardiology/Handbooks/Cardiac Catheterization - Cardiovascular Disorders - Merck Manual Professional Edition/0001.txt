Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins. Cardiac catheterization can be used to do various tests, including Angiography Detection and quantification of shunts Endomyocardial biopsy Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) Measurement of cardiac output (CO) Measurements of myocardial metabolism These tests define coronary artery anatomy, cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics to establish diagnoses and help clinicians select treatment. Cardiac catheterization is also the basis for several therapeutic interventions (see Percutaneous coronary intervention in Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease). Procedure for Cardiac Catheterization Many but not all preprocedure protocols require patients to fast for 4 to 6 hours before cardiac catheterization. Most patients do not require overnight hospitalization unless a therapeutic intervention is also done. Left heart catheterization Left heart catheterization is most commonly used to assess Coronary artery anatomy and presence of coronary artery disease Left heart catheterization is also used to assess 1/14 Aortic blood pressure Aortic valve function Left ventricular pressure and function Mitral valve function Systemic vascular resistance Left heart catheterization is done via femoral, subclavian, radial, or brachial artery puncture, with a catheter passed into the coronary artery
