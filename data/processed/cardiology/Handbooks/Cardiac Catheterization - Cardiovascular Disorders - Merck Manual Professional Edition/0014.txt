Cardiac Catheterization

contrast agent is injected; asking the patient to cough often restores normal rhythm. More serious reactions (see also Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions) include Allergic-type contrast reactions Contrast-induced kidney injury Allergic-type reactions to radiographic contrast include urticaria and conjunctivitis, which usually respond to diphenhydramine 50 mg IV. Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions with bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and dyspnea are rare reactions with an approximate frequency of about 1/5000 tests (1). These reactions should be treated immediately with epinephrine. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to contrast may be premedicated with oral prednisone (or parenteral hydrocortisone if the study is urgent) and diphenhydramine. Contrast-induced kidney injury is defined as impairment of renal function (either a 25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline or a 0.5 mg/dL [44 micromole/L] increase in absolute value) within 24 to 48 hours of IV contrast administration judged to be caused by contrast rather than alternative causes. For patients at risk, use of lowest possible dose of low-osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast, avoidance of multiple contrast studies within a short period of time, and infusion of a total 10 to 15 mL/kg normal saline IV beginning 4 to 6 hours before angiography and 6 to 12 hours
