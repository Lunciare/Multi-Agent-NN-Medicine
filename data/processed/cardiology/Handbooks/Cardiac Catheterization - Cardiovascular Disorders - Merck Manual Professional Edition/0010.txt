Cardiac Catheterization

L/minute). Techniques (see table Cardiac Output Equations) used to calculate CO include Fick cardiac output technique Indicator-dilution technique Thermodilution technique TABLE Cardiac Output Equations Fick technique 8/14 Numerator is oxygen consumption (O2 absorbed by lungs in mL/minute). Indicator-dilution technique Denominator is the sum of contrast agent concentrations (C) at each time interval (t). Thermodilution technique TB – TI is the difference between body and injectate temperatures; injectate is usually dextrose or saline. Denominator is the sum of changes in temperature at each time interval (t). SaO2 = arterial oxygen saturation (%); SvO2 = mixed venous oxygen saturation (%), measured in the pulmonary artery. With the Fick technique, CO is proportional to oxygen consumption divided by arteriovenous oxygen difference. Dilution techniques rely on the assumption that after an indicator is injected into the circulation, it appears and disappears proportionately to CO. 2 Usually, CO is expressed in relation to body surface area (BSA) as the cardiac index (CI) in L/minute/m (ie, CI = CO/BSA—see table Normal Values for Cardiac Index and Related Measures). BSA is calculated using DuBois height (ht)–weight (wt) equation: TABLE Normal Values for Cardiac Index and Related Measurements Measurement Normal Value SD 2 Oxygen uptake 143 mL/minute/m *
