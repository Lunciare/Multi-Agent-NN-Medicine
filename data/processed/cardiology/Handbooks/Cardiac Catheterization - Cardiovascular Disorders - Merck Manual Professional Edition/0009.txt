Cardiac Catheterization

the heart and great vessels can help determine the presence, direction, and volume of central shunts. The maximal normal difference in oxygen content between structures is as follows: The pulmonary artery and right ventricle: 0.5 mL/dL (0.5 vol%) The right ventricle and right atrium: 0.9 mL/dL (0.9 vol%) The right atrium and superior vena cava: 1.9 mL/dL (1.9 vol%) If the blood oxygen content in a chamber exceeds that of the more proximal chamber by more than these values, a left-to-right shunt at that level is probable. Right-to-left shunts are strongly suspected when LA, LV, or arterial oxygen saturation is low (≤ 92%) and does not improve when pure oxygen (fractional inspirational O2 = 1.0) is given. Left heart or arterial desaturation plus increased oxygen content in blood samples drawn beyond the shunt site on the right side of circulation suggests a bidirectional shunt. Measurement of cardiac output and flow Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood ejected by the heart per minute (normal at rest: 4 to 8 L/minute). Techniques (see table Cardiac Output Equations) used to calculate CO include Fick cardiac output technique Indicator-dilution technique Thermodilution technique TABLE Cardiac Output Equations Fick technique 8/14 Numerator is oxygen
