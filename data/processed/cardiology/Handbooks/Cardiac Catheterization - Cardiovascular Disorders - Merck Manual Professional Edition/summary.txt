Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins. Cardiac catheterization can be used to do various tests, including Angiography Detection and quantification of shunts Endomyocardial biopsy Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) Measurement of cardiac output (CO) Measurements of myocardial metabolism These tests define coronary artery anatomy, cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics to establish diagnoses and help clinicians select treatment. Cardiac catheterization is also the basis for several therapeutic interventions (see Percutaneous coronary intervention in Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease). Procedure for Cardiac Catheterization Many but not all preprocedure protocols require patients to fast for 4 to 6 hours before cardiac catheterization. Most patients do not require overnight hospitalization unless a therapeutic intervention is also done.
