pressure and function Mitral valve function Systemic vascular resistance Left heart catheterization is done via femoral, subclavian, radial, or brachial artery puncture, with a catheter passed into the coronary artery ostia and/or across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV). Catheterization of the left atrium (LA) and LV is occasionally done using transseptal perforation during right heart catheterization. Right heart catheterization Right heart catheterization is commonly used to measure Right atrial pressure Right ventricular pressure Pulmonary artery pressure Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP—see figure Diagram of the Cardiac Cycle) The most frequent indications for right heart catheterization are to assess hemodynamics, diagnose pulmonary hypertension, guide therapy, and assess need for cardiac transplantation or mechanical cardiac support (eg, a ventricular assist device). PAOP approximates left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. In seriously ill patients, PAOP helps assess volume status and, with simultaneous measurements of cardiac output, can help guide therapy. Right heart catheterization is also useful for assessing cardiac filling pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, tricuspid or pulmonic valve function, intracardiac shunts, and right ventricular pressure. Right heart pressure measurements may help in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade when noninvasive testing is nondiagnostic, and it is
