Cardiomyopathy Patients usually present first with symptoms of heart blocks and/or arrhythmias, including palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. Age at presentation is typically < 40 years. Heart failure manifestations (eg, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema) typically develop later, but timing is variable. A significant number of patients also have skeletal muscle symptoms (eg, weakness), which may precede cardiac manifestations. Diagnosis of Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathy ECG Cardiac imaging (eg, echocardiography, cardiac MRI) Genetic testing Screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis is suspected in young patients with palpitations, syncope, or resuscitation from unexplained cardiac arrest, particularly if they also have early-onset conduction system disease, supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, skeletal muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, and/or a family history of arrhythmias and/or heart failure. Patients should have ECG, ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and cardiac imaging, typically echocardiography and/or cardiac MRI. If conduction disturbances, tachyarrhythmias, and/or cardiomyopathy are detected, genetic testing is done. The yield of genetic testing rises from 5% to 10% in the general population of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to approximately one third in patients with AV conduction disturbances and a family history of cardiomyopathy (1). As described above, first-degree family members of patients have a significant risk of disease. Thus,
