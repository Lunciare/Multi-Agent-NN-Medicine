Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathies (Cardiolaminopathies) - Cardiovascular Disorders

Lamin A/C cardiomyopathies are genetic disorders that cause dilated cardiomyopathy, a variety of arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and an increased risk of sudden death. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. Treatment is usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic medications, and standard measures for heart failure. (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias) Lamin A and lamin C are structural filament proteins in the cell nucleus, encoded by the gene LMNA. Mutations in this gene produce a group of disorders called laminopathies. Many laminopathies cause a severe, usually dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by rapid progression, atrial tachyarrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) blocks, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden death. Lamin A/C cardiomyopathies account for about 5 to 10% of inherited dilated cardiomyopathies (1). Most cardiolaminopathies have autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance; thus, patients' family members are often affected. Some LMNA mutations are associated with other disorders, including certain muscular dystrophies (eg, Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy), peripheral neuropathies, premature ageing, and metabolic abnormalities (eg, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, lipodystrophy). Symptoms and Signs of Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathy Patients usually present first with symptoms of heart blocks and/or arrhythmias, including palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. Age at presentation is typically < 40 years. Heart failure manifestations (eg,
