Lamin A/C cardiomyopathies are genetic disorders that cause dilated cardiomyopathy, a variety of arrhythmias, conduction disorders, and an increased risk of sudden death. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. Treatment is usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic medications, and standard measures for heart failure. (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias) Lamin A and lamin C are structural filament proteins in the cell nucleus, encoded by the gene LMNA. Mutations in this gene produce a group of disorders called laminopathies. Many laminopathies cause a severe, usually dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by rapid progression, atrial tachyarrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) blocks, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden death.
