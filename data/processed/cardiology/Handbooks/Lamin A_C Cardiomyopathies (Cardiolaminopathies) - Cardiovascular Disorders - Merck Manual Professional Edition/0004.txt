(first-degree or higher degrees), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and left ventricular ejection fraction. An online risk calculator for patients who have not yet had a life-threatening arrhythmia is available (1). Because of a high risk of sudden death, an ICD is typically implanted earlier in the course of illness in patients with lamin A/C cardiomyopathies than in others with dilated cardiomyopathy (see table Indications for an ICD). Established indications for ICD use include patients with (2) Dilated cardiomyopathy plus left ventricular ejection fraction of < 35% Sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation Resuscitated cardiac arrest Placement of an ICD may also be useful (class IIa recommendation) for patients with lamin A/C cardiomyopathy who have (2) Unexplained syncope An independent indication for a permanent pacemaker ≥ 2 other risk factors for sudden death (intermediate left ventricular ejection fraction in the range of 35% to 44%, male sex, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) A beta-blocker should be used in most patients but may increase the possibility of AV block. Antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy with a class III medication , particularly sotalol or amiodarone, may reduce symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias but is not a substitute for an ICD. However, these medications may benefit patients who have frequent appropriate ICD
