Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathies (Cardiolaminopathies) - Cardiovascular Disorders

one third in patients with AV conduction disturbances and a family history of cardiomyopathy (1). As described above, first-degree family members of patients have a significant risk of disease. Thus, they should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia, muscle weakness, and/or heart failure), ECG, ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and echocardiography initially and then every 1 to 3 years. Genetic testing is done if the index case has a mutation identified. Family members who are not carriers of that mutation do not require ongoing testing. Treatment of Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathy Moderation of physical activity Usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Sometimes antiarrhythmic medication therapy Heart failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Treatment focuses on prevention of sudden death and prevention of symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients should avoid athletic exertion because such activities may hasten the progression of the cardiomyopathy and may foster life-threatening arrhythmias. The 5-year risk of a first episode of life-threatening arrhythmia ranges from approximately 4% to 50% depending on sex, non-missense LMNA mutation, AV block (first-degree or higher degrees), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and left ventricular ejection fraction. An online risk calculator for patients who have not yet had a life-threatening arrhythmia is available (1). Because
