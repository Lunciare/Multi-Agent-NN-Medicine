Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathies (Cardiolaminopathies) - Cardiovascular Disorders
KEYWORDS: patients, cardiomyopathy, ventricular, cardiac, heart, icd, lamin, family, risk, genetic, tachyarrhythmias, failure, dilated, testing, arrhythmias

medication , particularly sotalol or amiodarone, may reduce symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias but is not a substitute for an ICD. However, these medications may benefit patients who have frequent appropriate ICD discharges despite adequate beta-blocker therapy. Standard measures for treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy are used as required. Lamin A/C cardiomyopathies are genetic disorders that cause tachyarrhythmias, heart blocks, and heart failure. Some of the mutations also affect skeletal muscle. Diagnosis is based on clinical and electrocardiographic factors, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. First-degree family members have a significant risk of disease and require screening. Treatment requires usually requires an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and a beta- blocker.
