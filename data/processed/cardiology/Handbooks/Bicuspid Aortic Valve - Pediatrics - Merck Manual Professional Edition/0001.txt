Bicuspid Aortic Valve

Bicuspid aortic valve is the presence of only two (rather than the normal three) valve cusps. Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality. It is present in 0.5 to 2 % of live births (1). Patients with bicuspid aortic valve are predisposed to developing infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, and/or aortic stenosis. Bicuspid aortic valve can also be associated with dilation of the aortic root or ascending aorta and with coarctation of the aorta. There is a genetic predilection for bicuspid aortic valves, with a 9% reported family prevalence, so first- degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve should undergo screening echocardiography. Recognition of a bicuspid valve, even in a patient who has normal valve function, is important for purposes of follow-up because of the association of bicuspid valves with an aortopathy that results in progressive aortic root or ascending aortic dilation and aneurysm formation. The reported prevalence of this complication varies widely in different studies, but, in general, dilatation will occur in up to 56% of those aged < 30 years (2). Symptoms and Signs of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Children with bicuspid aortic valve may be asymptomatic if there is little or no valve dysfunction.
