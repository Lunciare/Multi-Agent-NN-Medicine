Bicuspid Aortic Valve

diastolic murmur if aortic regurgitation is present. Echocardiography shows the characteristic finding of fusion of two of the three aortic valve leaflets. Fusion of the right coronary and left coronary leaflets is the most common morphology. Children with fusion of the right coronary and noncoronary leaflets are more likely to have progression of valve dysfunction and to require intervention during childhood. Treatment of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Balloon dilation or surgical repair Treatment of bicuspid aortic valve is indicated if severe valve dysfunction develops and if symptoms occur. Treatment consists of balloon dilation or surgical repair of stenotic valves. Regurgitant valves are treated with surgery. Ascending aorta or root replacement may be indicated if there is severe or progressive enlargement of those structures. More Information The following English-language resource may be useful.
