Bicuspid aortic valve is the presence of only two (rather than the normal three) valve cusps. Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality. It is present in 0.5 to 2 % of live births (1). Patients with bicuspid aortic valve are predisposed to developing infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, and/or aortic stenosis. Bicuspid aortic valve can also be associated with dilation of the aortic root or ascending aorta and with coarctation of the aorta. There is a genetic predilection for bicuspid aortic valves, with a 9% reported family prevalence, so first- degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve should undergo screening echocardiography.
