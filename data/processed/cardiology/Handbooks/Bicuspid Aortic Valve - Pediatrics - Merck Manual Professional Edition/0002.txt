Symptoms depend on the type of complication and can include fever in infective endocarditis or dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, palpitations, and exercise intolerance due to valvular regurgitation or stenosis. 1/2 Bicuspid Aortic Valve - Pediatrics - Merck Manual Professional Edition Examination reveals an early systolic click, a systolic ejection murmur and, if aortic regurgitation is present, a diastolic decrescendo murmur. Diagnosis of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Physical examination Echocardiography Diagnosis is by physical examination findings and echocardiography. Physical examination usually reveals a prominent early systolic ejection sound (click) at the apex and base of the heart. This finding is often best heard with the patient sitting; the examiner listens at the apex for a click just after the first heart sound (S1), simulating a prominent split of S1.

Echocardiography shows the characteristic finding of fusion of two of the three aortic valve leaflets. Fusion of the right coronary and left coronary
