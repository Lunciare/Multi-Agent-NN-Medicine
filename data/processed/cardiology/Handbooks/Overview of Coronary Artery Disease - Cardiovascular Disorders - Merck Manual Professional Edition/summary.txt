Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. Clinical presentations include silent ischemia, angina pectoris, acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, myocardial infarction), and sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is by symptoms, ECG, stress testing, and sometimes coronary angiography. Prevention consists of modifying reversible risk factors (eg, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, smoking). Treatment includes medications and procedures to reduce ischemia and restore or improve coronary blood flow. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in both sexes, accounting for approximately one third of all deaths, and substantial numbers of these occur in low resource areas (1).
