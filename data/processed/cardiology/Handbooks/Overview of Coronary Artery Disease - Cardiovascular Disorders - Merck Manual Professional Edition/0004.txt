to intrinsic vasodilators (eg, acetylcholine) and increased production of vasoconstrictors (eg, 2/11 angiotensin II, endothelin, leukotrienes, serotonin, thromboxane) in the area of the atheroma. Recurrent spasm may damage the intima, leading to atheroma formation. Use of vasoconstricting substances (eg, cocaine, nicotine) and emotional stress also can trigger coronary spasm. Coronary artery dissection Coronary artery dissection is a rare, non-traumatic tear in the coronary intima with creation of a false lumen. Blood flowing through the false lumen expands it, which restricts blood flow through the true lumen sometimes causing coronary ischemia or infarction. Dissection may occur in atherosclerotic or non-atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Non-atherosclerotic dissection is more likely in pregnant or postpartum females and/or patients with fibromuscular dysplasia or other connective tissue disorders. Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease Risk factors for coronary artery disease are the same as risk factors for atherosclerosis: Older age Male sex Family history of early coronary artery disease (death from coronary artery disease in a first-degree relative prior to age 55 in males or age 65 in females) High blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (see Dyslipidemia) High blood levels of lipoprotein a Low blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol Diabetes mellitus (particularly type
