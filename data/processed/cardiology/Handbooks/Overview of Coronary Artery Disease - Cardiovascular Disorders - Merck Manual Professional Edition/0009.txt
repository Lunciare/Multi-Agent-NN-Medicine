Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

mortality post-infarction, especially in the presence of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction. Calcium channel blockers are also helpful. They often are combined with beta-blockers in managing angina and hypertension but have not been proven to reduce mortality. 6/11 Nitrates modestly dilate coronary arteries and decrease venous return, decreasing cardiac work and relieving angina quickly. Longer acting nitrate formulations help decrease angina events but do not decrease mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are most effective at reducing mortality post MI in CAD patients with LV dysfunction (1, 2). Little evidence exists to guide therapy for patients with endothelial dysfunction. Treatment is generally similar to that for typical large-vessel atherosclerosis, and some evidence suggests that use of beta- blockers may enhance endothelial function (3). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (See Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.) PCI is indicated for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or with stable ischemic heart disease who have angina despite optimal medical therapy. Drug-eluting stents, which release an antiproliferative drug (eg, everolimus, zotarolimus) over a period of several weeks, have reduced the rate of restenosis lower than the rate with bare metal stents, to < 10% (4). Most PCI is done with stents, and
