Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

a period of several weeks, have reduced the rate of restenosis lower than the rate with bare metal stents, to < 10% (4). Most PCI is done with stents, and most stents used in the United States are drug-eluting. Patients without significant infarct or complications may return to work and usual activities usually within a few days after stent placement. However, cardiac rehabilitation is recommended for all patients. In-stent thrombosis occurs because of the inherent thrombogenicity of metallic stents. Most cases occur within the first 24 to 48 hours. However, late stent thrombosis, occurring after 30 days and as late as ≥ 1 year (rarely), can occur with both bare-metal and drug-eluting stents, especially after cessation of antiplatelet therapy. Progressive endothelialization of the bare-metal stent occurs within the first few months and reduces the risk of thrombosis. However, the antiproliferative drugs released by drug- eluting stents inhibit this process and prolong the risk of thrombosis. Thus, patients who undergo stent placement are treated with various antiplatelet agents. The current standard regimen for patients with a bare-metal or drug-eluting stent consists of all of the following (5): Intraprocedural anticoagulation with heparin or a similar agent (eg, bivalirudin, particularly for those at
