Vascular endothelial dysfunction can promote atherosclerosis and contribute to coronary artery spasm. Endothelial dysfunction is also recognized as a cause of angina in the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis or spasm (see Microvascular Angina). Rare causes include coronary artery embolism, dissection, aneurysm (eg, in Kawasaki disease), and vasculitis (eg, in Takayasu arteritis). Pathophysiology of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary atherosclerosis Coronary atherosclerosis is often irregularly distributed in different vessels but typically occurs at points of turbulence (eg, vessel bifurcations). As the atheromatous plaque grows, the arterial lumen progressively narrows, resulting in ischemia (often causing angina pectoris). The degree of stenosis required to cause ischemia varies with oxygen demand. Occasionally, an atheromatous plaque ruptures or splits. Reasons are unclear but probably relate to plaque morphology, plaque calcium content, and plaque softening due to an inflammatory process. Rupture exposes collagen and other thrombogenic material, which activate platelets and the coagulation cascade (see figure Pathways in Blood Coagulation), resulting in an acute thrombus, which interrupts coronary blood flow and causes some degree of myocardial ischemia. The consequences of acute ischemia, collectively referred to as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), depend on the location and degree of obstruction and range from unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation
