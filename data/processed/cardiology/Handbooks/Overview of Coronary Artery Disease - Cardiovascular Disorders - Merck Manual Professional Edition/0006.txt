diet high in fat and calories and low in phytochemicals (found in fruits and vegetables), fiber, and vitamins C, D, and E; by a diet relatively low in omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs—at least in some people); and by poor stress management. The Revised Pooled Cohort risk calculator, recommended by current US-based guidelines, estimates 10- year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (5, 6). The PREVENT calculator ( incorporates additional information, including measures of kidney and metabolic health and socioeconomic variation (as determined by U. S. zip code), to provide 10- and 30- year risk estimates for combined atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure (7, 8). Coronary Artery Anatomy The right and left coronary arteries arise from the right and left coronary sinuses in the root of the aorta just above the aortic valve orifice (see figure Arteries of the Heart). The coronary arteries divide into large and medium-sized arteries that run along the heart’s surface (epicardial coronary arteries) and subsequently send smaller arterioles into the myocardium. The left coronary artery begins as the left main artery and quickly divides into the left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex, and sometimes an intermediate artery (ramus intermedius). The LAD artery usually follows the
