Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

therapy has been shown to improve long-term event-free survival (6). Patients who receive a statin before the procedure have a lower risk of periprocedural MI. Overall, risks of undergoing PCI are comparable to those of CABG. Overall mortality rate is < 1%, but varies based on individual risk factors and tends to be similar to that of CABG; Q wave MI rate is < 1%. In < 1% of patients, intimal dissection causes obstruction requiring emergency CABG. Risk of stroke with PCI is lower than with CABG. A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials reported a higher risk of stroke in patients undergoing CABG (1.2%) than PCI (0.34%,) at 30 days (7). Risk of bleeding is 1 to 2%. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (See Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.) CABG uses arteries (eg, internal mammary, radial) whenever possible, and if necessary, sections of autologous veins (eg, saphenous) to bypass diseased segments of the coronary arteries. At 1 year, about 85% of venous bypass grafts are patent, and after 5 years, one third or more are completely blocked. However, after 10 years, as many as 97% of internal mammary artery grafts are patent (8). Arteries also hypertrophy to accommodate increased flow. CABG
