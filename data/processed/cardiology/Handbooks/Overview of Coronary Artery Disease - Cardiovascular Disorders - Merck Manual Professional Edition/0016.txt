achieve specific target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, patients are selected for treatment based on their risk of ASCVD. Lower risk patients with elevated LDL may not require statin treatment. Four higher risk patient groups have been identified in whom the benefit of statin therapy outweighs the risk of adverse events: Patients with clinical ASCVD Patients with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) Patients age 40 to 75 years with diabetes and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L) Patients age 40 to 75 years without diabetes, with LDL cholesterol levels of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), and with ASCVD risk > 7.5% Nicotinic acid or a fibrate may be added for patients with an HDL cholesterol level < 40 mg/dL (< 1.03 mmol/L), although several trials have failed to demonstrate a lower risk of ischemia or slowed progression of atherosclerosis when medications are used to raise HDL (3). Aspirin is not recommended for primary prevention of CAD in patients ≥ 60 years (4). It can be considered for patients aged 40 to 59 years whose 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease exceeds 10%, but absolute benefit is likely to be
