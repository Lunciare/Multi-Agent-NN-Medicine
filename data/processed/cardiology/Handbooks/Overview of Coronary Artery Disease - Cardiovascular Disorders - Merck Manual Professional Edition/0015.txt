Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

(AHA) recommends using the pooled cohort risk assessment equations to estimate lifetime and 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The risk calculator is based on sex, age, race, total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure (and whether blood pressure is being treated), diabetes, and smoking status (1). Prevention of coronary artery disease involves modifying atherosclerosis risk factors: Smoking cessation Weight loss 9/11 Healthful diet Regular exercise Modification of serum lipid levels Reduction of salt intake Control of hypertension Control of diabetes Antihypertensive recommendations vary. In the United States, for patients who are at low risk (< 10% 10-year risk) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), antihypertensive therapy is recommended if blood pressure is > 130/80. In patients with coronary artery disease or whose risk of ASCVD is > 10%, antihypertensive medication is recommended for blood pressure > 130/80 mm Hg (2). Modification of serum lipid levels (particularly with statins) may slow or even partially reverse the progression of CAD. Treatment goals have been modified. Instead of trying to achieve specific target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, patients are selected for treatment based on their risk of ASCVD. Lower risk patients with elevated LDL may not require statin treatment.
