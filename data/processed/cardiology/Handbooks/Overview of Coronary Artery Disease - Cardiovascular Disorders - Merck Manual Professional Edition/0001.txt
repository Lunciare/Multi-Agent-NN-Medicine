Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. Clinical presentations include silent ischemia, angina pectoris, acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, myocardial infarction), and sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is by symptoms, ECG, stress testing, and sometimes coronary angiography. Prevention consists of modifying reversible risk factors (eg, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, smoking). Treatment includes medications and procedures to reduce ischemia and restore or improve coronary blood flow. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in both sexes, accounting for approximately one third of all deaths, and substantial numbers of these occur in low resource areas (1). Mortality from coronary artery disease is approximately 5 times higher in men than in women, but the mortality difference declines with age (2). Etiology of Coronary Artery Disease Usually, coronary artery disease is due to Coronary artery atherosclerosis: Subintimal deposition of atheromas in large and medium- sized coronary arteries Less often, coronary artery disease is due to Coronary artery spasm (see Vasospastic Angina) Vascular endothelial dysfunction can promote atherosclerosis and contribute to coronary artery spasm. Endothelial dysfunction is also recognized as a cause of angina in the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis
