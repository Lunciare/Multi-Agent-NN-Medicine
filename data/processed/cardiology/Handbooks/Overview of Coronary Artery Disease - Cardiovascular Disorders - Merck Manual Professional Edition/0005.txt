Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

in females) High blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (see Dyslipidemia) High blood levels of lipoprotein a Low blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol Diabetes mellitus (particularly type 2) Smoking (including secondhand exposure) Obesity Physical inactivity High level of apoprotein B (apo B) High blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) Smoking may be a stronger predictor of myocardial infarction in females (1). Genetic factors play a role, and several systemic disorders (eg, hypertension, hypothyroidism) and metabolic disorders (eg, hyperhomocysteinemia) contribute to risk. A high level of apo B may identify increased risk when total cholesterol or LDL level is normal (2, 3). CLINICAL CALCULATORS Cardiovascular Risk Assessment (10-year, Revised Pooled Cohort Equations 2018) High blood levels of C-reactive protein indicate plaque instability and inflammation and may be a stronger predictor of risk of ischemic events than high levels of LDL (4). High blood levels of triglycerides 3/11 and insulin (reflecting insulin resistance) may be risk factors, but data are less clear. CAD risk is also increased by a diet high in fat and calories and low in phytochemicals (found in fruits and vegetables), fiber, and vitamins C, D, and E; by a diet relatively low in omega-3 (n-3)
