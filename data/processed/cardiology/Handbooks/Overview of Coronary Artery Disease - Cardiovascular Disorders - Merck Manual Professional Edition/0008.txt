Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

Arteries 3D MODEL Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease Medical therapy, including antiplatelet agents, lipid-lowering drugs (eg, statins), and beta- blockers Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) For acute thrombosis, sometimes fibrinolytic drugs Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Treatment generally aims to reduce cardiac workload by decreasing oxygen demand and improving coronary artery blood flow, and, over the long term, to halt and reverse the atherosclerotic process. Coronary artery blood flow can be improved by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An acute coronary thrombosis may sometimes be dissolved by fibrinolytic drugs. Medical therapy Medical management of patients with CAD depends on symptoms, cardiac function, and the presence of other disorders. Recommended therapy includes Antiplatelet agents to prevent thrombus formation Statins to lower LDL cholesterol levels Beta-blockers to reduce symptoms of angina Antiplatelet agents and statins improve short-term and long-term outcomes, probably by improving atheromatous plaque stability and endothelial function. Beta-blockers reduce symptoms of angina by reducing heart rate and contractility and decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Beta-blockers also reduce mortality post-infarction, especially in the presence of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction. Calcium channel blockers are also helpful. They often are combined with beta-blockers in managing angina and hypertension but
