Overview of Coronary Artery Disease

regimen for patients with a bare-metal or drug-eluting stent consists of all of the following (5): Intraprocedural anticoagulation with heparin or a similar agent (eg, bivalirudin, particularly for those at high risk of bleeding) Aspirin given indefinitely Clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for at least 3 months and up to 12 months The best results are obtained when the newer antiplatelet agents (eg, ticagrelor or clopidogrel) are begun before the procedure. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not routinely used in stable patients (ie, no comorbidities, no acute coronary syndrome) having elective stent placement. They may be beneficial in some patients with an acute coronary syndrome but should not be considered routine. It is unclear whether it is beneficial to give glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors before arrival in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, but most national organizations do not recommend their use in this situation (5). 7/11 A statin is started after stent insertion, if one is not already being used because PCI by itself does not cure or prevent the progression of CAD. Statin therapy has been shown to improve long-term event-free survival (6). Patients who receive a statin before the procedure have a lower risk of periprocedural MI. Overall, risks of undergoing PCI
