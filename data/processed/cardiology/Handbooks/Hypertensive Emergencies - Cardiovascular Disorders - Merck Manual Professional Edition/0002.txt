into the brain, causing cerebral edema, including papilledema. Although many patients with stroke and intracranial hemorrhage present with elevated BP, elevated BP is often a consequence rather than a cause of the condition. Whether rapidly lowering BP is beneficial in these conditions is unclear (2); it may even be harmful. CLINICAL CALCULATORS Mean Vascular Pressure (systemic or pulmonary) Hypertensive urgencies Severe hypertension (eg, systolic pressure > 180 mm Hg) without target-organ damage (except perhaps grades 1 to 2 retinopathy) may be considered a hypertensive urgency. Although BP at these very high levels often concerns clinicians, acute complications are unlikely, so immediate BP reduction is not required. Anxiety is by far the most common cause of hypertensive urgency. Treating the anxiety by counseling and/or use of anxiety-alleviating medications is often helpful in reducing BP (3) and thus reducing the incidence of hypertensive urgencies. If elevated BP persists, patients should be started on medications, such as combination therapy with 2 oral antihypertensives (for severe hypertension), and closely evaluated for treatment efficacy on an outpatient basis. Symptoms and Signs of Hypertensive Emergencies Blood pressure is elevated, often markedly (systolic pressure > 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg). Central nervous
