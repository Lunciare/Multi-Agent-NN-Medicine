an outpatient basis. Symptoms and Signs of Hypertensive Emergencies Blood pressure is elevated, often markedly (systolic pressure > 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg). Central nervous system symptoms include rapidly changing neurologic abnormalities (eg, confusion, transient cortical blindness, hemiparesis, hemisensory defects, seizures). Cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain and dyspnea. Renal involvement may be asymptomatic, although severe azotemia due to advanced renal failure may cause lethargy or nausea. Physical examination focuses on target organs, with neurologic examination, fundoscopy, and cardiovascular examination. Global cerebral deficits (eg, confusion, obtundation, coma), with or without focal deficits, suggest encephalopathy; normal mental status with focal deficits suggests stroke. 2/7 Severe retinopathy (sclerosis, cotton-wool spots, arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhage, papilledema) is usually present with hypertensive encephalopathy, and some degree of retinopathy is present in many other hypertensive emergencies. Jugular venous distention, basilar lung crackles, and a third heart sound suggest pulmonary edema. Asymmetry of pulses between arms suggests aortic dissection. Diagnosis of Hypertensive Emergencies Systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg Testing to identify target-organ involvement: ECG, urinalysis, serum electrolytes, and creatinine; if neurologic findings, head CT Testing typically includes ECG, urinalysis, serum electrolytes, and creatinine. Patients with neurologic findings require head CT to
