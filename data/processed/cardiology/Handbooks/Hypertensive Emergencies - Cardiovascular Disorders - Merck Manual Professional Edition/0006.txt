Hypertensive Emergencies

be avoided in hypotension patients with asthma Most hypertensive emergencies, except acute heart failure Tachycardia, headache, Nicardipine flushing, local phlebitis Should be used cautiously in patients with myocardial ischemia Nitroglycerin Headache, tachycardia, Myocardial ischemia, heart nausea, vomiting, failure apprehension, restlessness, muscular 4/7 Selected Adverse Medication Special Indications Effects* twitching, palpitations, methemoglobinemia, tolerance with prolonged use Nausea, vomiting, Most hypertensive agitation, muscle emergencies twitching, sweating, cutis Should be used cautiously Nitroprusside anserina (if blood pressure in patients with high is reduced too rapidly), intracranial pressure or thiocyanate and cyanide azotemia toxicity Rarely used unless patient Tachycardia, flushing, Phentolamine has a confirmed diagnosis headache of pheochromocytoma * Hypotension may occur with all medications. † A special delivery system (eg, infusion pump for nitroprusside, nonpolyvinyl chloride tubing for nitroglycerin) is required. Oral medications are not indicated because onset is variable and the medications are difficult to titrate. Although short-acting oral nifedipine reduces blood pressure rapidly, it may lead to acute hypotension, which may lead to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events (sometimes fatal) and is therefore not recommended. Clevidipine is an ultra-short-acting (within 1 to 2 minutes), third-generation calcium channel blocker that reduces peripheral resistance without affecting venous vascular tone and cardiac filling pressures.
