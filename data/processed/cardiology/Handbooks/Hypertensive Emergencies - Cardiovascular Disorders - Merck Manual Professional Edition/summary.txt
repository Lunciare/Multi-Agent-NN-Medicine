A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension (often defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg) with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys). Diagnosis is by BP measurement, ECG, urinalysis, and serum electrolyte and creatinine measurements. Treatment is immediate BP reduction with IV antihypertensives. Signs of target-organ damage include (1): Hypertensive encephalopathy Hypertensive retinopathy Preeclampsia or eclampsia Acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema Myocardial ischemia Acute aortic dissection Renal failure Damage is rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal. Hypertensive encephalopathy may involve a failure of cerebral autoregulation of blood flow. Normally, as blood pressure increases, cerebral vessels constrict to maintain constant cerebral perfusion.
