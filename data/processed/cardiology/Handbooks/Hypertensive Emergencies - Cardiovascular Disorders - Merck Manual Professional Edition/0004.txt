target-organ involvement: ECG, urinalysis, serum electrolytes, and creatinine; if neurologic findings, head CT Testing typically includes ECG, urinalysis, serum electrolytes, and creatinine. Patients with neurologic findings require head CT to diagnose intracranial bleeding, edema, or infarction. Patients with chest pain or dyspnea require an ECG and chest radiograph. ECG abnormalities suggesting acute target-organ damage include acute ischemic changes. Urinalysis abnormalities typical of renal involvement include red blood cells (RBCs), RBC casts, and proteinuria. Diagnosis is based on the presence of a BP > 180 mm Hg and findings of target-organ involvement. Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies Initiate short-acting IV medication (eg, labetalol, clevidipine, esmolol) in the emergency department Admit to intensive care unit (ICU) where titratable IV medications (eg, nitroprusside, fenoldopam, nicardipine) can be monitored Goal: 20 to 25% reduction MAP in 1 to 2 hours Hypertensive emergencies are treated in an ICU; blood pressure is progressively (although not abruptly) reduced using a short-acting, titratable IV medication. Choice of medication and speed and degree of reduction vary somewhat with the target organ involved, but generally a 20 to 25% reduction in MAP over about an hour or two is appropriate, with further titration based on symptoms. Achieving “normal” BP urgently is
