Heart block

Overview Heart block is defined as impaired or abnormal conduction of electrical impulses in the heart. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles). As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. This process repeats with each new heartbeat. Heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This abnormality can occur in the heart muscle (myocardium) or in the specialized electrical conduction system of the heart. Classification A heart block can be a blockage at any level of the electrical conduction system of the heart: • SA Nodal Block: Blocks that occur within the sinoatrial node (SA node) are described as SA nodal blocks. • AV Nodal Block: Blocks that occur within the atrioventricular node (AV node) are described as AV nodal blocks. • Infra-Hisian Block: Blocks that occur below the AV node are known as Infra-Hisian blocks (named after the bundle of His). • Bundle Branch Block: Blocks that occur within the left or right bundle branches are known as bundle branch blocks. • Hemiblock: Blocks that
