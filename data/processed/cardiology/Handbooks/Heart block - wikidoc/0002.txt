(named after the bundle of His). • Bundle Branch Block: Blocks that occur within the left or right bundle branches are known as bundle branch blocks. • Hemiblock: Blocks that occur within the fascicles of the left bundle branch are known as hemiblocks. Clinically speaking, most of the important heart blocks are AV nodal blocks and Infra-Hisian blocks. Types of SA nodal blocks The SA nodal blocks rarely give symptoms. This is because if an individual had complete block at this level of the conduction system (which is uncommon), the secondary pacemaker of the heart would be at the AV node, which would fire at 40 to 60 beats a minute, which is enough to retain consciousness in the resting state. Types of SA nodal blocks include: • SA node Wenckebach (Mobitz type I)[1] • SA node Mobitz type II • SA node exit block In addition to the above blocks, the SA node can be suppressed by any other arrhythmia that reaches it. This includes retrograde conduction from the ventricles, ectopic atrial beats, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. The difference between SA node block and SA node suppression is that in SA node block an electrical impulse is generated
