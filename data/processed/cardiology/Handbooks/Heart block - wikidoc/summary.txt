Overview Heart block is defined as impaired or abnormal conduction of electrical impulses in the heart. With each heartbeat, an electrical signal spreads across the heart from the upper (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles). As it travels, the signal causes the heart to contract and pump blood. This process repeats with each new heartbeat. Heart block occurs if the electrical signal is slowed or disrupted as it moves from the upper to the lower chambers of the heart. This abnormality can occur in the heart muscle (myocardium) or in the specialized electrical conduction system of the heart.
