Heart block

heart block is considered most important because of the possible progression to complete heart block. Pathophysiology Damage to the heart muscle and its electrical system by diseases, surgery, or medicines can cause acquired heart block. Heart block can be either congenital or acquired. Acquired heart block is more common than congenital heart block. Risk Factors The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different. Congenital Heart Block • If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. • Autoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block. 2/5 • Congenital heart defects also may result in congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects. • Heredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child
