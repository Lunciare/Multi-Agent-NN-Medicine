Heart block

ventricles, ectopic atrial beats, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. The difference between SA node block and SA node suppression is that in SA node block an electrical impulse is generated by the SA node that doesn't make the atria contract. In SA node suppression, on the other hand, the SA node doesn't generate an electrical impulse because it is reset by the electrical impulse that enters the SA node. Types of AV nodal blocks There are four basic types of AV nodal block: • First degree AV block • Second degree AV block • Type 1 second degree AV block (Mobitz I) (also known as Wenckebach phenomenon) • Third degree AV block (Complete heart block) Types of infrahisian block Infrahisian block describes block of the distal conduction system. Types of infrahisian block include: • Type 2 second degree heart block (Mobitz II) • Left bundle branch block • Left anterior fascicular block • Left posterior fascicular block • Right bundle branch block Of these types of infrahisian block, Mobitz II heart block is considered most important because of the possible progression to complete heart block. Pathophysiology Damage to the heart muscle and its electrical system by diseases, surgery, or medicines
