loss of motor function (paralysis is often considered the sixth P of acute limb ischemia). After 6 to 8 hours, muscles may be tender when palpated. 1/3 Pearls & Pitfalls Consider acute limb ischemia in patients at risk who have sudden pain out of proportion to physical findings. Cholesterol Embolization Diagnosis of acute limb ischemia is typically based on clinical findings. Immediate angiography is required to confirm location of the occlusion, identify collateral flow, and guide therapy. Treatment Embolectomy, thrombolysis, or bypass surgery Treatment of acute limb ischemia consists of thrombectomy or embolectomy (catheter or surgical), thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed), or lower extremity bypass surgery. In addition to the clinical expertise available in the local environment, the decision to do surgical thromboembolectomy vs thrombolysis is based on the severity of ischemia, the extent or location of the thrombus, and the general medical condition of the patient (1). A thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) medication, especially when given by intra-arterial catheter infusion, is most effective for patients with acute arterial occlusions of < 2 weeks and intact motor and sensory limb function (ie, a salvageable limb) (1, 2). Tissue plasminogen activator is most commonly used. A catheter is introduced and directed to the occluded
