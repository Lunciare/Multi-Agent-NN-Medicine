weeks and intact motor and sensory limb function (ie, a salvageable limb) (1, 2). Tissue plasminogen activator is most commonly used. A catheter is introduced and directed to the occluded area, and the thrombolytic medication is given at a rate appropriate for the patient’s size and the extent of thrombosis. Treatment is usually continued for 4 to 24 hours, depending on severity of ischemia and signs of thrombolysis (relief of symptoms and return of pulses or improved blood flow shown by Doppler ultrasound). In a large observational study, 2/3 between 1998 and 2009, 1-year amputation rates declined over time from approximately 15% to 11% although 1-year mortality remained the same at approximately 40% (3). Key Points Acute limb ischemia is characterized by severe pain, pallor, paresthesias (or anesthesia), poikilothermia (cold sensation), and pulselessness in the affected extremity. Treatment consists of embolectomy, thrombolysis, or bypass surgery. Despite treatment, approximately 11% of patients with acute limb ischemia require limb amputation.
