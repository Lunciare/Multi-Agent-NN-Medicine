Peripheral arteries may be acutely occluded by a thrombus, an embolus, aortic dissection, or acute compartment syndrome. Acute limb ischemia may result from: Rupture and thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque Embolus from the heart or thoracic or abdominal aorta Aortic dissection Acute compartment syndrome Symptoms and signs are sudden onset in an extremity of the 5 P’s: Pain (severe) Pallor Paresthesias (or anesthesia) Poikilothermia (coldness) Pulselessness Outcomes are best with early diagnosis, but pain, generally the earliest symptom, is nonspecific. However, the pain of acute limb ischemia can be out of proportion to physical findings. Thus, acute limb ischemia should be considered in patients at risk (eg, with known or suspected peripheral artery disease) who have limb pain disproportionate to physical findings, particularly if onset is sudden. The occlusion can be roughly localized to the arterial bifurcation just distal to the last palpable pulse (eg, at the common femoral bifurcation when the femoral pulse is palpable; at the popliteal bifurcation when the popliteal pulse is palpable). Severe cases may cause loss of motor function (paralysis is often considered the sixth P of acute limb ischemia). After 6 to 8 hours, muscles may be tender when palpated. 1/3 Pearls & Pitfalls
