Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy

not require ongoing testing. Treatment of Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy Moderation of physical activity Sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Usually a beta-blocker Sometimes other antiarrhythmic medications (particularly sotalol or amiodarone) Heart failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Sometimes chronic anticoagulation Patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy should avoid athletic exertion because such activities foster life-threatening arrhythmias. Prevention of sudden death is by an ICD (see also table Indications for an ICD. An ICD is recommended for patients with (1) Prior ventricular tachycardia with syncope Resuscitated cardiac arrest Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%) Placement of an ICD may also be useful (class IIa recommendation) for patients with lamin A/C cardiomyopathy who have (1) Both nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction Beta-blockers and other antiarrhythmic medications are used to treat tachyarrhythmias as they occur. Anticoagulation is used for patients with atrial fibrillation or stroke who meet standard criteria (see also table CHA2DS2-VASc Score). A recent Heart Rhythm Society consensus statement (1) indicates antithrombotic therapy may also be useful (class IIa recommendation) in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction and/or trabecular thrombi. Standard measures for treatment of heart failure are used as required (see also Treatment of Dilated
