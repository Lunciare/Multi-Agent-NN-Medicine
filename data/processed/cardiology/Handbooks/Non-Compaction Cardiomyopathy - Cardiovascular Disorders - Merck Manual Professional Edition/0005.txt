Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy

useful (class IIa recommendation) in patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction and/or trabecular thrombi. Standard measures for treatment of heart failure are used as required (see also Treatment of Dilated Cardiomyopathy). Key Points Non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a genetic cardiac disorder that causes heart failure, arrhythmias, heart blocks, and thromboembolic disease. Diagnosis is based on clinical factors, arrhythmias, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. First-degree family members have a significant risk of disease and require screening. Treatment may require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic medications, anticoagulation, and/or heart failure medications.
