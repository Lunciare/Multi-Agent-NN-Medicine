Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy

fibrosis predisposes to both systolic and diastolic heart failure and to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. The deep intertrabecular recesses produce areas of blood flow stasis predisposing to thromboembolic events, including stroke. Some forms also are associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), conduction system blocks, early repolarization, long QT interval syndrome, other congenital heart disorders, or skeletal muscular dystrophies. Symptoms and Signs of Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy Patients may be asymptomatic. Initial symptoms are usually those of heart failure (eg, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema), although some patients present with symptoms of conduction blocks and/or arrhythmias, including palpitations and/or syncope, or sometimes cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be triggered by exercise. Diagnosis of Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy Cardiac imaging (eg, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement) Genetic testing Screening of first-degree relatives Diagnosis of non-compaction cardiomyopathy is suspected in patients with manifestations of arrhythmias or conduction disorders in whom standard evaluation (eg, echocardiography) discloses ventricular wall abnormalities, including hypertrophy, distinct layers, and deep trabeculae. However, it is frequently difficult to distinguish the findings in non-compaction cardiomyopathy from normal variations, particularly in patients with physiological or pathological left ventricular hypertrophy, those with other cardiomyopathies, and pregnant patients.
