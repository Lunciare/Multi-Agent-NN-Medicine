Overview
The QT interval is a measure of the time between
the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in
the heart's electrical cycle. The QT interval is a
general measure of how long it takes for the heart to
recharge or repolarize itself electrically. The QT
interval is dependent on the heart rate such that the
faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval. As a
result, the QT interval must be adjusted for the heart
Schematic representation of normal ECG trace
rate for accurate interpretation. This adjustment is (sinus rhythm), with waves, segments, and
called the corrected QT interval or QTc. A lengthened intervals labeled.
QT interval is a biomarker for ventricular
tachyarrhythmias such as torsades de pointes and is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death.
Historical Perspective
The standard clinical correction is to use Bazett's formula,[1] named after physiologist Henry
Cuthbert Bazett, calculating the heartrate-corrected QT interval QTc.
The formula is as follows:
<math>QTc = \frac{QT}{\sqrt {RR} }</math>,
where QTc is the QT interval corrected for rate, and RR is the interval from the onset of one QRS
complex to the onset of the next QRS complex, measured in seconds. However, this formula tends
to not be accurate, and over-corrects at high heart rates and under-corrects at low heart rates.
In the same year, Fridericia [2] published an alternative adjustment:
<math>QT_F = \frac{QT}{RR^{1/3} } </math>.
There are several other methods, but a regression based approach is the most accurate according to
the current knowledge. An example of the regression-based approach is that developed by Sagie et
al.,[3] as follows:

Measurement
Normal values for the QT interval are between 0.30 and 0.44 (0.45 for women) seconds. QT
interval can be measured by different methods such as the threshold method in which the end of
the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the
isoelectric baseline or the tangent method in which the end of the T wave is determined by the
intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line which touches
the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximium downslope.[4]
Shown below is an example of normal QT interval.
The QT interval is an important ECG parameter and the identification of ECGs with long QT
syndrome is of clinical importance. Considering the required standards for precision, the
measurement of QT interval is subjective.[5] This is because the end of the T wave is not always
clearly defined and usually merges gradually with the baseline. QT interval in an ECG complex can
be measured manually by different methods such as the threshold method, in which the end of the
T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the
isoelectric baseline or the tangent method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the
intersection of a line extrapolated from the isoelectric baseline and the tangent line, which touches
the terminal part of the T wave at the point of maximum downslope.[4]

With the increased availability of digital ECGs with simultaneous 12-channel recording, QT
measurement may also be done by the 'superimposed median beat' method. In the superimposed
median beat method, a median ECG complex is constructed for each of the 12 leads. The 12 median
beats are superimposed on each other and the QT interval is measured either from the earliest
onset of the Q wave to the latest offset of the T wave or from the point of maximum convergence
for the Q wave onset to the T wave offset.[6]
Natural History, Complications and Prognosis
If the QT interval is abnormally prolonged or shortened, there is a risk of developing ventricular
arrhythmias.
Genetic Causes
An abnormal prolonged QT interval could be due to Long QT syndrome, whereas an abnormal
shortened QT interval could be due to Short QT syndrome.
Due to adverse drug reactions
Prolongation of the QT interval may be due to an adverse drug reaction.[7] Many drugs such as
haloperidol[8] can prolong the QT interval.
Prolongation of the QT Interval:
1. • Represents an excess time required for completion of ventricular depolarization and
repolarization.
2. • Abnormal when the QTc is > 0.44 seconds.
Shown below are examples of prolonged QY interval.

• is associated with congenital deafness, syncope, and sudden death.
• autosomal recessive inheritance
• heterozygotes may be normal or have a slightly prolonged QT interval
• incidence among deaf mute children is .25%
2. • Romano-Ward syndrome
• clinically similar to the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome except the hearing
is normal
• autosomal dominant
• heterozygotes and homozygotes persons may have similar symptoms
3. • Sporadic long QT syndrome
• females:males = 2:1
• 57% had a history of syncope
• there was a strong association between syncopal episodes and emotions,
vigorous activities and loud noises.
4. • Pathogenesis
• imbalance between various components of the cardiac sympathetic innervation.
5. • Treatment to shorten the QT syndrome:
• left stellate ganglion block
• right stellate ganglion stimulation
• the administration of propranolol [9]
Short QT Interval

Causes
1. • Digoxin therapy
2. • Hypercalcemia
3. • Secondary (acquired) types of QT prolongation
• Coronary artery disease: Ischemia, infarction
• MVP, cardiomyopathy
• CNS disease, especially hemorrhage
• Autonomic nervous system dysfunction secondary to radical neck dissection,
carotid endarterectomy, transabdominal truncal vagotomy.
• Metabolic disturbances. Electrolyte imbalance (such as hypocalcemia), liquid
protein diet, intracoronary injection of contrast agents.
• Cardiac medications: Quinidine, PCA, disopyramide, encainide, flecainide,
propafenone, amiodarone.
