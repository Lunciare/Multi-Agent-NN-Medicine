Cardiac Sarcoidosis

also common. Symptoms and Signs of Cardiac Sarcoidosis Most patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are asymptomatic, but the associated bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope, and sometimes cardiac arrest or sudden death. A significant number of deaths resulting from systemic sarcoidosis are due to sudden cardiac death, including in many patients who have had no previous indication of cardiac involvement. Cardiomyopathy may cause any heart failure symptom, including exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. In most patients, disease manifests between the ages of 25 to 60 years. Diagnosis of Cardiac Sarcoidosis Clinical suspicion ECG, echocardiography, and sometimes cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement and/or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan Biopsy of noncardiac tissue that appears affected by systemic sarcoidosis Rarely cardiac biopsy About 35% of the patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are already known to have systemic sarcoidosis or have clinical evidence of extracardiac sarcoidosis at presentation (1). Patients with known sarcoidosis and no cardiac symptoms should typically have periodic ECGs and echocardiography to screen for cardiac involvement. If cardiac symptoms, signs, or test abnormalities are present, cardiac MRI with gadolinium should also be done. Ambulatory ECG monitoring should be done if symptoms suggest a rhythm or conduction disturbance. An
