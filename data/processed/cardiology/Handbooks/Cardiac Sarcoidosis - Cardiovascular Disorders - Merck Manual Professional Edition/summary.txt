Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, chronic inflammatory/granulomatous disorder that often affects the heart, causing conduction disturbances, bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and sometimes cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is suspected in patients with known sarcoidosis or young patients who have otherwise unexplained heart block, arrhythmias, or cardiomyopathy. Treatment is immunosuppression and sometimes an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD). (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias.) Systemic sarcoidosis is reviewed elsewhere in THE MANUAL. This topic focuses on the cardiac effects of sarcoidosis. The inflammatory process in sarcoidosis leads to formation of noncaseating granulomas and fibrosis in any tissue.
