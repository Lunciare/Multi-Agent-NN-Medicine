optimal medical therapy (including a period of immunosuppression in patients with active inflammation) (each a class I recommendation)(2) (see table Indications for an ICD). The Heart Rhythm Society cardiac sarcoid consensus document also suggests an ICD can be useful (class IIa recommendation) for patients with cardiac sarcoidosis with unexplained syncope or near- syncope thought to be arrhythmic in etiology and for those with inducible sustained VT/VF at a programmed stimulation electrophysiologic study (each a class IIa recommendation) (2). The document further suggests that an ICD may be considered (class IIb recommendation) in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis with a left ventricular ejection fraction in the 35% to 49% range and/or a right ventricular ejection fraction < 40% despite optimal medical therapy for heart failure and use of immunosuppressants in patients with active inflammation (2). Similar, but not identical, recommendations for ICD therapy have been proposed by the Japanese Circulation Society (3), the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (4), and the European Society of Cardiology (5). Because ventricular late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI (a marker of ventricular scarring) predicts life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, ICD placement is recommended (class IIa recommendations) for patients with significant LGE despite an LVEF
