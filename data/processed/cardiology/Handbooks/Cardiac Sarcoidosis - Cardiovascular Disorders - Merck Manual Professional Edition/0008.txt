gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI (a marker of ventricular scarring) predicts life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, ICD placement is recommended (class IIa recommendations) for patients with significant LGE despite an LVEF > 35% (4, 5). 4/6 Antiarrhythmic medications such as amiodarone and sotalol may be given as necessary to control frequently recurrent ventricular tachycardias and/or other tachyarrhythmias. If medications (and adequate anti-inflammatory therapy) do not control VT, electrophysiologic studies may be done to identify the origin of the arrhythmia (often a reentrant site) that can then be treated using transcatheter ablation. Heart failure therapy typically includes a beta-blocker (watching for the possibility of worsening AV conduction), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Pharmacological treatments for dilated cardiomyopathy, including angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, have been less well studied in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. The frequent coexistence of left bundle branch block in patients with sarcoidosis-related dilated cardiomyopathy makes cardiac resynchronization therapy attractive. Heart transplantation may be considered. Key Points About 25% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis have cardiac involvement, but only about 5% have cardiac symptoms. Cardiac involvement causes a disproportionate percentage of deaths in patients with sarcoidosis. Diagnosis
