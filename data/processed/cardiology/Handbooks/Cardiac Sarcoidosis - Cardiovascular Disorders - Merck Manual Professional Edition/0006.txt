Cardiac Sarcoidosis

(WASOG) (3) and the Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) Corticosteroids Sometimes other immunosuppressive medications Sometimes permanent pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Sometimes antiarrhythmic medications (avoiding class I medications) Sometimes transcatheter ablation Heart failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Standard treatments for sarcoidosis itself are given, including corticosteroids and sometimes other immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate). Tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors may be used for refractory cases. These modalities often also ameliorate cardiac abnormalities and should be optimized (1). Cardiac treatment is focused on treatment and prevention of arrhythmias. Recommendations for treatment of bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias follow those for other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. In cardiac sarcoidosis specifically, a pacemaker is recommended (class of recommendation IIa) for qualifying AV block even if the AV block reverses spontaneously (2). When a permanent pacemaker is indicated (see table Indications for Permanent Pacemakers), an ICD is preferred (class IIa recommendation). The Heart Rhythm Society cardiac sarcoid consensus document recommends an ICD for patients with prior sustained VT, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 35% despite optimal medical therapy (including a period of immunosuppression in patients with active inflammation) (each a class I recommendation)(2) (see table Indications for an ICD).
