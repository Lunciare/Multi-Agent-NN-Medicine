Cardiac Sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, chronic inflammatory/granulomatous disorder that often affects the heart, causing conduction disturbances, bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and sometimes cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is suspected in patients with known sarcoidosis or young patients who have otherwise unexplained heart block, arrhythmias, or cardiomyopathy. Treatment is immunosuppression and sometimes an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD). (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias.) Systemic sarcoidosis is reviewed elsewhere in THE MANUAL. This topic focuses on the cardiac effects of sarcoidosis. The inflammatory process in sarcoidosis leads to formation of noncaseating granulomas and fibrosis in any tissue. In patients with clinically apparent cardiac sarcoidosis, the conducting system and/or myocardium are typically involved, but valvular, papillary muscle, and pericardial involvement may also occur. Nearly all patients with cardiac sarcoidosis have involvement of other organs (typically the lungs), but cardiac sarcoidosis may rarely occur in isolation. About 25% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis have cardiac involvement identifiable using imaging techniques, but cardiac involvement is symptomatic in only about 20% of these (5% of all patients with sarcoidosis) (1). Systemic sarcoidosis shows marked regional variation in incidence, being higher in patients of Northern European or African descent, particularly African American females. Nevertheless, in patients with systemic sarcoidosis
