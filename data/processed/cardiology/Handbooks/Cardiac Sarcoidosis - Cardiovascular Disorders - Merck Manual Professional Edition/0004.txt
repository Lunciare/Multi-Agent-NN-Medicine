Cardiac Sarcoidosis

symptoms, signs, or test abnormalities are present, cardiac MRI with gadolinium should also be done. Ambulatory ECG monitoring should be done if symptoms suggest a rhythm or conduction disturbance. An FDG-PET scan provides additional information regarding active inflammation and is usually also done. 2/6 In patients not yet diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis, diagnosis of isolated cardiac sarcoidosis is frequently difficult. Cardiac sarcoidosis should be suspected in young patients with heart block, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and/or heart failure who have no obvious cause. All such patients should have ECG and echocardiography. Patients with an unexplained cardiomyopathy should also have cardiac MRI. When findings from these examinations suggest cardiac sarcoidosis or when there is a high suspicion thereof (eg, in young patients with unexplained AV block), further testing for cardiac sarcoidosis (ambulatory ECG monitoring, FDG-PET scanning) and testing for extracardiac sarcoidosis, (chest x-ray, chest CT, whole body FDG-PET scan) is needed. With extensive investigation, > 80% of patients with apparent isolated cardiac sarcoidosis are found to also have extracardiac sarcoidosis. An international consensus document (2) indicated that the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis requires a cardiac biopsy showing non-caseating granuloma without alternative explanation or an extracardiac tissue biopsy showing non-caseating granuloma without alternative explanation
