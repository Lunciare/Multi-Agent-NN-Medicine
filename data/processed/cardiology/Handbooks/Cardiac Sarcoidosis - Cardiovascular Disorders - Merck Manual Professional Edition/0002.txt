Cardiac Sarcoidosis

sarcoidosis) (1). Systemic sarcoidosis shows marked regional variation in incidence, being higher in patients of Northern European or African descent, particularly African American females. Nevertheless, in patients with systemic sarcoidosis men are more likely to manifest cardiac sarcoidosis and no racial difference in cardiac sarcoidosis is apparent in North American studies (2). The predilection of cardiac sarcoid involvement of the interventricular septum causes atrioventricular (AV) conduction system blocks in many patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. Involvement of the conducting system may cause first-, second-, or third-degree AV block, left anterior or left posterior hemiblock, and left or right bundle branch block. Involvement of the sinus node artery may produce the bradyarrhythmias of sinus node dysfunction. 1/6 Myocardial involvement may produce tachyarrhythmias, predominantly ventricular tachycardia (VT), but atrial tachycardias, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation may also occur. Infiltration of the myocardium may cause an isolated left ventricular, an isolated right ventricular, a biventricular, dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Pericardial involvement may cause pericardial effusion or contribute to restrictive physiology. Multifactorial pulmonary hypertension is also common. Symptoms and Signs of Cardiac Sarcoidosis Most patients with cardiac sarcoidosis are asymptomatic, but the associated bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope, and sometimes cardiac arrest or
