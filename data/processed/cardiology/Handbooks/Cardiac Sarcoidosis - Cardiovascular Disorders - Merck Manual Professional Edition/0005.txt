Cardiac Sarcoidosis

document (2) indicated that the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis requires a cardiac biopsy showing non-caseating granuloma without alternative explanation or an extracardiac tissue biopsy showing non-caseating granuloma without alternative explanation plus ≥ 1 of the following without alternative explanation: Corticosteroid-responsive cardiomyopathy or heart block Unexplained reduced left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% Unexplained spontaneous or induced ventricular tachycardia Mobitz type II second-degree AV block or third-degree AV block Cardiac PET scan showing patchy uptake Cardiac MRI showing late gadolinium enhancement Positive gallium uptake on a nuclear scan Most commonly, the diagnosis is established by extracardiac biopsy in conjunction with suggestive cardiac abnormalities on noninvasive testing. Cardiac biopsy has low sensitivity because the disease process is patchy and pathological tissue may not be sampled. However, sensitivity of cardiac biopsy is improved if it is guided by advanced cardiac imaging techniques or by targeting areas of low voltage. Similar, but not identical, criteria for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis have been published by the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (WASOG) (3) and the Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) Corticosteroids Sometimes other immunosuppressive medications Sometimes permanent pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Sometimes antiarrhythmic medications (avoiding class I medications) Sometimes transcatheter ablation
