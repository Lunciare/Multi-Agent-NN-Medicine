than females (2:1). They may result from previous abdominal trauma, illicit IV drug use, medial degeneration of the arterial wall, or periarterial inflammation. Renal artery aneurysms may dissect or rupture, causing acute occlusion. Superior mesenteric artery aneurysms occur equally in males and females. Causes include fibromuscular dysplasia, cystic medial necrosis, and trauma. Symptoms and Signs of Aortic Branch Aneurysms Many aortic branch aneurysms are asymptomatic. Symptoms (when they occur) vary depending on the location and artery affected. Subclavian aneurysms can cause local pain, a pulsating sensation, venous thrombosis or edema (due to compression of adjacent veins), distal ischemic symptoms, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve), or impaired motor and sensory function (due to compression of the brachial plexus). Splenic artery aneurysm may cause left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Hepatic artery aneurysm may cause right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Superior mesenteric aneurysms may cause generalized abdominal pain and ischemic colitis. Regardless of location, mycotic or inflammatory aneurysms may cause local pain and sequelae of systemic infection (eg, fever, malaise, weight loss). Diagnosis of Aortic Branch Aneurysms Ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) With the routine availability of axial diagnostic imaging, many
