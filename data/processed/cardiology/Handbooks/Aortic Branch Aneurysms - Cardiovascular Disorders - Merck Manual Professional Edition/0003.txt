of systemic infection (eg, fever, malaise, weight loss). Diagnosis of Aortic Branch Aneurysms Ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) With the routine availability of axial diagnostic imaging, many aneurysms are diagnosed before rupture. Calcified asymptomatic or occult aneurysms may be seen on radiographs or other imaging tests done for other reasons. Ultrasound, CT angiography, or MRI is typically used to detect or confirm aortic branch aneurysms. Conventional angiography is typically reserved for treatment or to evaluate distal organ perfusion. Treatment of Aortic Branch Aneurysms Open repair or sometimes endovascular stent grafting Treatment is surgical removal and replacement with a graft. Endovascular repair is an option for some patients. The decision to repair asymptomatic aneurysms is based on risk of rupture, extent and location of the aneurysm, and perioperative risk. Surgery for subclavian artery aneurysms may involve removal of a cervical rib (if present) before repair and replacement. For splanchnic aneurysms, risk of rupture and death is as high as 10% and is particularly high for women of childbearing age and for patients with hepatic aneurysms (> 35%) (1). Elective repair of splanchnic aneurysms is therefore indicated for Aneurysms > 2 cm in diameter Aneurysms in pregnant women or
