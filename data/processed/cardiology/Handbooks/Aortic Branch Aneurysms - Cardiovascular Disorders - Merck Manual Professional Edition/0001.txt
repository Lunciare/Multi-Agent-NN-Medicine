Aneurysms may occur in any major aortic branch; such aneurysms are much less common than abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysms. Symptoms vary depending on the location and artery affected but may include pain in areas where the aneurysm compresses nearby structures. Diagnosis is made by ultrasound, CT angiography, or MRI. Treatment is endovascular stent grafting or surgery. (See also Overview of Aortic Aneurysms, Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms, and Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms.) Risk factors for aneurysms of aortic branch arteries include Atherosclerosis Hypertension Cigarette smoking Older age Localized infection can cause mycotic aneurysms. Subclavian artery aneurysms sometimes occur in patients with cervical ribs or thoracic outlet compression syndrome. Aneurysms of the arteries of the splanchnic circulation are uncommon. About 60% occur in the splenic artery, 20% in the hepatic artery, 5.5% in the superior mesenteric artery (1). Splenic artery aneurysms are more common in females than males (4:1). Causes include medial fibromuscular dysplasia, portal hypertension, multiple pregnancies, penetrating or blunt abdominal trauma, pancreatitis, and infection. Hepatic artery aneurysms occur in more males than females (2:1). They may result from previous abdominal trauma, illicit IV drug use, medial degeneration of the arterial wall, or periarterial inflammation. Renal artery aneurysms may dissect or rupture,
