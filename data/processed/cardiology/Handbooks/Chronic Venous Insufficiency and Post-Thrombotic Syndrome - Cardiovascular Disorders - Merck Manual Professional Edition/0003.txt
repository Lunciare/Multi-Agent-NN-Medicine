Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome

Venous Insufficiency Clinically evident chronic venous insufficiency may not cause any symptoms but always causes signs; post-thrombotic syndrome always causes symptoms. Both disorders are a concern because their symptoms can mimic those of acute DVT and both can lead to substantial reductions in physical activity and quality of life. Symptoms include a sense of fullness, heaviness, aching, cramps, pain, tiredness, and paresthesias in the legs; these symptoms worsen with standing or walking and are relieved by rest and elevation. Pruritus may accompany skin changes. Signs occur along a continuum: no changes to varicose veins (rare) to edema to stasis dermatitis on the lower legs and at the ankles, with or without ulceration (see table Clinical Classification of Chronic Venous Insufficiency). The calf may be painful when compressed.
