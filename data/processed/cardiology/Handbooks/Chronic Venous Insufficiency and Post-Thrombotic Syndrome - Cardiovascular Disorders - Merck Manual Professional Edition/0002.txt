veins (2). in DVT), venous valvular insufficiency, or decreased contraction of muscles surrounding the veins (eg, due to immobility) decrease forward venous flow and increase venous pressure (venous hypertension). Fluid accumulation in the lower extremities (eg, in right heart failure) can also contribute by causing venous hypertension. Prolonged venous hypertension causes tissue edema, inflammation, and hypoxia, leading to symptoms. Pressure may be transmitted to superficial veins if valves in perforator veins, which connect deep and superficial veins, are ineffective. The most common risk factor for chronic venous insufficiency is Deep venous thrombosis Other risk factors include Trauma Older age Obesity Sitting or standing for long periods Pregnancy Idiopathic cases are often attributed to a history of occult DVT. Post-thrombotic syndrome is symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency that follows DVT. Risk factors for post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with DVT include proximal thrombosis, recurrent ipsilateral 2 DVT, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 kg/m . Age, female sex, and estrogen therapy are also associated with the syndrome. Symptoms and Signs of Chronic Venous Insufficiency Clinically evident chronic venous insufficiency may not cause any symptoms but always causes signs; post-thrombotic syndrome always causes symptoms. Both disorders are a concern because their symptoms can
