with calf compression) on a scale of 0 (absent or minimal) to 3 (severe) is increasingly recognized as a standard diagnostic tool of disease severity (1). Scores of 5 to 14 on 2 visits separated by ≥ 6 months indicate mild-to-moderate disease, and scores of ≥ 15 indicate severe disease. Lower-extremity duplex ultrasonography reliably excludes or confirms DVT. Absence of edema and a reduced ankle-brachial index suggest peripheral arterial disease rather than chronic venous insufficiency and post-thrombotic syndrome. Diagnosis reference 1. Kahn SR. Measurement properties of the Villalta scale to define and classify the severity of the post-thrombotic syndrome.

However, all interventions may be difficult to implement. Elevating the leg above the level of the right atrium decreases venous hypertension and edema, is appropriate for all patients, and should be done a minimum of 3 times a day for ≥ 30 minutes. However, 6/8 most patients cannot reliably adhere to this schedule
