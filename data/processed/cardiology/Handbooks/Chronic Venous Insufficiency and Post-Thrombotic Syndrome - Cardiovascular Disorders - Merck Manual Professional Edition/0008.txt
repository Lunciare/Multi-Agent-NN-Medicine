Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome

be put on when patients awaken, before leg edema worsens with activity, and should exert maximal pressure at the ankles and gradually less pressure proximally. Adherence to this treatment varies; many patients consider stockings irritating, restricting, or cosmetically undesirable; many patients have difficulty putting them on. Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) uses a pump to cyclically inflate and deflate hollow plastic leggings. IPC provides external compression, squeezing blood and fluid out of the lower legs. It effectively treats severe post-thrombotic syndrome and venous stasis ulcers but may be no more effective than compression stockings alone and is much less practical for patients to adhere to on an ongoing basis. Topical wound care is important in venous stasis ulcer management. When an Unna boot (zinc oxide– impregnated bandages) is properly applied, covered by compression bandages, and changed weekly, almost all ulcers heal. Occlusive dressings (eg, hydrocolloids such as aluminum chloride) provide a moist environment for wound healing and promote growth of new tissue; they may be used for ulcers with light to moderate exudate, but they probably add little to simple Unna bandaging. Dry dressings are absorptive, making them most appropriate for heavier exudate. Medications have no role in routine treatment of
