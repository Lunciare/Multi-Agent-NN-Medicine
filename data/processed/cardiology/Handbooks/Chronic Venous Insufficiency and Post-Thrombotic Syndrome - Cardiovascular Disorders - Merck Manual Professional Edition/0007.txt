is appropriate for all patients, and should be done a minimum of 3 times a day for ≥ 30 minutes. However, 6/8 most patients cannot reliably adhere to this schedule during the day. Compression is recommended for treatment and prevention of the effects of chronic venous insufficiency (ie, edema, venous ulcers) and is indicated for all patients. Although the data are mixed as to whether compression stockings prevent post-thrombotic syndrome, they are useful to reduce symptoms of swelling, pain, and tightness that may occur after deep vein thrombosis (1). Elastic bandages are used initially until edema and ulcers resolve and leg size stabilizes; commercial compression stockings are then used. Stockings that provide 20 to 30 mm Hg of distal circumferential pressure are indicated for smaller varicose veins and mild chronic venous insufficiency; 30 to 40 mm Hg is indicated for larger varicose veins and moderate to severe disease. Infrequently, higher compression pressures (eg, > 40 mm Hg) can be used but may not be tolerated for long-term use. Stockings should be put on when patients awaken, before leg edema worsens with activity, and should exert maximal pressure at the ankles and gradually less pressure proximally. Adherence to this treatment varies;
