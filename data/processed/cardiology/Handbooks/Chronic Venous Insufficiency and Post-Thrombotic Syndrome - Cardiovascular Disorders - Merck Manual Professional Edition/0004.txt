venous stasis and 5 healed ulceration Skin changes due to venous stasis and 6 active ulceration * May occur idiopathically without chronic venous insufficiency. Venous stasis dermatitis consists of erythema, hyperpigmentation, induration, venous ectasia, lipodermatosclerosis (fibrosing subcutaneous panniculitis), lichenification, and venous stasis ulcers. Erythema may be difficult to appreciate in dark skin. 3/8 Stasis Dermatitis (Chronic Changes) Hide Details Chronic stasis dermatitis may appear as fibrotic skin thickening and hyperpigmentation. The changes are characteristic in both light skin (top) and dark skin (bottom), here appearing more pronounced in the bottom photo. Images provided by Thomas Habif, MD. Venous stasis ulcers may develop spontaneously or after affected skin is scratched or injured. They typically occur around the medial malleolus, tend to be shallow and moist, and may be malodorous (especially when poorly cared for) or painful. They do not penetrate the deep fascia. In contrast, ulcers due to peripheral arterial disease eventually expose tendons or bone. Venous Stasis Ulcer Manifestations 4/8 Early Venous Stasis Ulcer Venous stasis includes lichenification and hyperpigmentation. A shallow ulcer is developing superior to the medial malleolus. Large Venous Stasis Ulcer This large venous stasis ulcer is surrounded by brawny induration. Stasis Dermatitis (Ulcer) Venous stasis ulcers
