A shallow ulcer is developing superior to the medial malleolus. Large Venous Stasis Ulcer This large venous stasis ulcer is surrounded by brawny induration. Stasis Dermatitis (Ulcer) Venous stasis ulcers develop as a result of inadequately treated stasis dermatitis; they may quickly follow the first signs of stasis dermatitis.

Penne-Casanova/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Leg edema tends to be unilateral or asymmetric; bilateral symmetric edema is more likely to result from a systemic disorder (eg, heart failure, hypoalbuminemia) or certain medications (eg, calcium channel blockers). In general, unless the lower extremities are adequately cared for, patients with any manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency or post-thrombotic syndrome are at risk of progression to more advanced forms. Diagnosis of Chronic Venous Insufficiency Clinical evaluation Ultrasonography to exclude DVT Diagnosis is usually based on history and physical examination. A clinical scoring system that ranks 5 symptoms (pain, cramps, heaviness, pruritus, paresthesia) and 6 signs (edema, hyperpigmentation, induration, venous ectasia, blanching hyperemia, pain with calf compression) on a scale of 0 (absent or minimal) to 3 (severe) is increasingly recognized as a standard diagnostic tool of disease severity (1). Scores of 5 to
