Chronic venous insufficiency is impaired venous return, sometimes causing lower extremity discomfort, edema, and skin changes. Post-thrombotic (postphlebitic ) syndrome is symptomatic chronic venous insufficiency after deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Causes of chronic venous insufficiency are disorders that result in venous hypertension, usually through venous damage or incompetence of venous valves, as occurs (for example) after DVT. Diagnosis is by history, physical examination, and duplex ultrasonography. Treatment is compression, wound care, and, rarely, surgery. Prevention requires adequate treatment of DVT and compression stockings. Prevalence estimates of chronic venous insufficiency vary widely, reflecting differences in the study populations (1). Post-thrombotic syndrome may affect up to 50% of patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and can have a substantial effect on quality of life. Post-thrombotic syndrome can range in severity from mild leg swelling to debilitating venous leg ulcers; 20 to 35% of patients will develop moderate to severe disease. Post-thrombotic syndrome is more common in patients with more extensive DVT, such as those with involvement of the common femoral and/or iliofemoral veins (2). in DVT), venous valvular insufficiency, or decreased contraction of muscles surrounding the veins (eg, due to immobility) decrease forward venous flow and increase venous pressure (venous hypertension).
