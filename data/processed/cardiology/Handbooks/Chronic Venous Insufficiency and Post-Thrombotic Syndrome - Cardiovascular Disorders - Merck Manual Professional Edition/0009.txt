Chronic Venous Insufficiency and Post-Thrombotic Syndrome

moderate exudate, but they probably add little to simple Unna bandaging. Dry dressings are absorptive, making them most appropriate for heavier exudate. Medications have no role in routine treatment of chronic venous insufficiency, although many patients are given aspirin, topical corticosteroids, diuretics for edema, or antibiotics. Surgery (eg, venous ligation, stripping, valve reconstruction) is also typically ineffective. Grafting autologous skin or skin created from epidermal keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts may be an option for patients with stasis ulcers refractory to all other measures (2); however, there is a risk that the graft may reulcerate, especially if there is ongoing venous hypertension. Prevention of Chronic Venous Insufficiency Primary prevention of chronic venous insufficiency involves adequate anticoagulation after DVT and use of compression stockings for up to 2 years after DVT or lower extremity venous trauma. However, a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing compression stockings with placebo (ie, either none or sham-compression stockings) failed to show a significant reduction in post-thrombotic syndrome (1). Lifestyle changes (eg, weight loss, regular exercise, reduction of dietary sodium) can decrease risk by decreasing lower extremity venous pressure. Key Points Skin changes range on a continuum from normal skin or mildly ectatic veins to severe stasis dermatitis
