Peripheral artery aneurysms are abnormal dilations of the peripheral arteries caused by weakening of the arterial wall. Approximately 80% of peripheral artery aneurysms are popliteal aneurysms, and the majority of the remaining are iliofemoral aneurysms (1, 2). Aneurysms at these locations may accompany abdominal aortic aneurysms, and > 50% are bilateral. Rupture is relatively infrequent, but these aneurysms may lead to thromboembolism with acute distal artery occlusion. Peripheral artery aneurysms occur in men much more often than in women (at least 6:1), and mean age at presentation is in the 60s (3). Aneurysms in arteries supplying the arm are relatively rare and often traumatic; they may cause limb ischemia, distal embolism, and, when extending to the aortic arch, stroke.
