Peripheral artery aneurysms are usually asymptomatic at the time of detection. Thrombosis or embolism (or rarely, aneurysm rupture) often leads to acute limb ischemia, in which extremities are painful, cold, pale, paresthetic, and/or pulseless. Infectious aneurysms may cause local pain, fever, malaise, and weight loss. Diagnosis is by ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography. Popliteal aneurysms may be suspected when physical examination detects an enlarged, pulsatile artery; the diagnosis is confirmed by imaging tests. Risk of rupture of extremity aneurysms is low but increases with increasing diameter above 2 cm. For leg artery aneurysms, surgical repair is elective. Repair is recommended for all symptomatic popliteal aneurysms, and for asymptomatic popliteal aneurysm ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Femoral artery aneurysms should be repaired when symptomatic or when twice the size of the normal blood vessel (4). Surgical repair is indicated for some arm artery aneurysms (5). The affected segment of artery is typically excised or ligated and replaced with a graft. Overall limb salvage rate after surgical repair of upper extremity aneurysms is 94 to 98% (6, 7). In certain patients, placement of an endovascular stent graft is another option for repair (8). Key Points Peripheral artery aneurysms occur mainly
