Aortic Regurgitation

loud, sharp or slapping second heart sound (S2) caused by increased elastic aortic recoil. The murmur of AR is often unimpressive, beginning soon after the aortic component of S2 (A2); it is loudest at the third or fourth left parasternal intercostal space or at the apex. The murmur is heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient is leaning forward, with breath held at end-expiration. It increases in volume in response to maneuvers that increase afterload (eg, squatting, isometric handgrip). If AR is slight, the murmur may occur only in early diastole. If LV diastolic pressure is very high, the murmur is short because aortic and LV diastolic pressures equalize earlier in diastole. Other abnormal sounds include a forward ejection and backward regurgitant flow (to-and-fro) murmur, an ejection click soon after the S1, and an aortic ejection flow murmur. A diastolic murmur heard near the axilla or mid left thorax (Cole-Cecil murmur) is caused by fusion of the aortic murmur with the S3, which is due to simultaneous filling of LV from the left atrium and AR. An Austin Flint murmur may mimic the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis. Visible signs include: Head bobbing (de Musset sign)
