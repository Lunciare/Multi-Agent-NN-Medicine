Aortic Regurgitation

surgical aortic valve replacement or (less commonly) valve repair . An aortic bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months postoperatively, but a mechanical valve requires lifetime anticoagulation using warfarin. Long-term non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or warfarin can be considered in patients with a bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation. (See also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease.) Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is challenging in AR because of the dilated aortic annulus and lack of sufficient leaflet calcification, leading to prosthetic valve migration and/or paravalvular leak (1). Patients who are not candidates for surgery benefit from pharmacologic treatment of heart failure. Beta-blockers should be used with caution because they block compensatory tachycardia and worsen AR by prolonging diastole. Intra-aortic balloon pump insertion is contraindicated because the diastolic balloon inflation worsens AR. Patients with severe AR who do not meet the criteria for intervention should be reevaluated by physical examination and echocardiography every 6 to 12 months. Antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is not recommended for aortic regurgitation except for patients who have had valve replacement (see table Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures). Indications for intervention Intervention is indicated when: AR
