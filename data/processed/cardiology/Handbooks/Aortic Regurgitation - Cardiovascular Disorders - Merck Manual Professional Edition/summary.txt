Aortic regurgitation (AR) is incomplete closure of the aortic valve, causing backflow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. Causes include valvular degeneration, aortic root dilation, or both, related to underlying bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dissection, rheumatic fever, endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration, and connective tissue (eg, Marfan syndrome) or rheumatologic diseases. Symptoms include exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain. Signs include widened pulse pressure and an early diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Treatment is surgical aortic valve replacement or repair.
