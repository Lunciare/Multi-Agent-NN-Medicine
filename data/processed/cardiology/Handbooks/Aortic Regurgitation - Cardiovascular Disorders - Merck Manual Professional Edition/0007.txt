Aortic Regurgitation

physical examination findings and confirmed by echocardiography. Doppler echocardiography is the test of choice to detect and quantify the magnitude of regurgitant blood flow and grade overall severity of the AR. Two-dimensional echocardiography can quantify aortic root size and anatomy and LV function. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional echocardiography can be used to evaluate leaflet morphology. Severe chronic aortic regurgitation is suggested by any of the following: Color Doppler jet width ≥ 65% of the LV outflow tract diameter Holodiastolic flow reversal in the abdominal aorta (specific for severe AR) Regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL/beat Regurgitation fraction ≥ 50% Vena contracta > 6 mm (the narrowest diameter of the fluid stream downstream of the abnormal valve orifice) Echocardiography can also assess severity of pulmonary hypertension secondary to LV failure, detect vegetations or pericardial effusions (eg, in aortic dissection), and provide information about prognosis. Coarctation is associated with bicuspid valve and is detected echocardiography by placing the ultrasound transducer at the suprasternal notch, as well as evaluating the Doppler pattern in the abdominal aorta. Transesophageal echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography provide additional delineation of aortic dilatation and valve anatomy, which is especially useful when surgical repair is being considered. If the aorta is
