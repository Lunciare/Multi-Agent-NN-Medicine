Aortic Regurgitation

common. 2/9 As chronic disease progresses, systolic blood pressure increases while diastolic blood pressure decreases, creating a widened pulse pressure. With time, the LV impulse may become enlarged, increased in amplitude, and displaced downward and laterally, with systolic depression of the entire left parasternal area, giving a rocking motion to the left chest. The typical heart murmur of aortic regurgitation is a blowing, high-pitched, diastolic decrescendo murmur beginning soon after the first heart sound. It is generally louder in chronic AR, and may be soft or absent in acute AR even if severe. However, a mid-to-late diastolic rumble heard at the apex (Austin Flint murmur) may result from rapid regurgitant flow into the LV, causing mitral valve leaflet vibration at the peak of atrial flow. AUDIO Aortic Regurgitation AUDIO Austin Flint Murmur A systolic apical or carotid thrill may become palpable in later stages of AR; it is caused by large forward stroke volumes and low aortic diastolic pressure. Additional auscultatory findings may include a normal S1 and a nonsplit, loud, sharp or slapping second heart sound (S2) caused by increased elastic aortic recoil. The murmur of AR is often unimpressive, beginning soon after the aortic component of S2 (A2);
