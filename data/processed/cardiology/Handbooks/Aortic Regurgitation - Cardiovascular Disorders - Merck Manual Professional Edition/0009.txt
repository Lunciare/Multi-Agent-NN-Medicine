Aortic Regurgitation

artery disease (1), which may need concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery. First-degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid valve should be screened using echocardiography because up to 15% will be similarly affected (2). 5/9 Phonocardiographic Characteristics of Heart Murmurs Diagnosis references 1.

These medications do not reduce the severity of aortic regurgitation or alter disease progression. Intervention is either surgical aortic valve replacement or (less commonly) valve repair . An aortic bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months postoperatively, but a mechanical valve requires lifetime anticoagulation using
