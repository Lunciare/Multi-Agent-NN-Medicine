Aortic Regurgitation

simultaneous filling of LV from the left atrium and AR. An Austin Flint murmur may mimic the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis. Visible signs include: Head bobbing (de Musset sign) Pulsation of the fingernail capillaries (Quincke sign, best seen while applying slight pressure) Pulsation of the uvula (Müller sign) Palpable signs include: 3/9 Large-volume pulse with rapid rise and fall (slapping, water-hammer, or collapsing pulse) Pulsation of the carotid arteries (Corrigan sign) Pulsation of the retinal arteries (Becker sign) Pulsation of the liver (Rosenbach sign) Pulsation of the spleen (Gerhard sign) Blood pressure findings may include: Popliteal systolic pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg higher than brachial pressure (Hill sign) A fall in diastolic blood pressure of > 15 mm Hg with arm elevation (Mayne sign) Auscultatory signs include a: Sharp sound heard over the femoral pulse (pistol-shot sound, or Traube sign) Femoral systolic bruit distal and a diastolic bruit proximal to arterial compression (Duroziez sign) Diagnosis of Aortic Regurgitation Echocardiography Diagnosis of aortic regurgitation is suspected based on history and physical examination findings and confirmed by echocardiography. Doppler echocardiography is the test of choice to detect and quantify the magnitude of regurgitant blood flow and grade overall severity of the
