Aortic Regurgitation

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is incomplete closure of the aortic valve, causing backflow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. Causes include valvular degeneration, aortic root dilation, or both, related to underlying bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dissection, rheumatic fever, endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration, and connective tissue (eg, Marfan syndrome) or rheumatologic diseases. Symptoms include exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain. Signs include widened pulse pressure and an early diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Treatment is surgical aortic valve replacement or repair. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) Etiology of Aortic Regurgitation Aortic regurgitation, also called aortic insufficiency, may be acute (very uncommonly) or chronic. The primary causes of acute aortic regurgitation, are: Dissection of the ascending aorta Infective endocarditis The primary causes of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults are: Degeneration of the aortic valve and root (with or without a bicuspid valve) Infective endocarditis Myxomatous degeneration Rheumatic fever Thoracic aortic aneurysm Trauma 1/9 Common causes of chronic aortic regurgitation in children are: Ventricular septal defect with aortic valve prolapse Bicuspid aortic valve Aortic regurgitation due to myxomatous degeneration may develop in patients with Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
