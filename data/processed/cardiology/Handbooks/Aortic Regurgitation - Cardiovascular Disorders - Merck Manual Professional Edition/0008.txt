abdominal aorta. Transesophageal echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography provide additional delineation of aortic dilatation and valve anatomy, which is especially useful when surgical repair is being considered. If the aorta is enlarged, gated computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to evaluate the entire thoracic aorta. MRI also can help assess LV function and degree of AR when echocardiographic images are suboptimal. 4/9 ECG and chest radiograph should also be performed. ECG may show repolarization abnormalities with or without QRS voltage criteria of LV hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and T-wave inversion with ST-segment depression in precordial leads. Chest radiograph may show cardiomegaly and a prominent aortic root in patients with chronic progressive AR. If AR is severe, signs of pulmonary edema and HF may also be present. Exercise testing may help assess functional capacity and symptoms in patients with documented AR and equivocal symptoms. Coronary angiography should be performed before surgery, even if no angina is present because approximately 20% of patients with severe AR have significant coronary artery disease (1), which may need concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery. First-degree relatives of patients with a bicuspid valve should be screened using echocardiography because up to 15% will
