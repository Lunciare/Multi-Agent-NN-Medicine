Rarely, aortic regurgitation is caused by seronegative spondyloarthropathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis associated with ulcerative colitis, luetic (syphilitic) aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, supravalvular or discrete membranous subaortic stenosis, Takayasu arteritis, rupture of a sinus of Valsalva, acromegaly, and giant cell arteritis. Pathophysiology of Aortic Regurgitation In aortic regurgitation, volume overload of the left ventricle (LV) occurs because during diastole the LV receives blood regurgitated from the aorta in addition to blood from the left atrium. In acute aortic regurgitation, the LV does not have time to dilate to accommodate the increased volume, which can then cause a rapid increase in left ventricular pressure and, subsequently, pulmonary edema and decreased cardiac output. In chronic aortic regurgitation, LV hypertrophy and dilation can occur gradually, so normal left ventricular pressures and cardiac output are maintained. But decompensation eventually develops, ultimately causing arrhythmias, LV dysfunction, and heart failure (HF). Symptoms and Signs of Aortic Regurgitation Acute aortic regurgitation can cause symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, edema)
