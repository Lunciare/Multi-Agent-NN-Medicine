Aortic Regurgitation
KEYWORDS: aortic, valve, regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, heart, patients, murmur, echocardiography, diastolic, pressure, aortic valve, chronic, left, failure, include

for aortic regurgitation except for patients who have had valve replacement (see table Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures). Indications for intervention Intervention is indicated when: AR is severe and is causing symptoms AR is severe and is causing LV dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] ≤ 55%, LV end-systolic 2 dimension > 50 mm, or indexed to body surface area > 25 mm/m ) AR is severe and at least 3 serial studies show a progressive decline in EF to 55 to 60%, or progressive increase in LV end-diastolic dimension to > 65 mm Patients with an enlarged ascending aorta frequently have AR as well as an increased risk of aortic dissection. A high risk of aortic dissection may be the first indication for cardiac surgery, which should be undertaken when Ascending aortic diameter is > 55 mm Bicuspid valve is present with ascending aortic diameter 50 to 55 mm and aortic growth rate > 5 mm/year, aortic coarctation, or a family history of aortic dissection 7/9 Marfan syndrome is present with ascending aortic diameter > 50 mm (or less if the aortic growth rate is > 5 mm/year) or a family history of aortic dissection at <
