Brugada Syndrome

sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, certain antidepressants and antipsychotics, lithium, alcohol, and cocaine (3). Diagnosis of Brugada Syndrome Electrocardiography (ECG) Family history Provocative testing to induce characteristic ECG changes Genetic testing 2/6 Diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained cardiac arrest or syncope or a family history of such when the affected people do not have structural heart disease. Initial diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based on a characteristic ECG pattern, the type 1 Brugada ECG pattern (see figure Type 1 Brugada ECG Pattern). The type 1 Brugada ECG pattern has prominent ST elevation in V1 and V2 (sometimes involving V3) that causes the QRS complex in these leads to resemble right bundle branch block. The ST segment is coved and descends to an inverted T-wave. Only a spontaneous type 1 pattern is considered diagnostic for Brugada syndrome according to the Shanghai Brugada syndrome score (1). Lesser degrees of these patterns (type 2 and type 3 Brugada ECG patterns) are not considered diagnostic. The type 2 and type 3 patterns may change to a type 1 pattern spontaneously, with fever, or in response to medications. The latter is the basis of a challenge diagnostic test usually using IV ajmaline, procainamide,
