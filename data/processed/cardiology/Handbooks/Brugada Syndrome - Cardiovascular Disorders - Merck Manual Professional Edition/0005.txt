Brugada Syndrome

cardiomyopathy, acute pulmonary embolism, and left anterior descending coronary artery of conus branch of the right coronary artery occlusion (1). 3/6 Type 1 Brugada ECG Pattern Prominent J-point elevation to a coved ST segment, leading to an inverted T-wave in leads V 1 and V . 2 Treatment of Brugada Syndrome Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Screening of family members Patients with a spontaneous or provoked type 1 Brugada syndrome ECG pattern and recent unexplained syncope, sustained VT, or cardiac arrest should typically have an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) (1). When frequent ICD discharges need to be suppressed, quinidine, which blocks the transient outward potassium current that may be increased in Brugada syndrome, may be efficacious. IV isoproterenol has also been used if the cause of the frequently recurrent arrhythmias appears transient and reversible (2). 4/6 In patients refractory to such therapy, catheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate may be considered (3). Best treatment of Brugada syndrome in patients diagnosed based on ECG changes and family history but who do not have syncope or arrhythmia is unclear, although they do have increased risk of sudden death. Scoring systems have been developed to aid in determining if an ICD is appropriate therapy in such
