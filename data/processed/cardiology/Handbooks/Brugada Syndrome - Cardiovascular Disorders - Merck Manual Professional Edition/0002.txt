right ventricular outflow tract that produce characteristic right precordial ECG changes and a 1/6 propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although different mutations have been reported, most are in the SCN5A gene, producing a loss-of-function of the inward sodium current (1). Typically, patients have no structural heart disease. Nevertheless, relationships with other genetic and acquired structural heart diseases are increasingly being recognized, as are overlap syndromes with long QT syndrome type 3, with the early repolarization syndrome, and with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Symptoms and Signs of Brugada Syndrome In some patients, Brugada syndrome has no clinical expression. However, in many patients it leads to syncope or sudden cardiac death due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular arrhythmias can cause sudden death during sleep. About 10% of patients develop atrial tachyarrhythmias, predominantly atrial fibrillation (1), and some even present with atrial fibrillation (2). Events occur more often at night and are not usually related to exercise. Events may also be brought on by fever and by certain medications, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, certain antidepressants and antipsychotics, lithium, alcohol, and cocaine (3).
