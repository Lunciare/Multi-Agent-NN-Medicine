Brugada Syndrome

Brugada syndrome is an inherited channelopathy, characterized by large J- waves and coved ST elevation with associated T-wave inversion in leads V1-V3, that causes an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), leading to syncope and sudden death. Diagnosis is by ECG and often provocative electrodiagnostic testing and/or genetic testing. Treatment is with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. Family members should be screened. Overall the incidence of Brugada syndrome is approximately 5 in 10,000 (1) but shows wide variation with ethnicity and, consequently geographical region, being highest is Southeast Asia (37 in 10,000), the Middle East (18/10,000), and the rest of Asia (17 in 10,000) and much lower in Europe (1/10,000) and North America (0.5/10,000) (1). The majority of patients with clinically apparent Brugada syndrome are male (85%) (1). Pathophysiology of Brugada Syndrome Brugada syndrome results from mutations that Decrease inward sodium or calcium currents OR Increase early outward potassium currents These abnormalities lead to early loss of the action potential plateau, particularly in the epicardial cells of the right ventricular outflow tract that produce characteristic right precordial ECG changes and a 1/6 propensity to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although different mutations have been reported, most are in the SCN5A gene,
