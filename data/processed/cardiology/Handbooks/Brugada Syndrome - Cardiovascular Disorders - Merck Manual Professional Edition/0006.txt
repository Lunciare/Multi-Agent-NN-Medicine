or arrhythmia is unclear, although they do have increased risk of sudden death. Scoring systems have been developed to aid in determining if an ICD is appropriate therapy in such patients (4). Prevention of Brugada Syndrome Arrhythmias It is important to avoid factors that can trigger arrhythmias. Patients should monitor their temperature during infectious illness and take antipyretic therapy for fever. When possible, clinicians should stop any predisposing medications and prescribe alternatives. Patients should avoid substances, particularly cocaine and excessive alcohol, that are arrhythmogenic in Brugada syndrome Key Points Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder causing characteristic ECG changes and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias causing syncope and sometimes sudden cardiac death at a relatively young age. Risk factors for symptomatic arrhythmias include fever and numerous medications and other substances (eg, alcohol, cocaine). Diagnosis is by ECG, sometimes with provocative testing. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be required.
