may change to a type 1 pattern spontaneously, with fever, or in response to medications. The latter is the basis of a challenge diagnostic test usually using IV ajmaline, procainamide, flecainide or pilsicainide. Scores have been developed to aid in diagnosing Brugada syndrome in borderline cases (1). In such cases, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is considered possible. Application of clinical, family history, and genetic criteria is the required to establish the diagnosis (1). The role of electrophysiologic testing is currently debated. Inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation with programmed ventricular stimulation limited to 2 extra stimuli received a class IIa indication for patients who are asymptomatic with a spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern for risk stratification (2) but is not part of the Shanghai diagnostic scoring system (1). Genetic testing is usually recommended but has a yield of approximately 20% (3). The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome includes considering, and ruling out, other disorders that produce similar cardiac findings, including hypothermia, hypocalcemia, right bundle branch block, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, acute pulmonary embolism, and left anterior descending coronary artery of conus branch of the right coronary artery occlusion (1). 3/6 Type 1 Brugada ECG Pattern Prominent J-point elevation to
