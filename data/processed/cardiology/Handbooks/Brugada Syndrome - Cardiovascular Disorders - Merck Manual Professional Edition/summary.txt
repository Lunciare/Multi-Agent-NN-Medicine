Brugada syndrome is an inherited channelopathy, characterized by large J- waves and coved ST elevation with associated T-wave inversion in leads V1-V3, that causes an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), leading to syncope and sudden death. Diagnosis is by ECG and often provocative electrodiagnostic testing and/or genetic testing. Treatment is with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator. Family members should be screened. Overall the incidence of Brugada syndrome is approximately 5 in 10,000 (1) but shows wide variation with ethnicity and, consequently geographical region, being highest is Southeast Asia (37 in 10,000), the Middle East (18/10,000), and the rest of Asia (17 in 10,000) and much lower in Europe (1/10,000) and North America (0.5/10,000) (1). The majority of patients with clinically apparent Brugada syndrome are male (85%) (1).
