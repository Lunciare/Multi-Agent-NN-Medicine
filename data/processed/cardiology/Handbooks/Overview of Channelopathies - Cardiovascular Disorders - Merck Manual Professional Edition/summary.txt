Channelopathies are a group of genetic, autoimmune, or inflammatory conditions that alter cardiomyocyte ion channel function in a manner that predisposes to bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias in the absence of a structural heart disorder. Sudden cardiac death may occur. The ion channels affected include those responsible for the inward sodium or calcium currents and those responsible for the outward potassium current. Either gain of function or loss of function in these ion channels, particularly when the abnormal channels are unevenly distributed, fosters abnormal electrophysiologic environments. The abnormal electrophysiology may be favorable to one or both of the following: Failure of impulse formation or conduction, which may lead to bradyarrhythmias Re-entry and mechanisms of abnormal automaticity, leading to tachyarrhythmias The most common genetic channelopathies are the Brugada syndrome (BrS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), early repolarization syndrome (ERS), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF), isolated progressive cardiac conduction disease (isolated PCCD), long QT interval syndromes (LQTS), and short QT interval syndrome (SQTS).
