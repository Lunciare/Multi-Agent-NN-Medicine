Overview of Channelopathies

sudden cardiac deaths in non-athletes ≤ 35 years of age (1) and undocumented genetic channelopathies are generally considered to be the etiology of sudden death in the 35% of such patients with no identifiable structural heart disease at autopsy (1). Systemic rheumatic disorders, including Sjogren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory disorders producing cytokines that affect cardiomyocyte ion channel function are increasingly being recognized as causes of channelopathies. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies may produce a long QT interval syndrome by inhibiting the outward potassium channel that is related to the human ether-a- go-go-related gene (hERG). Also, transplacental exposure to anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in utero is responsible for some cases of immune-mediated congenital AV block. Autoimmune antibody production and inflammatory cytokines may also be responsible for temporal variability in arrhythmia propensities, such as the deleterious effects of fever in patients with Brugada syndrome. Diagnostic evaluation for genetic channelopathies usually includes ECG, ambulatory cardiac monitoring, and sometimes exercise testing. Genetic testing is frequently done but may not be recommended if its sensitivity for a particular disorder is low. Patients diagnosed with a channelopathy should have regular follow-up with ECG and ambulatory cardiac monitoring to detect occult arrhythmias. Family members are at risk of disease
