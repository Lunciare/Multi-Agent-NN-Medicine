Overview of Channelopathies

particular disorder is low. Patients diagnosed with a channelopathy should have regular follow-up with ECG and ambulatory cardiac monitoring to detect occult arrhythmias. Family members are at risk of disease and should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia), ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and, sometimes, exercise testing to identify the presence of disease prior to its expression as sudden death. Genetic testing of family members is done when the index case has a known mutation. Typically, parents and siblings are tested first and then other relatives are tested based on results of parent testing and the mode of inheritance (cascade testing). Family members also require ongoing clinical monitoring (eg, every 1 to 3 years) for development of arrhythmias unless the genetic mutation is absent. Treatments depend on disease manifestations, but all patients should avoid known triggers (eg, exercise, certain medications). Patients with clinical or ECG findings of significant ventricular arrhythmias typically require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), often one with pacemaker functionality. Some disorders benefit from beta-blockers and/or other antiarrhythmic medications.
