Superficial Venous Thrombosis
By James D. Douketis, MD, McMaster University
Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary
Reviewed/Revised Dec 2023
Superficial venous thrombosis is a blood clot in a superficial vein of the upper
or lower extremities or, less commonly, in one or more veins of the chest or
breast (Mondor disease).
Superficial venous thrombosis in the upper extremity most commonly results from IV infusions or
catheterization. Varicose veins seem to be the main risk factor for superficial venous thrombosis in the
lower extremity, especially among women. Superficial venous thrombi rarely cause serious
complications and rarely become emboli.
Typically, patients present with pain, tenderness, or an indurated cord along a palpable superficial vein.
The overlying skin is usually warm and erythematous.
Migratory superficial venous thrombosis, which develops, resolves, and recurs in normal veins of the
arms, legs, and torso at various times, is a possible harbinger of pancreatic cancer and other
adenocarcinomas (Trousseau syndrome).
Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination. Patients with superficial venous thrombosis
above the knee have an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and should probably have
ultrasonography (1).

Treatment of Superficial Venous Thrombosis
Warm compresses and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Sometimes anticoagulation
Treatment of superficial venous thrombosis traditionally involves warm compresses and NSAIDs.

In patients with extensive superficial venous thrombosis, anticoagulation (eg, with low molecular weight
heparin, fondaparinux) is often beneficial (1). The optimal regimen and duration are unknown, but most
experts recommend treating for about 1 month using either a low molecular weight heparin (eg,
enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once a day) or fondaparinux (2.5 mg subcutaneously once a day).
