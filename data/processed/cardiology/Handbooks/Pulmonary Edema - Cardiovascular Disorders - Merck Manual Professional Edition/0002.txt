with pulmonary edema present with extreme dyspnea, restlessness, and anxiety with a sense of suffocation. Cough, possibly producing blood-tinged sputum, pallor, cyanosis, and marked diaphoresis are common; some patients froth at the mouth. Frank hemoptysis is uncommon. The pulse is rapid and low volume, and blood pressure (BP) is variable. Marked hypertension indicates significant cardiac reserve; hypotension with systolic BP < 100 mg Hg is ominous. Inspiratory fine crackles are widely dispersed anteriorly and posteriorly over both lung fields. Marked wheezing may occur. Noisy respiratory efforts often make cardiac auscultation difficult; a summation gallop—merger of third (S3) and fourth (S4) heart sounds—may be present. "Cardiac asthma" refers to coughing, wheezing, breathlessness, and sometimes paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, that occur with left heart failure and pulmonary edema. Signs of right ventricular failure (eg, neck vein distention, peripheral edema) may be present. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Edema History and physical examination showing severe dyspnea and pulmonary crackles Chest radiograph Sometimes chest ultrasound Sometimes arterial blood gas analysis Sometimes serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-pro BNP (NT-pro-BNP) Additional acute heart failure testing as indicated A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation can mimic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure.
