Pulmonary Edema

N-terminal-pro BNP (NT-pro-BNP) Additional acute heart failure testing as indicated A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation can mimic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. While a patient without any prior history of cardiac disease may present in new-onset heart failure with acute pulmonary edema, patients with severe dyspnea due to COPD usually have a history of COPD, although they may be too dyspneic to relate it. Imaging in Patients With Pulmonary Edema Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Pulmonary Edema 2/8 This radiograph shows bilateral perihilar patchy opacities in a "bat-wing" or "butterfly" pattern consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In this patient, the costophrenic angles are seen sharply, indicating the absence of significant pleural effusions. Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Pulmonary Edema and Bilateral Pleural Effusions This patient has bilateral patchy interstitial infiltrates characteristic of pulmonary edema, as well as bilateral pleural effusions (arrows). The normally sharp costophrenic angles are obscured by fluid. Kerley B Lines Kerley B lines (arrows) are horizontal lines in the lung periphery that extend to the pleural surface. They denote thickened, edematous interlobular septa often due to pulmonary edema. Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Cardiomegaly and Cephalization This patient has cardiomegaly
