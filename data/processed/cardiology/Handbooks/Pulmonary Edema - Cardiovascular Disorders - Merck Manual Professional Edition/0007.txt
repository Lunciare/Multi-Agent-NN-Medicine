Pulmonary Edema

syndrome, thrombolysis or direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement For severe hypertension, an IV vasodilator For supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, direct-current cardioversion For rapid atrial fibrillation, cardioversion is preferred. To slow the ventricular rate, an IV beta-blocker, IV digoxin, or cautious use of an IV calcium channel blocker In patients with acute myocardial infarction, fluid status before onset of pulmonary edema is usually normal, so diuretics are less useful than in patients with acute decompensation of chronic heart failure and may precipitate hypotension. If systolic blood pressure falls < 100 mm Hg or shock develops, IV dobutamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump (counterpulsation) may be required. Key Points Acute pulmonary edema can result from acute coronary ischemia, decompensation of underlying heart failure, arrhythmia, an acute valvular disorder, or acute volume overload. Patients have severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, wheezing, and sometimes blood-tinged frothy sputum. Clinical examination and chest radiography are usually sufficient for diagnosis; ECG, cardiac markers, and sometimes echocardiography are done to identify cause. Treat the cause and give oxygen and IV furosemide and/or nitrates as needed; inotropic agents to increase cardiac output, try noninvasive ventilatory assistance initially but use tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation if necessary.
