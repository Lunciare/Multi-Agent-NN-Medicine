of Patients With Pulmonary Edema). Management of Patients With Pulmonary Edema MCS = mechanical circulatory support; RRT = renal replacement therapy; SBP = systolic blood pressure. Adapted from McDonagh TA, Metra M, Adamo M, et al: 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure: Developed by the Task Force for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) with the special contribution of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the ESC. Morphine has long been used to reduce severe anxiety and the work of breathing but is decreasingly used (except in palliative care) due to observational studies suggesting a poorer outcome with its use (1). Noninvasive ventilatory assistance with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is helpful if hypoxia is significant. If carbon dioxide retention is significant or the patient is obtunded, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated. Specific additional treatment depends on etiology of pulmonary edema: For acute myocardial infarction or another acute coronary syndrome, thrombolysis or direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement For severe hypertension, an IV vasodilator For supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, direct-current cardioversion For rapid atrial fibrillation, cardioversion
