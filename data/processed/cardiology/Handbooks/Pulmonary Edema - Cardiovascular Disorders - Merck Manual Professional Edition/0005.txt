Pulmonary Edema

may reveal hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or metabolic acidosis if tissue perfusion is impaired. Hypoxemia can be severe. Carbon dioxide retention is a late, ominous sign of secondary hypoventilation. Bedside measurement of serum BNP or NT-pro BNP levels (elevated in pulmonary edema; normal in COPD exacerbation) is helpful if the diagnosis is in doubt. ECG and other blood tests (cardiac biomarkers, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine) are performed. 4/8 Echocardiography is helpful to determine the cause of the pulmonary edema (eg, myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, hypertensive heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy), as well as evaluating the patient's overall hemodynamic status, and may influence the choice of therapies. Treatment of Pulmonary Edema Treatment of cause Oxygen Ventilatory support as indicated IV diuretic Sometimes nitrates Sometimes IV inotropes Treatment of pulmonary edema involves providing oxygen and appropriate ventilatory support, administering diuretics (often in combination with vasodilators and/or inotropes depending upon the blood pressure, perfusion, and cardiac function), identifying and correcting the underlying cause (including any arrhythmias), and optimizing overall medical therapy.
