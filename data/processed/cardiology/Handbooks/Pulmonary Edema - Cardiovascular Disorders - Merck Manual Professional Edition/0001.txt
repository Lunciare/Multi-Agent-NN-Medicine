Pulmonary Edema

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is acute alveolar flooding caused by pulmonary venous hypertension secondary to severe left ventricular failure. Findings are severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, wheezing, and sometimes blood-tinged frothy sputum. Diagnosis is clinical and by chest radiograph. Treatment is with oxygen, IV nitrates, diuretics, and, in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, sometimes short-term IV positive inotropes and assisted ventilation (ie, endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation or bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation). When left ventricular (LV) filling pressure increases suddenly, plasma fluid moves rapidly from pulmonary capillaries into interstitial spaces and alveoli, causing pulmonary edema. Although precipitating causes vary by age and country, 30 to 40% of cases result from acute coronary ischemia (1, 2). Some cases are from decompensation of significant underlying heart failure (HF), including HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) due to hypertension, and the rest are from arrhythmia, an acute valvular disorder, or acute volume overload often due to IV fluids. Medication or dietary nonadherence is often involved. Symptoms and Signs of Pulmonary Edema Patients with pulmonary edema present with extreme dyspnea, restlessness, and anxiety with a sense of suffocation. Cough, possibly producing blood-tinged sputum, pallor, cyanosis, and marked diaphoresis are common; some patients froth
