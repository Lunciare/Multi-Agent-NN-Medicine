Pulmonary Edema

that extend to the pleural surface. They denote thickened, edematous interlobular septa often due to pulmonary edema. Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Cardiomegaly and Cephalization This patient has cardiomegaly (width of cardiac silhouette is > 50% of thoracic cage on a posterior-anterior chest radiograph). The patient also has cephalization (black arrows) whereby upper lobe pulmonary vessels become more prominent. These findings are often seen in patients with heart failure. Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Fluid in Minor and Major Fissures Lateral chest radiograph in a patient with fluid in major (1) and minor (2) fissures as well as a loculated effusion (3) seen along right posterior chest wall. Comet Tail Artifact Sonographic "comet tail artifact" (white arrow) inferior to rib (black arrows) on thoracic ultrasound. Comet tail artifact corresponds to the radiographic finding of Kerley B lines. A chest radiograph, done immediately, is usually diagnostic, showing marked interstitial edema. Chest ultrasound may also be useful, particularly if pleural effusions are suspected. Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis may reveal hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or metabolic acidosis if tissue perfusion is impaired. Hypoxemia can be severe. Carbon dioxide retention is a late, ominous sign of secondary hypoventilation. Bedside measurement of
