Exercise tolerance testing is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool for assessing patients with
suspected or known ischaemic heart disease. During exercise, coronary blood flow must increase to
meet the higher metabolic demands of the myocardium. Limiting the coronary blood flow may result
in electrocardiographic changes. This article reviews the electrocardiographic responses that occur
with exercise, both in normal subjects and in those with ischaemic heart disease.
ST segment depression (horizontal or downsloping) is the most reliable indicator of
exercise-induced ischaemia
Clinical relevance
Exercise tolerance testing (also known as exercise testing or exercise stress testing) is used routinely
in evaluating patients who present with chest pain, in patients who have chest pain on exertion, and
in patients with known ischaemic heart disease.

Diagnostic indications for exercise testing
Assessment of chest pain in patients with intermediate probability for coronary artery
disease
Arrhythmia provocation
Assessment of symptoms (for example, presyncope) occurring during or after exercise
Prognostic indications for exercise testing
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction
Risk stratification in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Evaluation of revascularisation or drug treatment
Evaluation of exercise tolerance and cardiac function
Assessment of cardiopulmonary function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or
heart failure
Assessment of treatment for arrhythmia
Exercise testing has a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 70% for detecting coronary artery
disease. It cannot therefore be used to rule in or rule out ischaemic heart disease unless the
probability of coronary artery disease is taken into account. For example, in a low risk population,
such as men aged under 30 years and women aged under 40, a positive test result is more likely to be
a false positive than true, and negative results add little new information. In a high risk population,
such as those aged over 50 with typical angina symptoms, a negative result cannot rule out ischaemic
heart disease, though the results may be of some prognostic value.
Exercise testing is therefore of greatest diagnostic value in patients with an intermediate risk of
coronary artery disease.

The Bruce protocol is the most widely adopted protocol and has been extensively validated. The
protocol has seven stages, each lasting three minutes, resulting in 21 minutes' exercise for a complete
test. In stage 1 the patient walks at 1.7 mph (2.7 km) up a 10% incline. Energy expenditure is
estimated to be 4.8 METs (metabolic equivalents) during this stage. The speed and incline increase
with each stage. A modified Bruce protocol is used for exercise testing within one week of myocardial
infarction.
Workload
Assessment of workload is measured by metabolic equivalents (METs)
Workload is a reflection of oxygen consumption and hence energy use
1 MET is 3.5 ml oxygen/kg per minute, which is the oxygen consumption of an average
individual at rest
To carry out the activities of daily living an exercise intensity of at least 5 METs is
required
Preparing the patient
β Blockers should be discontinued the day before the test, and dixogin (which may cause false
positive results, with ST segment abnormalities) should be stopped one week before testing.
Maximum predicted heart rate
By convention, the maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 (210 for women)
minus the patient's age
A satisfactory heart rate response is achieved on reaching 85% of the maximum
predicted heart rate
Attainment of maximum heart rate is a good prognostic sign
The patient is first connected to the exercise electrocardiogram machine. Resting electrocardiograms,
both sitting and standing, are recorded as electrocardiographic changes, particularly T wave
inversion, may occur as the patient stands up to start walking on the treadmill. A short period of
electrocardiographic recording during hyperventilation is also valuable for identifying changes
resulting from hyperventilation rather than from coronary ischaemia.

Contraindications for exercise testing
Acute myocardial infarction (within 4-6 days)
Unstable angina (rest pain in previous 48 hours)
Uncontrolled heart failure
Acute myocarditis or pericarditis
Acute systemic infection
Deep vein thrombosis
Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >220 mm Hg, diastolic >120 mm
Hg)
Severe aortic stenosis
Severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
Untreated life threatening arrhythmia
Dissecting aneurysm
Recent aortic surgery
During the test the electrocardiogram machine provides a continuous record of the heart rate, and
the 12 lead electrocardiogram is recorded intermittently. Blood pressure must be measured before the
exercise begins and at the end of each exercise stage. Blood pressure may fall or remain static during
the initial stage of exercise. This is the result of an anxious patient relaxing. As the test progresses,
however, systolic blood pressure should rise as exercise increases. A level of up to 225 mm Hg is
normal in adults, although athletes can have higher levels. Diastolic blood pressure tends to fall
slightly. The aim of the exercise is for the patient to achieve their maximum predicted heart rate.
Safety
If patients are carefully selected for exercise testing, the rate of serious complications (death or acute
myocardial infarction) is about 1 in 10 000 tests (0.01%). The incidence of ventricular tachycardia or
fibrillation is about 1 in 5000. Full cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilities must be available, and test
supervisors must be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Limitations
The specificity of ST segment depression as the main indicator of myocardial ischaemia is limited. ST
segment depression has been estimated to occur in up to 20% of normal individuals on ambulatory
electrocardiographic monitoring. There are many causes of ST segment changes apart from coronary
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1123032/ 4/16

artery disease, which confound the result of exercise testing. If the resting electrocardiogram is
abnormal, the usefulness of an exercise test is reduced or may even be precluded. Repolarisation and
conduction abnormalities—for example, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, pre-
excitation, and effects of digoxin—preclude accurate interpretation of the electrocardiogram during
exercise, and as a result, other forms of exercise test (for example, adenosine or dobutamine
scintigraphy) or angiography are required to evaluate this group of patients.
Normal trace during exercise
The J point (the point of inflection at the junction of the S wave and ST segment) becomes depressed
during exercise, with maximum depression at peak exercise. The normal ST segment during exercise
therefore slopes sharply upwards.
By convention, ST segment depression is measured relative to the isoelectric baseline (between the T
and P waves) at a point 60-80 ms after the J point. There is intraobserver variation in the
measurement of this ST segment depression, and therefore a computerised analysis that accompanies
the exercise test can assist but not replace the clinical evaluation of the test.
Normal electrocardiographic changes during exercise
P wave increases in height
R wave decreases in height
J point becomes depressed
ST segment becomes sharply upsloping
Q-T interval shortens
T wave decreases in height
Abnormal changes during exercise
The standard criterion for an abnormal ST segment response is horizontal (planar) or downsloping
depression of >1 mm. If 0.5 mm of depression is taken as the standard, the sensitivity of the test
increases and the specificity decreases (vice versa if 2 mm of depression is selected as the standard).

Reasons for stopping a test
Electrocardiographic criteria
Severe ST segment depression (>3 mm)
ST segment elevation >1 mm in non-Q wave lead
Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (unless the test is to assessment ventricular
arrhythmia)
Onset of ventricular tachycardia
New atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia
Development of new bundle branch block (if the test is primarily to detect underlying
coronary disease)
New second or third degree heart block
Cardiac arrest
Symptoms and signs
Patient requests stopping because of severe fatigue
Severe chest pain, dyspnoea, or dizziness
Fall in systolic blood pressure (>20 mm Hg)
Rise in blood pressure (systolic >300 mm Hg, diastolic >130 mm Hg)
Ataxia
Other recognised abnormal responses to exercise include ST elevation of >1 mm, particularly in the
absence of Q waves. This suggests severe coronary artery disease and is a sign of poor prognosis. T
wave changes such as inversion and pseudo-normalisation (an inverted T wave that becomes upright)
are non-specific changes.
A highly specific sign for ischaemia is inversion of the U wave. As U waves are often difficult to
identify, especially at high heart rates, this finding is not sensitive. The presence of extrasystoles that
have been induced by exercise is neither sensitive nor specific for coronary artery disease.
Stopping the test
In clinical practice, patients rarely exercise for the full duration (21 minutes) of the Bruce protocol.
However, completion of 9-12 minutes of exercise or reaching 85% of the maximum predicted changes
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1123032/ 6/16

in heart rate is usually satisfactory. An exercise test should end when diagnostic criteria have been
reached or when the patient's symptoms and signs dictate.
The most common reason for stopping an exercise test is fatigue and breathlessness as
a result of the unaccustomed exercise
After the exercise has stopped, recording continues for up to 15 minutes. ST segment changes (or
arrhythmias) may occur during the recovery period that were not apparent during exercise. Such
changes generally carry the same significance as those occurring during exercise.
Interpreting the results
Diagnostic testing
Any abnormal electrocardiographic changes must be interpreted in the light of the probability of
coronary artery disease and physiological response to exercise. A normal test result or a result that
indicates a low probability of coronary artery disease is one in which 85% of the maximum predicted
heart rate is achieved with a physiological response in blood pressure and no associated ST segment
depression.
Findings suggesting high probability of coronary artery disease
⩽
Horizontal ST segment depression of 2 mm
Downsloping ST segment depression
Early positive response within six minutes
Persistence of ST depression for more than six minutes into recovery
ST segment depression in five or more leads
Exertional hypotension
A test that indicates a high probability of coronary artery disease is one in which there is substantial
ST depression at low work rate associated with typical angina-like pain and a drop in blood pressure.
Deeper and more widespread ST depression generally indicates more severe or extensive disease.

False positive results are common in women, reflecting the lower incidence of coronary artery disease
in this group.
Prognostic testing
Exercise testing in patients who have just had a myocardial infarction is indicated only in those in
whom a revascularisation procedure is contemplated; a less strenuous protocol is used. Testing
provides prognostic information. Patients with low exercise capacity and hypotension induced by
exercise have a poor prognosis. Asymptomatic ST segment depression after myocardial infarction is
associated with a more than 10-fold increase in mortality compared with a normal exercise test.
Conversely, patients who reach stage 3 of a modified Bruce protocol with a blood pressure response
of >30 mm Hg have an annual mortality of <2%. Exercise testing can also add prognostic
information in patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography or coronary artery
bypass graft.
Rationale for testing
Bayes's theorem of diagnostic probability states that the predictive value of an
abnormal exercise test will vary according to the probability of coronary artery disease
in the population under study
Exercise testing is therefore usually performed in patients with an moderate
probablility of coronary artery disease, rather than in those with a very low or high
probability
Screening
Exercise testing of asymptomatic patients is controversial because of the high false positive rate in
such individuals. Angina remains the most reliable indicator of the need for further investigation.
In certain asymptomatic groups with particular occupations (for example, pilots) there is a role for
regular exercise testing, though more stringent criteria for an abnormal test result (such as ST
segment depression of >2 mm) should be applied. In the United Kingdom, drivers of heavy goods
vehicles and public service vehicles have to achieve test results clearly specified by the Driver and
Vehicle Licensing Agency before they are considered fit to drive.
