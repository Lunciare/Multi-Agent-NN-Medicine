Cardiac tumors overview

is dismal. Diagnosis Multiple cardiovascular imaging techniques could be utilized to outline the anatomy of the cardiac mass and its potential functional consequences. The primary purpose of cardiovascular imaging is to assess the location, extent, and vascularity of the tumor, as well as any hemodynamic consequences and myopericardial invasion. All patients should receive two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). A biopsy provides the definitive diagnosis. The technique for a final diagnosis is carried out using percutaneous cardiac biopsy and transvenous cardiac biopsy, guided by echocardiography, mediastinoscopy, or thoracotomy. Staging | History and Symptoms | Physical Examination | Laboratory Findings | Electrocardiogram | Chest X Ray | CT | MRI | Echocardiography | Other Imaging Findings | Other Diagnostic Studies Treatment The vast majority of cardiac tumors are treated surgically. Primary malignant cardiac tumors have a propensity for fast metastatic dissemination. Systemic neoadjuvant therapy should be vigorously sought in hemodynamically stable patients with localized disease because it permits: (a) faster removal by lowering the size of the tumor, and (b) a reduction in the likelihood of systemic recurrence. In certain instances, surgery may be an option for malignant tumors. Patients with a solitary heart problem and a controlled primary tumor are the best
