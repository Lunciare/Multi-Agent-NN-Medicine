syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital anomalies and a predisposition to tumorigenesis. • Cardiac myxomas may be related with Carney complex, an autosomal dominant disorder. • Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy is occasionally inherited, however the underlying genetic abnormalities are still unclear. • The majority of undifferentiated cardiac sarcomas share the same genetic profile as pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas, which are defined by recurrent mutations in the MDM2, PDGFRA, and CDKN2A genes. • Papillary fibroelastomas have been reported following cardiac instrumentation and thoracic irradiation. Causes Numerous genetic abnormalities are linked to cardiac tumors however no direct causes have been established as of yet. Some genetic disorders closely related with a high incidence of cardiac tumors are Tuberous Sclerosis, Gorlin Syndrome, and Carneys Triad. Differentiating Cardiac Tumors from other Diseases Common cardiac tumor symptoms include fever, weight loss, and other constitutional symptoms. Each tumor has unique traits that distinguish it from others. Epidemiology and Demographics Risk Factors There are no recognized cardiac tumor risk factors. However, HIV increases the risk of Kaposi sarcoma of the heart. Certain disorders, including Gorlin syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, LAMB, NAME, and Paragangliomas, are linked to an elevated risk of cardiac tumors. The presence of other tumors also
