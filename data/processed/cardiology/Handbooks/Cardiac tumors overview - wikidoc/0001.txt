Overview The primary tumors of the heart are tumors that arise from the normal tissues that make up the heart. This is in contrast to secondary tumors of the heart, which are typically either metastatic from another part of the body, or infiltrate the heart via direct extension from the surrounding tissues. History and Symptoms Cardiac tumors present with a wide variety of symptoms. Many patients remain asymptomatic, and the tumor is an incidental finding. Some patients may present with symptoms of mimicking those of valve abnormalities such as mitral stenosis. Patients may also present with rhythm disturbances,endocarditis or even heart failure. Physical Examination A "tumor plop" (a sound related to movement of the tumor), abnormal heart sounds, or murmur may be heard. These sounds may change when the patient changes position. Electrocardiogram There are no specific ECG abnormalities associated with heart tumors. The ECG changes vary depending on the location of the tumor and aid in the diagnosis of tumors when used in conjunction with other diagnostic modalities. Historical Perspective As early as 1559, Dr. Realdo Colombo wrote about heart tumors, and the first successful surgery to remove a left atrial myxoma was performed in 1954 by Dr. Clarence
