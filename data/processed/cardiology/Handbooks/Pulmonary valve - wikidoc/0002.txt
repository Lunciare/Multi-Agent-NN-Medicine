Pulmonary valve

the aortic valve at the level of the third intercostal space and separated from the tricuspid valve by the infundibulum of the right ventricle. [1] • It is comprised of three equal sized, semilunar cusps or leaflets (right, left, anterior), nomenclature based on the corresponding aortic valve. [2] [2] • The three cusps are joined by commissures and the cusps are thinner when compared to the aortic valve, due to a low pressure in the right ventricle.[2] • The area of the valve is related to body surface area and men usually have greater valve area when compared with women. • The normal orifice area is approximately around 3cm². [3] • The pulmonary valve opens in the right ventricular systole allowing the deoxygenated blood to be delivered to the lungs. [2] • During the right ventricular diastole the pulmonary valves close completely to prevent regurgitation of blood into the right ventricle.
