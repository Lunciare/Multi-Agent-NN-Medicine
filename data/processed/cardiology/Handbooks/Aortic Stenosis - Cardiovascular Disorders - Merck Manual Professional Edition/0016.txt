Aortic Stenosis

is moderate or greater. Choice of intervention 9/12 Transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty is used primarily in children and very young adults with congenital AS. In older patients who are not candidates for surgery, balloon valvuloplasty has been used as a bridge to valve replacement, but this procedure has a high complication rate and provides only temporary relief. Transcatheter valve implantation, which can be performed with similar procedural risk even in sick, high-risk patients, is more common. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) usually involves replacement with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve. In younger patients, the patient’s own pulmonary valve can be used, with a bioprosthesis then used to replace the pulmonary valve (Ross procedure). The advantage of the Ross procedure rather than SAVR to replace the aortic valve only is increased durability of the procedure. The valve exposed to systemic pressure is the patient's own pulmonary valve, and this lasts longer than other replacement valves. The bioprosthesis in the pulmonary position tends to also last a relatively long time. Transcatheter (percutaneous) aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (sometimes called transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR) is a less invasive method of aortic valve replacement. TAVI valves are constructed differently than SAVR valves; TAVI valves
