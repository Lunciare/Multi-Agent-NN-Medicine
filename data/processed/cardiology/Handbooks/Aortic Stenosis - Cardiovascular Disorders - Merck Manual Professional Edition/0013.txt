when patient is normotensive AS = aortic stenosis; DVI = Doppler velocity index, the ratio of LV outflow tract to aortic velocity; LV EF = left ventricular ejection fraction; Vmax = peak forward velocity across the aortic valve. Data from Otto CM, Nishimura RA, Bonow RO, et al: 2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease: Executive Summary: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines. Circulation 143(5):e35–e71, 2021. doi: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000932 Cardiac catheterization is performed prior to intervention to determine whether coronary artery disease (CAD) is the cause of angina and, occasionally, to resolve inconsistent clinical and echocardiographic estimates of AS severity. An ECG and chest radiograph are obtained. ECG typically shows changes of LV hypertrophy with or without an ischemic ST- and T-wave pattern. Chest radiograph findings may include calcification of the aortic cusps (seen on the lateral projection or on fluoroscopy) and evidence of heart failure. Heart size may be normal or only mildly enlarged. 7/12 In asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, closely supervised exercise ECG testing is recommended in an attempt to elicit symptoms of angina, dyspnea, or hypotension—any of these symptoms, when due
