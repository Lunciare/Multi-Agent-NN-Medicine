Aortic Stenosis

a stenotic aortic valve and possible causes, to quantify LV hypertrophy and degree of systolic dysfunction, and to detect coexisting valvular heart disorders (aortic regurgitation, mitral valve disorders) and complications (eg, endocarditis). Doppler echocardiography is used to quantify degree of stenosis by measuring jet velocity, transvalvular systolic pressure gradient, and aortic valve area. Severity of aortic stenosis is characterized echocardiographically as (1): Mild: Peak aortic jet velocity 2.5 to 2.9 m/second, mean gradient 10 to 20 mm Hg, or valve 2 area 1.5 to 2.0 cm Moderate: Peak aortic jet velocity 3 to 4 m/second, mean gradient 20 to 40 mm Hg, or valve 2 area 1.0 to 1.5 cm Severe: Peak aortic jet velocity > 4 m/second, mean gradient > 40 mm Hg, or valve area < 2 1.0 cm Very severe: Peak aortic jet velocity > 5 m/second or mean gradient > 60 mm Hg Clinical judgment and critical review of the data are used to resolve any discordance among these parameters (eg, moderate valve area but severe mean gradient). When LV function is normal, peak velocity is preferred as it is significantly more reproducible than valve area (2). Quantification of aortic 5/12 valve stenosis is least accurate
