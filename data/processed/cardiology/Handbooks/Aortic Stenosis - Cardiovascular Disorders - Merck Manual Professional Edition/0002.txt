yet known but is mediated by an inflammatory process similar to but distinct from atherosclerosis. Genetic, anatomic, fluid dynamic, and environmental risk factors include hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol, and presence of a bicuspid valve. Lipid deposition and inflammation initially lead to thickening of aortic valve structures by fibrosis and calcification without causing significant obstruction. Aortic sclerosis progresses to severe aortic stenosis in approximately 10% of patients within 5 years (3). Lipoprotein (a) is implicated in the pathogenesis of both aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis. Elevated lipoprotein (a) levels also predict faster hemodynamic progression of AS. 1/12 Patients with psoriasis are also at increased risk for atherosclerosis, and more recently, psoriasis has been tied to an increased risk of aortic stenosis. In patients < 70 years, the most common cause of aortic stenosis is: A congenital bicuspid aortic valve Congenital aortic valve disease, including bicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis, occurs in 0.5 to 2% of people and affects more males (4); it is associated with coarctation and progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, causing aortic dissection. Aortic stenosis in neonates can also accompany hypoplastic left heart syndrome and its variants. In medically underserved countries, the most common cause of aortic stenosis
