using warfarin. Long-term non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or warfarin can be considered in patients with a bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease). Prognosis for Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis progresses faster as severity increases, but the wide variability in progression rates requires regular surveillance, particularly in sedentary older patients. In such patients, flow may become significantly compromised without triggering symptoms. Asymptomatic patients with severe AS and normal systolic function should be reevaluated every 6 months because up to 11% may have a fall in LVEF after one year(1). The risk of surgery outweighs the survival benefit in asymptomatic patients, but with the onset of symptoms the mean survival drops to 3 years (2), and prompt valve replacement is indicated to relieve symptoms and improve survival. Risk of surgery increases for patients who require simultaneous CABG and for those with depressed systolic LV function. In patients with severe AS, approximately 13% of deaths occur suddenly (3), so patients with severe AS should be advised to limit physical exertion. Key Points The most common cause of aortic stenosis (AS) is bicuspid aortic valve in patients < 70 years and aortic
