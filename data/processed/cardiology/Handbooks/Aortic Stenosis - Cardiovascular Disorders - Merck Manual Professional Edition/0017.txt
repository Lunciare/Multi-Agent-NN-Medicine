Aortic Stenosis

valve implantation (TAVI) (sometimes called transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR) is a less invasive method of aortic valve replacement. TAVI valves are constructed differently than SAVR valves; TAVI valves are inserted through an artery in a collapsed configuration to the aortic valve site and are then deployed/expanded to replace the stenotic aortic valve. The choice is between the up-front risk and morbidity of SAVR versus the unknown durability of TAVI valves beyond 10 years, although durability studies ranging up to 10 years suggest a structural valve degeneration rate < 10% within that time frame (3, 4, 5). Guidelines to inform shared decision-making suggest SAVR for patients < 65 years; TAVI is preferred for patients whose arteries are suitable for the transfemoral approach and who are > 80 years or who have a life expectancy of < 10 years. In patients aged 65 to 80 years whose arteries are suitable for transfemoral TAVI, the decision regarding SAVR or TAVI is determined based on individual patient characteristics (1). If the patient’s arteries are not suited to the transfemoral route, then SAVR is preferred as long as surgical risk is not prohibitive. In patients with a life expectancy of < 1 year
