In early disease stages, there is an increased pressure gradient from the high-pressure LV to the lower pressure aorta. With time, the ventricle can no longer compensate and begins to fail, with secondary LV cavity enlargement, reduced 2/12 ejection fraction (EF), decreased cardiac output, and a misleadingly low gradient across the aortic valve (low-gradient severe AS) as the LV can no longer generate as high of a systolic pressure. Aortic regurgitation accompanies aortic stenosis in approximately 7% of patients (1), and about half of patients with severe AS also have mitral annular calcification (2,
