Aortic Stenosis

mean gradient). When LV function is normal, peak velocity is preferred as it is significantly more reproducible than valve area (2). Quantification of aortic 5/12 valve stenosis is least accurate when LV volume or systolic function is reduced, or when systemic hypertension is present. Aortic Stenosis VIDEO The gradient may be overestimated when aortic regurgitation is present. The gradient may under- represent severity when the stroke volume is low, eg, in patients with systemic hypertension or LV systolic dysfunction (low-gradient AS with reduced EF) or a small, hypertrophied LV (low-gradient AS with normal EF—see table Types of Severe Aortic Stenosis). Sometimes LV systolic dysfunction results in low ventricular pressure that is inadequate to open nonstenotic valve leaflets, causing echocardiographic appearance of low valve area in the absence of stenosis (pseudo-stenosis). Differentiation of pseudo-stenosis from low-gradient AS can be aided by calculation of the ratio of outflow tract to aortic velocity (Doppler velocity index [DVI]). A DVI value < 0.25 suggests true severe stenosis. Assessment of the degree of valve calcification by computed tomography (CT) can help determine the severity of AS. Severe AS is likely when the valvular calcium score is > 2000 Agatston units (AU) (men) and > 1300
