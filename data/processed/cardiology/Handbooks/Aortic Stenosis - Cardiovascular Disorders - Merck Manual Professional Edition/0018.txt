Aortic Stenosis

arteries are not suited to the transfemoral route, then SAVR is preferred as long as surgical risk is not prohibitive. In patients with a life expectancy of < 1 year even with a successful procedure, intervention is not recommended. Compared with SAVR, transfemoral TAVI has lower short-term mortality and less risk of stroke, major bleeding, and atrial fibrillation. TAVI also requires a shorter hospital stay, causes less pain, and permits more rapid return to activity; however, it also increases vascular complications and paravalvular regurgitation and increases the need for permanent pacemaker implantation and early repeat valve intervention. Indications for TAVI will expand as research includes younger and less symptomatic patients, although trials should be interpreted with caution due to potential flaws in methodology (6, 7). Preoperative evaluation for CAD is indicated so that coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve replacement, if indicated, can be performed during the same procedure. 10/12 An aortic bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months postoperatively, but a mechanical valve requires lifetime anticoagulation using warfarin. Long-term non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or warfarin can be considered in patients with a bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac
