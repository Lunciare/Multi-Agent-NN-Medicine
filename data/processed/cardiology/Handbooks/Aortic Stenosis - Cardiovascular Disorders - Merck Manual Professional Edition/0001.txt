Aortic Stenosis

Aortic stenosis (AS) is narrowing or restricted opening of the aortic valve, obstructing blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta during systole. Causes include a congenital bicuspid valve, idiopathic degenerative sclerosis with calcification, and rheumatic fever. Untreated AS progresses to become symptomatic with one or more of the classic triad of syncope, angina, and exertional dyspnea; heart failure and arrhythmias may develop. A crescendo- decrescendo ejection murmur is characteristic. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Asymptomatic AS in adults usually requires no treatment. Once symptoms develop, surgical or percutaneous valve replacement is required. For severe or symptomatic AS in children, balloon valvuloplasty may be effective, but surgery is often required. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) Etiology of Aortic Stenosis In older patients, the most common precursor to aortic stenosis is: Aortic sclerosis Aortic sclerosis is the deposition of calcium on the aortic valve leaflets, seen in 25 to 45% of adults over age 65 (1, 2). The cause of aortic sclerosis and stenosis is not yet known but is mediated by an inflammatory process similar to but distinct from atherosclerosis. Genetic, anatomic, fluid dynamic, and environmental risk factors include hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol, and presence
