Aortic Stenosis

by computed tomography (CT) can help determine the severity of AS. Severe AS is likely when the valvular calcium score is > 2000 Agatston units (AU) (men) and > 1300 AU (women). It is very likely when the calcium score is > 3000 AU(men) and > 1600 AU (women). Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography distinguishes low-gradient AS from pseudo- stenosis.
