Aortic Stenosis

In asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, closely supervised exercise ECG testing is recommended in an attempt to elicit symptoms of angina, dyspnea, or hypotension—any of these symptoms, when due to the AS, is an indication for intervention. Failure to normally increase blood pressure and development of ST-segment depression are less predictive of adverse prognosis. Exercise testing is contraindicated in symptomatic patients.

Statins have been ineffective (2). Medications that can cause hypotension (eg, nitrates) should be used cautiously, although nitroprusside has been used as a temporizing measure to reduce afterload in patients with decompensated heart failure in the hours before valve replacement. Patients who develop heart failure but are too high risk for valve intervention benefit from cautious treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Indications for intervention The benefits of intervention do not outweigh the risks until patients develop symptoms and/or meet certain echocardiographic criteria. Thus, patients should have periodic clinical evaluations, including echocardiography and sometimes exercise testing, to determine the optimal time for valve replacement (1). Valve replacement is recommended when
