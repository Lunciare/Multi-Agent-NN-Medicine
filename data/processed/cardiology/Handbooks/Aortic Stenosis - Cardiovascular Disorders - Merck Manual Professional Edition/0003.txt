Aortic Stenosis

ascending aorta, causing aortic dissection. Aortic stenosis in neonates can also accompany hypoplastic left heart syndrome and its variants. In medically underserved countries, the most common cause of aortic stenosis in all age groups is: Rheumatic fever Supravalvular AS caused by a discrete congenital membrane or narrowing of the sinotubular junction or ascending aorta is uncommon. Supravalvular AS can be a component of Williams syndrome, a microdeletion syndrome of chromosome 7 associated with a characteristic facial appearance (high and broad forehead, hypertelorism, strabismus, upturned nose, long philtrum, wide mouth, dental abnormalities, puffy cheeks, micrognathia, low-set ears) and neonatal hypercalcemia. Subvalvular AS caused by a congenital membrane or fibrous ring just beneath the aortic valve is uncommon. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can have dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Etiology references 1. Ferreira-González I, Pinar-Sopena J, Ribera A, et al.
