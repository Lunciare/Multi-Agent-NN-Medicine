certain echocardiographic criteria. Thus, patients should have periodic clinical evaluations, including echocardiography and sometimes exercise testing, to determine the optimal time for valve replacement (1). Valve replacement is recommended when aortic stenosis is severe and there is any one of the following: Symptoms Exercise testing causing symptoms or showing reduced effort tolerance or a fall in blood pressure ≥ 10 mm Hg below baseline) LV EF < 50% In addition, if surgical risk is low, then surgery may also be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe AS if there is any one of: Very severe AS (aortic velocity > 5 m/second) Brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP) is > 3 times normal Severe pulmonary hypertension without other explanation Decline in EF to < 60% Severe valve calcification with rapid progression of stenosis (reduction in aortic valve area ≥ 0.3 m/second/year) Evidence also supports surgical intervention in asymptomatic but severe AS. When cardiac surgery is being performed for other reasons, concomitant aortic valve surgery is indicated regardless of symptoms if the AS is moderate or greater. Choice of intervention 9/12 Transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty is used primarily in children and very young adults with congenital AS. In older patients who are not candidates
