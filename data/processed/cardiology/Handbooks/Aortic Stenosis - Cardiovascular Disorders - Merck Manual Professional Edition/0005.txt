Aortic Stenosis

high of a systolic pressure. Aortic regurgitation accompanies aortic stenosis in approximately 7% of patients (1), and about half of patients with severe AS also have mitral annular calcification (2, 3), which may lead to mitral regurgitation. Patients with other disorders that also cause LV enlargement and reduced EF (eg, myocardial infarction, intrinsic cardiomyopathy) may generate insufficient flow to fully open a sclerotic valve and have an apparently small valve area even when their AS is not particularly severe (pseudo-severe AS). Pseudo- severe AS must be differentiated from low-gradient severe AS because only patients with low-gradient severe AS benefit from valve replacement. Aortic Stenosis IMAGE MONICA SCHROEDER / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Elevated shear stress across the stenosed aortic valve degrades von Willebrand factor multimers. The resulting coagulopathy may cause gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with angiodysplasia (Heyde syndrome). The syndrome typically resolves following successful aortic valve replacement (4).
