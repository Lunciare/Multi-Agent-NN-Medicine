Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

noncardiac disorder Duct-dependent congenital heart disease The ductus arteriosus is a normal connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta; it is necessary for proper fetal circulation. At birth, the rise in PaO2 and decline in prostaglandin concentration cause closure of the ductus arteriosus, typically beginning within the first 10 to 15 hours of life. Some congenital cardiac disorders are dependent on the ductus arteriosus remaining open to maintain systemic blood flow (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, critical aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta) or pulmonary blood flow (cyanotic lesions such as pulmonary atresia or severe tetralogy of Fallot). Keeping the ductus arteriosus open with exogenous prostaglandin infusion is therefore vital in these disorders prior to definitive repair (usually surgery). Symptoms and Signs of Congenital Heart Disease Manifestations of congenital heart diseases are varied but commonly include Murmurs Cyanosis Heart failure Diminished or nonpalpable pulses Other physical examination abnormalities may include circulatory shock, poor perfusion, abnormal 2nd heart sound (S2—single or widely split), systolic click, gallop, or abnormally slow, fast, or irregular rhythm. Murmurs Most left-to-right shunts and obstructive lesions cause systolic murmurs. Systolic murmurs and thrills are most prominent at the surface closest to their point of origin, making location
