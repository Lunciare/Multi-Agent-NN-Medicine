anomalies (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, critical aortic stenosis, interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta). Neonates appear extremely ill with pale or cyanotic mucous membranes, cold extremities, diminished pulses, low blood pressure, and reduced response to stimuli. Chest pain in children is usually noncardiac. In infants, chest pain may be manifested by unexplained marked irritability, particularly during or after feeding, and can be caused by anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. In older children and adolescents, chest pain due to a cardiac etiology is usually associated with exertion and may be caused by a coronary anomaly, pericarditis, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or severe aortic stenosis. Syncope, typically without warning symptoms and often in association with exertion, may occur with certain anomalies including cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic or dilated), anomalous origin of a coronary artery, or inherited arrhythmia syndromes (eg, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT], Brugada syndrome). High school–age athletes are most commonly affected. Diagnosis of Congenital Heart Disease Screening by pulse oximetry Cardiac physical examination Chest x-ray and ECG Echocardiography Sometimes cardiac MRI or CT angiography, cardiac catheterization with angiocardiography When present, heart murmurs, cyanosis, abnormal pulses, or manifestations of heart failure suggest congenital
