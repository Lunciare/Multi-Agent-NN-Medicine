the above Coarctation of the aorta, with or without associated abnormalities Complete heart block with or without associated structural heart anomalies 9/18 Age at Onset Causes Large left-to-right shunts in preterm infants (eg, patent ductus arteriosus) Transposition of the great arteries with a large ventricular septal defect Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (right ventricular failure) Complete atrioventricular septal defects Patent ductus arteriosus Persistent truncus arteriosus Infancy (especially 6 to 8 weeks) Rare metabolic disorders (eg, glycogen storage disease type II, also called Pompe disease) Single ventricle Supraventricular tachycardia Ventricular septal defect Childhood Acute cor pulmonale (caused by upper airway obstructions such as large tonsils) Acute rheumatic fever with carditis Acute severe hypertension (eg, with acute glomerulonephritis) Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (unobstructed) Bacterial endocarditis Chronic anemia (severe) Dilated cardiomyopathy Iron overload due to altered iron metabolism (hereditary hemachromatosis) or due to frequent transfusions (eg, for thalassemia major) Nutritional deficiencies Valvular heart disorders due to congenital or acquired cardiac disease 10/18 Age at Onset Causes (eg, rheumatic fever) Viral myocarditis Volume overload in a noncardiac disorder Duct-dependent congenital heart disease The ductus arteriosus is a normal connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta; it is necessary for proper fetal circulation. At birth, the rise
