heart failure (eg, with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta-blockers, digoxin, spironolactone, salt restriction and, in selected cases, supplemental oxygen or prostaglandin E1) Surgical repair or transcatheter intervention Treatment of heart failure varies widely depending on the etiology. Definitive therapy typically requires correction of the underlying problem. After medical stabilization of acute heart failure symptoms or cyanosis, most children require surgical or transcatheter repair; the exceptions are certain ventricular septal defects that are likely to become smaller or close with time or mild valve dysfunction. Transcatheter procedures include Balloon atrial septostomy for palliation of severely cyanotic neonates with transposition of the great arteries Balloon dilation of severe aortic valve stenosis or pulmonic valve stenosis Transcatheter closure of cardiac shunts (most often atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus) Transcatheter placement of pulmonary valve Balloon dilation with or without stenting of vascular stenoses, most commonly pulmonary artery stenosis Heart failure in neonates Acute, severe heart failure or cyanosis during the first week of life is a medical emergency. Secure vascular access should be established, preferably via an umbilical venous catheter. When critical congenital heart disease is suspected or confirmed, an IV infusion of prostaglandin E1 should be started at 0.05 to
