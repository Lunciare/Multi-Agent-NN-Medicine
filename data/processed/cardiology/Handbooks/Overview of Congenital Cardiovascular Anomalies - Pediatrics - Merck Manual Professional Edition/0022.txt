children with chronic congestive heart failure. Newer medications used in adults for heart failure, such as sacubitril/valsartan and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, may be useful, but data are limited in the pediatric population (1). Digoxin is used less often than in the past but may still have a role in children with heart failure who have large left-to-right shunts and in certain postoperative patients with congenital heart disease (dose varies by age; see table Oral Digoxin Dosage in Children). Notably, digoxin has been shown to reduce mortality in single-ventricle patients after the Norwood procedure and before the second stage surgery 15/18 (2). Use of digoxin as a front-line drug in the treatment of neonatal supraventricular tachycardia has declined because it results in higher mortality than treatment with propranolol (3). However, if Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome is not present, it may be a useful as a primary agent if propranolol is ineffective or as a second agent combined with propranolol or other antiarrhythmic drugs.
