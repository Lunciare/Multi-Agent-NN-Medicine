Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

25 mm Hg) along with locally produced prostaglandins. The foramen ovale is kept open by differences in atrial pressures: left atrial pressure is relatively low because little blood is returned from the lungs, but right atrial pressure is relatively high because large volumes of blood return from the placenta. 3/18 Normal Circulation in a Fetus In the fetus, blood entering the right side of the heart has already been oxygenated via the placenta. Because the lungs are not ventilated, only a small amount of blood needs to go through the pulmonary artery. Most of the blood from the right side of the heart bypasses the lungs through the Foramen ovale Ductus arteriosus Normally, these 2 structures close shortly after birth. Red arrows represent the most highly oxygenated fetal blood (oxygen saturation ≥ 65%). Blue arrows represent the least highly oxygenated blood (oxygen saturation ≤ 45%). Purple arrows represent intermediate oxygen saturation (oxygen saturation 50–60%). Note that oxygen saturation throughout is significantly lower than in postnatal life. 4/18 Perinatal changes Profound changes to this system occur after the first few breaths, resulting in Increased pulmonary blood flow Functional closure of the foramen ovale Pulmonary arteriolar resistance drops acutely as a result
