Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital anomaly, occurring in almost 1% of live births (1). Among birth defects, congenital heart disease is the leading cause of infant mortality. The most common congenital heart diseases diagnosed in infancy are muscular and perimembranous ventricular septal defects followed by secundum atrial septal defects, with a total prevalence of 48.4 in 10,000 live births (2, 3, 4). The most common cyanotic congenital heart disease is tetralogy of Fallot, which is twice as prevalent as transposition of the great arteries (4.7 vs. 2.3/10 000 births). Overall, bicuspid aortic valves are the most common congenital defects with a prevalence reported to be as high as 0.5% to 2.0%. Etiology of Congenital Heart Disease Environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of congenital heart disease. Common environmental factors include maternal illness (eg, diabetes, rubella, systemic lupus erythematosus) or maternal intake of teratogenic agents (eg, lithium, isotretinoin, antiseizure drugs). Maternal age is a known risk factor for certain genetic conditions, especially Down syndrome, that may include cardiac defects. It is unclear whether maternal age is an independent risk factor for congenital heart disease. Paternal age may also be a risk factor (1). Certain numerical chromosomal
