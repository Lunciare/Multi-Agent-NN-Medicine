(cyanosis of the hands and feet) without lip or nail bed cyanosis is caused by peripheral vasoconstriction rather than hypoxemia and is a common, normal finding in neonates. Older children with longstanding cyanosis often develop clubbing of the nail beds. Heart failure In infants, symptoms or signs of heart failure include Tachycardia Tachypnea Dyspnea during feeding Diaphoresis, especially during feeding Restlessness, irritability Hepatomegaly Failure to thrive 12/18 Dyspnea during feeding causes inadequate intake and poor growth, which may be worsened by increased metabolic demands in heart failure and frequent respiratory tract infections. In contrast to adults and older children, most infants do not have distended neck veins and dependent edema; however, they occasionally have edema in the periorbital area. Hepatomegaly is a particularly prominent feature of heart failure in infants because of the distensibility of the liver capsule at this age. Findings in older children with heart failure are similar to those in adults. Other manifestations of heart defects In neonates, circulatory shock may be the first manifestation of certain anomalies (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, critical aortic stenosis, interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta). Neonates appear extremely ill with pale or cyanotic mucous membranes, cold extremities, diminished pulses,
