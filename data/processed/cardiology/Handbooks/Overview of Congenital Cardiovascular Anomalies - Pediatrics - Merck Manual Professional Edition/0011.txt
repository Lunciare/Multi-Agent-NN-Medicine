Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

to meet the body’s metabolic needs or when the heart cannot adequately handle venous return, causing pulmonary congestion (in left ventricular failure), edema primarily in dependent tissues and abdominal viscera (in right ventricular failure), or both. Heart failure in infants and children has many causes other than congenital heart anomalies (see table Common Causes of Heart Failure in Children). 8/18 TABLE Common Causes of Heart Failure in Children Age at Onset Causes Chronic anemia with subsequent high- output heart failure Large systemic arteriovenous fistulas (eg, cerebral vein of Galen shunt) In utero Myocardial dysfunction secondary to myocarditis Sustained intrauterine tachycardia Any of the above Critical aortic stenosis or critical coarctation Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid and/or pulmonic regurgitation Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Intrauterine or neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Metabolic disorders (eg, hypoglycemia, Birth through first few days hypothermia, severe metabolic acidosis) Neonatal sepsis Perinatal asphyxia with myocardial damage Severe intrauterine anemia (hydrops fetalis) Total anomalous pulmonary venous return with severe obstruction (usually infracardiac type) Up to 1 month Any of the above Coarctation of the aorta, with or without associated abnormalities Complete heart block with or without associated structural heart anomalies 9/18 Age at Onset Causes Large left-to-right shunts in
