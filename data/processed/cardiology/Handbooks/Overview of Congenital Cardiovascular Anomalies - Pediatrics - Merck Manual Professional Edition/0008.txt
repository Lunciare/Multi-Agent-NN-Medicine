Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

Atrial septal defect Left-to-right shunt Patent ductus arteriosus Atrioventricular septal defect Pulmonic stenosis Aortic stenosis Aortic coarctation Obstructive Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (often also manifests with cyanosis, which may be mild) * In approximate decreasing order of frequency. Cyanotic heart anomalies Varying amounts of deoxygenated venous blood are shunted to the left heart (right-to-left shunt), reducing systemic arterial oxygen saturation. If there is > 5 g/dL (> 50 g/L) of deoxygenated hemoglobin, cyanosis results. Complications of persistent cyanosis include polycythemia, clubbing, thromboembolism (including stroke), bleeding disorders, brain 7/18 abscess, and hyperuricemia. Hypercyanotic spells can occur in infants with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot or other complex congenital defects with dynamic subpulmonic stenosis and a ventricular defect. Depending on the anomaly, pulmonary blood flow may be reduced, normal, or increased (often resulting in heart failure in addition to cyanosis), resulting in cyanosis of variable severity. Heart murmurs are variably audible and are not specific. Left-to-right shunts Oxygenated blood from the left heart (left atrium or left ventricle) or the aorta shunts to the right heart (right atrium or right ventricle) or the pulmonary artery through an opening or communication between the 2 sides. Immediately after birth, pulmonary vascular resistance is high and
