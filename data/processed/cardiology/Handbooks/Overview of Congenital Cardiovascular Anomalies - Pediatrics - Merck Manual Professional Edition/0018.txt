Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry is recommended for all neonates before hospital discharge (1). The screening is done when infants are ≥ 24 hours old and is considered positive if ≥ 1 of the following is present: Any oxygen saturation measurement is < 90%. The oxygen saturation measurements in both the right hand and foot are < 95% on 3 separate measurements taken 1 hour apart. There is > 3% absolute difference between the oxygen saturation in the right hand (preductal) and foot (postductal) on 3 separate, paired measurements taken 1 hour apart. All neonates with a positive screening result should undergo a comprehensive evaluation for congenital heart disease and other causes of hypoxemia (eg, various respiratory disorders, central nervous system depression, sepsis) typically including a chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiography, and often blood testing. Sensitivity of pulse oximetry screening is slightly > 75%; the congenital heart disease lesions most often missed are left heart obstructive lesions (eg, coarctation of the aorta). Treatment of Congenital Heart Disease Medical stabilization of heart failure (eg, with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, beta-blockers, digoxin, spironolactone, salt restriction and, in selected cases, supplemental oxygen or prostaglandin E1) Surgical repair or transcatheter intervention Treatment of
