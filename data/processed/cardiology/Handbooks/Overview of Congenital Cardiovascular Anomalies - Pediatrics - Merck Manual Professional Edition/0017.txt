Overview of Congenital Cardiovascular Anomalies

examination Chest x-ray and ECG Echocardiography Sometimes cardiac MRI or CT angiography, cardiac catheterization with angiocardiography When present, heart murmurs, cyanosis, abnormal pulses, or manifestations of heart failure suggest congenital heart disease. In neonates with these findings, echocardiography is done to confirm the diagnosis of congenital heart disease. If the only abnormality is cyanosis, methemoglobinemia also should be ruled out. Although echocardiography is typically diagnostic, in select cases, cardiac MRI or CT angiography may clarify important anatomic details. Cardiac catheterization with angiocardiography is occasionally needed to confirm the diagnosis or to assess severity of the anomaly; however, it is generally done only for therapeutic purposes. 13/18 Newborn Screening for Congenital Heart Disease Manifestations of congenital heart disease may be subtle or absent in neonates, and failure or delay in detecting critical congenital heart disease, particularly in the 10 to 15% of neonates who require surgical or inpatient medical treatment in the first hours or days of life, may lead to neonatal mortality or significant morbidity. Thus, universal screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry is recommended for all neonates before hospital discharge (1). The screening is done when infants are ≥ 24 hours old and is considered positive
