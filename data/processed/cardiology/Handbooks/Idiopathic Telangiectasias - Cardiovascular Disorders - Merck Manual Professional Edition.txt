Although telangiectasias are usually asymptomatic, many people consider even the smallest

Telangiectasias (spider veins) are usually asymptomatic. However, some patients report a burning
sensation or pain, and many people consider even the smallest telangiectasias cosmetically
unacceptable.
Diagnosis is clinical.
Treatment of Idiopathic Telangiectasias
Sclerotherapy
Laser treatment
Telangiectasias can usually be eliminated by sclerotherapy, intracapillary injections of 0.3% solution of
sodium tetradecyl sulfate through a fine-bore needle. Hypertonic saline 23.4% is sometimes used but
causes fairly severe, temporary, localized pain; therefore, large areas of telangiectasias may require
several treatments. Pigmentation may develop but usually subsides, often completely. Skin ulceration
may result if the injection is extravascular or too large.
Laser treatment is effective, but large areas require several treatments. Small telangiectasias may
persist or recur after initial treatment.
