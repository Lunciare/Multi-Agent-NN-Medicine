Syncope

for all. † See table Some Medications That Cause Syncope. AV = atrioventricular; BP = blood pressure; POCUS = point-of-care ultrasound; S4 = fourth heart sound. TABLE Some Medications That Cause Syncope Mechanism Example 7/14 Mechanism Example Amiodarone, other rate-limiting drugs Beta-blockers Bradyarrhythmia Calcium channel blockers (not dihydropyridines) Digoxin Any medication that prolongs repolarization* (eg, some Tachyarrhythmia antiarrhythmics, some antipsychotics, some antidepressants, some antihistamines, some fluoroquinolones) Most antihypertensives (rarely beta- blockers) Antipsychotics (mainly phenothiazines) Doxorubicin Levodopa Diuretics (eg, loop diuretics such as furosemide; thiazide diuretics such as Orthostatic hypotension hydrochlorothiazide) Nitrates (with or without a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for erectile dysfunction) Quinidine Tricyclic antidepressants Vincristine Evaluation of Syncope Evaluation should be done as soon as possible after the event. The more remote the syncopal event, the more difficult the diagnosis. Information from witnesses is quite helpful and best obtained as soon as 8/14 possible. Guidelines for evaluation and management are available from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (1) and the American College of Cardiology (2). History History of present illness should ascertain events leading up to the syncope, including the patient’s activity (eg, exercising, arguing, in a potentially emotional situation), position (eg, lying or standing), and, if standing, for how long.
