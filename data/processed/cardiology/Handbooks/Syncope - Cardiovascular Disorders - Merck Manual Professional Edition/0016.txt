be interrogated by an external machine that allows the cardiac rhythm to be printed. Pulse oximetry should be done during or immediately after an episode to identify hypoxemia (which may indicate pulmonary embolism). If hypoxemia is present, CT angiography is indicated to rule out pulmonary embolism. Laboratory tests are done based on clinical suspicion; reflexively obtained laboratory panels are of little use. However, all females of childbearing age should have a pregnancy test. Hematocrit is measured if anemia is suspected. Electrolytes are measured only if an abnormality is clinically 11/14 suspected (eg, by symptoms or medication use). Serum troponin is measured if acute myocardial infarction is suspected. Echocardiography (either point-of-care ultrasound [POCUS] or a traditional echocardiogram) is indicated for patients with clinically unexplained syncope, exercise-induced syncope, cardiac murmurs, or suspected intracardiac tumors (eg, those with positional syncope). Stress testing (exercise or pharmacologic) is done when intermittent myocardial ischemia is suspected. It is often done for patients with exercise-induced symptoms. Exercise testing is less valuable unless physical activity precipitated syncope. Tilt table testing may be done if history and physical examination indicate vasodepressor or other reflex-induced syncope. It is also used to evaluate exercise-induced syncope if echocardiography or exercise stress testing
