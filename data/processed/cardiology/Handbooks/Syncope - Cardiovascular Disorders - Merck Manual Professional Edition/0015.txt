conduction abnormality, ventricular hypertrophy, pre-excitation, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, pacemaker malfunction, myocardial ischemia, or myocardial infarction (3). If the diagnosis is questionable after this basic evaluation, measuring cardiac biomarkers and obtaining serial ECGs to rule out MI in older patients plus ECG monitoring for at least 24 hours are prudent. Any detected arrhythmia must be associated with altered consciousness in order to be implicated as the cause, but most patients do not experience syncope during monitoring. On the other hand, the presence of symptoms in the absence of rhythm disturbance helps rule out a cardiac cause. An event recorder (which can record cardiac rhythm for longer periods) may be useful if warning symptoms precede syncope. A signal-averaged ECG may identify predisposition to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease, suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or in patients during the post-myocardial infarction period. If syncopal episodes are infrequent (eg, < 1/month), an implantable loop recorder can be used for longer term recording. This device continuously records the rhythm and can be interrogated by an external machine that allows the cardiac rhythm to be printed. Pulse oximetry should be done during or immediately after an episode to identify hypoxemia (which may
