Syncope

syncopal events, known cardiovascular disease, and known seizure disorders. Medications used should be identified (particularly antihypertensives, diuretics, vasodilators, and antiarrhythmics—see table Some Medications that Cause Syncope). Family history should note presence at a young age of heart disease or sudden death in any family member. Physical examination Vital signs are essential. Heart rate and blood pressure are measured with the patient supine and after 3 minutes of standing. Pulse is palpated for irregularity. General examination notes patient’s mental status, including any confusion or hesitancy suggesting a postictal state and any signs of injury (eg, bruising, swelling, tenderness, tongue bite). The heart is auscultated for murmurs; if present, any change in the murmur with a Valsalva maneuver, standing, or squatting is noted. Careful evaluation of the jugular venous waves (see figure Normal Jugular Vein Waves) while palpating the carotid or auscultating the heart may allow diagnosis of an arrhythmia if an ECG is not available. For example, cannon "a" waves occur when the atria contraction takes place against a closed tricuspid valve and indicate atrial-ventricular dissociation. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, and a rectal examination is done to check for gross or occult blood. A neurologic examination is done to
