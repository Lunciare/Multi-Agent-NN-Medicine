Syncope

table testing may be done if history and physical examination indicate vasodepressor or other reflex-induced syncope. It is also used to evaluate exercise-induced syncope if echocardiography or exercise stress testing is negative. Invasive electrophysiologic testing is considered if noninvasive testing does not identify arrhythmia in patients with any of the following: Unexplained recurrent syncope Unexplained red flag findings Ischemic cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and adult congenital disease, or unexplained syncope that does not otherwise meet criteria for an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD) used for primary prevention An electrophysiologic study that is negative for an inducible abnormal rhythm defines a low-risk subgroup with a high rate of remission of syncope. The use of electrophysiologic testing is controversial in other patients. EEG is warranted if a seizure disorder is suspected. CT and MRI of the head and brain are indicated only if signs and symptoms suggest a focal CNS disorder. Treatment of Syncope 12/14 In witnessed syncope, pulses are checked immediately. If the patient is pulseless, CPR is begun. If pulses are present, severe bradycardia is treated with atropine or external transthoracic pacing. Isoproterenol can be used to maintain adequate heart rate while a temporary pacemaker is placed. Tachyarrhythmias are treated; a direct-current
