Syncope is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone followed by spontaneous revival. The patient is motionless and limp and usually has cool extremities, a weak pulse, and shallow breathing. Sometimes brief involuntary muscle jerks occur, resembling a seizure. Near-syncope is light-headedness and a sense of an impending faint without loss of consciousness. It is usually classified and discussed with syncope because the causes are the same. Seizures can cause sudden loss of consciousness but are not considered syncope.
