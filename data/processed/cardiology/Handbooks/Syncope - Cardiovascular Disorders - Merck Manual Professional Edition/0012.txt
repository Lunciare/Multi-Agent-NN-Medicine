A neurologic examination is done to identify any focal abnormalities, which suggest a central nervous system cause (eg, seizure disorder). 9/14 Red flags Certain findings suggest a more serious etiology: Syncope during exertion Multiple recurrences within a short time Heart murmur or other findings suggesting structural heart disease (eg, chest pain) Older age Significant injury during syncope Family history of sudden unexpected death, exertional syncope, or unexplained recurrent syncope or seizures Interpretation of findings Although the cause is often benign, it is important to identify the occasional life-threatening cause (eg, tachyarrhythmia, heart block) because sudden death is a risk. Clinical findings (see table Some Causes of Syncope) help suggest a cause in many cases. A few generalizations are useful. Benign causes often lead to syncope. Syncope precipitated by unpleasant physical or emotional stimuli (eg, pain, fright), usually occurring in the upright position and often preceded by vagally mediated warning symptoms (eg, nausea, weakness, yawning, apprehension, blurred vision, diaphoresis), suggests vasovagal syncope.
