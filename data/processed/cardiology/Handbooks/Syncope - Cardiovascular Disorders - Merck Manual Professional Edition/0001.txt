Syncope

Syncope is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone followed by spontaneous revival. The patient is motionless and limp and usually has cool extremities, a weak pulse, and shallow breathing. Sometimes brief involuntary muscle jerks occur, resembling a seizure. Near-syncope is light-headedness and a sense of an impending faint without loss of consciousness. It is usually classified and discussed with syncope because the causes are the same. Seizures can cause sudden loss of consciousness but are not considered syncope. However, seizures must be considered in patients presenting for apparent syncope because history may be unclear or unavailable, and some seizures do not cause tonic-clonic convulsions. Furthermore, a brief (< 5 second) seizure sometimes occurs with true syncope. Diagnosis depends on a careful history, eyewitness accounts, or fortuitous examination during the event. Pathophysiology of Syncope Most syncope results from insufficient cerebral blood flow. Some cases involve adequate flow but with insufficient cerebral substrate (oxygen, glucose, or both). Insufficient cerebral blood flow Most deficiencies in cerebral blood flow result from decreased cardiac output (CO). Decreased CO can be caused by Cardiac disorders that obstruct outflow Cardiac disorders of systolic dysfunction Cardiac disorders of diastolic dysfunction Arrhythmias (too fast
