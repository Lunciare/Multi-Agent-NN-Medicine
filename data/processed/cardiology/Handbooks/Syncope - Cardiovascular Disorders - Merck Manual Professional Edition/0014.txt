the likelihood of a cardiac cause or seizure, and therefore the event is of greater concern. The warning signs and slower loss of consciousness that accompany benign vasovagal syncope somewhat reduce the likelihood of injury. 10/14 Loss of consciousness during a seizure or postictal confusion can sometimes be confused with syncope, but muscular jerking or convulsions that last more than a few seconds, incontinence, drooling, or tongue biting, if present, usually point to a seizure. Testing Testing typically is done: ECG Pulse oximetry Sometimes echocardiography Sometimes tilt table testing Blood tests only if clinically indicated Central nervous system imaging rarely indicated In general, if syncope results in an injury or is recurrent (particularly within a brief period), more intensive evaluation is warranted. Cardiac and brain imaging are not done unless indicated by clinical findings (suspected cardiac etiology or neurologic deficits). Patients with suspected arrhythmia, myocarditis, or ischemia should be evaluated as inpatients. Others may be evaluated as outpatients. ECG is done for all patients. The ECG may reveal arrhythmia, a conduction abnormality, ventricular hypertrophy, pre-excitation, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, pacemaker malfunction, myocardial ischemia, or myocardial infarction (3). If the diagnosis is questionable after this basic evaluation, measuring cardiac biomarkers and
