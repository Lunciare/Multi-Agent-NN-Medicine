Syncope

venous return that occurs with standing. Cerebrovascular disorders (eg, strokes, transient ischemic attacks) rarely cause syncope because most of them do not involve the centrencephalic structures that must be affected to cause loss of consciousness. However, basilar artery ischemia, due to transient ischemic attack, stroke, or migraine, may cause syncope. Rarely, patients with severe cervical arthritis or spondylosis develop vertebrobasilar insufficiency with syncope when the head is moved in certain positions. Insufficient cerebral substrate The central nervous system (CNS) requires oxygen and glucose to function. Even with normal cerebral blood flow, a significant deficit of either will cause loss of consciousness . In practice, hypoglycemia is the primary cause because hypoxia rarely develops in a manner causing abrupt loss of consciousness (other than in flying or diving incidents). Loss of consciousness due to hypoglycemia is seldom as abrupt as in syncope or seizures because warning symptoms occur (except in patients taking beta-blockers); however, the onset may be unclear to the examiner unless the event was witnessed. Etiology of Syncope Causes are usually classified by the mechanism (see table Some Causes of Syncope). The most common causes are Vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) Idiopathic Many cases of syncope never have a firm diagnosis but
