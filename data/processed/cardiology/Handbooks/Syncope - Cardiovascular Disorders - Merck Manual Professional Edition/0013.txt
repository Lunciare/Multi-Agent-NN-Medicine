vagally mediated warning symptoms (eg, nausea, weakness, yawning, apprehension, blurred vision, diaphoresis), suggests vasovagal syncope. Syncope that occurs most often when assuming an upright position (particularly in older patients after prolonged bed rest or in patients taking medications in certain classes) suggests orthostatic syncope. Syncope that occurs after standing for long periods without moving is usually due to venous pooling. Dangerous causes are suggested by red flag findings. Syncope with exertion suggests cardiac outflow obstruction or exercise-induced arrhythmia. Such patients sometimes also have chest pain, palpitations, or both. Cardiac findings may help identify a cause. A harsh, late-peaking, basal murmur radiating to the carotid arteries suggests aortic stenosis; a systolic murmur that increases with the Valsalva maneuver and disappears with squatting suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Syncope that begins and ends suddenly and spontaneously is typical of cardiac causes, most commonly an arrhythmia. Syncope while lying down also suggests an arrhythmia because vasovagal and orthostatic mechanisms do not cause syncope in the recumbent position. Syncope accompanied by injury during the episode increases the likelihood of a cardiac cause or seizure, and therefore the event is of greater concern. The warning signs and slower loss of consciousness that accompany benign vasovagal syncope somewhat
