Myocarditis overview

and rheumatoid factor may also be detected. Electrocardiogram The presence of ST segment elevation in patients with myocarditis can mimic pericarditis and myocardial infarction. Arrhythmias and heart block may also be observed in myocarditis patients. Myocarditis can be distinguished from pericarditis by the presence of PR depression in the patient with pericarditis. Endomyocardial Biopsy Endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard test to evaluate for the presence of and to subclassify the type of myocarditis. A small tissue sample of the endocardium and myocardium is obtained via Croigokhiets hseidlpe uds dcelaivredr ioaucr secravtichese.t Beyr uizsiantgi oounr .s eTrvhicees , syaoum agprleee tois o utrh uesen o fe cvooakliuesa.ted by a pathologist 3/6 using immunochemistry and special staining techniques as necessary. Histopathological features include abundant edema in the myocardial interstitium and an inflammatory infiltrate which is rich in lymphocytes and macrophages. Focal destruction of myocytes as a result of the inflammatory process results in left ventricular dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended when the results would identify an underlying disease that is amenable to therapy. Routine performance of endomyocardial biopsy is not recommended in all patients with myocarditis. Chest X Ray Findings on chest x-ray suggestive of myocarditis include cardiomegaly, cephalization of the
