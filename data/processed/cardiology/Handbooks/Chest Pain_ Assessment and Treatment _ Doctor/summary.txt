Prognosis For suspected cardiac causes of chest pain, see the separate Cardiac-type chest pain presenting in primary care article. There is an urgent need to diagnose the cause of any patient presenting with chest pain to ensure that serious and life-threatening conditions are not missed. Urgent hospital referral is indicated if there is any indication of a severe underlying disorder or of the patient being acutely unwell. 1/9 When a patient telephones, acutely unwell with chest pain, arrange a 999/112/911 ambulance in advance of (or instead of) visiting, as any delay in starting appropriate treatment has an adverse effect on prognosis. How common is chest pain? (Epidemiology) Epidemiological studies of chest pain, in particular the risk of pain being cardiac in nature, vary according to setting.
