patients.type: embedded-entry-inline id: 6UOQftueJOgSfJ9fQ4tAOv In patients with a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism (<15%), meeting all of the following criteria allows the diagnosis to be ruled out: Age < 50. Heart rate < 100bpm. Oxygen saturations on room air > 94%. No unilateral leg swelling. No haemoptysis. No recent surgery or trauma (within the last 4 weeks). No prior pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis diagnosis. No oral contraceptive, hormone replacement, or oestrogenic hormone use. Investigations Within primary care, non-acute chest pain: FBC (to exclude anaemia). Renal function tests and electrolytes. TFTs. CRP. Fasting lipids and glucose. 5/9 Resting ECG. Note: a resting ECG is normal in over 90% of patients with recent symptoms of angina. If an urgent ECG is considered necessary on clinical grounds, admission to hospital is usually required. Additional tests if a non-cardiac cause is suspected - eg, CXR, LFTs and amylase, abdominal ultrasound. Referral to a rapid access chest pain clinic is now usual for further assessment and review, if stable angina is suspected. With acute chest pain, in a hospital setting: Blood tests: FBC, renal function tests, electrolytes, LFTs, amylase, coagulation screen, serial cardiac enzymes (troponin I or T). D-dimer testing may be
