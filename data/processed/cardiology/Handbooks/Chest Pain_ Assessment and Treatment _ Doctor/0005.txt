Palpitations, dizziness, syncope: increase the likelihood of a cardiac cause and imply the need for hospital admission - but palpitations may be associ- ated with anxiety. Consider the presence of any risk factors for coronary heart disease. Refer to any previous ECGs for comparison and any previous cardiac investiga- tions (where available). Exclude thrombolysis contra-indications if ACS is suspected. Examination Vital signs, including blood pressure measurement in both arms. Detailed cardiovascular and respiratory examinations, looking particularly for signs of cardiac failure or dysrhythmia. Chest wall, looking for localised tenderness and evidence of trauma. 4/9 Also examine the abdomen (possible gastrointestinal cause), legs (oedema or possible deep vein thrombosis) and skin (rash). The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used to rule out a pulmonary embolism on clinical grounds in selected low-risk patients.type: embedded-entry-inline id: 6UOQftueJOgSfJ9fQ4tAOv In patients with a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism (<15%), meeting all of the following criteria allows the diagnosis to be ruled out: Age <
