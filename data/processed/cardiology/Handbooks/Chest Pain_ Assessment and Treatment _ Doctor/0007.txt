KEYWORDS: pain, chest, chest pain, cardiac, cause, patients, acs, diagnosis, coronary, angina, acute, disease, hospital, pulmonary, embolism

With acute chest pain, in a hospital setting: Blood tests: FBC, renal function tests, electrolytes, LFTs, amylase, coagulation screen, serial cardiac enzymes (troponin I or T). D-dimer testing may be used to help rule out a pulmonary embolism in patients where it is a diagnostic possibili- ty, but there is a low pre-test probability. Serial ECG. CXR. Second-line investigations when indicated include echocardiography, angiog- raphy, exercise testing, myocardial perfusion scan, CT/MRI scan, upper gastroin- testinal endoscopy, and lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. Cardiac chest pain Cardiac pain is often heavy, pressing and tight. Symptoms that may indicate ACS include: Pain in the chest and/or other areas (eg, the arms, back or jaw) lasting longer than 15 minutes. Chest pain with nausea and vomiting, marked sweating and/or breathless- ness, or haemodynamic instability. New-onset chest pain, or abrupt deterioration in stable angina, with recur- rent pain occurring frequently with little or no exertion and often lasting longer than 15 minutes. Contradictory findings are reported about symptoms that could predict the di- agnosis or severity of ACS. European guidelines declare that severe or ongoing chest pain lasting 20 minutes or more is a symptom indicating high risk of ACS, 6/9 but ACS pain can
