Chest pain is a common symptom, accounting for about 1% of GP visits.[1] Around 40% of patients are referred to secondary care and musculoskeletal pain is both the most frequent working (26.1%) and final diagnosis (33.1%).[2] Potentially life-threatening final diagnosis accounts for 8.4% of all chest pain cases. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines report that among unselected patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department, dis- ease prevalence can be expected to be the following: 5-10% ST-segment eleva- tion myocardial infarction (STEMI), 15-20% non-STEMI (NSTEMI), 10% unstable angina, 15% other cardiac conditions, and 50% non-cardiac diseases.[3] Combined hospital and primary care data produced an incidence of cardiac chest pain of 6.5 per 1,000 general population per annum. Population-based questionnaire studies show about 20% of adults reporting chest pain over the course of a year. This reflects the chronicity of coronary heart disease but also low consultation rates, particularly in those without a diagnosis of cardiac disease. The incidence of chest pain consultations increases with age and is more com- mon for men.
