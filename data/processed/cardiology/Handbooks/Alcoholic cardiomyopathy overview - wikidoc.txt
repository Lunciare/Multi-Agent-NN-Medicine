Overview
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the excessive use of alcohol use damages the heart
muscle causing heart failure. It is characterized by constellation of findings which includes a
history of excessive alcohol intake, physical signs of alcohol abuse, heart failure, and supportive
findings consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy.
Pathophysiology
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. Both acute and chronic alcohol
consumption, in excessive amounts, has been associated with adverse effects on the myocardium
leading to non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It accounts for 21-36% of all cases of non-
ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [1]. The maximum recommended dose of alcohol consumption in
US men and women is 14 drinks and 7 drinks respectively. Consumption above these levels has
been shown to be associated with the increased risk of alcoholic cardiomyopathy [2]. Pathogenesis
of this condition is multi-factorial.
Differentiating Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy from Other Diseases
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Therefore, it must be
differentiated from other forms of DCM like idiopathic DCM, connective tissue disorders etc.
Epidemiology and Demographics
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is more prevalent in middle aged males between the ages of 35-50.
However, females may be more sensitive to cardiotoxic effects of alcohol, and may develop
alcoholic cardiomyopathy with lesser amounts of alcohol use, than males.[3][4]
Natural History, Complications and Prognosis
In patients who continue to abuse alcohol, 4 year survival rate is 50%. On the contrary, abstinence
is associated with regression of symptoms and overall improvement. Improvement in cardiac
function evident from echocardiographic findings can also be noted.

Symptoms presented by the occurrence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy are the result of the heart
failure and usually occur after the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. Therefore the
symptoms have a lot in common with other forms of cardiomyopathy. Symptoms may develop
acutely or insidiously.
Physical Examination
Patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy present with signs similar to that of heart failure. Most
common findings include pedal edema, increased jugular venous pressure, pulmonary edema, and
abnormal heart sounds.
Laboratory Findings
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is majorly a clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis. There are no
pathognomonic laboratory findings diagnostic of this disorder.
Electrocardiogram
Although many EKG changes are seen in patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, none of them are
pathognomonic for this condition. However, acute alcoholic intoxication is also associated with
pathological EKG changes. Common EKG abnormalities in alcoholic cardiomyopathy include non-
specific ST-T changes and QT abnormalities.
Imaging
Chest X-ray
Chest X-ray findings are essentially the same as those seen in congestive heart failure.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is the most useful initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with heart
failure. Because of its noninvasive nature and the ease of the test, it is the test of choice in the
initial and follow-up evaluation of most forms of cardiomyopathy. It provides information not only
on overall heart size and function, but also on valvular structure and function, wall motion and
thickness, and pericardial disease.
Cardiac Catheterization
Cardiac catheterization or angiogram may be done to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) as the
etiology of heart failure in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. In addition to ruling out CAD, cardiac
catheteriation may also be helpful to assess cardiac output, cardiac hemodynamics and filling
pressures.

Treatment for alcoholic cardiomyopathy involves lifestyle changes, including complete abstinence
from alcohol use [5][6][7][8], a low sodium diet, and fluid restriction, as well as medications. If the
heart failure is severe, the effectiveness of treatment will be limited.
Surgery
In severe or unresponsive patients, cardiac transplantation can be an option.
