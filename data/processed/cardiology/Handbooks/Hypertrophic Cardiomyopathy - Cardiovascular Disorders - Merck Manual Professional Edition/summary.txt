Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a congenital or acquired disorder characterized by marked ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction (eg, due to valvular aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, systemic hypertension). Symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and sudden death. A systolic murmur, increased by Valsalva maneuver, is typically present in the hypertrophic obstructive type. Diagnosis is by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. Treatment is with beta-blockers, verapamil, disopyramide, mavacamten, and sometimes chemical reduction or surgical removal of outflow tract obstruction. A cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscle (see also Overview of Cardiomyopathies.) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden death in young athletes.
