Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a congenital or acquired disorder characterized by marked ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction (eg, due to valvular aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, systemic hypertension). Symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and sudden death. A systolic murmur, increased by Valsalva maneuver, is typically present in the hypertrophic obstructive type. Diagnosis is by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. Treatment is with beta-blockers, verapamil, disopyramide, mavacamten, and sometimes chemical reduction or surgical removal of outflow tract obstruction. A cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscle (see also Overview of Cardiomyopathies.) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden death in young athletes. It may cause unexplained syncope and may not be diagnosed before autopsy. Etiology of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Most cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are inherited. At least 1,500 different mutations that are inherited in an autosomally dominant pattern have been identified; spontaneous mutations can also occur. Prevalence is 1:200 to 1:500 (1); phenotypic expression varies markedly. Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is acquired. It may develop in patients with acromegaly, pheochromocytoma, or neurofibromatosis. Pathophysiology of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy The myocardium is abnormal with cellular and myofibrillar disarray, although this finding is not specific for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the most common phenotype,
