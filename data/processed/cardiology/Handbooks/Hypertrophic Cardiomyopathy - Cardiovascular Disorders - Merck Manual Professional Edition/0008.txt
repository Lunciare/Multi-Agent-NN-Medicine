Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

cardiomyopathy (see figure Forms of Cardiomyopathy) and quantify the severity of hypertrophy and degree of outflow tract obstruction. These measurements are particularly useful for monitoring the effect of medical or surgical treatment. Midsystolic closure of the aortic valve sometimes occurs when outflow tract obstruction is severe. Ambulatory 24-hour monitoring is recommended during the initial evaluation and every 1 to 3 years to assess risk of sudden cardiac death and help guide treatment of arrhythmias (1). Cardiac catheterization is usually done only when invasive therapy is considered. Usually, no significant stenoses are present in the coronary arteries, but older patients may have coexisting coronary artery disease. Genetic markers do not identify high-risk individuals or influence treatment. However, genetic testing may be of benefit in screening family members. Diagnosis reference 1.
