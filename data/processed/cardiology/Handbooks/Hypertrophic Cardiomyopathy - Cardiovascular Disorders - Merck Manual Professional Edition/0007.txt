Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

such patients is difficult. Patients with syncope or sustained arrhythmias should be evaluated as inpatients. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Apical Variant) The ECG usually shows voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy (eg, S wave in lead V1 plus R wave in lead V5 or V6 > 35 mm). Very deep septal Q waves in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 are often present with asymmetric septal hypertrophy; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sometimes produces a QRS complex in V1 and V2, simulating previous septal infarction. T waves are usually abnormal; the most common finding is deep symmetric T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. ST-segment depression in the same leads is common (particularly in the apical obliterative form). The P wave is often broad and notched in leads II, III, and aVF, with a biphasic P wave in leads V1 and V2, indicating left atrial hypertrophy. Incidence of preexcitation phenomenon of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome type, which may cause palpitations, is increased. Bundle branch block is common. Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography can differentiate the forms of cardiomyopathy (see figure Forms of Cardiomyopathy) and quantify the severity of hypertrophy and degree of outflow tract obstruction. These measurements are particularly useful for monitoring the effect of medical or
