Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

diastolic volume), measures to lower aortic pressure (eg, nitroglycerin), or a postextrasystolic contraction (which increases the outflow tract pressure gradient). Handgrip increases aortic pressure, thereby reducing the murmur’s intensity. Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Clinical suspicion (syncope, other symptoms, or murmur) Echocardiography and/or MRI Diagnosis is suspected based on a typical murmur and symptoms. Suspicion is increased if the patient has a history of unexplained syncope or a family history of unexplained sudden death. Unexplained syncope in young athletes should always raise suspicion. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy must be distinguished from aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease, which cause similar symptoms. Less common infiltrative cardiac disorders such as Anderson-Fabry disease and amyloid heart disease may mimic findings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ECG and 2-dimensional echocardiography and/or MRI (the best noninvasive confirmatory tests) are done. Chest x-ray is often done but is usually normal because the ventricles are not dilated (although the left atrium may be enlarged). Exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory monitoring may be helpful for patients considered at high risk, although accurately identifying such patients is difficult. Patients with syncope or sustained arrhythmias should be evaluated as inpatients. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Apical Variant) The ECG usually shows voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy (eg, S
