Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

capillary density relative to myocyte size is inadequate (capillary/myocyte imbalance) or lumen diameter of intramyocardial coronary arteries is narrowed by intimal and medial hyperplasia and hypertrophy. A supply-demand mismatch also may be present due to increased oxygen demand caused by the hypertrophy and adverse loading conditions. In some cases, myocytes gradually die, probably because capillary/myocyte imbalance causes chronic diffuse ischemia. As myocytes die, they are replaced by diffuse fibrosis. Then, the hypertrophied ventricle with diastolic dysfunction gradually dilates and systolic dysfunction develops. Symptoms and Signs of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Typically, symptoms appear between ages 20 and 40 years and are exertional, but symptoms may be highly variable. They include dyspnea, chest pain (usually resembling typical angina), palpitations, and syncope. Because systolic function is preserved, fatigability is seldom reported. The abnormal diastolic 2/8 function is responsible for most symptoms. In patients with outflow tract obstruction, differentiation of symptoms due to the obstruction versus those caused by abnormal diastolic function can be difficult. Syncope may occur during exertion either because outflow obstruction worsens with increased contractility or because of ventricular or atrial arrhythmia. Syncope is a marker of increased risk of sudden death. Blood pressure and heart rate are usually normal, and signs
