Beta-blockers are generally considered first-line treatment for patients with the obstructive phenotype; disopyramide helps relieve symptoms for patients in whom first-line therapy with beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem has failed. Patients who continue to experience symptoms related to significant outflow tract gradients (≥ 50 mm Hg) despite medical therapy are candidates for invasive treatment. When done at an experienced center, surgical myectomy has a low operative mortality with excellent outcomes, making it the preferred therapy in such patients. Percutaneous catheter alcohol septal ablation is an alternative to surgery in older patients and others who are at high surgical risk. Medications that reduce preload (eg, nitrates, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers) decrease chamber size and worsen symptoms and signs. Vasodilators increase the outflow tract gradient and cause a reflex tachycardia that further worsens ventricular diastolic function. Inotropic drugs (eg, digitalis glycosides, catecholamines) worsen outflow tract obstruction, do not relieve the high end-diastolic pressure, and may induce arrhythmias. Mavacamten, an oral cardiac myosin inhibitor that reduces actin-myosin cross-bridge formation, relieves symptoms, reduces left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and increases exercise tolerance in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1, 2). If syncope or sudden cardiac arrest has occurred or if sustained ventricular
