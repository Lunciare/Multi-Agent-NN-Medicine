need for repeat interventions (4). 6/8 Avoidance of competitive sports was previously recommended because sudden deaths can occur during increased exertion. Current guidelines recommend that athletes with HCM undergo comprehensive evaluation and shared discussion of potential risk with an expert HCM specialist. Treatment of the dilated congestive phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the same as that of dilated cardiomyopathy with predominant systolic dysfunction. Genetic counseling is appropriate for patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy. Prognosis for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Overall, annual mortality is about 1% for adults but is higher for children. Death is usually sudden, and sudden death is the most common sequela; chronic heart failure occurs less often. A higher risk of sudden cardiac death is predicted by the presence of the following risk factors: Family history of sudden cardiac death due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular arrhythmias Personal history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular arrhythmias Multiple repetitive non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (on ambulatory ECG) Massive left-ventricular hypertrophy (thickness ≥ 30 mm), LV dysfunction (EF < 50%) , LV apical aneurysm Extensive and diffuse late gadolinium enhancement on MRI Key Points 7/8 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually due to one of numerous genetic mutations that cause
