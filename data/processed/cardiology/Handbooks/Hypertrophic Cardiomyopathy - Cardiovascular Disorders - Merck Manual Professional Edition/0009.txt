Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Possibly antiarrhythmics (eg, disopyramide, amiodarone) Possibly implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and sometimes surgery or ablative procedures Treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based on the phenotype. Patients without obstruction generally have a stable clinical course without significant symptoms, although some experience heart failure symptoms due to diastolic dysfunction. Beta-blockers and heart rate-limiting calcium channel blockers with a lower arterial dilation capacity (usually verapamil), alone or combined, are the mainstays. By slowing the heart rate, they prolong the diastolic filling period, which may increase left ventricular filling in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Long-term efficacy of such therapy, however, has not been proven. 5/8 In patients with the obstructive phenotype, in addition to attempts at improving diastolic function, treatment is directed at reducing the outflow tract gradient. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem), beta-blockers, and disopyramide reduce the outflow tract gradient through their negative inotropic effects. Disopyramide appears to be most effective for patients with a resting gradient whereas beta-blockers are best at blunting the gradient that occurs during exercise. Beta-blockers are generally considered first-line treatment for patients with the obstructive phenotype; disopyramide helps relieve symptoms for patients in whom first-line therapy with beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem has failed.
