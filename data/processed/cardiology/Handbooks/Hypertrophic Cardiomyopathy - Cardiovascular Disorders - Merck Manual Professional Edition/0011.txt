reduces left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and increases exercise tolerance in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1, 2). If syncope or sudden cardiac arrest has occurred or if sustained ventricular arrhythmia is confirmed by ECG or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) should usually be placed. Controversy exists regarding the need to place a defibrillator in patients without syncope, sudden cardiac arrest, or ventricular arrhythmias. It is generally believed that ICD insertion should be considered in patients with high-risk features (3). High-risk features include A family history of premature sudden cardiac arrest Left ventricular wall thickness > 3 cm Delayed enhancement on cardiac MRI Unexplained syncope Survival after a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmia Multiple burst of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% (end-stage disease) Left ventricular aneurysm Myomectomy and alcohol ablation have been used to decrease outflow obstruction and relive symptoms. There is no proven difference on mortality between these interventions, but myomectomy is more effective for relieving obstruction and decreasing the need for repeat interventions (4). 6/8 Avoidance of competitive sports was previously recommended because sudden deaths can occur during increased exertion. Current guidelines recommend that athletes with HCM undergo comprehensive
