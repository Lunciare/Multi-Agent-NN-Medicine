Syndrome of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia

Syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia refers to sinus node dysfunction causing rapid, physiologically inappropriate, heart rates. Symptoms are pronounced and include palpitations, orthostatic and exercise intolerance, weakness, fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and anxiety. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment is augmentation of vagal tone, reduction of sympathetic tone, and reduction of sinus nodal rate. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) Syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a defined as the persistent or paroxysmal presence of a sinus heart rate > 100 beats/minute with a mean 24-hour heart rate > 90 beats/minute in the absence of a physiologic or evident secondary cause associated with distressing symptoms (1) dominated by palpitations, orthostatic intolerance, and exercise intolerance. Syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia mainly affects females in their late second decade to mid fourth decade (2). Etiology of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia The etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is unknown. Potential components include 1/3 Increased intrinsic sinus node automaticity Decreased vagal sensitivity Augmented beta-adrenergic sensitivity Disturbed neurohumoral modulation Symptoms and Signs of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia Typically, patients with the syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia are very symptomatic with palpitations, orthostatic intolerance, exercise intolerance, weakness, fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and anxiety. Physical findings are those
