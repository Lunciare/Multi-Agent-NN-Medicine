Syndrome of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia

Tachycardia Typically, patients with the syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia are very symptomatic with palpitations, orthostatic intolerance, exercise intolerance, weakness, fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and anxiety. Physical findings are those of tachycardia aggravated by standing in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. The latter helps to distinguish the syndrome from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Diagnosis of Syndrome of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia ECG 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to rule out hyperthyroidism Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a diagnosis of exclusion. All other secondary causes of sinus tachycardia are considered, including physiologic disorders (eg, cardiac conditions, infections, anemia, hypoxia), hormonal disorders (eg, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma), anxiety, pain, medications and other stimulants (1). Treatment of Syndrome of Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia Avoidance of sympathomimetics, including caffeine Down-regulation of beta-adrenergic activity through physical activity Up-regulation of vagal activity (eg, with yoga, meditation, breathing exercises) Nonselective beta-1 blocker medication or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist therapy Ivabradine Treatment of symptomatic syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is difficult, and the condition is often inadequately treated (1, 2). The most promising therapy to date is with ivabradine, a blocker of the electrical current in the dominant sinus node pacemaker (If current, or the funny current) (1).
