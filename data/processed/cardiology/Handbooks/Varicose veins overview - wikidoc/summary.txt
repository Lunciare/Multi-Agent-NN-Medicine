Overview Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and twisted. The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, although varicose veins occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde). Leg muscles pump the blood in veins to return it to the heart. When veins become enlarged, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves don't work. A common cause of valve failure is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), which can cause permanent damage to the valves.
