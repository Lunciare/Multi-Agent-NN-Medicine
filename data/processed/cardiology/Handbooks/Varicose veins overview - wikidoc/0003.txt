Varicose veins overview

Medical Therapy Non-surgical treatments include sclerotherapy, elastic stockings, elevating the legs, and exercise. The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins. Newer surgical treatments are less invasive (see radiofrequency ablation) and are slowly replacing traditional surgical treatments. Since most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins, and the superficial veins only return about 10%, they can be removed or ablated without serious harm.[5] Surgery Several techniques have been performed for over a century, from the more invasive named "saphenous stripping" up to mini invasives like superficial phlectomies and CHIVA cure.
