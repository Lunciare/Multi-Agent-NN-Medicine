to 64 mm Hg or peak velocity 3 to 4 m/second Severe: Peak gradient > 64 mm Hg or peak velocity > 4 m/second ECG may be normal or show RV hypertrophy or right bundle branch block. Right heart catheterization is indicated when 2 levels of obstruction are suspected (valvular and infundibular), when direct measurement of right ventricular or other pressures is needed, when clinical and echocardiographic findings differ, or before intervention is performed. Cardiac MRI may be useful if there is a need for quantification of right ventricle size or function, or the degree of concomitant pulmonary insufficiency. Phonocardiographic Characteristics of Heart Murmurs Treatment of Pulmonary Stenosis Balloon valvuloplasty Sometimes surgical valvuloplasty or valve replacement Prognosis of pulmonary stenosis without treatment is generally good and improves with appropriate intervention. Mild pulmonary valve stenosis in children may improve and even resolve spontaneously. The first-line treatment of pulmonary stenosis is balloon valvuloplasty, which is indicated for patients with symptoms and moderate or severe valvular stenosis and for asymptomatic patients with severe stenosis. Surgical valvuloplasty may be performed when there is another indication for cardiac surgery if the patient is otherwise not a candidate for a transcatheter approach. Pulmonary valve replacement may
