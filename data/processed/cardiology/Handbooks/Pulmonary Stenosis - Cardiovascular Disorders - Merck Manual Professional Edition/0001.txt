Pulmonary Stenosis

By Guy P. Armstrong, MD, Waitemata District Health Board and Waitemata Cardiology, Auckland Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary Reviewed/Revised Jun 2025 Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract, or restricted opening of the pulmonary valve leaflets, causing obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery during systole. Most mild cases are congenital; many remain asymptomatic until adulthood. Signs include a crescendo-decrescendo ejection murmur. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Symptomatic patients and those with large gradients require balloon valvuloplasty. Etiology of Pulmonary Stenosis Pulmonary stenosis is most often congenital and affects predominantly children; stenosis may be valvular or just below the valve in the outflow tract (infundibular); commonly it is a component of tetralogy of Fallot. Supravalvular stenosis may also occur, sometimes in combination with valvar stenosis, as a tethered valve/supravalve complex, or as isolated supravalvar narrowing (as in Williams or Alagille syndromes). Less common causes are: Noonan syndrome (a genetic syndrome involving the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway) Carcinoid syndrome (in adults) Symptoms and Signs of Pulmonary Stenosis Many children with pulmonary stenosis remain asymptomatic for years and do not develop overt symptoms until adulthood, although abnormalities
