is thought to result from abnormal ventricular wall tension. The click occurs early in systole (very near S1) and may be louder in inspiration. A harsh crescendo- decrescendo ejection murmur is audible and is heard best at the left parasternal second (valvular stenosis) or fourth (infundibular stenosis) intercostal space with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient leans forward. In RV failure and hypertrophy, the third and fourth heart sounds (S3 and S4) are rarely audible at the left parasternal fourth intercostal space. Unlike the aortic stenosis murmur, a pulmonary stenosis murmur does not radiate, and the crescendo component lengthens as stenosis progresses. The murmur grows louder immediately with Valsalva release and with inspiration; the patient may need to be standing for this effect to be heard. AUDIO Pulmonary Stenosis Murmur Diagnosis of Pulmonary Stenosis Echocardiography Diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis is confirmed by Doppler echocardiography, which can characterize the severity as (1): Mild: Peak gradient < 36 mm Hg or peak velocity < 3 m/second Moderate: Peak gradient 36 to 64 mm Hg or peak velocity 3 to 4 m/second Severe: Peak gradient > 64 mm Hg or peak velocity > 4 m/second ECG may be normal or show
