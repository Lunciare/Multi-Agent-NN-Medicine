Armstrong, MD, Waitemata District Health Board and Waitemata Cardiology, Auckland Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary Reviewed/Revised Jun 2025 Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is narrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract, or restricted opening of the pulmonary valve leaflets, causing obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery during systole. Most mild cases are congenital; many remain asymptomatic until adulthood. Signs include a crescendo-decrescendo ejection murmur. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Symptomatic patients and those with large gradients require balloon valvuloplasty.
