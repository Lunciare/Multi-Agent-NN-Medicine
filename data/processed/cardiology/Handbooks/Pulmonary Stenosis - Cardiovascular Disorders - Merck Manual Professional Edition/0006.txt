Pulmonary Stenosis
KEYWORDS: pulmonary, stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, valve, heart, second, murmur, peak, pulmonary valve, symptoms, right, valvuloplasty, patients, asymptomatic, patient

is usually congenital, but symptoms (eg, syncope, angina, dyspnea) usually do not appear until adulthood. Heart sounds include wide but not fixed splitting of the second heart sound and a harsh crescendo-decrescendo ejection murmur heard best at the left parasternal second or fourth intercostal space when the patient leans forward; the murmur grows louder immediately with Valsalva release and with inspiration. Balloon valvuloplasty is performed for symptomatic patients and for asymptomatic patients with severe pulmonary stenosis.
