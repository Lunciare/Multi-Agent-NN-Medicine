pathway) Carcinoid syndrome (in adults) Symptoms and Signs of Pulmonary Stenosis Many children with pulmonary stenosis remain asymptomatic for years and do not develop overt symptoms until adulthood, although abnormalities can sometimes be detected on exercise testing before symptoms appear. Even in adulthood, many patients remain asymptomatic. When symptoms of 1/5 pulmonary stenosis develop, they resemble those of aortic stenosis (exercise intolerance, syncope, angina, dyspnea). Visible and palpable signs reflect the effects of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and include a prominent jugular venous a wave (due to forceful atrial contraction against a hypertrophied RV), an RV precordial lift or heave, and a left parasternal systolic thrill at the second intercostal space. Auscultation Widened second heart sound (S2) and delayed pulmonic component of S2 (P2) Harsh crescendo-decrescendo ejection murmur On auscultation, the first heart sound (S1) is normal and the splitting S2 is widened (but not fixed) because prolonged pulmonary ejection causes a delay in P2. As severity of PS worsens, P2 becomes softer in volume. A click in congenital PS is thought to result from abnormal ventricular wall tension. The click occurs early in systole (very near S1) and may be louder in inspiration. A harsh crescendo- decrescendo ejection murmur
