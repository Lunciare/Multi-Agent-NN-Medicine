Overview of Revascularization for Acute Coronary

causes acute coronary artery dissection. Fibrinolytics are not indicated for unstable angina or NSTEMI. Risk outweighs potential benefit. CLINICAL CALCULATORS Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Score for Unstable Angina Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Emergency PCI is the preferred treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when available in a timely fashion (door to balloon-inflation time < 90 minutes) by an experienced operator (1). Indications for urgent PCI later in the course of STEMI include hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmias requiring transvenous pacing or repeated cardioversion, and age > 75 years. If the lesions necessitate CABG, there is significant mortality and a higher morbidity rate. If there is likely to be a significant delay in availability of PCI, thrombolysis should be done for STEMI patients meeting criteria (see table Fibrinolytic Therapy for STEMI). Reperfusion using fibrinolytics is most effective if given in the first few minutes to hours after onset of myocardial infarction. The earlier a fibrinolytic is begun, the better. The goal is a door-to-needle time of 30 to 60 minutes. Greatest benefit occurs within 3 hours, but the drugs may be effective up to 12 hours. Used with aspirin, fibrinolytics reduce hospital mortality rate by
