Overview of Revascularization for Acute Coronary

of 30 to 60 minutes. Greatest benefit occurs within 3 hours, but the drugs may be effective up to 12 hours. Used with aspirin, fibrinolytics reduce hospital mortality rate by 30 to 50% and improve ventricular function. Prehospital use of fibrinolytics by trained paramedics can significantly reduce time to treatment and should be considered in situations in which PCI within 90 minutes is not possible, particularly in patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset. Regardless, most patients who undergo thrombolysis will ultimately require transfer to a PCI-capable facility for elective angiography and PCI as necessary before discharge. PCI should be considered after fibrinolytics if chest pain or ST-segment elevation persists ≥ 60 minutes after initiation of fibrinolytics or if pain and ST-segment elevation recur, but only if PCI can be initiated < 90 minutes after onset of recurrence. If PCI is unavailable, fibrinolytics can be repeated. Characteristics and selection of fibrinolytic drugs are discussed elsewhere. 2/4 TABLE Fibrinolytic Therapy for STEMI Criteria Specifics ST-segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous leads Typical symptoms and left bundle ECG criteria* branch block not known to be old Strictly posterior MI (large R wave in V1 and ST depression in V1–V4 Aortic dissection
