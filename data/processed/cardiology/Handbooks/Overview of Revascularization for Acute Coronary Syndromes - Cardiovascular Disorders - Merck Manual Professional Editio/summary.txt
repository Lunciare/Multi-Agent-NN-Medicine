Revascularization is the restoration of blood supply to ischemic myocardium in an effort to limit ongoing damage, reduce ventricular irritability, and improve short-term and long-term outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Modes of revascularization include: Thrombolysis with fibrinolytic drugs Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with or without stent placement Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) The use, timing, and modality of revascularization depend on which acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is present, timing of presentation, extent and location of anatomic lesions, and availability of personnel and facilities (see figure Approach to Acute Coronary Syndromes—1). Unstable Angina and Non–ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Immediate reperfusion is not as urgent in patients with uncomplicated non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), in whom a completely occluded infarct-related artery at presentation is uncommon, or in patients with unstable angina who respond to medical therapy. Such patients typically undergo angiography within the first 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG.
