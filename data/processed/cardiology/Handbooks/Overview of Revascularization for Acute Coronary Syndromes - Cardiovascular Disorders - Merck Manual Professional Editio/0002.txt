Overview of Revascularization for Acute Coronary

patients in whom angiography demonstrates Only a small area of myocardium at risk Lesion morphology not amenable to PCI Anatomically insignificant disease (< 50% coronary stenosis) Significant left main disease in patients who are not candidates for CABG Further, angiography or PCI should be deferred in favor of medical management for patients with a high risk of procedure-related morbidity or mortality. By contrast, patients with persistent chest pain despite maximal medical therapy or complications (eg, markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, presence of cardiogenic shock, acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, unstable arrhythmias) should proceed directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG. As in patients with stable angina, CABG has historically been preferred over PCI for patients with left main or left main equivalent disease (although the data supporting this practice are changing) and for those with left ventricular dysfunction or diabetes. CABG must also be considered when PCI is unsuccessful, cannot be used (eg, in lesions that are long or near bifurcation points), or causes acute coronary artery dissection. Fibrinolytics are not indicated for unstable angina or NSTEMI. Risk outweighs potential benefit. CLINICAL CALCULATORS Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Score for Unstable Angina Non
