Overview A ventricular septal defect (or VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum (the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart). The ventricular septum consists of a muscular (inferior) and membranous portion (superior). The membranous portion (which is close to the atrioventricular node) is most commonly affected.[1] Congential VSDs are collectively the most common congenital heart defect. The incidence of VSD in adulthood has decreased over past decades due to successful surgical closure of large defects.[2] Epidemiology and Demographics The ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac malformation with an incidence of 300 to 350 per 100,000 live births,[3] corresponding to 30% of all newborns with a congenital heart defect. There is no predilection based on sex. Incidence rates are similar in different races and seasons and are unrelated to maternal age, birth order, sex, and socioeconomic status.
