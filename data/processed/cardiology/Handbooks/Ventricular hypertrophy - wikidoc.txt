Overview
Although ventricular hypertrophy may occur in either the left or right or both ventricles of the
heart, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more commonly encountered.
Physiology
The ventricles are the chambers in the heart responsible for pumping blood either to the lungs
(right ventricle) or the rest of the body (left ventricle). Increased ventricular mass is an adaptation
by the ventricle(s) of the heart to increased stress, such as chronically increased volume load
(preload) or increased pressure load (afterload).
It is a physiological response that enables the heart to adapt to increased stress; however, the
response can become pathological and ultimately lead to a deterioration in function. For example,
hypertrophy is a normal physiological adaptation to exercise that enables the ventricle to enhance
its pumping capacity. Aerobic training results in the heart being able to pump a larger volume of
blood through an increase in the size of the ventricles. Anaerobic training results in the thickening
of the myocardial wall to push blood through arteries compressed by muscular contraction. This
type of physiologic hypertrophy is reversible and non-pathological, increasing the heart's ability to
circulate blood. Chronic hypertension causes pathological ventricular hypertrophy. This response
enables the heart to maintain a normal stroke volume despite the increase in afterload. However,
over time, pathological changes occur in the heart that lead to a functional degradation and heart
failure.
If the precipitating stress is volume overload (as through aerobic exercise, which increases blood
return to the heart through the action of the skeletal-muscle pump), the ventricle responds by
adding new sarcomeres in-series with existing sarcomeres (i.e. the sarcomeres lengthen rather
than thicken). This results in ventricular dilation while maintaining normal sarcomere lengths -

the heart can expand to receive a greater volume of blood. The wall thickness normally increases in
proportion to the increase in chamber radius. This type of hypertrophy is termed eccentric
hypertrophy.
In the case of chronic pressure overload (as through anaerobic exercise, which increases resistance
to blood flow by compressing arteries), the chamber radius may not change; however, the wall
thickness greatly increases as new sarcomeres are added in-parallel to existing sarcomeres. This is
termed concentric hypertrophy. This type of ventricle is capable of generating greater forces and
higher pressures, while the increased wall thickness maintains normal wall stress. This type of
ventricle becomes "stiff" (i.e., compliance is reduced) which can impair filling and lead to diastolic
dysfunction.
