Ventricular hypertrophy

the heart can expand to receive a greater volume of blood. The wall thickness normally increases in
proportion to the increase in chamber radius. This type of hypertrophy is termed eccentric
hypertrophy.
In the case of chronic pressure overload (as through anaerobic exercise, which increases resistance
to blood flow by compressing arteries), the chamber radius may not change; however, the wall
thickness greatly increases as new sarcomeres are added in-parallel to existing sarcomeres. This is
termed concentric hypertrophy. This type of ventricle is capable of generating greater forces and
higher pressures, while the increased wall thickness maintains normal wall stress. This type of
ventricle becomes "stiff" (i.e., compliance is reduced) which can impair filling and lead to diastolic
dysfunction.
