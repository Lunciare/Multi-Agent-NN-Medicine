compresses and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Sometimes anticoagulation Treatment of superficial venous thrombosis traditionally involves warm compresses and NSAIDs. In patients with extensive superficial venous thrombosis, anticoagulation (eg, with low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux) is often beneficial (1). The optimal regimen and duration are unknown, but most experts recommend treating for about 1 month using either a low molecular weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once a day) or fondaparinux (2.5 mg subcutaneously once a day).
