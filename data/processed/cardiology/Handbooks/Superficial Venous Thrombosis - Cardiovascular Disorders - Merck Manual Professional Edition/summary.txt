Superficial venous thrombosis is a blood clot in a superficial vein of the upper or lower extremities or, less commonly, in one or more veins of the chest or breast (Mondor disease). Superficial venous thrombosis in the upper extremity most commonly results from IV infusions or catheterization. Varicose veins seem to be the main risk factor for superficial venous thrombosis in the lower extremity, especially among women. Superficial venous thrombi rarely cause serious complications and rarely become emboli. Typically, patients present with pain, tenderness, or an indurated cord along a palpable superficial vein. The overlying skin is usually warm and erythematous.
