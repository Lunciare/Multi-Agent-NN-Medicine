Gain of function of outward potassium current channels OR Loss of function of inward sodium or calcium current channels These ion channel changes magnify the normal small transmural voltage gradients during the plateau phase of the action potential. These gradients produce a J-wave and J-point elevation on the ECG and predispose to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation in the absence of other causes of early repolarization (eg, hyperthermia or hypothermia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia). The ECG changes are similar to those of the Brugada syndrome but appear in the inferior or lateral leads in the early repolarization syndrome rather than in the right precordial leads of the Brugada syndrome. This and other similarities has led to Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome being grouped as J-wave syndromes (4). Prior to the VT/VF, the early repolarization pattern may become more exaggerated and the VT/VF may be precipitated by an episode of myocardial ischemia. - Early repolarization syndrome appears to be inheritable, but disease-specific gene mutations are rarely identified, suggesting that the disorder is often polygenic. The ventricular arrhythmias may cause palpitations and/or cardiac arrest. Syncope may occur but is uncommon because VT that occurs with early repolarization syndrome rarely
