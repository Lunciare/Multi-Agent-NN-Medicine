Early repolarization syndrome is a genetic disorder of cardiomyocyte ion channel function (channelopathy). Patients are predisposed to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Diagnosis is by ECG. Some patients require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Early repolarization refers to ECG findings typically including J-point elevation ≥ 0.1 mV, often with a slurred or notched terminal QRS complex, followed by ST-segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous leads other than V1 to V3. This ECG pattern is not uncommon, as it occurs in about 5% to 10% of the population (1, 2, 3), especially in males, younger patients, and athletes.
