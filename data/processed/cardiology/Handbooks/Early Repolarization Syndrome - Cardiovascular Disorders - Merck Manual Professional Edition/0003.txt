Early Repolarization Syndrome

that the disorder is often polygenic. The ventricular arrhythmias may cause palpitations and/or cardiac arrest. Syncope may occur but is uncommon because VT that occurs with early repolarization syndrome rarely self-terminates (unlike with some other disorders that cause VT in which syncope is more common). Diagnosis of Early Repolarization Syndrome Characteristic clinical and ECG manifestations Clinical screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis should be considered in patients who have had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden cardiac arrest (or a family history of those events) in the absence of structural heart disease and who also have ECG changes showing an inferior and/or lateral early repolarization pattern. The typical ECG finding of early repolarization is J-point elevation of ≥ 1 mm (≥ 0.1 mV) followed by ST segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous inferior and/or lateral leads. A probabilistic diagnosis scoring system (the Shanghai Early Repolarization Syndrome Score System) for the early repolarization syndrome has been proposed (1). Because specific gene defects are seldom identified, genetic testing is not typically recommended for patients or family members. However, first-degree family members should be evaluated clinically and with an ECG. Treatment of Early Repolarization Syndrome Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if symptomatic For patients
