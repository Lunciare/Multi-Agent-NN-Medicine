Early repolarization syndrome is a genetic disorder of cardiomyocyte ion channel function (channelopathy). Patients are predisposed to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Diagnosis is by ECG. Some patients require an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Early repolarization refers to ECG findings typically including J-point elevation ≥ 0.1 mV, often with a slurred or notched terminal QRS complex, followed by ST-segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous leads other than V1 to V3. This ECG pattern is not uncommon, as it occurs in about 5% to 10% of the population (1, 2, 3), especially in males, younger patients, and athletes. Most people with this early repolarization ECG pattern do not manifest arrhythmias. However, early repolarization is substantially more common in survivors of apparently idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) (1, 2, 3). Early repolarization syndrome refers to people with early repolarization in inferior or lateral leads (predicting higher risk of arrhythmias) on ECG who also have had symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias (4). Early repolarization syndrome appears to result from mutations that produce a Gain of function of outward potassium current channels OR Loss of function of inward sodium or calcium current channels These ion channel changes magnify the normal small transmural voltage gradients
