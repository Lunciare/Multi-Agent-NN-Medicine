Recurrences of mild cardiac inflammation (indicated by fever or chest pain) may subside spontaneously; aspirin or corticosteroids should be resumed if recurrent symptoms last longer than a few days or if heart failure is uncontrolled by standard management (eg, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, inotropic agents). Antibiotic prophylaxis Antistreptococcal prophylaxis should be maintained continuously after the initial episode of ARF to prevent recurrences. Antibiotics taken orally are slightly less effective as those given by injection. 11/14 However, with the oral route, painful injections are avoided, and clinic visits and observation for postinjection reactions are not needed. The optimal duration of antistreptococcal prophylaxis is uncertain. Children without carditis should receive prophylaxis for 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer). The American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend that patients with carditis without evidence of residual heart damage receive prophylaxis for 10 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer) (1). Children with carditis and evidence of residual heart damage should receive prophylaxis for > 10 years; many experts recommend that such patients continue prophylaxis indefinitely or, alternatively, until age 40. Prophylaxis should be life long in all patients with severe valvular disease who
