following an initial episode of ARF depends mostly on how severely the heart is affected, and whether there is a recurrent episode of ARF. Murmurs eventually disappear in about half of patients whose acute episodes were manifested by mild carditis without major cardiac enlargement or decompensation. However, many others develop chronic valvular disease, including some who recovered from the acute episode without evidence of valvular disease. Episodes of Sydenham chorea usually last several months and resolve completely in most patients, but about one third of patients have recurrences. Joint inflammation may take 1 month to subside if not treated but does not lead to residual damage. 12/14 In patients with chronic valvular disease, symptoms develop and progress slowly, typically over several decades. However, once significant symptoms develop, intervention is usually necessary. In resource- poor countries, chronic rheumatic heart disease is the cause of 25 to 45% of all cardiovascular disease. Key Points Rheumatic fever is a nonsuppurative, acute, inflammatory complication of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngeal infection occurring most often initially between ages 5 years and 15 years. Symptoms and signs may include migratory polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and chorea. Chronic rheumatic heart disease, particularly involving the mitral
