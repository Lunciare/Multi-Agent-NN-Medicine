usually subsides without permanent damage. Characteristic and potentially dangerous valve changes may occur. Acute interstitial valvulitis may cause valvular edema. In chronic rheumatic heart disease, valve thickening, fusion, and retraction or other destruction of leaflets and cusps may occur, leading to stenosis or insufficiency. Similarly, chordae tendineae can shorten, thicken, or fuse, worsening regurgitation of damaged valves or causing regurgitation of an otherwise unaffected valve. Dilation of valve rings may also cause regurgitation. Rheumatic valvular disease most commonly involves the mitral and aortic valves. The tricuspid and pulmonic valves are seldom if ever affected in isolation. In acute rheumatic fever, the most common cardiac manifestations are Mitral regurgitation Pericarditis Sometimes aortic regurgitation In chronic rheumatic heart disease, the most common cardiac manifestations are Mitral stenosis Aortic regurgitation (often with some degree of stenosis) Perhaps tricuspid regurgitation (often along with mitral stenosis) Skin Subcutaneous nodules appear indistinguishable from those of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), but biopsy shows features resembling Aschoff bodies. Erythema marginatum differs histologically from other skin lesions with similar macroscopic appearance, eg, the rash of systemic JIA, immunoglobulin A–associated vasculitis (formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura), erythema chronicum migrans, and erythema multiforme. Perivascular neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrates of the dermis occur.
