million patients with rheumatic heart disease, resulting in about 300,000 deaths annually. Pearls & Pitfalls Patients who have had rheumatic fever have about a 50% likelihood of having a recurrence if they have another episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis that is untreated. Pathophysiology of Rheumatic Fever Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is the etiologic precursor of ARF, but host and environmental factors are important. GAS M proteins share epitopes (antigenic-determinant sites that are recognized by antibodies) with proteins found in synovium, heart muscle, and heart valve, suggesting that molecular mimicry by GAS antigens from rheumatogenic strains contributes to the arthritis, carditis, and valvular damage. Genetic host risk factors include the D8/17 B-cell antigen and certain class II histocompatibility antigens. Undernutrition, overcrowding, and lower socioeconomic status predispose to streptococcal infections and subsequent episodes of rheumatic fever. Remarkably, although GAS infections of both the pharynx and of skin and soft-tissue structures, bones or joints, lungs, and bloodstream may cause poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, nonpharyngitis GAS infections do not lead to ARF. The reason for this distinct difference in complications resulting from infection by the same organism is not well understood. The joints, heart, skin, and central nervous system (CNS) are most often affected.
