Rheumatic Fever

cm in at least 1 view, a peak velocity of > 3 m/second, and a pansystolic jet in at least 1 envelope Pathologic aortic regurgitation: Must be seen in at least 2 views, and have a jet length ≥ 1 cm in at least 1 view, a peak velocity of > 3 m/second, and a pandiastolic jet in at least 1 envelope Echocardiographic morphologic criteria: Pathologic mitral valve morphologic changes include annular dilation, chordal elongation or rupture with flail leaflet, anterior (or less commonly posterior) leaflet tip prolapse, or beading/nodularity of leaflet tips. Pathologic aortic valve morphologic changes include irregular or focal leaflet thickening, coaptation defect, restricted leaflet motion, or leaflet prolapse. Chest x-rays are not routinely done but can detect cardiomegaly, a common manifestation of carditis in ARF. Biopsy of a subcutaneous nodule can aid in early diagnosis, especially when other major clinical manifestations are absent. ESR and serum CRP are sensitive but not specific. The ESR is typically > 60 mm/hour. CRP is typically > 3 mg/dL (> 30 mg/L) and often > 7 mg/dL (> 70 mg/L); because it rises and falls faster than ESR, a normal CRP may confirm that inflammation is resolving in a patient
