Rheumatic Fever

> 10 years; many experts recommend that such patients continue prophylaxis indefinitely or, alternatively, until age 40. Prophylaxis should be life long in all patients with severe valvular disease who have close contact with young children because young children have a high rate of GAS carriage. The standard regimen for prophylaxis against recurrent GAS infection is penicillin G benzathine IM every 3 to 4 weeks. In parts of the world with high ARF endemicity, IM prophylaxis every 3 weeks is superior to every 4 weeks. Alternatives (eg, for patients unwilling to receive injections) are penicillin V or sulfadiazine or sulfisoxazole orally every day. For patients who are proved to be allergic to penicillin and sulfa, alternatives are erythromycin or azithromycin orally every day. The American Heart Association no longer recommends that patients with known or suspected rheumatic valvular disease take short-term antibiotic prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis for dental or oral surgical procedures unless they have an indwelling prosthetic valve (see Prevention of Infective Endocarditis) (1). Prognosis for Rheumatic Fever Prognosis following an initial episode of ARF depends mostly on how severely the heart is affected, and whether there is a recurrent episode of ARF.
