signs of the carditis common in ARF. Compared with the arthritis of ARF, poststreptococcal reactive arthritis typically involves only 1 or 2 joints, is less migratory but may be more protracted, and does not respond as well or as quickly to aspirin. Other, nonrheumatic disorders causing similar symptoms (eg, Lyme arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis) should be excluded. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis can be treated with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. 13/14 Although clinical practice for secondary prevention of cardiac involvement varies greatly, it is reasonable to give antistreptococcal prophylaxis for several months to 1 year if ARF cannot be excluded, and then to reevaluate the patient. If cardiac lesions are detected by echocardiography, long-term prophylaxis is indicated.
