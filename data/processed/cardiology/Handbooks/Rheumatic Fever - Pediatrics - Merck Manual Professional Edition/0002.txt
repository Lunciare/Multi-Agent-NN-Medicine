Rheumatic Fever

patients with untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis who develop ARF) varies from < 1.0 to 3.0%. Higher attack rates occur with certain streptococcal M protein serotypes and a stronger host immune response (likely resulting from as-yet-uncharacterized genetic tendencies). In patients with a prior episode of ARF, the rate of recurrence of ARF in untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis approaches 50%, underscoring the importance of long-term antistreptococcal prophylaxis. Incidence has declined in most resource-rich countries but remains high in resource-poor parts of the world, especially parts with aboriginal or native populations, such as Alaskan Native, Canadian Inuit, Native American, Australian Aboriginal, and Maori New Zealander, where incidence is as high as 50 to 250/100,000. However, the continued occurrence in the United States of local outbreaks of ARF suggest that more rheumatogenic strains of streptococci are still present in the United States. The prevalence of chronic rheumatic heart disease is uncertain because criteria are not standardized and autopsy is not done routinely, but it is estimated that worldwide there are ≥ 39 million patients with rheumatic heart disease, resulting in about 300,000 deaths annually. Pearls & Pitfalls Patients who have had rheumatic fever have about a 50% likelihood of having a recurrence
