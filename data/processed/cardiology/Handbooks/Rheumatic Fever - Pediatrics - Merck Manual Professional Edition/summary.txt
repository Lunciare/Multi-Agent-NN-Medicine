Rheumatic fever is a nonsuppurative, acute inflammatory complication of group A streptococcal pharyngeal infection, causing combinations of arthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and chorea. Diagnosis is based on applying the modified Jones criteria to information gleaned from history, examination, and laboratory testing. Treatment includes aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids during severe carditis, and antimicrobials to eradicate residual streptococcal infection and prevent reinfection. A first episode of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) can occur at any age but occurs most often between 5 years and 15 years of age, which are the peak years of age for streptococcal pharyngitis. ARF is uncommon before 3 years and after 21 years. However, preceding symptomatic pharyngitis is recognized in only about two thirds of patients with ARF.
