Perivascular neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrates of the dermis occur. CNS Sydenham chorea, the form of chorea that occurs with ARF, manifests in the CNS as hyperperfusion and increased metabolism in the basal ganglia. Increased levels of antineuronal antibodies have also been shown. Symptoms and Signs of Rheumatic Fever An initial episode of symptoms of rheumatic fever occurs typically about 2 to 3 weeks after the streptococcal infection. Manifestations typically involve some combination of the joints, heart, skin, and CNS (1). Joints Migratory polyarthritis is the most common manifestation of ARF, occurring in about 35 to 66% of children; it is often accompanied by fever.

Occasionally monarthritis occurs in high-risk indigenous populations (eg, in Australia, India, and Fiji) but very rarely in the United States.
