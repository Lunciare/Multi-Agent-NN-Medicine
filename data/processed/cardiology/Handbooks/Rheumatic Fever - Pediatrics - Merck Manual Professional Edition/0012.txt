initial diagnosis) Testing for group A streptococcal (GAS) infection (culture, rapid strep test, or antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B titers) ECG Echocardiography with Doppler Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level Diagnosis of a first episode of ARF is based on the modified Jones criteria (1) (see table Modified Jones Criteria for a First Episode of Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)*); 2 major criteria or 1 major criterion and 2 minor criteria are required, each along with evidence of preceding GAS infection. Sydenham chorea alone (ie, without minor criteria) fulfills diagnostic criteria if other causes of movement disorder are ruled out. The modified Jones criteria were designed for the evaluation of ARF rather than for a possible recurrence. However, if patients have a reliable past history of ARF or rheumatic heart disease and also have documented GAS infection, the criteria may be used to establish the presence of a recurrence. A preceding GAS infection is suggested by a recent history of pharyngitis and is confirmed by 1 or more of the following: Positive throat culture Increased or preferably rising antistreptolysin O titer Positive rapid GAS antigen test in a child with clinical manifestations suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis Recent scarlet
