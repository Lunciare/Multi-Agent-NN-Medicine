Rheumatic Fever

initially between ages 5 years and 15 years. Symptoms and signs may include migratory polyarthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and chorea. Chronic rheumatic heart disease, particularly involving the mitral and/or aortic valves, may progress over decades and is a major cause of heart disease in resource-poor parts of the world. Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) requires 2 major or 1 major and 2 minor manifestations (modified Jones criteria for a first episode of ARF) and evidence of GAS infection. Give antibiotics to eliminate GAS infection, aspirin to control fever and pain caused by arthritis and mild carditis, and corticosteroids for patients with moderate to severe carditis. Give prophylactic antistreptococcal antibiotics after the initial episode of ARF to prevent recurrences. Poststreptococcal Reactive Arthritis Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis is development of arthritis after group A streptococcal infection in patients who do not meet the criteria for acute rheumatic fever. Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis may or may not represent an attenuated variant of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Patients do not have symptoms or signs of the carditis common in ARF. Compared with the arthritis of ARF, poststreptococcal reactive arthritis typically involves only 1 or 2 joints, is less migratory but may be more
