the physical examination. Trendelenburg test (comparing venous filling before and after release of a thigh tourniquet) is no longer commonly used to identify retrograde blood flow past incompetent saphenous valves. Duplex ultrasonography is an accurate test, but it is not clear whether it is routinely necessary. Treatment of Varicose Veins Compression stockings Sometimes minimally invasive therapy (eg, sclerotherapy, thermal ablation) or surgery Treatment aims to relieve symptoms, improve the leg’s appearance, and, in some cases, prevent complications of varicose veins. Treatment includes compression stockings and local wound care as needed. Minimally invasive therapy (eg, sclerotherapy) and surgery are indicated for prevention of recurrent variceal thrombosis and for skin changes; these procedures are also commonly used for cosmetic reasons. Sclerotherapy uses an irritant (eg, sodium tetradecyl sulfate) to induce a thrombophlebitic reaction that fibroses and occludes the vein; however, many varicose veins recannulate. Surgery involves ligation or stripping of the long and sometimes the short saphenous veins. These procedures provide good short-term symptom relief, but long-term efficacy is poor (ie, patients often develop recurrent varicose veins). Thermal ablation with the use of laser or radiofrequency ablation is another minimally invasive tool for the treatment of varicose veins. Regardless of treatment, new
