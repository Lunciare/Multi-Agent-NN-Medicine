Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

shows a rapid (120 to 250 beats/minute), regular, tachycardia. The QRS complex is usually narrow but may be wide (≥ 0.12 seconds) with coexistent bundle branch block. If found, the P-wave is in the first half of the RR interval (a short RP tachycardia), often in the ST segment or early T-wave, and is negative in the inferior leads (II, III, AVF) (see figure Narrow QRS Tachycardia: Orthodromic Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia Using an Accessory AV Connection in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome). During antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, the ECG shows a rapid (120 to 250 beats/minute), regular tachycardia. The QRS complex is wide (≥ 0.12 seconds) due to total ventricular preexcitation. When the accessory AV connection functions as a bystander conducting a supraventricular arrhythmia, the QRS complexes may show total ventricular preexcitation, intermittent total preexcitation mingled with normally conducted narrow QRS complexes, and/or variable degrees of fusion QRS complexes between the QRS complexes of total ventricular preexcitation and those of normal conduction. Conduction of atrial fibrillation via the accessory AV connection in WPW syndrome can be very dangerous if antegrade conduction is very fast. Clues to the presence of pre-excited atrial fibrillation include a very rapid, dominantly wide QRS complex arrhythmia with the
