syndrome can be very dangerous if antegrade conduction is very fast. Clues to the presence of pre-excited atrial fibrillation include a very rapid, dominantly wide QRS complex arrhythmia with the occasional occurrence of a narrow QRS complex that is not the result of a long proceeding RR interval. The QRS complex morphology may vary, but all QRS complexes are a fusion of that of the widest QRS complex and that of a normal narrow QRS complex. In pre-excited atrial fibrillation, the normal rate-limiting effects of the AV node are bypassed, and the resultant excessive ventricular rates (sometimes 200 to 300 beats/minutes) may lead to ventricular fibrillation (2). Risk factors for ventricular fibrillation in WPW syndrome include younger age, exercise, prior tachyarrhythmias, multiple accessory AV connections, presence of negative dromotropic medications (especially digitalis),and minimum RR interval during pre-excited atrial fibrillation ≤ 0.25 seconds (2). The estimated risk of developing atrial fibrillation in patients with WPW syndrome is 1.5%/year and that of sudden death is 0.1%/year (3). Treatment of WPW Syndrome Acute: treatment of the presenting arrhythmia Long-term: chronic antiarrhythmic therapy for arrhythmia prevention or ablation of the accessory AV connection Acute When a patient with WPW syndrome presents with a rapid,
