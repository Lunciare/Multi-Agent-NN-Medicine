Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

Less commonly, and more often induced by a ventricular premature beat, the reentry occurs in the opposite direction (antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia). Since 5% of patients with an accessory AV connection have multiple accessory AV connections (4), it is also possible to have a dual accessory AV connection atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia that uses one accessory AV connection for antegrade conduction and another accessory AV connection for retrograde conduction. The accessory atrioventricular connection in WPW syndrome behaves like atrial myocardium, a fast channel tissue, the refractory period of which shortens with increasing rates. Accordingly, should a rapid supraventricular rhythm occur, the ventricular response may not be controlled by the usual increased refractoriness of the AV node as the accessory AV connection may be able to conduct at very rapid rates. This is particularly relevant to the ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation which may be sufficiently rapid as to produce hemodynamic compromise and may induce ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Sudden death may be the first clinical manifestation of WPW syndrome, particularly in adolescence. In some patients with an accessory AV connection that conducts in the retrograde direction (and can, therefore, participate in orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia) the accessory AV connection
