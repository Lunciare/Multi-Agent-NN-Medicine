of these medications. Alternatively, synchronized DC cardioversion is performed. When a patient with WPW syndrome presents with a rapid, regular, wide QRS complex tachycardia the possibilities include orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia with bundle branch block, antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, dual accessory connection atrioventricular tachycardia, accessory AV connection of another supraventricular arrhythmia (atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia), or ventricular tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is used if hemodynamic instability is present. If stable and vagal maneuvers are unsuccessful, therapy with IV procainamide, IV amiodarone, or synchronized cardioversion is recommended (1). When a patient with classic (manifest) WPW syndrome presents with atrial fibrillation, at least some of the QRS complexes are expected to show ventricular pre-excitation. When most or all of the QRS complexes show ventricular pre-excitation, the ventricular response rate may be very fast. If hemodynamically unstable, synchronized DC cardioversion is used. If hemodynamically stable, IV ibutilide, IV procainamide, or synchronized DC cardioversion is recommended (1). Long-term Long-term therapy of patients who have had a documented WPW syndrome-related tachyarrhythmia (or symptoms highly suggestive thereof) is with catheter ablation of the accessory AV connection(s) (1). A meta-analysis of ablation in WPW syndrome reports a success rate of 94%, a recurrence
