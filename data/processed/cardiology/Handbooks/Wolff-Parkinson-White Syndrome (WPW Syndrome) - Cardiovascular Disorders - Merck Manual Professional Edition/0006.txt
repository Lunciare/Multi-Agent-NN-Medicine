Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

seconds or persist for several hours (rarely, > 12 hours). Syncope is uncommon but may occur. Infants present with episodic breathlessness, lethargy, feeding problems, or rapid precordial pulsations. If the episode of tachycardia is protracted, infants may present with heart failure. Patients with WPW syndrome may also experience rapidly conducted supraventricular arrhythmias such as 1:1 conduction of atrial flutter or rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation wherein symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, including syncope are more common. Rapidly conducted atrial fibrillation may also induce ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. This risk is low (approximately 1%) but is more likely to occur in adolescence. Between episodes of arrhythmia, examination is normal. Diagnosis of WPW Syndrome Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of WPW syndrome is by ECG showing a short PR interval (< 0.12 seconds), a wide QRS complex (≥ 0.12 seconds) with an initial slurred component (the delta wave), and secondary ST and T wave changes (see figure Classic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Pattern) (1). During the most common arrhythmia in WPW syndrome, orthodromic atrioventricular tachycardia, the ECG shows a rapid (120 to 250 beats/minute), regular, tachycardia. The QRS complex is usually narrow but may be wide (≥ 0.12 seconds) with coexistent bundle branch block. If found, the
