medications are ineffective or there is hemodynamic instability. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias and Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia.) Pathophysiology of WPW Syndrome An accessory pathway connecting an atrium and a ventricle is the substrate for the Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome. When the accessory AV connection conducts in the antegrade direction, the AV nodal delay is bypassed and a portion of ventricular myocardium is activated before the rest is activated by the normal conduction system. This ventricular pre-excitation produces a short PR interval (< 0.12 seconds), a wide QRS complex (≥ 0.12 seconds) with an initial slurred component (the delta wave) which, along with symptoms of paroxysmal tachycardia, define the classic (manifest) Wolff-Parkinson-White 1/7 syndrome (1). Classic (manifest) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome occurs in about 1 to 3/1000 people ([2] sampled in Canadian men). Depending on the orientation of the delta wave, a pseudoinfarction pattern Q-wave may be present. Because the early depolarized parts of the ventricle also repolarize early, the T-wave vector may be abnormal. If the accessory AV connection can conduct in the retrograde direction, it can support a form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia called orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. The accessory AV connection tends to have a longer refractory period at baseline heart
