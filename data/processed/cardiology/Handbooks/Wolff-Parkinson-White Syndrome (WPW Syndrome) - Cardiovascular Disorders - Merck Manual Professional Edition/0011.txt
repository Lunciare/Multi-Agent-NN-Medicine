Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

(or symptoms highly suggestive thereof) is with catheter ablation of the accessory AV connection(s) (1). A meta-analysis of ablation in WPW syndrome reports a success rate of 94%, a recurrence rate of 6% (usually treated by re-ablation), and a procedure-related complication rate of 1% (2). If ablation cannot be performed or if the patient declines ablation, medical therapy may be accomplished with almost any oral antiarrhythmic medication other than digoxin. Class IIa recommendations are given for oral flecainide or oral propafenone in the absence of a structural heart disorder (1). Class IIb recommendations are given for oral dofetilide, oral sotalol, and oral amiodarone (1). Although a class IIb recommendation is given for oral beta blockers (especially useful if symptoms occur with exercise), oral diltiazem, or oral verapamil, there is a small possibility that these mediations could be harmful should atrial fibrillation ever occur. Key Points Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is characterized by a short PR interval, a wide QRS complex with an initial slurred component (delta wave), and secondary repolarization changes in association with symptomatic reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia. Episodes of reentrant supraventricular tachycardia underlie symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, and sometimes syncope. In patients with WPW syndrome who develop atrial
