Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)
KEYWORDS: tachycardia, accessory, syndrome, wpw, qrs, wpw syndrome, reentrant, connection, ventricular, accessory connection, atrioventricular, atrial, fibrillation, rapid, qrs complex

Classic (manifest) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is due to an accessory atrioventricular connection that produces a prototypical ECG consisting of a short PR interval, a wide QRS complex with an initial slurred component (delta wave), and secondary repolarization changes in association with symptomatic reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia. Reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycarida produces sudden episodes of palpitations that begin and terminate abruptly; some patients have dyspnea or chest discomfort. The accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection can facilitate very rapid ventricular response rates to any fast supraventricular arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation in which ultrafast ventricular response rates may initiate ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Diagnosis is clinical and by electrocardiography. Initial treatment of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia is usually with vagotonic maneuvers. If these maneuvers are ineffective, treatment is with IV adenosine or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for regular narrow QRS rhythms or for regular wide QRS rhythms known to be a reentrant SVT with aberrant conduction.
