Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)
KEYWORDS: tachycardia, accessory, syndrome, wpw, qrs, wpw syndrome, reentrant, connection, ventricular, accessory connection, atrioventricular, atrial, fibrillation, rapid, qrs complex

in association with symptomatic reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia. Episodes of reentrant supraventricular tachycardia underlie symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, and sometimes syncope. In patients with WPW syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation, excessively rapid ventricular response rates can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Acute treatment of WPW-related tachycardia in unstable patients is with synchronized DC cardioversion; treatment of stable patients with regular, narrow QRS complex tachycardia is IV adenosine or alternatively parenteral antiarrhythmics. Long-term treatment is with catheter ablation of the accessory pathway; oral antiarrhythmics can be used if ablation cannot be performed.
