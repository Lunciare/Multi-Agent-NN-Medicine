Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

retrograde direction, it can support a form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia called orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. The accessory AV connection tends to have a longer refractory period at baseline heart rates than the AV node. At a premature atrial depolarization coupling interval less than the refractory period of the accessory AV pathway, but longer than the refractory period of the AV node, antegrade accessory AV pathway transmission is blocked but antegrade AV nodal conduction proceeds. The ECG shows a sudden increase in the PR interval and loss of the delta wave. When antegrade conduction through the AV node is sufficiently slow, it can find the distal accessory AV connection ready to conduct, but now in the retrograde (ventricle to atrium) direction. When this retrograde accessory AC connection transmission finds the atria and, subsequently, the AV node ready to conduct again in the antegrade direction, around-and-around atrioventricular reentry occurs. The ECG then shows a rapid, regular, tachycardia. This orthodromic atrioventricular tachycardia is the usual (95%) type of AV reentrant tachycardia (3). Less commonly, and more often induced by a ventricular premature beat, the reentry occurs in the opposite direction (antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia). Since 5% of patients with an accessory AV
