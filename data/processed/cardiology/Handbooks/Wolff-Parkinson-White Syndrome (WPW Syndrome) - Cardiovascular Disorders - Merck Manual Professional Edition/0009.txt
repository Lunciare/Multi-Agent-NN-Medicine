Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

treatment of the presenting arrhythmia Long-term: chronic antiarrhythmic therapy for arrhythmia prevention or ablation of the accessory AV connection Acute When a patient with WPW syndrome presents with a rapid, regular, narrow QRS complex tachycardia, the mechanism of the tachycardia is almost always orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and may be treated as any other regular, narrow QRS complex tachycardia (see Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) ). Vagal maneuvers are attempted first. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or unresponsive to other medical therapies, synchronized DC cardioversion is used. For hemodynamically stable patients, IV adenosine is preferred. If unresponsive to IV adenosine, United States guidelines recommend a class IIb such as an IV beta blocker, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (1). This class IIb recommendation in patients with known WPW syndrome (rather than the class IIa recommendation in the setting of other causes of PSVT) recognizes the rare possibility that the PSVT will terminate to pre-excited atrial fibrillation with a more rapid ventricular response rate because of the presence of one of these medications. Alternatively, synchronized DC cardioversion is performed. When a patient with WPW syndrome presents with a rapid, regular, wide QRS complex tachycardia the possibilities include orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant
