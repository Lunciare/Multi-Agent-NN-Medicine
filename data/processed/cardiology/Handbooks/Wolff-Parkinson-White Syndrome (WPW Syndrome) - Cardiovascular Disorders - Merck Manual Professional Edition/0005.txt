Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW Syndrome)

particularly in adolescence. In some patients with an accessory AV connection that conducts in the retrograde direction (and can, therefore, participate in orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia) the accessory AV connection does not conduct in the antegrade direction. Such patients do not have the WPW pattern on their ECG and are said to have concealed WPW syndrome. They are not at risk of rapidly conducted supraventricular arrhythmias. WPW syndrome is mainly idiopathic, although it is more common among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, transposition of the great vessels, or Epstein's anomaly. Classic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Pattern Leads I, II, III, V through V show classic features of WPW syndrome, with a short PR interval 3 6 and a delta wave during sinus rhythm. Symptoms and Signs of WPW Syndrome Most patients present with symptoms of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia during young adulthood or middle age. They typically have episodes of sudden-onset, sudden-offset, rapid, regular palpitations often associated with symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort, light- headedness). Attacks may last only a few seconds or persist for several hours (rarely, > 12 hours). Syncope is uncommon but may occur. Infants present with episodic breathlessness, lethargy, feeding problems, or rapid precordial pulsations. If the
