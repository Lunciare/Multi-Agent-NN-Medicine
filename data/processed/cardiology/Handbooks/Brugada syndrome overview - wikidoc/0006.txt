syndrome is not associated with any structural heart disease, there are generally no abnormalities on physical examination. Vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage may increase vagal tone and may unmask the presence of a Type I Brugada pattern. In a patient who has experienced recent symptoms such as syncope, it is important to check the temperature in so far as fever may trigger a self terminating or sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation. The presence of fever is also a target of antipyretic therapy. Laboratory Findings Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia can both trigger either sustained or nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation and serum electrolytes should therefore be checked. Both alcohol and cocaine intoxication can be associated with either sustained or nonsustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and a toxicology screen should be ordered if there is a clinical suspicion. Likewise, tricyclic antidepressants can be associated with exacerbations of the syndrome, and levels of these agents should also be checked if there is a clinical suspicion. Electrocardiogram There are three electrocardiographic patterns associated with Brugada syndrome: Type I, Type II and Type III. The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based upon the presence of Type I
