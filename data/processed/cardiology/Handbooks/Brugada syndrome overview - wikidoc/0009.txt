death are at high risk for recurrence and should undergo AICD implantation, and do not require an electrophysiologic study to assess inducibility. Patients with symptoms (either syncope, seizures or nocturnal agonal respirations) should undergo implantation of a defibrillator if no other cause of their symptoms can be identified. Asymptomatic patients should undergo electrophysiologic testing, and if VT / VF can be induced, they should undergo implantation of an ICD. Asymptomatic patients who cannot be induced should followed- up closely. Patients who are asymptomatic with no family history of Brugada syndrome can be followed-up closely. Drugs to Avoid There are certain drugs that should be avoided in patients with Brugada syndrome. These drugs include ajmaline, flecainide, pilsicainide, procainamide, and propafenone. These drugs are all sodium blocking antiarrhythmics which are either in the IA class or IC class. Drugs to Preferably Avoid Drugs which are not contraindicated in Brugada syndrome, but which should be avoided, are amiodarone, cibenzoline, disopyramide, lidocaine, propanolol, and verapamil. These agents are all antiarrhythmics. Topical lidocaine used for anesthesia is thought to be safe when used in persons with Brugada syndrome.
