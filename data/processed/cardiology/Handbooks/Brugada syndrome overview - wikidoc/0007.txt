Brugada syndrome overview

Electrocardiogram There are three electrocardiographic patterns associated with Brugada syndrome: Type I, Type II and Type III. The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based upon the presence of Type I EKG changes. Patients with Type II or Type III Brugada patterns can convert to a Type I Brugada pattern following the administration of sodium channel blockers such as ajmaline and flecainide. Type 1 Brugada syndrome may always be present on the EKG, or it may be elicited by the administration of particular drugs (e.g., Class IC antiarrythmic drugs that blocks sodium channels such as ajmaline, flecainide) or it may be unmasked by various triggers or risk factors. Chest X Ray Insofar as Brugada syndrome is not associated with structural abnormalities of the heart, there are no associated abnormalities on the chest x-ray. Echocardiography or Ultrasound There is ongoing controversy as to whether there are structural abnormalities among patients with Brugada syndrome. There was one small study of 11 patients with Brugada syndrome that demonstrated a rapid swinging motion shifting towards the right ventricle of the basal segment of the intraventricular septum and early systole in 73% (8/11) of patients with Brugada syndrome. None of the control patients demonstrated this abnormality.[2]
