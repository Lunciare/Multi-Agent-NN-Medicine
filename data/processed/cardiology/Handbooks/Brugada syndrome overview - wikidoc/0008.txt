Brugada syndrome overview

the right ventricle of the basal segment of the intraventricular septum and early systole in 73% (8/11) of patients with Brugada syndrome. None of the control patients demonstrated this abnormality.[2] Electrophysiologic Studies 3/4 Patients who are inducible at the time electrophysiologic study have an eightfold increased risk of aborted sudden cardiac death compared with those patients who are not inducible.[3] Some groups have advocated that programmed electrical stimulation (PES) be performed to induce ventricular fibrillation for risk assessment in Brugada patients [4][5] Other groups have not reproduced the predictive value of these tests,[6][7] so the value of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) and inducibility remains controversial. Genetic Testing Despite the association of the Brugada syndrome with the SCN5A genotype, there is unfortunately no association between the results of genetic testing and clinical prognosis. Genetic testing can be used to support the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome and to detect relatives at risk.[1] Treatment Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator is the only proven method of treatment in Brugada syndrome.Patients with aborted sudden cardiac death are at high risk for recurrence and should undergo AICD implantation, and do not require an electrophysiologic study to assess inducibility. Patients with symptoms (either syncope, seizures or nocturnal
