is a relatively newly recognized syndrome, its incidence and prevalence continues to increase. Brugada syndrome is quite common in Southeast Asia where it is endemic, and affects 500 out of every 100,000 individuals. It is the second leading cause of death after car accidents among young people in these countries. It has been estimated that Brugada syndrome accounts for 4% of all sudden cardiac deaths and 20% of sudden cardiac deaths among patients with structurally normal hearts. It is 8-10 times more common in men. Risk Factors The EKG changes of Brugada syndrome can vary over time, depending on the autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Adrenergic stimulation decreases the ST segment elevation, while vagal stimulation worsens it. During sleep, there is heightened vagal tone, and the pattern may be exacerbated at that time (as is the risk of sudden cardiac death at that time). The administration of class Ia, Ic and III drugs increases the ST segment elevation, as does fever. The impact of exercise depends upon when the EKG is obtained: during exercise the ST segment elevation may decrease but may increase later after exercise when the body temperature has risen. Similar to early repolarization variant,
