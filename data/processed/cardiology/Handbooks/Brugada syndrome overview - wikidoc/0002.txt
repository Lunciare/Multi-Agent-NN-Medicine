or Type III Brugada patterns can convert to a Type I Brugada pattern following the administration of sodium channel blockers such as ajmaline and flecainide. Pathophysiology Approximately 20% of persons with Brugada syndome have a mutation in the gene SCN5A. This gene encodes for the sodium ion channel. The mutation is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and is more commonly seen in males. Brugada syndrome has also been shown to result from defects in a calcium channel. Differentiating Brugada syndrome from other Diseases Brugada syndrome should be differentiated from other cardiac disorders, electrolyte disturbances, and drug intoxication syndromes. The condition which most similarly presents to Brugada syndrome is arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, as they both cause sudden cardiac death in children. Brugada syndrome can be differentiated from arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia by the genetic counterpart of SCN5A, the lack of structural abnormalities within the heart, the association with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia during sleep, and EKG changes that are enhanced by vagotonic agents. Epidemiology and Demographics Insofar as Brugada syndrome is a relatively newly recognized syndrome, its incidence and prevalence continues to increase. Brugada syndrome is quite common in Southeast Asia where it is endemic, and affects 500 out of
