Brugada syndrome overview

when the EKG is obtained: during exercise the ST segment elevation may decrease but may increase later after exercise when the body temperature has risen. Similar to early repolarization variant, when the heart rate decreases, the ST segment elevation increases and when the heart rate increases the ST segment elevation decreases. While Brugada syndrome is often associated with polymorphic VT which may be self terminating, in the presence of autonomic imbalance, hypokalemia, fever or exacerbating drugs sustained ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death may result.[1] Screening Relatives of patients with Brugada syndrome can be screened for the syndrome by obtaining an EKG, although the diagnostic pattern may be concealed. Genetic testing can also be used to support the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome and to detect relatives at risk.[1] Unfortunately, despite the association of the Brugada syndrome with the SCN5A genotype, there is unfortunately no association between the results of genetic testing and clinical prognosis. Natural History, Complications and Prognosis Brugada syndrome usually becomes apparent in adulthood, although it may present in infants and children as sudden cardiac death. The mean age of sudden death in patients with Brugada syndrome is 40 years old. The Brugada patient may develop atrial arrhythmias
