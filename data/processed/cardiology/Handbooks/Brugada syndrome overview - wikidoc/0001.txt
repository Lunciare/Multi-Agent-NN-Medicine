Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease that is characterized by abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in young adults, and occasionally in children and infants. Brugada syndrome is a condition that causes a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm. Specifically, this disorder can lead to uncoordinated electrical activity in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles), an abnormality called ventricular arrhythmia. If untreated, the irregular heartbeats can cause fainting (syncope), seizures, difficulty breathing, or sudden death. These complications typically occur when an affected person is resting or asleep. Historical Perspective Brugada syndorme was potentially first seen on EKG in survivors of cardiac arrest in 1989, but it was not until 1992 that the Brugada brothers recognized it as a distinct clinical entity which could cause sudden death by ventricular fibrillation. Classification There are three electrocardiographic patterns associated with Brugada syndrome: Type I, Type II and Type III. The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based upon the presence of Type I EKG changes. Patients with Type II or Type III Brugada patterns can convert to a Type I Brugada pattern following the administration of sodium channel blockers such as ajmaline and flecainide.
