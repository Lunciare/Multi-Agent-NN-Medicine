Arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia overview
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)
Overview
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD, also known as arrhythmogenic right
ventricular cardiomyopathy or ARVC) is a type of nonischemic cardiomyopathy that involves
primarily the right ventricle. It is characterized by hypokinetic areas involving the free wall of the
right ventricle, with fibrofatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, with associated
arrhythmias originating in the right ventricle.
ARVD is an important cause of ventricular arrhythmias in children and young adults. It is seen
predominantly in males, and 30-50% of cases have a familial distribution. It is usually inherited in
an autosomal dominant pattern, with variable expression. The penetrance is 20-35% in general,
but significantly higher in Italy. Seven gene loci have been implicated in ARVD. However, about
50% of families that express ARVD that undergo genetic screening do not show linkage with any of
the known chromosomal loci. It is unclear whether the pathogenesis varies with the different loci
involved. A standard genetic screening test is not available.
Naxos Disease
Naxos disease is an autosomal recessive variant of ARVD, described initially on the Greek island
of Naxos. There, the penetrance is >90%. It involves the gene that codes for plakoglobin (a protein
that is involved in cellular adhesion), on chromosome 17p. Naxos disease is described as a triad of
ARVD, palmoplantar keratosis, and wooly hair. The signs of Naxos disease are more severe than
with autosomal dominant ARVD.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), also called arrhythmogenic right
ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C), is an inherited heart disease.
ARVD is caused by genetic defects of the parts of heart muscle (also called myocardium or cardiac
muscle) known as desmosomes, areas on the surface of heart muscle cells which link the cells
together. The desmosomes are composed of several proteins, and many of those proteins can have
harmful mutations.
The disease is a type of nonischemic cardiomyopathy that involves primarily the right ventricle. It
is characterized by hypokinetic areas involving the free wall of the right ventricle, with fibrofatty
replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, with associated arrhythmias originating in the
right ventricle.
ARVD is often found in association with diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair,
because their genes are nearby and often inherited together [1]:513[2]

ARVC/D is an important cause of ventricular arrhythmias in children and young adults. It is seen
predominantly in males, and 30-50% of cases have a familial distribution.
Genetics
It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with variable expression. Novel studies
showed that mutations (point mutations) in genes encoding for desmosomal proteins (see
intercalated disc) are the main causatives for the development of this disease. Recently it could be
shown, that mutations in the desmin gene could cause ARVC. Desmin is an intermediate filament
protein, which is linked to the desmosomes. The penetrance is 20–35% in general, but significantly
higher in Italy. Seven gene loci have been implicated in ARVD. However, about 50% of families
that express ARVD that undergo genetic screening do not show linkage with any of the known
chromosomal loci. It is unclear whether the pathogenesis varies with the different loci involved.
Standard genetic screening test are currently tested and evaluated in different state of the art
cardiovascular research centres and hospitals. Types include:

Incidence
The incidence of ARVD is about 1/10,000 in the general population in the United States, although
some studies have suggested that it may be as common as 1/1,000. Recently, 1/200 were found to
be carriers of mutations that predispose to ARVC[3] It accounts for up to 17% of all sudden cardiac
deaths in the young. In Italy, the incidence is 40/10,000, making it the most common cause of
sudden cardiac death in the young population.
Presentation
Up to 80% of individuals with ARVD present with syncope or sudden cardiac death. The remainder
frequently present with palpitations or other symptoms due to right ventricular outflow tract
(RVOT) tachycardia (a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia).
Symptoms are usually exercise-related. In populations where hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is
screened out prior to involvement in competitive athletics, it is a common cause of sudden cardiac
death. Cookies help us deliver our services. By using our services, you agree to our use of cookies.

The first clinical signs of ARVD are usually during adolescence. However, signs of ARVD have been
demonstrated in infants.
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of ARVD is largely unknown. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) appears to play
a large role. It is unclear why only the right ventricle is involved. The disease process starts in the
subepicardial region and works its way towards the endocardial surface, leading to transmural
involvement (possibly accounting for the aneurysmal dilatation of the RV). Residual myocardium
is confined to the subendocardial region and the trabeculae of the RV. These trabeculae may
become hypertrophied.
Aneurysmal dilatation is seen in 50% of cases at autopsy. It usually occurs in the diaphragmatic,
apical, and infundibular regions (known as the triangle of dysplasia). The left ventricle is involved
in 50-67% of individuals. If the left ventricle is involved, it is usually late in the course of disease,
and confers a poor prognosis.
There are two pathological patterns seen in ARVD, Fatty infiltration and fibro-fatty infiltration.
Fatty infiltration
The first, fatty infiltration, is confined to the right ventricle. This involves a partial or near-
complete substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue without wall thinning. It involves
predominantly the apical and infundibular regions of the RV. The left ventricle and ventricular
septum are usually spared. No inflammatory infiltrates are seen in fatty infiltration. There is
evidence of myocyte (myocardial cell) degeneration and death seen in 50% of cases of fatty
infiltration.
Fibro-fatty infiltration
The second, fibro-fatty infiltration, involves replacement of myocytes with fibrofatty tissue. A
patchy myocarditis is involved in up to 2/3 of cases, with inflammatory infiltrates (mostly T cells)
seen on microscopy. Myocardial atrophy is due to injury and apoptosis. This leads to thinning of
the RV free wall (to < 3 mm thickness) Myocytes are replaced with fibrofatty tissue. The regions
preferentially involved include the RV inflow tract, the RV outflow tract, and the RV apex.
However, the LV free wall may be involved in some cases. Involvement of the ventricular septum is
rare. The areas involved are prone to aneurysm formation.
Ventricular arrhythmias
Ventricular arrhythmias due to ARVD typically arise
from the diseased right ventricle. The type of
arrhythmia ranges from frequent premature
ventricular complexes (PVCs) to ventricular
tachycardia (VT) to ventricular fibrillation (VF).
While the initiating factor of the ventricular
Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia
arrhythmias is unclear, it may be due to triggered
activity or reentry.

Ventricular arrhythmias are usually exercise-related, suggesting that they are sensitive to
catecholamines. The ventricular beats typically have a right axis deviation. Multiple morphologies
of ventricular tachycardia may be present in the same individual, suggesting multiple
arrhythmogenic foci or pathways.
Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is the most common VT seen in individuals
with ARVD. In this case, the EKG shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology with an
inferior axis.
Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis for the ventricular tachycardia due to ARVD include:
• Congenital heart disease
• Repaired tetralogy of Fallot
• Ebstein's anomaly
• Uhl's anomaly
• Atrial septal defect
• Partial anomalous venous return
• Acquired heart disease
• Tricuspid valve disease
• Pulmonary hypertension
• Right ventricular infarction
• Bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia
• Miscellaneous
• Pre-excited AV re-entry tachycardia
• Idiopathic RVOT tachycardia
• Sarcoidosis
Clinical testing
In order to make the diagnosis of ARVD, a number of clinical tests are employed, including the
electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiography, right ventricular angiography, cardiac MRI, and
genetic testing.
Electrocardiogram
90% of individuals with ARVD have some EKG abnormality. The most common EKG abnormality
seen in ARVD is T wave inversion in leads V to V . However, this is a non-specific finding, and

may be considered a normal variant in right bundle branch block (RBBB), women, and children
under 12 years old.
RBBB itself is seen frequently in individuals with ARVD. This may be due to delayed activation of
the right ventricle, rather than any intrinsic abnormality in the right bundle branch.
The epsilon wave is found in about 50% of those with ARVD. This is described as a terminal
notch in the QRS complex. It is due to slowed intraventricular conduction. The epsilon wave may
be seen on a surface EKG; however, it is more commonly seen on signal averaged EKGs.

Ventricular ectopy seen on a surface EKG in the setting
of ARVD is typically of left bundle branch block (LBBB)
morphology, with a QRS axis of -90 to +110 degrees.
The origin of the ectopic beats is usually from one of
the three regions of fatty degeneration (the "triangle of

dysplasia"): the RV outflow tract, the RV inflow tract,
and the RV apex.

ARVD.
Signal averaged ECG
Signal averaged ECG (SAECG) is used to detect late potentials and epsilon waves in individuals
with ARVD.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography may reveal an enlarged, hypokinetic right ventricle with a paper-thin RV free
wall. The dilatation of the RV will cause dilatation of the tricuspid valve annulus, with subsequent
tricuspid regurgitation. Paradoxical septal motion may also be present.
Cardiac MRI
Fatty infiltration of the RV free wall can be visible on
cardiac MRI. Fat has increased intensity in T1-
weighted images. However, it may be difficult to
differentiate intramyocardial fat and the epicardial
fat that is commonly seen adjacent to the normal
heart. Also, the sub-tricuspid region may be difficult
to distinguish from the atrioventricular sulcus, which
is rich in fat.
Cardiac MRI can visualize the extreme thinning and
akinesis of the RV free wall. However, the normal RV

Right ventricular angiography
Right ventricular angiography is considered the gold
standard for the diagnosis of ARVD. Findings consistent with ARVD are an akinetic or dyskinetic
bulging localized to the infundibular, apical, and subtricuspid regions of the RV. The specificity is
90%; however, the test is observer dependent.
Right ventricular biopsy
Transvenous biopsy of the right ventricle can be highly specific for ARVD, but it has low sensitivity.
False positives include other conditions with fatty infiltration of the ventricle, such as chronic
alcohol abuse and Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy.
False negatives are common, however, because the disease progresses typically from the
epicardium to the endocardium (with the biopsy sample coming from the endocardium), and the

common in this disease process, most biopsy samples are taken from the ventricular septum,
which is commonly not involved in the disease process.
A biopsy sample that is consistent with ARVD would have > 3% fat, >40% fibrous tissue, and <45%
myocytes.
Autopsy
A post mortem histological demonstration of full
thickness substitution of the RV myocardium by fatty
or fibro-fatty tissue is consistent with ARVD.
Genetic Testing
ARVD is an autosomal dominant trait with reduced
penetrance. Approximately 40-50% of ARVD
patients have a mutation identified in one of several
genes encoding components of the desmosome,
which can help confirm a diagnosis of ARVD.[4]
Since ARVD is an autosomal dominant trait, children
of an ARVD patient have a 50% chance of inheriting
the disease causing mutation. Whenever a mutation
is identified by genetic testing, family-specific
genetic testing can be used to differentiate between
relatives who are at-risk for the disease and those
who are not. ARVD genetic testing is clinically
available.[5]

Natural history
There is a long asymptomatic lead-time in individuals with ARVD. While this is a genetically
transmitted disease, individuals in their teens may not have any characteristics of ARVD on
screening tests.
Many individuals have symptoms associated with ventricular tachycardia, such as palpitations,
light-headedness, or syncope. Others may have symptoms and signs related to right ventricular
failure, such as lower extremity edema, or liver congestion with elevated hepatic enzymes.
Unfortunately, sudden death may be the first manifestation of disease.
ARVD is a progressive disease. Over time, the right ventricle becomes more involved, leading to
right ventricular failure. The right ventricle will fail before there is left ventricular dysfunction.
However, by the time the individual has signs of overt right ventricular failure, there will be
histological involvement of the left ventricle. Eventually, the left ventricle will also become
involved, leading to bi-ventricular failure. Signs and symptoms of left ventricular failure may
become evident, including congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an increased incidence of
thromboembolic events.
Management
The goal of management of ARVD is to decrease the incidence of sudden cardiac death. This raises
a clinical dilemma: How to prophylactically treat the asymptomatic patient who was diagnosed
during family screening.
A certain subgroup of individuals with ARVD are considered at high risk for sudden cardiac death.
Characteristics associated with high risk of sudden cardiac death include:
• Young age
• Competitive sports activity

• Extensive RV disease with decreased right ventricular ejection fraction.
• Left ventricular involvement
• Syncope
• Episode of ventricular arrhythmia
Management options include pharmacological, surgical, catheter ablation, and placement of an
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
Prior to the decision of the treatment option, programmed electrical stimulation in the
electrophysiology laboratory may be performed for additional prognostic information. Goals of
programmed stimulation include:
• Assessment of the disease's arrhythmogenic potential
• Evaluate the hemodynamic consequences of sustained VT
• Determine whether the VT can be interrupted via antitachycardia pacing.
Regardless of the management option chosen, the individual is typically suggested to undergo
lifestyle modification, including avoidance of strenuous exercise, cardiac stimulants (i.e.: caffeine,
nicotine, pseudoephedrine) and alcohol. If the individual wishes to begin an exercise regimen, an
exercise stress test may have added benefit.
Pharmacologic management
Pharmacologic management of ARVD involves arrhythmia suppression and prevention of
thrombus formation.
Sotalol, a beta blocker and a class III antiarrhythmic agent, is the most effective antiarrhythmic
agent in ARVD. Other antiarrhythmic agents used include amiodarone and conventional beta
blockers (i.e.: metoprolol). If antiarrhythmic agents are used, their efficacy should be guided by
series ambulatory holter monitoring, to show a reduction in arrhythmic events.
While angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE Inhibitors) are well known for slowing
progression in other cardiomyopathies, they have not been proven to be helpful in ARVD.
Individuals with decreased RV ejection fraction with dyskinetic portions of the right ventricle may
benefit from long term anticoagulation with warfarin to prevent thrombus formation and
subsequent pulmonary embolism.
Catheter ablation
Catheter ablation may be used to treat intractable ventricular tachycardia. It has a 60-90% success
rate.[6] Unfortunately, due to the progressive nature of the disease, recurrence is common (60%
recurrence rate), with the creation of new arrhythmogenic foci. Indications for catheter ablation
include drug-refractory VT and frequent recurrence of VT after ICD placement, causing frequent
discharges of the ICD.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
An ICD is the most effective prevention against sudden cardiac death. Due to the prohibitive cost
of ICDs, they are not routinely placed in all individuals with ARVD.

• Cardiac arrest due to VT or VF
• Symptomatic VT that is not inducible during programmed stimulation
• Failed programmed stimulation-guided drug therapy
• Severe RV involvement with poor tolerance of VT
• Sudden death of immediate family member
Since ICDs are typically placed via a transvenous approach into the right ventricle, there are
complications associated with ICD placement and follow-up.
Due to the extreme thinning of the RV free wall, it is possible to perforate the RV during
implantation, potentially causing pericardial tamponade. Because of this, every attempt is made at
placing the defibrillator lead on the ventricular septum.
After a successful implantation, the progressive nature of the disease may lead to fibro-fatty
replacement of the myocardium at the site of lead placement. This may lead to undersensing of the
individual's electrical activity (potentially causing inability to sense VT or VF), and inability to pace
the ventricle.
Cardiac transplant surgery
Cardiac transplant surgery may be performed in ARVD. It may be indicated if the arrhythmias
associated with the disease are uncontrollable or if there is severe bi-ventricular heart failure that
is not manageable with pharmacological therapy.
Family screening
All first degree family members of the affected individual should be screened for ARVD. This is
used to establish the pattern of inheritance. Screening should begin during the teenage years
unless otherwise indicated. Screening tests include:
• Echocardiogram
• EKG
• Signal averaged EKG
• Holter monitoring
• Cardiac MRI
• Exercise stress test
Highly-publicised deaths from arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia
• Sevilla FC and Spanish international left wing-back Antonio Puerta died from the condition, at
the age of 22, on 28 August 2007, three days after suffering several cardiac arrests, while

• Englishman Matt Gadsby also died from the condition after collapsing on the pitch on 9
September 2006, while playing with his team Hinckley United in a Conference North game
