Sick sinus syndrome overview

condition, and patients with heart rate < 40 per minute. Historical Perspective Sick sinus syndrome was first described by Dr. Keith and Dr. Flack, in 1907. In 2015, MYH6 gene mutations were first implicated in the pathogenesis of sick sinus syndrome. In 1972, Dr. Mandel found a new method of assessing sinus node function, known as sinus node recovery time. Classification There is no classification system for sick sinus syndrome. Pathophysiology Sick sinus syndrome occurs as an improperly propagated signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node. Age- dependent progressive fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and Remodeling of a sinuatrial node are the potential mechanisms of this abnormally formed signal propagation. MYH6 gene may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Causes Sick sinus syndrome can result in many abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), including sinus arrest, sinus node exit block, sinus bradycardia, and other types of bradycardia (slow heart rate). Sick sinus syndrome may also be caused by a variety of conditions including but not limited to myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, drugs or toxins, infections,medications, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothermia, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis. Differentiating Sick sinus syndrome from other Diseases Sick sinus syndrome must be differentiated from other cause of
