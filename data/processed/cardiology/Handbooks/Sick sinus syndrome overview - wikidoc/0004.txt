Sick sinus syndrome overview

sick sinus syndrome. However, electrolyte abnormalities may be one of the causes. Possible metabolic disturbances associated with sick sinus syndrome include hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoxia. Sick sinus syndrome is a collection of heart rhythm disorders that include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses and sinus arrest. Sick sinus syndrome can evolve towards causing atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ectopic atrial tachycardia, sinus node reentrant tachycardia, and tachycardia-bradycardia. There are no echocardiography/ultrasound findings associated with sick sinus syndrome. The management of sick sinus syndrome depends on the underlying cause and the presenting symptoms. Asymptomatic patients are usually monitored without therapy. Atropine may be used in the presence of symptoms or hemodynamic compromise. The management of sick sinus syndrome depends on the underlying cause and the presenting symptoms. After correcting the reversible causes of sick sinus syndrome, it can be managed by placing an implantable pacemaker. Indications of the implantable pacemaker include, patients with documented bradycardia and are symptomatic, patients with chronotropic incompetence, sinus node dysfunction secondary to medications necessitated by another medical condition, and patients with heart rate < 40 per minute. Historical Perspective Sick sinus syndrome was first described by Dr. Keith and Dr. Flack, in 1907. In 2015, MYH6 gene
