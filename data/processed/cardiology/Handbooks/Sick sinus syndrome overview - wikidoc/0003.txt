screening for sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome natural history progress over decades. Patients are usually asymptomatic at first, but then symptoms may present due to the insufficient blood supply. Sinus pause or severe bradycardia may present with the central nervous system (CNS) under perfusion which manifests with presyncope or syncope. Possible complications of sick sinus syndrome include cerebrovascular events, stroke, transient ischemic events, renal, gastrointestinal hypo-perfusion, thromboembolism, Fatigue and exercise intolerance. The syndrome is progressive, which means it usually gets worse over time. Patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) may present with nonspecific symptoms or be asymptomatic. 50 percent of patients present with syncope or pre-syncope related to the decreased cerebral perfusion secondary to bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias. Some of the symptoms that may develop among patients include memory loss, dizziness or light-headedness, Palpitations, chest pain or angina, shortness of breath, fatigue, and headache. Patients with sick sinus syndrome usually appear normal. Physical examination of patients with sick sinus syndrome is usually remarkable for bradycard associated with the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. However, electrolyte abnormalities may be one of the causes. Possible metabolic disturbances associated with sick sinus syndrome include hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypoxia. Sick sinus syndrome
