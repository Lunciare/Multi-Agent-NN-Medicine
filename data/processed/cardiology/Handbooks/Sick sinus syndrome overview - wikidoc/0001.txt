Overview Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) is a term used to describe a number of different abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's "natural" pacemaker. It encompasses disorders causing reduced automaticity of the sinoatrial node, exit block, and sinus arrest. The syndrome primarily affects the elderly, and is associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter in approximately half of the patients and with distal conduction disease in up to one tenth of patients. Sick sinus syndrome was first described by Dr. Keith and Dr. Flack, in 1907. In 2015, MYH6 gene mutations were first implicated in the pathogenesis of sick sinus syndrome. In 1972, Dr. Mandel found a new method of assessing sinus node function, known as sinus node recovery time. There is no classification system for sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome occurs as an improperly propagated signal from the sinoatrial (SA) node. Age- dependent progressive fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and Remodeling of a sinuatrial node are the potential mechanisms of this abnormally formed signal propagation. MYH6 gene may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Sick sinus syndrome can result in many abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), including sinus
