Sick sinus syndrome overview

this abnormally formed signal propagation. MYH6 gene may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Sick sinus syndrome can result in many abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), including sinus arrest, sinus node exit block, sinus bradycardia, and other types of bradycardia (slow heart rate). Sick sinus syndrome may also be caused by a variety of conditions including but not limited to myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, drugs or toxins, infections,medications, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothermia, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis. Sick sinus syndrome must be differentiated from other cause of syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, and tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. The incidence of SSS increases with increasing age, occurring in 1 of every 600 cardiac patients above the age of 65 years old. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) usually occurs in individuals older than 50 years old. There is no difference in incidence of SSS between men and women. In addition, the black population was found to have a 41% lower risk of developing SSS as compared to the white population. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome natural history progress over decades. Patients are usually asymptomatic at first, but then symptoms may present due to the insufficient blood supply.
