Differentiating Sick sinus syndrome from other Diseases Sick sinus syndrome must be differentiated from other cause of syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, and tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Epidemiology and Demographics The incidence of SSS increases with increasing age, occurring in 1 of every 600 cardiac patients above the age of 65 years old. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) usually occurs in individuals older than 50 years old. There is no difference in incidence of SSS between men and women. In addition, the black population was found to have a 41% lower risk of developing SSS as compared to the white population. Screening There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for sick sinus syndrome. Natural history, Complications and Prognosis Sick sinus syndrome natural history progress over decades. Patients are usually asymptomatic at first, but then symptoms may present due to the insufficient blood supply. Sinus pause or severe bradycardia may present with the central nervous system (CNS) under perfusion which manifests with presyncope or syncope. Possible complications of sick sinus syndrome include cerebrovascular events, stroke, transient ischemic events, renal, gastrointestinal hypo-perfusion, thromboembolism, Fatigue and exercise intolerance. The syndrome is progressive, which means
