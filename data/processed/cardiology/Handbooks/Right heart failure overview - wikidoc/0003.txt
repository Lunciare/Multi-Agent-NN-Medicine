Right heart failure overview

Pathophysiology The pathophysiological processes underlying right heart failure can be divided broadly into three: decreased right ventricular contractility, right ventricular pressure overload, and right ventricular volume overload.[8] The right ventricle tries to adapt acutely by dilatation and chronically by hypertrophy. Whether dilatation or hypertrophy occur, right heart failure gets further exacerbated as a result of these adaptive mechanisms. Right ventricular performance is tightly linked to ventricular interdependence and pericardial constraint. The right ventricle and left ventricle are anatomically and physiologically integrated through the interventricular septum, and right ventricular pressure or volume overload can impair left ventricular filling and output by shifting the septum and increasing pericardial restraint.[1] In addition to load dependent mechanisms, cellular and molecular changes such as myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, ischemia, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation contribute to progressive right ventricular dysfunction across etiologies.[9][1] Causes There are acute and chronic causes of right heart failure. Acute right heart failure is often associated with right ventricular dilation. Chronic right heart failure is often associated with right ventricular hypertrophy. Common etiologic categories include: • Acute pressure overload: pulmonary embolism, acute worsening of pulmonary hypertension, severe hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress with high intrathoracic pressures from mechanical ventilation.[1][7] • Chronic pressure overload:
