Right heart failure overview

and correction of reversible causes.[1][18] Device selection should account for the mechanism of failure and the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension, since isolated right ventricular assist strategies may be inappropriate when pulmonary vascular resistance is markedly elevated.[1] Future or Investigational Therapies A right ventricular assist device (RVAD) can be a temporary therapy for patients with acute exacerbation of right heart failure. Ongoing research focuses on improved assessment of right ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling and therapies that directly target right ventricular contractility and lusitropy.
