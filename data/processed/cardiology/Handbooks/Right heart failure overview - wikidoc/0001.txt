Overview The right ventricle was previously recognized as a simple conduit between the systemic and the pulmonary circulation, but its importance in maintaining hemodynamic stability and end organ function is now well established.[1] Right heart function is an important prognostic factor in multiple settings, including congenital heart diseases, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure.[2][3] Right heart failure can be defined as failure of the right ventricle to pump blood into the lungs adequately. It is a clinical syndrome resulting from functional and structural cardiovascular disorders that impair right ventricular filling and or ejection. In clinical practice, the main physiologic determinants of right ventricular performance mirror those of the left ventricle and include preload, afterload, contractility, and active relaxation (lusitropy).[1] Right ventricular failure often reflects impaired right ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling and is particularly sensitive to acute increases in pulmonary vascular load.[4] Furthermore, isolated right ventricular failure, despite its rarity as compared to left ventricular failure, may carry a worse prognosis in selected settings. Right heart failure is also used interchangeably with cor pulmonale when the pathology is caused by an underlying lung disease.[2][5] Classification There are many different ways to categorize right heart failure, which includes whether the abnormality
