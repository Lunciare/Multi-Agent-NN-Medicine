Right heart failure overview

1000 for individuals older than 65 years of age.[13] Right ventricular failure epidemiology varies by underlying substrate, and is particularly common in advanced pulmonary hypertension, advanced left sided heart failure, and critical illness with acute pulmonary vascular load. Contemporary guidance emphasizes recognizing right ventricular dysfunction as a major determinant of symptoms, exercise limitation, and outcomes across these populations.[1][7] Natural History, Complications and Prognosis 2/5 Right heart failure, if left undiagnosed and untreated, may lead to impaired quality of life and eventually death. There are several factors that define this natural history depending mainly on the underlying etiology or mechanism of injury, the onset of illness, how early treatment was initiated, and other comorbidities. Progression is often driven by a cycle of rising right sided filling pressures, impaired forward flow, worsening systemic congestion with hepatic and renal dysfunction, and further neurohormonal activation. In pressure overload states, worsening right ventricle to pulmonary artery uncoupling is a key inflection point associated with clinical deterioration.[1][4] Diagnosis In the initial approach to a patient with right heart failure, it is important to determine the underlying etiology, assess functional status, determine the presence of end organ dysfunction (liver and kidney most notably), and identify associated conditions.
