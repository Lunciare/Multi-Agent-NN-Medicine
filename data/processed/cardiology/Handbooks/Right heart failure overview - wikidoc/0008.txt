Right heart failure overview

Invasive Hemodynamics Right heart catheterization can define the hemodynamic profile, quantify pulmonary vascular load, and guide therapy in complex or refractory cases. In acute decompensation, invasive monitoring may help assess response to preload adjustment and afterload targeted therapies, particularly when clinical examination and noninvasive findings are discordant.[1][7] Treatment Medical Therapy Currently, the basis of therapy for right heart failure includes cautious diuresis, rhythm management, and treatment of the underlying cause when feasible. Management can be tailored to etiology specific therapy such as anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism or antibiotics for endocarditis. Management also comprises optimizing right ventricular preload, afterload and contractility. A contemporary approach emphasizes four parallel goals: optimize preload, reduce right ventricular afterload, augment contractility when needed, and maintain systemic perfusion pressure while treating the precipitating cause.[1][7] Optimization of preload includes careful diuresis and management of venous congestion, while avoiding excessive preload reduction that may lower cardiac output. In selected patients, invasive hemodynamic guidance may be useful for titration.[1][7] Reduction of afterload depends on etiology and includes reperfusion or anticoagulation for acute pulmonary embolism, correction of hypoxemia and acidosis, minimizing injurious ventilator settings, and targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy for appropriate forms of pulmonary hypertension.[1][10] Augmentation of contractility may be required
