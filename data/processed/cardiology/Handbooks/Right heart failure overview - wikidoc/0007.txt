of therapy, and provide prognostic information.[15] In addition, in patients with right heart failure, an arterial blood gas can be useful in assessing hypoxemia and guiding oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram Right heart failure is often accompanied by right ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular dilation. General electrocardiographic findings of right ventricular hypertrophy include right axis deviation, an R S ratio greater than 1 in V1, and the presence of P pulmonale. Chest X Ray 3/5 The plain chest radiograph has limited utility in identifying right heart failure. It might show evidence of underlying causes such as pulmonary embolism or congenital heart disease. Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography plays a key role in the diagnosis of right heart failure by evaluating right ventricular size and function, estimating pulmonary pressures, and assessing tricuspid regurgitation. Recommended measures of right ventricular systolic function include tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tissue Doppler S prime, right ventricular fractional area change, and right ventricular longitudinal strain, interpreted in the context of loading conditions and right ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling.[16][1] Invasive Hemodynamics Right heart catheterization can define the hemodynamic profile, quantify pulmonary vascular load, and guide therapy in complex or refractory cases. In acute decompensation, invasive monitoring may help assess
