Right heart failure overview

interchangeably with cor pulmonale when the pathology is caused by an underlying lung disease.[2][5] Classification There are many different ways to categorize right heart failure, which includes whether the abnormality is due to insufficient contraction (systolic dysfunction); or due to insufficient relaxation of the heart (diastolic dysfunction), or to both; whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure (preload), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion (afterload); whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high systemic vascular resistance or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low output heart failure vs. high output heart failure); degree of functional impairment conferred by the abnormality (as reflected in the New York Heart Association Functional Classification[6]); and the degree of coexisting illness, such as heart failure with systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, or chronic renal failure. A practical approach is to classify right ventricular failure by time course (acute vs chronic) and predominant mechanism, including pressure overload (afterload), volume overload (preload), and primary myocardial dysfunction affecting contractility or lusitropy.[1][7] Pathophysiology The pathophysiological processes underlying right heart failure can be divided broadly into three: decreased right ventricular contractility, right ventricular pressure overload, and right ventricular volume overload.[8] The right ventricle
