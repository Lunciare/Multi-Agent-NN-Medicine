for acute pulmonary embolism, correction of hypoxemia and acidosis, minimizing injurious ventilator settings, and targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy for appropriate forms of pulmonary hypertension.[1][10] Augmentation of contractility may be required in shock or low output states. Dobutamine can increase cardiac output and stroke volume in right ventricular myocardial infarction and in pulmonary hypertension, and milrinone may be considered with attention to systemic vasodilation and hypotension.[1][7] 4/5 Since atrial fibrillation and high grade AV block can cause hemodynamic instability in right heart failure, maintaining sinus rhythm and atrioventricular synchrony is important.[17] Surgery Surgical intervention in right heart failure is mainly indicated for valvular pathologies and congenital heart diseases causing progressive symptoms despite adequate medical interventions. Early correction in selected settings can improve symptoms and outcomes. Treating primary pulmonary hypertension may lead to improved functional capacity, and in selected cases, lung transplant or heart lung transplant can extend survival.[17][7] Mechanical Circulatory Support Temporary mechanical circulatory support may be considered for patients with refractory acute right ventricular failure and shock despite optimized pharmacotherapy and correction of reversible causes.[1][18] Device selection should account for the mechanism of failure and the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension, since isolated right ventricular assist strategies may be inappropriate
