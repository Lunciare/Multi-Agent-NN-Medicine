Right heart failure overview

categories include: • Acute pressure overload: pulmonary embolism, acute worsening of pulmonary hypertension, severe hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress with high intrathoracic pressures from mechanical ventilation.[1][7] • Chronic pressure overload: pulmonary arterial hypertension and other forms of chronic pulmonary hypertension with progressive right ventricle to pulmonary artery uncoupling.[3][10] • Primary myocardial dysfunction: right ventricular myocardial infarction and inflammatory or infiltrative cardiomyopathies affecting the right ventricle.[11] • Volume overload: significant tricuspid regurgitation, intracardiac shunts, and chronic right sided valvular lesions.[7] • Right ventricular dysfunction secondary to systemic illness and critical illness, including sepsis and severe viral infections; right ventricular dysfunction has also been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID 19 and is associated with adverse outcomes.[12] Epidemiology and Demographics The prevalence of heart failure has been increasing due to the increase in the aging population, early detection, preventive measures, and improvement in therapy. The prevalence of heart failure in the United States was estimated in 2006 to be 5.8 million people of all ages with an estimated incidence of 10 per 1000 for individuals older than 65 years of age.[13] Right ventricular failure epidemiology varies by underlying substrate, and is particularly common in advanced pulmonary hypertension, advanced left sided heart failure,
