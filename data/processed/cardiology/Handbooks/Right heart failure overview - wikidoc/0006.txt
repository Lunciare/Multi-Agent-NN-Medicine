Right heart failure overview

right heart failure, it is important to determine the underlying etiology, assess functional status, determine the presence of end organ dysfunction (liver and kidney most notably), and identify associated conditions. History and Symptoms Right heart failure is frequently associated with shortness of breath, exercise intolerance and coughing, and in later stages chest discomfort and swelling of the feet or ankles. According to the 2009 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Consensus Conference update on right sided heart failure, right heart failure should be suspected when a patient presents with unexplained exercise intolerance or hypotension with signs of elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, or a combination of these findings.[14] Physical Exam Physical exam should consist of a thorough cardiovascular exam, an abdominal exam, and examination of the extremities. Findings to be aware of are cyanosis, JVD, S2 and S3 heart sounds, ascites, hepatomegaly, and pedal edema. Laboratory Findings Laboratory tests are not diagnostic for heart failure, but they are essential to identify precipitating factors of decompensation, assess severity, monitor adverse effects of therapy, and provide prognostic information.[15] In addition, in patients with right heart failure, an arterial blood gas can be useful in assessing hypoxemia and guiding oxygen therapy.
