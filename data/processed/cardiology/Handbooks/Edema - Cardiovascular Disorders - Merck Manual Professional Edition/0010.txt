for a liver disorder or heart failure. The kidneys are palpated, and the bladder is percussed. An abnormal abdominal mass, if present, should be palpated. Red flags Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of edema: Sudden onset Significant pain Shortness of breath Fever History of a heart disorder or an abnormal cardiac examination Hemoptysis, dyspnea, or pleural friction rub Hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, or hematemesis Unilateral leg swelling with tenderness 8/11 Interpretation of findings Potential acute life threats, which typically manifest with sudden onset of focal edema, must be identified. Such a presentation suggests acute DVT, soft-tissue infection, or angioedema. Acute DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be fatal. Soft-tissue infections range from minor to life threatening, depending on factors that include the infecting organism and the patient’s health. Acute angioedema sometimes progresses to involve the airway, with serious consequences. Dyspnea may occur with edema due to heart failure, DVT if PE has occurred, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or angioedema that involves the airways. Generalized, slowly developing edema suggests a chronic heart, kidney, or liver disorder. Although these disorders can also be life threatening, complications tend to take much longer to develop.
