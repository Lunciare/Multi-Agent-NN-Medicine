Edema

Generalized, slowly developing edema suggests a chronic heart, kidney, or liver disorder. Although these disorders can also be life threatening, complications tend to take much longer to develop. These factors and other clinical features help suggest the cause (see table Some Causes of Edema). Testing For most patients with generalized edema, testing should include complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver tests, serum protein, and urinalysis (particularly noting the presence of protein and microscopic hematuria). Other tests should be done based on the suspected cause (see table Some Causes of Edema)—eg, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) for suspected heart failure or D-dimer for suspected pulmonary embolism. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can sometimes be useful to evaluate the following: Fluid and volume status (evaluating jugular venous pressure, inferior vena cava, B-lines, pleural effusions) Left ventricular ejection fraction Right ventricular abnormalities (eg, increased right ventricular pressure or size or impaired function) secondary to disorders such as pulmonary embolism or right ventricular failure Patients with isolated lower-extremity swelling should usually have venous obstruction excluded by ultrasound. Treatment of Edema Specific causes are treated. Patients with sodium retention often benefit from restriction of dietary sodium. Patients with heart failure should eliminate
