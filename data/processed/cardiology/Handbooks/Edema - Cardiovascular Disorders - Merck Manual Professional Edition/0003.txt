fluid out of the interstitial space into the capillaries due to lack of adequate plasma oncotic pressure, as in nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, liver failure, or starvation. 2/11 Increased capilliary permeability occurs in infections or as the result of toxin or inflammatory damage to the capillary walls. In angioedema, mediators, including mast cell–derived mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins) and bradykinin and complement-derived mediators, cause focal edema. The lymphatic system is responsible for removing protein and white blood cells (along with some water) from the interstitium. Lymphatic obstruction allows these substances to accumulate in the interstitium. Etiology of Edema Generalized edema is most commonly caused by Heart failure Liver failure Kidney disorders (especially nephrotic syndrome) Localized edema is most commonly caused by DVT or another venous disorder or venous obstruction (eg, by tumor) Infection Angioedema Lymphatic obstruction Chronic venous insufficiency may involve one or both legs. Common causes are listed by primary mechanism (see table Some Causes of Edema).
