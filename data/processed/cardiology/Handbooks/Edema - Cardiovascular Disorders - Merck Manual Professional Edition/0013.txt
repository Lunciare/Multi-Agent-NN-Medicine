Edema

modestly increase sodium excretion. Both triamterene and amiloride have been combined with a thiazide to prevent potassium wasting. An ACE inhibitor–thiazide combination also reduces potassium wasting. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) lower serum glucose in patients with diabetes but also induce diuresis by increasing natriuresis and glycosuria without significantly affecting serum electrolytes (1, 2, 3, 4). They can be used in patients with heart failure or nephrotic syndrome with or without diabetes. Geriatrics Essentials: Edema In older adults, use of medications that treat causes of edema (particularly heart failure) requires special caution, such as the following: Starting doses low and evaluating patients thoroughly when the dose is changed Monitoring for orthostatic hypotension if diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or beta-blockers are used Frequently testing for hypokalemia or hyperkalemia Not stopping calcium channel blockers because of pedal edema, which is benign Logging daily weight helps immensely in monitoring clinical improvement or deterioration. Key Points Edema may result from a generalized or local process and may occur anywhere in the body. Main causes of generalized edema are chronic heart, liver, and kidney disorders. Not all edema is serious; consequences depend mainly on the cause. Sudden onset
