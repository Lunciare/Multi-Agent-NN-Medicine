at peak exertion. After a suitable waiting period, pictures are taken with a gamma camera. The pictures can then be compared with the patient's resting images in order to assess the status of the patient's coronary arteries. Diagnostic value The American Heart Association journal, Circulation, describes: Treadmill test: sensitivity of 67%, specificity of 70% Nuclear test: sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 85-95% However, these numbers reference detection of advanced artery luminal narrowing as assessed by stress methods compared with angiography as the "gold standard". As a predictor of future heart attack, both methods suffer in that they only detect lumen stenosis, a common symptom of some very advanced atheroma, but not the vulnerable plaques which produce most heart attacks. Because of this, most clinical cardiology experience demonstrates that the actual sensitivity and specificity values for detecting likelihood of future heart attack, as opposed to lumen narrowing, are much lower than stated above. Whatever the actual numbers, the value of stress tests has increasingly been recognized as limited, especially for people without symptoms. Yet, according to United States data from 2004, for about 65% of men and 47% of women, the first symptom of cardiovascular disease is heart attack or sudden
