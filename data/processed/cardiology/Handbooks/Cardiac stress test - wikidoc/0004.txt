exercise. However, most heart attacks result from rupture of atheroma lesions associated with only mild narrowing (20% on average by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) clinical studies), thus stress tests do not work well for detecting the vulnerable plaques which are responsible for most heart attacks. Like all tests, stress testing has problems with both falsely positive and falsely negative results compared with other clinical tests. Angiogram and/or intracoronary ultrasound (preferably in a hospital capable of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [PCI] with stenting) can provide even greater information, but at the risk of complications associated with cardiac catheterization. Variations Some patients with abnormal resting EKGs, or those who are unable to walk safely, can be "exercised" pharmacologically instead of walking on a treadmill. The patient will typically receive a pharmaceutical such as dipyridamole or adenosine (both vasodilators) or dobutamine (stimulates heart rate and pumping force) while a cardiologist or physician assistant reviews the electrocardiogram (EKG) tracing and checks blood pressure periodically. A radiotracer (typically Technetium-99m sestamibi, Technetium-99m tetrofosmin, or Thallium- 201) is injected at peak exertion. After a suitable waiting period, pictures are taken with a gamma camera. The pictures can then be compared with the patient's resting images in order to assess
