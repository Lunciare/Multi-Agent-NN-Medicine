Representation in culture The ECG has become so familiar to the general population that it is part of the logo of many medical organizations, representing the technical side of medicine vs. the Rod of Asclepius or caduceus, which are more traditional. Being an electrical representation, it signifies vitality and urgency. In various television medical dramas, an isoelectric ECG (no cardiac electrical activity, also known as flatline) is often used as a symbol of death or at least extreme medical peril. This is technically known as asystole, a form of cardiac arrest with a particularly bad prognosis. Though sometimes 12/14 shown on television, defibrillation, which can be used to correct arrythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, does not correct asystole and is not an indicated therapy. The Digital Imperative Recent regulatory developments have thrust cardiac safety to the forefront of clinical development due to the fact that QT effects of new drugs is now the most common cause of drug withdrawal from the market and delays in or lack of regulatory approval for marketing. The resultant "Digital ECG
