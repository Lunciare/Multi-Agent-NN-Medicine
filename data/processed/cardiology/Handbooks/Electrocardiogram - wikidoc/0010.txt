Electrocardiogram

of what is known as Einthoven's triangle.[4] ( Eventually, electrodes were invented that could be placed directly on the patient's skin. Even though the buckets of salt water are no longer necessary, the electrodes are still placed on the patient's arms and legs to approximate the signals obtained with the buckets of salt water. They remain the first three leads of the modern 12 lead ECG. • Lead I is a dipole with the negative (white) electrode on the right arm and the positive (black) electrode on the left arm. • Lead II is a dipole with the negative (white) electrode on the right arm and the positive (red) electrode on the left leg. • Lead III is a dipole with the negative (black) electrode on the left arm and the positive (red) electrode on the left leg.

They are derived from the same three electrodes as leads I, II, and III. However, they view the heart from
