effects of new drugs is now the most common cause of drug withdrawal from the market and delays in or lack of regulatory approval for marketing. The resultant "Digital ECG Imperative for Cardiac Safety" requires innovative strategies on the part of both drug development organizations and ECG services providers. On November 15, 2002, the FDA and Health Canada published regulatory guidance in the form of a concept paper entitled The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs, which was reviewed and discussed on January 13-14, 2003. Overall, the new regulatory guidance on ECGs in clinical research will require more robust and uniform cardiac safety assessments across virtually all segments of the drug development industry. It will drive increased reliance on ECG core laboratories. In turn, such laboratories will need to respond with not only increased capacity and capability, but also an enhancement of methodologies employed. While scientific expertise will remain of prime importance, core ECG laboratories will need to demonstrate mastery in new core competencies of a technical and logistical nature.
