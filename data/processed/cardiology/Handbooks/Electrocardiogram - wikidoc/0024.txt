Electrocardiogram

leads I and aVL are located on the left shoulder, leads I and aVL are sometimes referred to as the high lateral leads. Because the positive electrodes for leads V5 and V6 are on the patient's chest, they are sometimes referred to as the low lateral leads. • The septal leads, V and V look at electrical activity from the vantage point of the septal wall 1 2 of the left ventricle. They are often grouped together with the anterior leads. • The anterior leads, V and V look at electrical activity from the vantage point of the anterior 3 4 wall of the left ventricle. • In addition, any two precordial leads that are next to one another are considered to be contiguous. For example, even though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another. • Lead aVR offers no specific view of the left ventricle. Rather, it views the inside of the endocardial wall from its perspective on the right shoulder. Shown below is a diagram showing the contiguous leads in same color. Axis The heart's electrical axis refers to the general direction of the
