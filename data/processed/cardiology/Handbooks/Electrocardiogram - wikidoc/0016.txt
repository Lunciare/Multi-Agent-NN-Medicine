Electrocardiogram

followed to identify a patient's heart rhythm. What is the rate? Is it regular or irregular? Are P waves present? Are QRS complexes present? Is there a 1:1 relationship Schematic representation of normal ECG between P waves and QRS complexes? Is the PR interval constant? P wave During normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P wave on the ECG, which is upright in II, III, and aVF (since the general electrical activity is going toward the positive electrode in those leads), and inverted in aVR (since it is going away from the positive electrode for that lead). A P wave must be upright in leads II and aVF and inverted in lead aVR to designate a cardiac rhythm as Sinus Rhythm. • The relationship between P waves and QRS complexes helps distinguish various cardiac arrhythmias. • The shape and duration of the P waves may indicate atrial enlargement. PR interval The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. It is usually 120 to 200
