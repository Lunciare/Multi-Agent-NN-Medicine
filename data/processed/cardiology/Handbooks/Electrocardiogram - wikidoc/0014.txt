Electrocardiogram

to positive between leads V2 and V4. The equiphasic lead is referred to as the transition lead. When the transition occurs earlier than lead V3, it is referred to as an early transition. When it occurs later than lead V3, it is referred to as a late transition. There should also be a gradual increase in the amplitude of the R wave between leads V1 and V4. This is known as R wave progression. Poor R wave progression is a nonspecific finding. It can be caused by conduction abnormalities, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and other pathological conditions. • Lead V1 is placed in the fourth intercostal space to the right of the sternum. • Lead V2 is placed in the fourth intercostal space to the left of the sternum. • Lead V3 is placed directly between leads V2 and V4. • Lead V4 is placed in the fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line (even if the apex beat is displaced). • Lead V5 is placed horizontally with V4 in the anterior axillary line • Lead V6 is placed horizontally with V4 and V5 in the midaxillary line. Ground An additional electrode (usually green) is present in modern four-lead and twelve-lead
