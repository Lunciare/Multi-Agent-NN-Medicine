its perspective on the right shoulder. Shown below is a diagram showing the contiguous leads in same color. Axis The heart's electrical axis refers to the general direction of the heart's depolarization wavefront (or mean electrical vector) in the frontal plane. It is usually oriented in a right shoulder to left leg direction, which corresponds to the left inferior quadrant of the hexaxial reference system, although -30o to +90o is considered to be normal. • Left axis deviation (-30o to -90o) may indicate left anterior fascicular block or Q waves from inferior MI. 11/14 • Right axis deviation (+90o to +180o) may indicate left posterior fascicular block, Q waves from high lateral MI, or a right ventricular strain pattern. • In the setting of right bundle branch block, right or left axis deviation may indicate bifascicular block. Shown below is a diagram showing how the polarity of the QRS complex in leads I, II, and III can be used to estimate the heart's electrical axis in the frontal plane. Relation of Action Potential to Electrocardiogram Shown below is an image depicting the the phases of action potential to ECG waves. Representation in culture The ECG has become so familiar to
