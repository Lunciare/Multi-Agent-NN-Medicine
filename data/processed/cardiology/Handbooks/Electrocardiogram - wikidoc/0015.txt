anterior axillary line • Lead V6 is placed horizontally with V4 and V5 in the midaxillary line. Ground An additional electrode (usually green) is present in modern four-lead and twelve-lead ECGs. This is the ground lead and is placed on the right leg by convention, although in theory it can be placed anywhere on Ctohoeki ebs hoedlpy u. s Wdeliitvher oau rt sherrveicee-sl. eBay dus iEngC oGur, s ewrvhiceesn, yooun aeg redei tpoo oluer uisse ovf iceowokeieds., the remaining lead 7/14 becomes the ground lead by default. Waves and intervals A typical ECG tracing of a normal heartbeat (or cardiac cycle) consists of a P wave, a QRS complex and a T wave. A small U wave is normally visible in 50 to 75% of ECGs. The baseline voltage of the electrocardiogram is known as the isoelectric line. Typically the isoelectric line is measured as the portion of the tracing following the T wave and preceding the next P wave. Rhythm analysis There are some basic rules that can be followed to identify a patient's heart rhythm. What is the rate? Is it regular or irregular? Are P waves present? Are QRS complexes present? Is there a 1:1 relationship Schematic
