Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular
Tachycardia

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder
affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. Patients are
predisposed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (less commonly atrial
tachyarrhythmias) and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased
adrenergic activity (eg, from exercise). Diagnosis is by exercise testing.
Treatment is exercise restriction, beta-blockade, and sometimes an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
(See also Overview of Arrhythmias and Overview of Channelopathies.)
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) results from mutations affecting proteins
related to intracellular calcium regulation (particularly diastolic calcium release by the sarcoplasmic
reticulum ryanodine receptor) in the heart. The abnormalities increase release of calcium from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to adrenergic stimulation. The resulting myocyte calcium overload
causes delayed after-depolarizations and a propensity to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Sudden cardiac death may occur.
The tachyarrhythmias are usually precipitated by the adrenergic stimulation of physical or emotional
stress. The most characteristic ventricular tachyarrhythmia is bidirectional ventricular tachycardia which
appears on ECG as 2 QRS complexes of opposite polarity in an alternating pattern. Nevertheless, any
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may occur.
The incidence of CPVT is unknown but has been estimated to be about 1 in 20,000 (1) and is equally
common in males and females. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation of the gene
encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor, but it may be inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation of
cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2).

Symptoms and Signs of CPVT
Some patients are asymptomatic and identified only on family screening. When symptoms occur, they
usually develop at a young age (ie, childhood or adolescence). The tachyarrhythmias may cause
palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. Events are typically triggered by emotional or physical stress.
Diagnosis of CPVT
Exercise testing
Genetic testing
Screening of first-degree family members
Diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained cardiac arrest or syncope or a family
history of such in the absence of structural heart disease.
Resting ECG is normal. Diagnosis is confirmed by exercise testing–induced polymorphic VT (especially
bidirectional VT) that also reproduces the patient's symptoms. Genetic testing should then be done; it
has a yield of approximately 60% (1).
First-degree family members of patients have a significant risk of disease. They should have clinical
evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia) and exercise testing performed every 1 to
3 years. If the initial patient has a causative mutation identified, family members without the index
mutation are then freed of the need for follow-up investigations.

All patients are advised to avoid strenuous exercise (eg, competitive sports). Particularly those who will
not accept exercise restrictions should be counseled on the need for appropriate cautions (eg,
availability of an automated external defibrillator during training and competition).
For patients who have had symptoms (eg, syncope, cardiac arrest) or who have demonstrated VF or
sustained VT, the primary treatment is high doses of a long-acting beta-blocker, preferably one without
intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (eg, nadolol, slow-release propranolol). If beta-blockade is ineffective,
flecainide may be useful both for its sodium channel and ryanodine receptor–blocking effects.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are used for patients with CPVT who survived cardiac
arrest or who have VT despite antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy.
Refractory cases are treated with left cardiac sympathetic denervation and/or arrhythmia substrate
ablation.
Follow-up typically involves repeated exercise testing, but the predictive value is only moderate.
Patients who are asymptomatic (including relatives identified by genetic testing) should also moderate
their physical activity and receive beta-blocker therapy.
