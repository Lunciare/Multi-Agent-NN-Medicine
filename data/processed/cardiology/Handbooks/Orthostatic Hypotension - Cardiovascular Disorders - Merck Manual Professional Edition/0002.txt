Orthostatic Hypotension

patient moves from supine to a standing position. Various symptoms (eg, fatigue, light-headedness, exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment) and tachycardia occur upon standing; however, there is little or no fall in BP. The reason for symptoms is unclear. Pathophysiology of Orthostatic Hypotension Normally, the gravitational stress of suddenly standing causes blood (½ to 1 L) to pool in the veins of the legs and trunk. The subsequent transient decrease in venous return reduces cardiac output and thus BP. In response, baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus activate autonomic reflexes to rapidly return BP to normal. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and contractility and increases vasomotor tone of the capacitance vessels. Simultaneous parasympathetic (vagal) inhibition also increases heart rate. In most people, changes in BP and heart rate upon standing are minimal and transient, and symptoms do not occur. With continued standing, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) secretion cause sodium and water retention and increase circulating blood volume. Etiology of Orthostatic Hypotension Homeostatic mechanisms may be inadequate to restore low BP if afferent, central, or efferent portions of the autonomic reflex arc are impaired by disorders or medications, if myocardial contractility or vascular
