Orthostatic Hypotension

and severity (eg, whether associated with syncope or falls) of symptoms. The patient is asked about known triggers (eg, medications, bed rest, fluid loss) and the relationship of symptoms to meals. Review of symptoms seeks symptoms of causative disorders, particularly symptoms of autonomic insufficiency such as visual impairment (due to mydriasis and loss of accommodation), incontinence or urinary retention, constipation, heat intolerance (due to impaired sweating), and erectile dysfunction. Other important symptoms include tremor, rigidity, and difficulty walking (Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy); weakness and fatigue (adrenal insufficiency, anemia); and black, tarry stool (gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Other symptoms of neurologic and cardiovascular disorders and cancer are noted. Past medical history should identify known potential causes, including diabetes, Parkinson disease, and cancer (ie, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome). The medication profile should be reviewed for offending prescription medications (see table Causes of Orthostatic Hypotension), particularly antihypertensives and nitrates. A family history of orthostatic symptoms suggests possible familial dysautonomia. Physical examination BP and heart rate are measured after 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes after standing; patients unable to stand may be assessed while sitting upright. Hypotension without a compensatory increase in heart rate (< 10 beats/minute) suggests autonomic impairment. Marked
