Orthostatic Hypotension

only when sodium intake is adequate. Dosage is 0.1 mg orally at bedtime, increased weekly to 1 mg or until peripheral edema occurs. This medication may also improve the peripheral vasoconstrictor response to sympathetic stimulation. Supine hypertension, heart failure, and hypokalemia may occur; potassium supplements may be needed. Midodrine, a peripheral alpha-agonist that is both an arterial and a venous constrictor, is often effective. Dosage is 2.5 mg to 10 mg orally 3 times a day. Adverse effects include paresthesias and itching (probably secondary to piloerection). This medication is not recommended for patients with coronary artery or peripheral arterial disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs—eg, indomethacin 25 to 50 mg orally 3 times a day) may inhibit prostaglandin-induced vasodilation, increasing peripheral vascular resistance. However, NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal symptoms and unwanted vasopressor reactions (reported with concurrent use of indomethacin and sympathomimetic medications). Droxidopa, a norepinephrine precursor, may be beneficial for autonomic dysfunction. Propranolol or other beta-blockers may enhance the beneficial effects of sodium and mineralocorticoid therapy. Beta-blockade with propranolol leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic peripheral vascular vasoconstriction, preventing the vasodilation that occurs when some patients stand. Pyridostigmine (1) and octreotide (2) have been effective in small clinical studies. Geriatrics Essentials: Orthostatic Hypotension
