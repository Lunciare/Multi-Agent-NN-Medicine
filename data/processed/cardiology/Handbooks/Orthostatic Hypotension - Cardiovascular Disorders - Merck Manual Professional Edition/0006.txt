and 3 minutes after standing; patients unable to stand may be assessed while sitting upright. Hypotension without a compensatory increase in heart rate (< 10 beats/minute) suggests autonomic impairment. Marked increase (to > 100 beats/minute or by > 30 beats/minute) suggests hypovolemia or, if symptoms develop without hypotension, POTS. The skin and mucosae are inspected for signs of dehydration and for pigment changes suggestive of Addison disease (eg, hyperpigmented areas, vitiligo). The extent of physical examination is guided by clinical suspicion. A rectal examination is done to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding. A detailed neurologic examination should include evaluation for peripheral neuropathy (eg, abnormalities of strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes). Red flags Certain findings suggest a more serious etiology: Bloody or heme-positive stool Abnormal neurologic examination Interpretation of findings 5/9 In patients with acute symptoms, the most common causes—medications, bed rest, and volume depletion—are often apparent clinically. In patients with chronic symptoms, an important goal is to detect any neurologic disorder causing autonomic dysfunction. Patients with movement abnormalities may have Parkinson disease or multiple system atrophy. Patients with findings of peripheral neuropathy may have an apparent cause (eg, diabetes, alcohol use disorder), but a paraneoplastic syndrome due to an occult
