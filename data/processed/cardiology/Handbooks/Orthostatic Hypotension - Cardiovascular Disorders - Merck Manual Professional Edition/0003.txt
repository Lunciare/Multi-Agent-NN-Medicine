Orthostatic Hypotension
KEYWORDS: symptoms, autonomic, hypotension, orthostatic, patients, orthostatic hypotension, standing, peripheral, heart, causes, sodium, disease, medications, bed, cause

mechanisms may be inadequate to restore low BP if afferent, central, or efferent portions of the autonomic reflex arc are impaired by disorders or medications, if myocardial contractility or vascular responsiveness is depressed, if hypovolemia is present, or if hormonal responses are faulty (see table Causes of Orthostatic Hypotension). Causes differ depending on whether symptoms are acute or chronic. The most common causes of acute orthostatic hypotension include Hypovolemia Medications Prolonged bed rest The most common causes of chronic orthostatic hypotension include Age-related changes in BP regulation Medications Autonomic dysfunction Postprandial orthostatic hypotension is also common. It may be caused by the insulin response to high- carbohydrate meals and blood pooling in the gastrointestinal tract; this condition is worsened by alcohol intake.
