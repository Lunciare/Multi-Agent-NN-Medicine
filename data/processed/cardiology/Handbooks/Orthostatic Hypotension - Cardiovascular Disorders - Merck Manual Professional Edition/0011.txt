unopposed alpha-adrenergic peripheral vascular vasoconstriction, preventing the vasodilation that occurs when some patients stand. Pyridostigmine (1) and octreotide (2) have been effective in small clinical studies. Geriatrics Essentials: Orthostatic Hypotension Orthostatic hypotension occurs in approximately 15 to 20% of older adults (1). It is more common among people with coexisting disorders, especially hypertension, and among residents of long-term care facilities. Many falls may result from unrecognized orthostatic hypotension. The increased incidence in older adults is due to decreased baroreceptor responsiveness plus decreased arterial compliance. Decreased baroreceptor responsiveness delays cardioacceleration and peripheral vasoconstriction in response to standing. Paradoxically, hypertension may contribute to poor baroreceptor sensitivity, increasing vulnerability to orthostatic hypotension. Older adults also have decreased resting parasympathetic tone, so that cardioacceleration due to reflex vagal withdrawal is lessened. Key Points Orthostatic hypotension typically involves volume depletion or autonomic dysfunction. Some degree of autonomic dysfunction is common in older adults, but neurologic disorders must be ruled out. Tilt table testing is sometimes done. Treatment involves physical measures to reduce venous pooling, increased sodium intake, and sometimes fludrocortisone or midodrine.
