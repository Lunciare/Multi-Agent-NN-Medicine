Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension is an excessive fall in blood pressure (BP) when an upright position is assumed. The consensus definition is a drop of > 20 mm Hg systolic, > 10 mm Hg diastolic, or both (1). Symptoms of faintness, light-headedness, dizziness, confusion, or blurred vision occur within seconds to a few minutes of standing and resolve rapidly on lying down. Some patients experience falls, syncope, or even rarely generalized seizures. Exercise or a heavy meal may exacerbate symptoms. Most other associated symptoms and signs relate to the cause. Orthostatic hypotension is a manifestation of abnormal BP regulation due to various conditions, not a specific disorder. Evidence suggests that disorders of postural hemodynamic control increase risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality (2, 3). Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) POTS (also called postural autonomic tachycardia, or chronic or idiopathic orthostatic intolerance) is a syndrome of orthostatic intolerance in younger patients. POTS is defined by a heart rate of ≥ 120 beats/minute or an increase of ≥ 30 beats/minute when a patient moves from supine to a standing position. Various symptoms (eg, fatigue, light-headedness, exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment) and tachycardia occur upon standing; however, there is little or no fall in
