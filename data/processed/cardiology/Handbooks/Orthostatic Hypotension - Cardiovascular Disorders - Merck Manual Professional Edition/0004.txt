Evaluation of Orthostatic Hypotension Orthostatic hypotension is diagnosed when systolic BP drops by ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP drops by ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing. Once orthostatic hypotension is diagnosed, a cause must be 4/9 sought. History History of present illness should identify the duration and severity (eg, whether associated with syncope or falls) of symptoms. The patient is asked about known triggers (eg, medications, bed rest, fluid loss) and the relationship of symptoms to
