Prognosis
For suspected cardiac causes of chest pain, see the separate Cardiac-type chest
pain presenting in primary care article.
There is an urgent need to diagnose the cause of any patient presenting with chest
pain to ensure that serious and life-threatening conditions are not missed. Urgent
hospital referral is indicated if there is any indication of a severe underlying disorder
or of the patient being acutely unwell.

When a patient telephones, acutely unwell with chest pain, arrange a
999/112/911 ambulance in advance of (or instead of) visiting, as any delay in
starting appropriate treatment has an adverse effect on prognosis.
How common is chest pain? (Epidemiology)
Epidemiological studies of chest pain, in particular the risk of pain being cardiac in
nature, vary according to setting. Community-based studies with their undifferenti-
ated populations see high rates of non-cardiac chest pain, whilst studies based in
A&E departments have much higher proportions of cardiac chest pain, as patients
are already self-selected based on the severity of symptoms, or triaged via contact
with their GP, emergency services (999/112/911) or the NHS 111 Service.
Chest pain is a common symptom, accounting for about 1% of GP visits.[1]
Around 40% of patients are referred to secondary care and musculoskeletal pain
is both the most frequent working (26.1%) and final diagnosis (33.1%).[2]
Potentially life-threatening final diagnosis accounts for 8.4% of all chest pain
cases.
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines report that among unselected
patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department, dis-
ease prevalence can be expected to be the following: 5-10% ST-segment eleva-
tion myocardial infarction (STEMI), 15-20% non-STEMI (NSTEMI), 10% unstable
angina, 15% other cardiac conditions, and 50% non-cardiac diseases.[3]
Combined hospital and primary care data produced an incidence of cardiac
chest pain of 6.5 per 1,000 general population per annum.
Population-based questionnaire studies show about 20% of adults reporting
chest pain over the course of a year. This reflects the chronicity of coronary heart
disease but also low consultation rates, particularly in those without a diagnosis
of cardiac disease.
The incidence of chest pain consultations increases with age and is more com-
mon for men.
Differential diagnosis
Cardiac:

Ischaemic: stable angina, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary va-
sospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic
stenosis.
Non-ischaemic: arrhythmias, aortic dissection, mitral valve disease, peri-
carditis.
Respiratory: pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pleurisy, lung
cancer.
Musculoskeletal: costochondritis, Tietze's syndrome, trauma, rib pain (including
fracture, bone metastases, osteoporosis), radicular pain, nonspecific muscu-
loskeletal pain (eg, fibromyalgia).
Breast disease.
Gastrointestinal: GORD, oesophageal rupture, oesophageal spasm, peptic ulcer
disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastritis.
Skin: herpes zoster infection.
Psychological - eg, anxiety, depression, panic disorder.
Others: sickle cell crisis, diabetic mononeuritis, tabes dorsalis.
Assessment
The aim is to exclude a life-threatening cause, which needs immediate treatment,
from other causes of chest pain. Diagnosis of chest pain is difficult but the history of-
ten gives an indication of the underlying cause.
As the patient walks into the consultation room or, when listening carefully over the
telephone, discern general appearance/status, including any confusion, anxiety,
shortness of breath, pain, distress, whether pale or sweaty, and any vomiting. If there
is any suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or other serious cause, or any
concern regarding the patient's general well-being, arrange urgent hospital assess-
ment and admission.
History
Pain: site, radiation, nature (type, frequency, severity), onset, duration, variation
with time, modifying factors (eg, exercise, rest, eating, breathing or medication)
and any previous episodes.

Visceral chest pain:
Originates from deep thoracic structures (heart, blood vessels, oesophagus)
and is often (but not always) described as dull, heavy or aching in nature.
It is transmitted via the autonomic system but may be referred via an adja-
cent somatic nerve - eg, referred cardiac pain felt in the jaw or left arm.
Somatic chest pain arises in the chest wall, pericardium and parietal pleura and
is characteristically sharp in nature and more easily localised (usually
dermatomal).
Associated symptoms may be useful in determining the underlying cause but
may be nonspecific (eg, breathlessness may be associated with a cardiac, mus-
culoskeletal, respiratory or psychological cause):
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting: may suggest a gastrointestinal or cardiac cause
of chest pain, depending on the individual context.
Breathlessness, cough, haemoptysis: may indicate a respiratory or a cardiac
cause of chest pain.
Excessive sweating: may be associated with shock.
Palpitations, dizziness, syncope: increase the likelihood of a cardiac cause
and imply the need for hospital admission - but palpitations may be associ-
ated with anxiety.
Consider the presence of any risk factors for coronary heart disease.
Refer to any previous ECGs for comparison and any previous cardiac investiga-
tions (where available).
Exclude thrombolysis contra-indications if ACS is suspected.
Examination
Vital signs, including blood pressure measurement in both arms.
Detailed cardiovascular and respiratory examinations, looking particularly for
signs of cardiac failure or dysrhythmia.
Chest wall, looking for localised tenderness and evidence of trauma.

Also examine the abdomen (possible gastrointestinal cause), legs (oedema or
possible deep vein thrombosis) and skin (rash).
The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) may be used to rule out a
pulmonary embolism on clinical grounds in selected low-risk patients.type:
embedded-entry-inline id: 6UOQftueJOgSfJ9fQ4tAOv
In patients with a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism (<15%),
meeting all of the following criteria allows the diagnosis to be ruled out:
Age < 50.
Heart rate < 100bpm.
Oxygen saturations on room air > 94%.
No unilateral leg swelling.
No haemoptysis.
No recent surgery or trauma (within the last 4 weeks).
No prior pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis diagnosis.
No oral contraceptive, hormone replacement, or oestrogenic hormone use.
Investigations
Within primary care, non-acute chest pain:
FBC (to exclude anaemia).
Renal function tests and electrolytes.
TFTs.
CRP.
Fasting lipids and glucose.

Resting ECG. Note: a resting ECG is normal in over 90% of patients with recent
symptoms of angina. If an urgent ECG is considered necessary on clinical
grounds, admission to hospital is usually required.
Additional tests if a non-cardiac cause is suspected - eg, CXR, LFTs and amylase,
abdominal ultrasound.
Referral to a rapid access chest pain clinic is now usual for further assessment
and review, if stable angina is suspected.
With acute chest pain, in a hospital setting:
Blood tests: FBC, renal function tests, electrolytes, LFTs, amylase, coagulation
screen, serial cardiac enzymes (troponin I or T). D-dimer testing may be used to
help rule out a pulmonary embolism in patients where it is a diagnostic possibili-
ty, but there is a low pre-test probability.
Serial ECG.
CXR.
Second-line investigations when indicated include echocardiography, angiog-
raphy, exercise testing, myocardial perfusion scan, CT/MRI scan, upper gastroin-
testinal endoscopy, and lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan.
Cardiac chest pain
Cardiac pain is often heavy, pressing and tight. Symptoms that may indicate
ACS include:
Pain in the chest and/or other areas (eg, the arms, back or jaw) lasting
longer than 15 minutes.
Chest pain with nausea and vomiting, marked sweating and/or breathless-
ness, or haemodynamic instability.
New-onset chest pain, or abrupt deterioration in stable angina, with recur-
rent pain occurring frequently with little or no exertion and often lasting
longer than 15 minutes.
Contradictory findings are reported about symptoms that could predict the di-
agnosis or severity of ACS. European guidelines declare that severe or ongoing
chest pain lasting 20 minutes or more is a symptom indicating high risk of ACS,

but ACS pain can be intermittent and appear to 'settle', providing false reassur-
ance.[3]
Response to nitrates or antacids does not prove the diagnosis, as angina and
GORD may appear to be relieved by both.
Non-cardiac chest pain
Consider non-cardiac causes of chest pain, including recent trauma, past med-
ical history and current medications.
Pleuritic pain (pain is aggravated during inspiration and when coughing) may
indicate a respiratory or musculoskeletal cause of pain. Musculoskeletal pain is
usually associated with tenderness of the chest wall.
Gastrointestinal chest pain may be very difficult to distinguish from cardiac
chest pain, especially in patients with oesophageal spasm.
Screen for panic disorder:
A positive screen ('yes' to either question) is highly sensitive for panic disor-
der but should not preclude cardiac testing in patients with risk factors:
'In the past six months, did you ever have a spell or an attack when you
suddenly felt anxious or frightened or very uneasy?'
'In the past six months, did you ever have a spell or an attack when for no
apparent reason your heart suddenly began to race, you felt faint or you
couldn't catch your breath?'
Management of chest pain
Management will be dependent on diagnosis.
See the separate articles on Stable angina, Acute coronary syndrome and Acute
myocardial infarction.
Psychological treatment may be helpful with some patients.
Prognosis
There is a 3% increased mortality rate in the year following consulting a GP re-
garding the onset of chest pain compared with a control group with no chest
pain, the excess being primarily due to cardiovascular disease.

Once a cardiac cause for chest pain is excluded, further investigation is often
curtailed and many patients continue to experience undiagnosed chest pain,
which carries significant psychological morbidity.
