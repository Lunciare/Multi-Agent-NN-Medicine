Fatigue that worsens with activity and lessens with rest suggests a general medical condition. Fatigue that is present constantly and does not lessen with rest, particularly with occasional bursts of energy, may indicate a mental health condition. In the absence of red flag findings, a thorough history, physical examination, and routine laboratory testing (plus tests directed at specific findings—see table Interpretation of Selected Findings in Evaluating Fatigue) should suffice for an initial evaluation. If test results are negative, watchful waiting is usually appropriate; if fatigue worsens or other symptoms and signs develop, the patient is reevaluated. Several causes can be considered for patients with prolonged or chronic fatigue and selected other common or specific clinical findings.
