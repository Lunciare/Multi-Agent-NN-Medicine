symptoms, including: Weakness, a symptom of nervous system or muscle disorders, is the insufficient force of muscular contraction at maximum effort. Disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Eaton- Lambert syndrome can cause weakness simulating fatigue. Dyspnea on exertion, an early symptom of cardiac and pulmonary disorders, can decrease exercise tolerance, simulating fatigue. Respiratory symptoms can usually be elicited by taking a careful history. Somnolence, a symptom of disorders causing sleep deprivation (eg, allergic rhinitis, esophageal reflux, painful musculoskeletal disorders, sleep apnea, severe chronic disorders), is an unusually strong desire to sleep. Yawning and lapsing into sleep during daytime hours are common. Patients can usually tell the difference between somnolence and fatigue. However, deprivation of deep nonrapid eye movement sleep can cause muscle aches and fatigue, and many patients with fatigue have disturbed sleep, so differentiating between fatigue and somnolence may be difficult. Etiology of Fatigue Most serious (and many minor) acute and chronic illnesses produce fatigue. However, many of these have other more prominent manifestations (eg, pain, cough, fever, jaundice) as the presenting complaint. This discussion focuses on disorders that can manifest primarily as fatigue (1). The most common disorders manifesting predominantly as recent fatigue (lasting < 1 month) are
