Fatigue

Fatigue is a common symptom. Fatigue caused primarily by a general medical condition usually increases with activity and lessens with rest. Laboratory testing is low yield in the absence of suggestive clinical findings. Successful treatment of chronic fatigue is more likely if the health care professional is patient and understanding.
