Evaluation of Fatigue Fatigue can be highly subjective. Patients vary in what they consider to be fatigue and how they describe it, and there are few ways to objectively confirm fatigue or tell how severe it is. History and physical examination focus on identifying subtle manifestations of underlying illness (particularly infections, endocrine and rheumatologic disorders, anemia, and depression) that can be used to guide testing. History History of present illness includes open-ended questions about what "fatigue" is and listening for descriptions that could suggest dyspnea on exertion, somnolence, or muscle weakness. The relationships between fatigue, activity, rest, and sleep should be elicited, as should the onset, time course and pattern, and factors that increase or decrease fatigue. Review of systems should be thorough because potential causes of fatigue are so numerous and diverse.
