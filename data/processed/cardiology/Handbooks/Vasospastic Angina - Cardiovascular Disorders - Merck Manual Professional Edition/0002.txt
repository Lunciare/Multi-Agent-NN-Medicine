Vasospastic Angina

which may precipitate coronary artery spasm. Coronary artery spasm is identified by finding significant ST-segment elevation on ECG or by observation of a reversible spasm during cardiac catheterization. Testing is done most commonly in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Treatment of Vasospastic Angina Calcium channel blockers Sublingual nitroglycerin Usually, sublingual nitroglycerin promptly relieves vasospastic angina. Calcium channel blockers may effectively prevent symptoms. Theoretically, beta-blockers (other than labetalol and carvedilol) may exacerbate spasm by allowing unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction, but this effect has not been proven clinically. Oral medications most commonly used are calcium channel blockers: Sustained-release diltiazem Sustained-release verapamil Amlodipine Although all these medications relieve symptoms, they do not appear to alter prognosis. Average survival at 5 years is approximately 95% (if obstruction is absent or present in only one vessel), but mortality risk is greater for patients with both vasospastic angina and atherosclerotic coronary artery obstruction (1, 2). Risk increases with increasing obstruction.
