Overview
Echocardiography
• Echocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your
heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape. There are
several types of echo, including stress echo.
• Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of
coronary heart disease. Another type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo,
or TEE.
• TEE provides a view of the back of the heart. For this test, a sound wave wand is put on the
end of a special tube. The tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the
passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the
heart,
