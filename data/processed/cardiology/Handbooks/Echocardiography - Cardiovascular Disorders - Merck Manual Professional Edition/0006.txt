Echocardiography

ischemia during stress testing. Three-dimensional echocardiography is increasingly used; special transducers can obtain a real-time, 3- dimensional image of cardiac structures. Three-dimensional echocardiography is particularly useful in evaluating the mitral valve apparatus for surgical correction. It is also increasingly being used to quantify right ventricular volumes, because the crescent shape of the right ventricle limits evaluation by 2- dimensional echocardiography, and during interventional procedures such as transcatheter edge-to- edge repair of the mitral valve. Use of 3-d imensional echocardiography continues to evolve. Stress echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography is an alternative to radionuclide imaging to identify myocardial ischemia during and after exercise or pharmacologic stress testing. Stress echocardiography shows regional wall motion abnormalities that result from an imbalance in blood flow in epicardial coronary vessels during stress. Computer programs can provide side-by-side assessment of ventricular contraction during systole and diastole at rest and under stress. Exercise and pharmacologic protocols are the same as those used in radionuclide stress testing, except that dobutamine is used rather than dipyridamole as the pharmacologic agent in the United States. Stress echocardiography is valuable in evaluating the hemodynamic severity of aortic valve stenosis in patients with significant symptoms but whose resting transvalvular pressure gradient is not markedly
