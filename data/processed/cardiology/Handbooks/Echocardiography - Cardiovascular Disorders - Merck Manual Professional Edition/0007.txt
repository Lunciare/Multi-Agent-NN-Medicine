the United States. Stress echocardiography is valuable in evaluating the hemodynamic severity of aortic valve stenosis in patients with significant symptoms but whose resting transvalvular pressure gradient is not markedly high. Stress echocardiography and radionuclide stress testing detect ischemia equally well. The choice between tests is often based on availability, the provider’s experience, and cost. Evidence of high left ventricular filling pressures during exercise, including elevated E/e' ratio (ratio of transmitral flow to mitral annular velocity) or elevated tricuspid regurgitant velocity, can be used to diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or dynamic valvular disease such as mitral regurgitation.
