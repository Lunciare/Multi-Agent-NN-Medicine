An estimated 1 to 3/100,000 apparently healthy young athletes die suddenly during exercise. Males are affected up to 10 times more often than females. Basketball and football players in the United States and soccer players in Europe may be at highest risk (1). In young athletes, sudden cardiac death has many causes (see table Some Causes of Sudden Cardiovascular Death in Young Athletes). The most common cause of sudden cardiac death was thought to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More recent studies suggest that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy accounts for a lower proportion of sudden cardiac deaths and that the majority of sudden cardiac deaths occur in patients whose hearts are found to be structurally normal during autopsy (2, 3).
