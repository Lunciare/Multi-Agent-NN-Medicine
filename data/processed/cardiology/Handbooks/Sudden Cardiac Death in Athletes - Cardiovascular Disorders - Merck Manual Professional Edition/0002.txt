Sudden Cardiac Death in Athletes

repolarization. Other causes include inherited arrhythmia syndromes (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome). Some young athletes die of aortic aneurysm rupture (in Marfan syndrome). In older athletes, sudden cardiac death is typically caused by Coronary artery disease Occasionally, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or valvular disease is involved. In other conditions underlying sudden death in athletes (eg, asthma, heatstroke, complications related to use of illicit or performance-enhancing drugs), ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is a terminal, not a primary, event. Symptoms and signs are those of cardiovascular collapse; diagnosis is obvious. Immediate treatment with advanced cardiac life support is successful in < 20%; the percentage may increase as distribution of community-based, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) expands. Studies have demonstrated that the presence of AEDs can increase the neurologically intact survival rates to over 80% (4). For survivors, treatment is management of the underlying condition. In some cases, an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator may ultimately be required. Some Causes of Sudden Cardiovascular Death in Young Athletes Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Commotio cordis Coronary artery anomalies (eg, anomalous left main coronary artery origin, anomalous right coronary artery origin, coronary arterial hypoplasia) Myocarditis Ruptured aortic aneurysm Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Tunneled left anterior descending coronary artery Aortic stenosis Premature atherosclerotic
