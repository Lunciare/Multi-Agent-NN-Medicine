main coronary artery origin, anomalous right coronary artery origin, coronary arterial hypoplasia) Myocarditis Ruptured aortic aneurysm Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Tunneled left anterior descending coronary artery Aortic stenosis Premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease Dilated cardiomyopathy Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve Long QT syndrome Brugada syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (anterograde conduction only) Catecholaminergic polymorphic tachycardia Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia Coronary vasospasm Cardiac sarcoidosis Cardiac trauma Ruptured cerebral artery aneurysm Key Points Sudden cardiac death during exercise is rare and may be due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but many patients have a structurally normal heart at autopsy (typically younger athletes) or coronary artery disease (older athletes).
