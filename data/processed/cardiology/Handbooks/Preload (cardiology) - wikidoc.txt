Synonyms and keywords: filling pressure

Preload increases with exercise (slightly), increasing blood volume (overtransfusion) and
excitement (sympathetics).
Factors & conditions increased ventricular filling and therefore preload
1.Increased central venous pressure (CVP) that can result from decreased venous compliance (e.g.,
caused by sympathetic venoconstriction) or increased thoracic blood volume.
The latter can be increased by either increased total blood volume or by venous return augmented
by increased respiratory activity, increased skeletal muscle pump activity, or gravity (e.g., head-
down tilt).
2.Increased ventricular compliance, which results in a greater expansion of the chamber during
filling at a given filling pressure.
3.Increased atrial force of contraction resulting from sympathetic stimulation of the atria or from
increased filling of the atria and therefore increased atrial contractile force through the Frank-
Starling mechanism.
4.Reduced heart rate, which increases ventricular filling time.
5.Increased aortic pressure, which increases the afterload on the ventricle, reduces stroke volume
by increasing end-systolic volume, and leads to a secondary increase in preload.
6.Pathological conditions such as ventricular systolic failure and valve defects such as aortic
stenosis, aortic regurgitation (pulmonary valve stenosis and regurgitation have similar effects on
right ventricular preload).
Factors & conditions decreased preload
1.Decreased venous blood pressure, most commonly resulting from reduced blood volume (e.g.,
hemorrhage) or gravity causing blood to pool in the lower limbs when standing upright.
2.Impaired atrial contraction that can result from atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
3.Increased heart rate (e.g., atrial tachycardia), which reduces ventricular filling time.
4.Decreased ventricular afterload, which enhances forward flow (i.e., ejection) thereby reducing
end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume secondarily.
5.Ventricular diastolic failure (decreased ventricular compliance) caused, for example, by
ventricular hypertrophy or impaired relaxation (lusitropy).
6.Inflow (mitral and tricuspid) valve stenosis, which reduces ventricular filling.
