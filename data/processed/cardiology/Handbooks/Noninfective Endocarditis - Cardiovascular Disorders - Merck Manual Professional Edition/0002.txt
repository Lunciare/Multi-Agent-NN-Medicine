Noninfective Endocarditis

injure the tricuspid and pulmonic valves, resulting in platelet and fibrin attachment at the site of injury. In disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), circulating immune complexes may result in friable platelet and fibrin vegetations along a valve leaflet closure (Libman-Sacks lesions). These lesions do not usually cause significant valvular obstruction or regurgitation. Antiphospholipid syndrome (lupus anticoagulants, recurrent venous thrombosis, stroke, spontaneous abortions, livedo reticularis) also can lead to sterile endocardial vegetations and systemic emboli. Rarely, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, HIV infection, or COVID-19 leads to noninfective endocarditis. Marantic endocarditis In patients with chronic wasting diseases, disseminated intravascular coagulation, mucin-producing metastatic carcinomas (eg, of lung, stomach, or pancreas), or chronic infections (eg, tuberculosis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis), large thrombotic vegetations may form on valves and produce significant emboli to the brain, kidneys, spleen, mesentery, extremities, and coronary arteries. These vegetations tend to form on congenitally abnormal cardiac valves or those damaged by rheumatic fever. Half of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation have noninfective endocarditis, suggesting a relationship between the conditions. Symptoms and Signs of Noninfective Endocarditis Vegetations themselves rarely cause symptoms unless their size and location cause valvular dysfunction, sometimes leading to dyspnea and/or palpitations. Symptoms result from embolization and depend on
