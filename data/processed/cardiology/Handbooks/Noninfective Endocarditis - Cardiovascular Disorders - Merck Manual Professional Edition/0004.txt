Noninfective Endocarditis

Anticoagulation Management of the underlying condition Rarely surgery Unless brain imaging finds a lesion prone to hemorrhagic transformation, treatment consists of indefinite anticoagulation with heparin (either intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous low molecular weight) (1). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and warfarin are not regarded as effective, although no comparative trials have been undertaken in this rare condition (2). Predisposing disorders should be treated whenever possible. Cardiac surgery (eg. vegetation excision, valve replacement) may be considered in cases where there is significant valvular dysfunction causing hemodynamic instability or recurrent embolic events despite optimal medical therapy. Prognosis for Noninfective Endocarditis Prognosis is generally poor, more because of the seriousness of predisposing disorders than the cardiac lesion. Key Points Noninfective endocarditis is much less common than infective endocarditis. Sterile vegetations form on heart valves in response to factors such as trauma, circulating immune complexes, vasculitis, or a hypercoagulable state. The sterile vegetations can embolize or become infected but rarely impair valvular or cardiac function. Evaluation is with echocardiography and exclusion of infective endocarditis using blood cultures. Prognosis depends mainly on the underlying disorder, which is often a serious illness. Treatment is usually with anticoagulation.
