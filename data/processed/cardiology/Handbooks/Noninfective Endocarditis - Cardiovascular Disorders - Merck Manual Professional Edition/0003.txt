Signs of Noninfective Endocarditis Vegetations themselves rarely cause symptoms unless their size and location cause valvular dysfunction, sometimes leading to dyspnea and/or palpitations. Symptoms result from embolization and depend on the organ affected (eg, brain, kidneys, spleen, digits). Fever and a heart murmur are sometimes present. Diagnosis of Noninfective Endocarditis Blood cultures Echocardiography Noninfective endocarditis should be suspected when patients who are chronically ill develop symptoms suggesting arterial embolism. Serial blood cultures and echocardiography should be done. Negative blood cultures and the presence of valvular vegetations (but not atrial myxoma) suggest the diagnosis. Examination of embolic fragments after embolectomy can help make the diagnosis. Differentiation from culture-negative infective endocarditis may be difficult but is important. Anticoagulation is often needed in noninfective endocarditis but is avoided in infective endocarditis unless there is a pre-existing requirement such as a mechanical valve. Assays for hypercoagulability, antinuclear antibodies, and antiphospholipid syndrome should be done to evaluate for causes of true noninfective endocarditis. Brain imaging is done to help guide treatment. Treatment of Noninfective Endocarditis Anticoagulation Management of the underlying condition Rarely surgery Unless brain imaging finds a lesion prone to hemorrhagic transformation, treatment consists of indefinite anticoagulation with heparin (either intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous
