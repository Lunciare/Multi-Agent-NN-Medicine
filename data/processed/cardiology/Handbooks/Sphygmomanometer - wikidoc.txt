Sphygmomanometer

at which this sound began is noted and recorded as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is
further released until the sound can no longer be heard and this is recorded as the diastolic blood
pressure.
Significance
The peak pressure in the arteries during the cardiac cycle is the systolic pressure, and the lowest
pressure (at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle) is the diastolic pressure.
Types
There are two types:
1. • Digital (electronic, easy to operate and practical in noisy environment. Many have not been
validated for all patient groups, and can give very inaccurate readings).They measure mean
arterial pressure, MAP, and use algorithms to calculate systolic and diastolic values. In this
sense, they do not actually measure the blood pressure, but derive the readings. Digital
oscillometric monitors are also confronted with “special conditions” for which they are not
designed to be used : arteriosclerosis, arrhythmia, preeclampsia, pulsus alternans, and pulsus
paradoxus.
2. • Manual (older fashioned, though more precise). Must be operated by a trained person.
Mercury manometers are considered to be the "Gold Standard" of measurement because they do
not go out of calibration. For this reason they are often required in clinical trials of
pharmaceuticals and for clinical evaluations of determining blood pressure for high risk patients
including pregnant women. Aneroid, mechanical, types are in common use, but should be checked
against a mercury manometer if they are suspected to be out of calibration.
