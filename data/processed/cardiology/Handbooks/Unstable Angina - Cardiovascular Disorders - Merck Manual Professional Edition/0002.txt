Unstable Angina

is clinically unstable and often a prelude to myocardial infarction or arrhythmias or, less commonly, to sudden death. Symptoms and Signs of Unstable Angina Patients have symptoms of angina pectoris (typically chest pain or discomfort) except that the pain or discomfort of unstable angina usually is more intense, lasts longer, is precipitated by less exertion, occurs spontaneously at rest, is progressive (crescendo) in nature, or involves any combination of these features. Unstable angina is classified based on severity and clinical situation (see table Canadian Cardiovascular Classification System for Angina Pectoris). Also considered are whether unstable angina occurs during treatment for chronic stable angina and whether transient changes in ST-T waves occur during angina. If angina has occurred within 48 hours and no contributory extracardiac condition is present, troponin levels may be measured to help estimate prognosis; troponin-negative results indicate a better prognosis than troponin-positive. Diagnosis of Unstable Angina Serial ECGs Serial cardiac biomarkers Immediate coronary angiography for patients with complications (eg, persistent chest pain, hypotension, unstable arrhythmias) Delayed angiography (24 to 48 hours) for stable patients (See figure Approach to Unstable Angina.) Evaluation begins with initial and serial ECG and serial measurements of cardiac biomarkers to help distinguish between unstable
