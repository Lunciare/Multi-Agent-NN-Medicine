Unstable Angina

influences prognosis; the presence of significant left ventricular dysfunction (even with 1- or 2-vessel disease) warrants a lower threshold for revascularization. Overall, a substantial proportion of patients with unstable angina have a myocardial infarction within 3 months of onset; sudden death is less common (see table Risk of Adverse Events at 14 Days in Unstable Angina or NSTEMI). Marked ECG changes with chest pain indicate higher risk of subsequent MI or death. Unstable Angina Outcome Prediction Key Points Unstable angina is new, worsening, or rest angina in patients whose cardiac biomarkers do not meet criteria for myocardial infarction. Symptoms of unstable angina include new or worsening chest pain or chest pain occurring at rest. Diagnosis is based on serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers. Immediate treatment includes oxygen, antianginals, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants. For patients with ongoing symptoms, hypotension, or sustained arrhythmias, do immediate angiography. For stable patients, do angiography within 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization. Following recovery, initiate or continue antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins.
