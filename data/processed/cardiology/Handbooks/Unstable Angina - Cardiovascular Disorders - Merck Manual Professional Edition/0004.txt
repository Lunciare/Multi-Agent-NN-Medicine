Unstable Angina

are done at presentation and 6 hours later. Creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) is not elevated in unstable angina. Cardiac troponin, particularly when measured using high-sensitivity troponin tests, may be slightly increased but does not meet the criteria for myocardial infarction (above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit or URL). Coronary angiography Patients with unstable angina whose symptoms have resolved typically undergo angiography within the first 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization to detect lesions that may require treatment. Coronary angiography most often combines diagnosis with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI—ie, angioplasty, stent placement). After initial evaluation and therapy, coronary angiography may be used in patients with evidence of ongoing ischemia (ECG findings or symptoms), hemodynamic instability, recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and other abnormalities that suggest recurrence of ischemic events. Treatment of Unstable Angina Prehospital care: Oxygen, aspirin, nitrates, and triage to an appropriate medical center Pharmacologic therapy: Antiplatelet agents, antianginal drugs, anticoagulants, and in some cases other medications Angiography to assess coronary artery anatomy Reperfusion therapy: Percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery Post-discharge rehabilitation and chronic medical management of coronary artery disease Prehospital care Oxygen Aspirin Nitrates Triage to appropriate medical center A reliable IV route must
