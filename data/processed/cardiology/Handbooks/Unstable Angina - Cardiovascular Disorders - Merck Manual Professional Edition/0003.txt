to 48 hours) for stable patients (See figure Approach to Unstable Angina.) Evaluation begins with initial and serial ECG and serial measurements of cardiac biomarkers to help distinguish between unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction (MI)—either non–ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) or ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). This distinction is the center of the decision pathway because fibrinolytics benefit patients with STEMI but not those with NSTEMI and unstable angina. Also, urgent cardiac catheterization is indicated for patients with acute STEMI but not generally for those with NSTEMI or unstable angina. ECG ECG is the most important test and should be done as soon as possible (eg, within 10 minutes of presentation) ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation, or T-wave inversion may occur during unstable angina but are transient. CLINICAL CALCULATORS M.I. Prediction Decision TreeCalc Cardiac biomarkers Patients suspected of having unstable angina should have a highly sensitive assay of cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) done on presentation and 2 to 3 hours later. If a standard Tn assay is used, measurements are done at presentation and 6 hours later. Creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) is not elevated in unstable angina. Cardiac troponin, particularly when measured using high-sensitivity troponin tests, may be
