(see figure Approach to Unstable Angina). Approach to Unstable Angina * Morphine should be used judiciously (eg, if nitroglycerin is contraindicated or if the patient has symptoms despite nitroglycerin therapy). Data suggest that morphine attenuates activity of some P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and may contribute to worse patient outcomes. † Complicated means that the hospital course was complicated by recurrent angina or infarction, heart failure, or sustained recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Absence of any of these events is termed uncomplicated. ‡ CABG is still generally preferred to PCI for patients with the following: Left main or left main equivalent disease Left ventricular dysfunction Diabetes Also, lesions that are long or near bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI. CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; GP = glycoprotein; NSTEMI = non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Pharmacologic treatment of unstable angina All patients should be given antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and if chest pain is present, antianginals. The specific medications used depend on the reperfusion strategy and other factors; their selection and use is discussed in Medications for Acute Coronary Syndrome. Other medications, such as beta- blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins, should
