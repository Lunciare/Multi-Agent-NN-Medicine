reperfusion strategy and other factors; their selection and use is discussed in Medications for Acute Coronary Syndrome. Other medications, such as beta- blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins, should be initiated during admission (see table Medications for Coronary Artery Disease). Patients with unstable angina should be given the following (unless contraindicated) Antiplatelet agents: Aspirin, clopidogrel, or both (prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel) Anticoagulants: A heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) or bivalirudin Sometimes a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor when PCI is done Antianginal therapy, usually nitroglycerin Beta-blocker Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor Statin All patients are given aspirin 160 to 325 mg (not enteric-coated), if not contraindicated, at presentation and 81 mg once a day indefinitely thereafter. Chewing the first dose before swallowing quickens absorption. Aspirin reduces short- and long-term mortality risk (2). In patients undergoing PCI, a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 to 600 mg orally once), prasugrel (60 mg orally once), or ticagrelor (180 mg orally once) improves outcomes. For urgent PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are more rapid in onset and may be preferred. Either a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin, or bivalirudin is given routinely to patients with unstable angina unless contraindicated (eg,
