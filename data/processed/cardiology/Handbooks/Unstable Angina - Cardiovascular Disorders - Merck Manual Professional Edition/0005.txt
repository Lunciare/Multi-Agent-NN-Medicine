or coronary artery bypass surgery Post-discharge rehabilitation and chronic medical management of coronary artery disease Prehospital care Oxygen Aspirin Nitrates Triage to appropriate medical center A reliable IV route must be established, oxygen given (typically 2 L by nasal cannula) if patients are hypoxemic, and continuous single-lead ECG monitoring started. Prehospital interventions by emergency medical personnel (including ECG, chewed aspirin [160 to 325 mg], pain management with nitrates) can reduce risk of mortality and complications (1). Early diagnostic data and response to treatment can help determine the need for and timing of revascularization. Hospital admission Risk-stratify patient and choose timing of reperfusion strategy Pharmacologic therapy with antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and other medications based on reperfusion strategy On arrival to the emergency department, the patient's diagnosis is confirmed. Pharmacologic therapy and timing of revascularization depend on the clinical picture. In clinically unstable patients (patients with ongoing symptoms, hypotension or sustained arrhythmias), urgent angiography with revascularization is indicated. In clinically stable patients, angiography with revascularization may be deferred for 24 to 48 hours (see figure Approach to Unstable Angina). Approach to Unstable Angina * Morphine should be used judiciously (eg, if nitroglycerin is contraindicated or if the patient has symptoms despite nitroglycerin therapy).
