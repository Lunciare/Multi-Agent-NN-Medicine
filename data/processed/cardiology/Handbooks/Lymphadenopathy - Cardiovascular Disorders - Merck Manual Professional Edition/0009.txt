In other cases, findings (such as the red flag findings) are of concern but do not point to a single cause. Cervical or inguinal nodes that are hard, markedly enlarged (> 2 cm—[1]), and/or fixed to adjacent tissue are concerning for cancer, particularly in patients who have had prolonged use of tobacco and/or alcohol. However, any palpable supraclavicular or axillary node not ascribable to infection regardless of size, should prompt concern about possible intrathoracic or breast cancer. Marked tenderness, erythema, and warmth in a single enlarged node may be due to a suppurative node infection (eg, due to staphylococcus or streptococcus). Fever may occur with many of the infectious, malignant, and systemic rheumatic disorders. Splenomegaly can occur with mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, leukemia, and lymphoma. Weight loss occurs with TB and cancer. Risk factors and travel and exposure history are at best suggestive. Finally, adenopathy can have a serious cause in patients who have no other manifestations of illness. Testing If a specific disorder is suspected (eg, mononucleosis in a young patient
