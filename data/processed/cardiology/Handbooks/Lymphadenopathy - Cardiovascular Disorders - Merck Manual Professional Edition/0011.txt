or generalized adenopathy and no other findings can safely be observed for 3 to 4 weeks, unless cancer is suspected. If cancer is suspected, patients typically require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the area as clinically indicated and, depending on the findings, should have biopsy of the node and any abnormal tissue. Biopsy is also considered if isolated or generalized adenopathy does not resolve in 3 to 4 weeks (2). Treatment of Lymphadenopathy Primary treatment is directed at the cause; adenopathy itself is not treated. A trial of corticosteroids is not done for adenopathy of unknown etiology because corticosteroids can reduce adenopathy caused by leukemia and lymphoma and thus delay diagnosis, and corticosteroids can exacerbate TB. A trial of antibiotics is also not indicated, except when a suppurative lymph node infection is suspected. Key Points Most cases are idiopathic and self limited or result from clinically apparent local causes. Initial testing should be done if there are red flag findings, if other manifestations or risk factors suggest a specific disorder, or when generalized adenopathy has no apparent cause. Patients with newly identified localized or generalized lymphadenopathy and no other diagnostic findings can be observed for 3
