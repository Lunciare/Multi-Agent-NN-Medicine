central venous circulation, removing cells and other material. The filtering process also presents antigens to the lymphocytes contained within the nodes. The immune response from these lymphocytes involves cellular proliferation, which can cause the nodes to enlarge (reactive lymphadenopathy). Pathogenic microorganisms carried in the lymphatic fluid can directly infect the nodes, causing lymphadenitis, and cancer cells may lodge in and proliferate in the nodes. Etiology of Lymphadenopathy Because lymph nodes participate in the body's immune response, a large number of infectious and inflammatory disorders and cancers are potential causes (see table Some Causes of Lymphadenopathy). Only the more common causes are discussed here. Causes most likely vary depending on patient age, associated findings, and risk factors, but overall the most common causes are Idiopathic, self-limited Upper respiratory infections (URI) Local soft-tissue infections The most dangerous causes are Cancer HIV infection Tuberculosis (TB) However, most cases represent benign disorders or clinically obvious local infections. Approximately 1% of undifferentiated cases presenting for primary care involve cancer (1).
