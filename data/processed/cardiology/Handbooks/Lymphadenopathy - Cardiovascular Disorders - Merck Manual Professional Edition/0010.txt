Lymphadenopathy

suggestive. Finally, adenopathy can have a serious cause in patients who have no other manifestations of illness. Testing If a specific disorder is suspected (eg, mononucleosis in a young patient with fever, sore throat, and splenomegaly), initial testing is directed at clinically indicated tests for that condition (see table Some Causes of Lymphadenopathy). If history and physical examination do not show a likely cause, further evaluation depends on the nodes involved and the other findings present. Patients with unexplained red flag findings and those with generalized adenopathy should have a complete blood count (CBC) and chest radiograph. If abnormal white blood cells are seen on CBC, a peripheral smear and flow cytometry are done to evaluate for leukemia or lymphoma. For generalized adenopathy, most clinicians usually also do a tuberculin skin test (or interferon-gamma release assay) and serologic tests for HIV, mononucleosis, and perhaps toxoplasmosis and syphilis. Patients with joint symptoms or rash should have antinuclear antibody testing for systemic lupus erythematosus. Most clinicians believe patients with newly identified localized or generalized adenopathy and no other findings can safely be observed for 3 to 4 weeks, unless cancer is suspected. If cancer is suspected, patients typically require computed tomography (CT)
