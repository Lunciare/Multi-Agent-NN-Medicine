Lymphadenopathy is palpable enlargement of ≥ 1 lymph nodes. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is of the causative disorder. (See also Overview of the Lymphatic System.) Lymph nodes are present throughout the body and may be superficial or deep. Particular collections of superficial lymph nodes are present in the neck, axillae, and inguinal region; a few small (< 1 cm) nodes often are palpable in those areas in healthy people. Lymphadenopathy is palpable enlargement (> 1 cm) of ≥ 1 lymph nodes; it is categorized as Localized: When present in only 1 body area Generalized: When present in ≥ 2 body areas Lymphadenitis is lymphadenopathy with pain and/or signs of inflammation (eg, erythema [more subtle on dark skin], tenderness). Other symptoms may be present depending on the underlying disorder. Pathophysiology of Lymphadenopathy Some plasma and cells (eg, cancer cells, infectious microorganisms) in the interstitial space, along with certain cellular material, antigens, and foreign particles enter lymphatic vessels, becoming lymphatic fluid. Lymph nodes filter the lymphatic fluid on its way to the central venous circulation, removing cells and other material. The filtering process also presents antigens to the lymphocytes contained within the nodes. The immune response from these lymphocytes involves cellular proliferation,
