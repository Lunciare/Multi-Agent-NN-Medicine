Genital lesions or discharge (herpes simplex, chlamydia, syphilis) Joint pain and/or swelling (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] or other systemic rheumatic disorders) Easy bleeding and/or bruising (leukemia) Dry, irritated eyes (Sjögren syndrome) Past medical history should identify risk factors for (or known) TB or HIV infection, and cancer (particularly use of alcohol and/or tobacco). Patients are queried about contacts who are ill (to assess risk of TB or viral illnesses, such as Epstein-Barr virus), sexual history (to assess risk of sexually transmitted infections), travel history to areas of endemic infections (eg, Middle East for brucellosis, American Southwest for plague) and possible exposures (eg, cat feces for toxoplasmosis, farm animals for brucellosis, wild animals for tularemia). Medication history is reviewed for specific known causative agents. 6/9 Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever. Areas of particular lymph node concentration in the neck (including occipital and supraclavicular areas), axillae, and inguinal region are palpated. Node size, tenderness, and consistency are noted as well as whether the nodes are freely mobile or fixed to adjacent tissue. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Cervical Lymphadenopathy) Skin is inspected for rash and lesions, with particular attention to areas drained by the affected nodes. The oropharynx is inspected and palpated
