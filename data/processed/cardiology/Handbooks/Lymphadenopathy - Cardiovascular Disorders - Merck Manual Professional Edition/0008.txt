to adjacent tissue. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Cervical Lymphadenopathy) Skin is inspected for rash and lesions, with particular attention to areas drained by the affected nodes. The oropharynx is inspected and palpated for signs of infection and any lesions that may be cancerous. The thyroid gland is palpated for enlargement and nodularity. Breasts (including in males) are palpated for lumps. Lungs are auscultated for crackles (suggesting sarcoidosis or infection). Abdomen is palpated for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Genitals are examined for chancres, vesicles, and other lesions, and for urethral discharge. Joints are examined for signs of inflammation.

However, patients with localized adenopathy may have a local or systemic disorder (including one that often causes generalized adenopathy). 7/9 Sometimes, history and physical examination suggest a cause (see table Some Causes of Lymphadenopathy) and may be diagnostic in patients with a clear viral upper respiratory infection or with local soft-tissue or dental infection.
