A thoracic aortic diameter ≥ 50% larger than normal is considered an aneurysm (normal diameter varies by location). Most thoracic aortic aneurysms do not cause symptoms, although some patients have chest or back pain; other symptoms and signs are usually the result of complications (eg, dissection, compression of adjacent structures, thromboembolism, rupture). Risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm. Diagnosis is made by CT angiography or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Treatment is endovascular stent grafting or surgery. Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) are abnormal dilatations of the aorta above the diaphragm. TAAs account for one-fourth of aortic aneurysms. Males and females are affected equally. Locations of TAAs (1) include Ascending thoracic aorta (between the aortic root and brachiocephalic, or innominate, artery): 46% Aortic arch (including the brachiocephalic, carotid, and subclavian arteries): 21% Descending thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery): 35% Complications Complications of TAAs include Aortic dissection Compression or erosion into adjacent structures Leak or rupture Thromboembolism Aneurysms of the ascending aorta sometimes affect the aortic root, causing aortic valve regurgitation, or occlusion of the coronary arterial ostia, causing angina, myocardial infarction, or syncope. Etiology of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Most thoracic aortic aneurysms result from Atherosclerosis
