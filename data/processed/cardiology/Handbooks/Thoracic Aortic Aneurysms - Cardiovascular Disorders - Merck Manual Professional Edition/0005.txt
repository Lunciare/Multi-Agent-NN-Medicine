Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms

echocardiography (TEE) Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually first suspected when a chest radiograph incidentally shows a widened mediastinum or enlargement of the aortic knob. However, chest radiography has poor sensitivity for TAA and is not a reliable diagnostic tool (eg, in patients with chest pain and suspected aortic aneurysm). Chest radiograph abnormalities or symptoms and signs suggesting an aneurysm should be followed up with a cross-sectional imaging test; choice among these tests is based on availability and local experience (1). If rupture is suspected, TEE (for ascending dissection) or CTA, depending on availability, should be done immediately. Chest CTA can delineate aneurysm size and proximal or distal extent, detect leakage, and identify coincidental pathology. MRA may provide similar detail. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can delineate aneurysm size and extent and detect leakage of aneurysms of the ascending but not descending aorta. TEE cannot show the entire thoracic aorta, but it can be extremely useful in detecting the entry point in aortic dissection. Contrast angiography provides the best image of the arterial lumen, but it is not the preferred imaging study. It gives no information on extraluminal structures (ie, as an alternative diagnosis), it is invasive, and it has a significant risk
