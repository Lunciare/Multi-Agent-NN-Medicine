Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms

Aneurysms Thoracic abdominal aneurysms enlarge an average of 3 to 5 mm/year. Risk factors for rapid enlargement include larger size of aneurysm, location in the descending aorta, and presence of mural thrombi. The risk of rupture appears to rise abruptly as TAAs reach 6 cm in diameter. Median diameter at aneurysm rupture is approximately 6 cm for ascending aneurysms and 7 cm for descending aneurysms (1, 2); smaller aneurysms also may rupture, especially in patients with connective tissue disorders or saccular aneurysms. Survival rate of patients with untreated large TAAs is 25% at 2 years. TAA rupture has a mortality of 97% (3). Key Points Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a ≥ 50% increase in diameter of the thoracic aorta. TAAs may dissect, compress, or erode into adjacent structures, cause thromboembolism, leak, or rupture. Median diameter at aneurysm rupture is 6 cm for ascending aneurysms and 7 cm for descending aneurysms. Diagnosis is often first suspected based on an incidental radiograph or CT finding, and confirmed using CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or transthoracic echocardiography. Treat small, asymptomatic TAAs with aggressive management of blood pressure and dyslipidemia and smoking cessation. Treat larger or symptomatic TAAs with endovascular stent grafting when
