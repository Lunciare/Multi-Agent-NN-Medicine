aggressive antimicrobial therapy directed at the specific pathogen. Generally, these aneurysms must also be surgically repaired. Although open surgical repair of an intact TAA improves outcome, mortality rate may still exceed 7% at 30 days (2). The mortality rate is lower with endovascular stent grafts, although life-long surveillance is still required (3). Risk of death increases greatly if aneurysms are complicated (eg, located in the aortic arch or thoracoabdominal aorta) or if patients are older or have coronary artery disease, symptoms, or preexisting renal insufficiency. Perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal injury, acute renal failure) occur in about 10 to 20% (4). Asymptomatic aneurysms that do not meet criteria for elective surgical or endovascular repair are treated with aggressive blood pressure control using a beta-blocker and other antihypertensives if necessary. Smoking cessation is essential. Dyslipidemia, diabetes, and respiratory diseases should all be treated. Patients require frequent follow-ups to check for symptoms and serial CT or ultrasound every 6 to 12 months. Imaging frequency depends on aneurysm size. Prognosis for Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Thoracic abdominal aneurysms enlarge an average of 3 to 5 mm/year. Risk factors for rapid enlargement include larger size of aneurysm, location in the descending aorta, and presence of
