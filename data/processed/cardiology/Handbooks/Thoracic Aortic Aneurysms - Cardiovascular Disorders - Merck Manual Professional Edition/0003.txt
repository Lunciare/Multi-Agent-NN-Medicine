pericarditis). Bacterial endocarditis and tertiary syphilis are uncommon causes. TAAs occur in some vasculitic disorders (eg, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Blunt chest trauma can cause a pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) due to injury to the aortic wall resulting in a communication between the arterial lumen and overlying connective tissue and blood leaking outside the confines of the aorta; a blood-filled cavity forms outside the vessel wall and seals the leak as it thromboses). Symptoms and Signs of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Most thoracic aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic until complications (eg, thromboembolism, rupture, aortic regurgitation, dissection) develop. However, compression of adjacent structures can cause back pain (due to compression of vertebra), cough or wheezing (due to compression of the tracheobronchial tree), dysphagia (due to esophageal compression), hoarseness (due to left recurrent laryngeal or vagus nerve compression), chest pain (due to coronary artery compression), and superior vena cava syndrome (due to compression of the central veins or superior vena cava). Erosion of aneurysms into the lungs causes hemoptysis or pneumonitis; erosion into the esophagus (aortoesophageal fistula) causes massive hematemesis. Dissection manifests with tearing chest pain, often radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. Thromboembolism may cause stroke, abdominal pain
