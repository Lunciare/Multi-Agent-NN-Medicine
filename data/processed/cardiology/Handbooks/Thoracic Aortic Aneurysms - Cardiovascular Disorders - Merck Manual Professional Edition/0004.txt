Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms

erosion into the esophagus (aortoesophageal fistula) causes massive hematemesis. Dissection manifests with tearing chest pain, often radiating to the back between the shoulder blades. Thromboembolism may cause stroke, abdominal pain (due to mesenteric ischemia), or extremity pain. Ruptured TAA that is not immediately fatal manifests with severe chest or back pain and hypotension or shock. Exsanguination due to rupture most commonly occurs into the pleural or pericardial space. Additional signs include Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis) due to compression of sympathetic ganglia, palpable downward pull of the trachea with each cardiac contraction (tracheal tug), and tracheal deviation. Visible or palpable chest wall pulsations, occasionally more prominent than the left ventricular apical impulse, are unusual but may occur. Syphilitic aneurysms of the aortic root classically lead to aortic regurgitation and inflammatory stenosis of the coronary artery ostia, which may manifest as chest pain due to myocardial ischemia. Syphilitic aneurysms do not dissect. Diagnosis of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Incidental radiograph finding Confirmation by CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually first suspected when a chest radiograph incidentally shows a widened mediastinum or enlargement of the aortic knob. However, chest radiography has poor sensitivity
