Surgery involves a median sternotomy (for ascending and aortic arch aneurysms) or left thoracotomy or thoracoretroperitoneal exposure (for descending and TAAs) and replacement with a synthetic graft. With emergency open surgery, the mortality rate at 1 month is approximately 30 to 50% (1). Patients who survive have a high incidence of serious complications (eg, renal failure, respiratory failure, severe neurologic damage). Elective surgery is indicated for aneurysms that are Large Rapidly enlarging (> 0.5 cm/year) Causing bronchial compression Causing aortobronchial or aortoesophageal fistulas Symptomatic Traumatic Mycotic Aneurysms of the ascending aorta are generally considered large if the diameter is > 5.5 cm or twice the native size of the ascending aorta or if the aortic size index (aortic diameter in relation to body surface 2 area) is ≥ 2.75 cm/m . In the descending aorta, aneurysms are generally considered large if they are > 6 cm. In patients with Marfan syndrome, large aneurysms are those that are ≥ 4.5 to 5 cm in any location. Treatment of mycotic aneurysms is aggressive antimicrobial therapy directed at the specific pathogen. Generally, these aneurysms must also be surgically repaired. Although open surgical repair of an intact TAA improves outcome, mortality rate may still
