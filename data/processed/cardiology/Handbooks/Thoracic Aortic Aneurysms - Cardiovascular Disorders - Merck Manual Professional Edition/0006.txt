lumen, but it is not the preferred imaging study. It gives no information on extraluminal structures (ie, as an alternative diagnosis), it is invasive, and it has a significant risk of renal and extremity atheroembolism and contrast nephropathy. Aortic root dilation or unexplained ascending aorta aneurysms warrant serologic testing for syphilis. If a mycotic aneurysm is suspected, bacterial and fungal blood cultures are done. Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms Control of hypertension and other comorbidities Endovascular stent grafting or open surgical repair Immediate control of hypertension is essential. Medical management with optimal control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and respiratory disease is the appropriate treatment until surgery is indicated. Treatment is endovascular stent grafting when anatomically possible and open surgical repair for more complex aneurysms. Ruptured TAAs, if untreated, are universally fatal. They require immediate intervention, as do leaking aneurysms and those that cause acute dissection or acute valvular regurgitation. Transcatheter-placed endovascular stent grafts (endografts) for descending TAAs and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are a less invasive alternative to open surgery. Surgery involves a median sternotomy (for ascending and aortic arch aneurysms) or left thoracotomy or thoracoretroperitoneal exposure (for descending and TAAs) and replacement with a synthetic graft.
