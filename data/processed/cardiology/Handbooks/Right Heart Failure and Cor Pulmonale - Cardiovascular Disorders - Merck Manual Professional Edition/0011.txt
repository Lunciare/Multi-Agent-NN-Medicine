Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

structural changes become irreversible. Loop diuretics are used cautiously for patients with symptoms or peripheral edema. Cor pulmonale is RV enlargement and eventually failure secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension. Cor pulmonale itself is usually asymptomatic but common physical findings include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of S2, functional tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation murmurs, and later, distended jugular veins, hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema.
