structural changes become irreversible. Loop diuretics are used cautiously for patients with symptoms or peripheral edema. Cor pulmonale is RV enlargement and eventually failure secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension. Cor pulmonale itself is usually asymptomatic but common physical findings include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of S2, functional tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation murmurs, and later, distended jugular veins, hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema.
