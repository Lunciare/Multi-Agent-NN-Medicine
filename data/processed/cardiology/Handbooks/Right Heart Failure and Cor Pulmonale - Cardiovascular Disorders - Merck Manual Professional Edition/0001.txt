Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale
KEYWORDS: heart, failure, right, pulmonale, cor pulmonale, cor, heart failure, pulmonary, right heart, cause, left, patients, ventricular, causes, edema

Right heart failure is defined by the clinical syndrome of systemic venous congestion with or without low cardiac output, secondary to right ventricular dysfunction. The most common cause of right heart failure is increased afterload caused by left heart failure. Cor pulmonale is right ventricular (RV) enlargement and eventual failure secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension. Findings include peripheral edema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly, and a parasternal lift. Diagnosis of right heart failure is clinical and by echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Treatment is directed at the cause. Pathophysiology of Right Heart Failure Right heart or right ventricular (RV) failure is the failure of the right side of the heart to pump blood adequately through the pulmonary vasculature at a normal central venous pressure. Right heart failure often involves right ventricle systolic dysfunction, dilation, or both. In the case of right heart failure secondary to left heart failure, elevated left heart filling pressure is transmitted retrograde through the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular pressure overload, which can be exacerbated by the development of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is typically functional in the setting of either right ventricular enlargement, or right atrial enlargement,
