Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

for other causes of cor pulmonale. Intravenous or inhaled agents are sometimes used in the acute setting in the absence of left heart dysfunction. Bosentan, an endothelin receptor blocker, also may benefit patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, but its use is not well studied in cor pulmonale. Digoxin may be used empirically, however evidence is lacking in the absence of LV dysfunction. Arrhythmias should also be managed. See Medications for Heart Failure for more detailed information on specific medication classes. Cor pulmonale Treatment of cor pulmonale is difficult; it focuses on the cause (see table Causes of Heart Failure), particularly alleviation or moderation of hypoxia. Early identification and treatment are important before structural changes become irreversible. Pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific therapies, including pulmonary vasodilators, are not typically indicated for cor pulmonale due to chronic lung disease, although they may play a role in severe cases (3). Key Points Diagnosis usually requires echocardiography or radionuclide imaging, and sometimes right heart catheterization. Early identification and treatment of the cause are important before cardiac structural changes become irreversible. Loop diuretics are used cautiously for patients with symptoms or peripheral edema. Cor pulmonale is RV enlargement and eventually failure secondary to a lung disorder that
