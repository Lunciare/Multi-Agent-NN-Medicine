Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

caused by COPD, but there are several less common causes (see table Causes of Cor Pulmonale). In patients with COPD, an acute exacerbation or pulmonary infection may trigger RV overload. In chronic cor pulmonale, risk of venous thromboembolism is increased. TABLE Causes of Cor Pulmonale Acuity Condition Massive pulmonary embolization Acute Injury due to mechanical ventilation (most commonly in patients with ARDS) Chronic COPD* Extensive loss of lung tissue due to surgery or trauma Chronic, unresolved pulmonary emboli 2/7 Acuity Condition Pulmonary veno-occlusive disorders Systemic sclerosis Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis Kyphoscoliosis Obesity with alveolar hypoventilation Neuromuscular disorders involving respiratory muscles Idiopathic alveolar hypotension * COPD is the most common cause of chronic cor pulmonale. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Symptoms and Signs of Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale In RV failure, the most common symptoms are peripheral edema and fatigue. Sometimes patients feel a sensation of fullness in the abdomen or neck. Hepatic congestion can cause right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort, and stomach and intestinal congestion can cause early satiety, anorexia, and abdominal bloating. Less specific heart failure symptoms include cool peripheries, postural light-headedness, nocturia, and decreased daytime micturition. Skeletal muscle wasting can
