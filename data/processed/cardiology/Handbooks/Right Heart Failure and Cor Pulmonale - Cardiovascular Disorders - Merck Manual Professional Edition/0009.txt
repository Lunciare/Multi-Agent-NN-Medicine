Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

Cor Pulmonale Treatment of cause Treatment of right heart failure consists of identifying and treating the underlying cause. When the cause is left heart failure, guideline-directed treatment strategies for left heart failure apply. Pulmonary arterial hypertension, congenital heart disease, acquired valvular disease, pericardial disease, cardiomyopathy, and other causes are treated per standard of care. 5/7 In patients with acute or critical illness, careful attention to preload, as well as afterload and contractility are the main approaches (1). Cautious diuresis, inotropic support with agents such as milrinone, and pulmonary vasodilation (in the absence of contraindications) may be helpful. Symptoms may be managed with loop diuretics. Otherwise, there are no evidence-based targeted pharmacologic or other forms of therapies (2). If peripheral edema is present chronically, diuretics may seem appropriate, but they should be used cautiously because small decreases in preload may result in hypotension. Pulmonary vasodilators (eg, hydralazine, calcium channel blockers, nitrous oxide, prostacyclin analogs, phosphodiesterase inhibitors), although beneficial in select Group 1 (primary) pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, are generally not effective for other causes of cor pulmonale. Intravenous or inhaled agents are sometimes used in the acute setting in the absence of left heart dysfunction. Bosentan, an endothelin receptor blocker, also
