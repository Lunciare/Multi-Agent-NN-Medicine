supportive findings. Echocardiography can assess RV systolic pressure but is often technically limited by the lung disorder; Cardiac MRI can quantitatively assess RV size and function. Right heart catheterization may be required for confirmation. Electrocardiography can identify arrhythmia as well as subtle findings of right ventricle hypertrophy and dilation and right atrial or ventricular dilation. Measurement of brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) levels can support the diagnosis of heart failure as well as track clinical response over time. Cor pulmonale Cor pulmonale should be suspected in all patients with one of its causes. Chest radiograph shows RV and proximal pulmonary artery enlargement with distal arterial attenuation. ECG evidence of RV hypertrophy (eg, right axis deviation, QR wave in lead V1, and dominant R wave in leads V1 to V3) correlates well with degree of pulmonary hypertension. However, because pulmonary hyperinflation and bullae in COPD cause realignment of the heart, physical examination, radiographs, and ECG may be relatively insensitive. Cor Pulmonale (Echocardiogram) Treatment of Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale Treatment of cause Treatment of right heart failure consists of identifying and treating the underlying cause. When the cause is left heart failure, guideline-directed treatment strategies for left
