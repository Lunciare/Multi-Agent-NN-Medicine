Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

on the RV may be intensified by increased blood viscosity due to hypoxia-induced polycythemia. Rarely, RV failure affects the LV if a dysfunctional septum bulges into the LV, interfering with filling and thus causing diastolic dysfunction. Cor pulmonale results from a disorder of the lung or its vasculature; it does not refer to right ventricular (RV) enlargement secondary to left ventricular (LV) failure, a congenital heart disorder (eg, ventricular septal defect), or an acquired valvular disorder. Cor pulmonale is usually chronic but may be acute and reversible. Primary pulmonary hypertension (ie, not caused by a pulmonary or cardiac disorder) is discussed elsewhere. Etiology of Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale The most common cause of right heart failure is left heart failure (1). Isolated right heart failure can be caused by right-sided congenital or acquired valvular disease, right-sided myocardial infarction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, right-heart specific cardiomyopathy such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or obstructive sleep apnea. Cor pulmonale Acute cor pulmonale has few causes. Chronic cor pulmonale is usually caused by COPD, but there are several less common causes (see table Causes of Cor Pulmonale). In patients with COPD, an acute exacerbation or pulmonary infection may trigger RV overload.
