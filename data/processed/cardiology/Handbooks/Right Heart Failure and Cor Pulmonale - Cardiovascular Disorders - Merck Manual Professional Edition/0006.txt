Jugular Vein Waves) In severe cases of heart failure, peripheral edema can extend to the thighs or even the sacrum, scrotum, lower abdominal wall, and occasionally even higher. Severe edema in multiple areas is termed anasarca. Edema may be asymmetric if patients lie predominantly on one side. Large v waves in the jugular veins are usually indicative of significant tricuspid regurgitation which is often present in RV failure. A paradoxical increase in the jugular venous pressure during inspiration (Kussmaul sign) is indicative of impaired right ventricular filling and can occur in severe RV failure as well as restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. With hepatic congestion, the liver may be palpably enlarged or tender, and hepatojugular or abdominal- jugular reflux may be detected (see Approach to the Cardiac Patient). Precordial palpation may detect the left parasternal lift of RV enlargement, and auscultation may detect the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation or the RV third heart sound (S3) along the left sternal border; both findings are augmented upon inspiration. Cor pulmonale Cor pulmonale is initially asymptomatic, although patients usually have significant symptoms (eg, dyspnea, exertional fatigue) due to the underlying lung disorder. Later, as RV pressures increase, physical signs commonly
