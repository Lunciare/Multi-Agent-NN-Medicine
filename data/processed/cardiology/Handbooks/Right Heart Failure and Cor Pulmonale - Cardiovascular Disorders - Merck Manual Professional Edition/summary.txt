Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale
KEYWORDS: heart, failure, right, pulmonale, cor pulmonale, cor, heart failure, pulmonary, right heart, cause, left, patients, ventricular, causes, edema

Right heart failure is defined by the clinical syndrome of systemic venous congestion with or without low cardiac output, secondary to right ventricular dysfunction. The most common cause of right heart failure is increased afterload caused by left heart failure. Cor pulmonale is right ventricular (RV) enlargement and eventual failure secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension. Findings include peripheral edema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly, and a parasternal lift. Diagnosis of right heart failure is clinical and by echocardiography and cardiac MRI. Treatment is directed at the cause.
