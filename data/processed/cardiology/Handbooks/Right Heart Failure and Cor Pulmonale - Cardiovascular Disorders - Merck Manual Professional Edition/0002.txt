Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

pressure overload, which can be exacerbated by the development of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is typically functional in the setting of either right ventricular enlargement, or right atrial enlargement, often exacerbated by the presence of atrial fibrillation. Sleep apnea is common in patients with chronic heart failure, particularly central sleep apnea. The presence of both central and obstructive sleep apnea can exacerbate right heart failure. Cor Pulmonale Cor pulmonale is right heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease, which can include: Loss of capillary beds (eg, due to bullous changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or thrombosis in pulmonary embolism) Vasoconstriction caused by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or both Increased alveolar pressure (eg, in COPD, during mechanical ventilation) Medial hypertrophy in arterioles (often a response to pulmonary hypertension due to other mechanisms) Pulmonary hypertension increases afterload on the RV, resulting in a cascade of events that is similar to what occurs in LV failure, including elevated end-diastolic and central venous pressure and ventricular hypertrophy and dilation. Demands on the RV may be intensified by increased blood viscosity due to hypoxia-induced polycythemia. Rarely, RV failure affects the LV if a dysfunctional septum bulges into the LV, interfering with
