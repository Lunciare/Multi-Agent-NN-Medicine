Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale

pulmonale Cor pulmonale is initially asymptomatic, although patients usually have significant symptoms (eg, dyspnea, exertional fatigue) due to the underlying lung disorder. Later, as RV pressures increase, physical signs commonly include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound (S2), and murmurs of functional tricuspid and pulmonic insufficiency (regurgitation). Later, an RV gallop rhythm (S3 and fourth [S4] heart sounds) augmented during inspiration, distended jugular veins (with a dominant a wave unless tricuspid regurgitation is present), hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema may occur. Diagnosis of Right Heart Failure and Cor Pulmonale Clinical suspicion Echocardiography and cardiac MRI Electrocardiogram Measurement of natriuretic peptide levels Sometimes right heart catheterization Right heart failure is a clinical diagnosis, composed of supportive symptoms and physical examination findings. Cardiac imaging, particularly echocardiography and cardiac MRI, is used to confirm right ventricular dysfunction, including dilatation and impaired systolic function. Both imaging modalities can 4/7 identify previously undiagnosed structural, functional, and congenital abnormalities. Right atrial enlargement and functional tricuspid valve regurgitation are also supportive findings. Echocardiography can assess RV systolic pressure but is often technically limited by the lung disorder; Cardiac MRI can quantitatively assess RV size and function. Right heart catheterization may
