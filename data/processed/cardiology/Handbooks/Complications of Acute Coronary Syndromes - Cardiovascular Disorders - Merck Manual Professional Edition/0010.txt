without hemodynamic instability may be treated with IV lidocaine, procainamide, or amiodarone. Some clinicians also treat complex ventricular arrhythmias with magnesium sulfate 2 g IV over 5 minutes whether or not serum magnesium level is low. Ventricular tachycardia may occur months after myocardial infarction. Late ventricular tachycardia is more likely to occur in patients with transmural infarction and to be sustained. 6/14 Broad QRS Ventricular Tachycardia The QRS duration is 160 millisecond. An independent P wave can be seen in II (arrows). There is a leftward mean frontal axis shift. Ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation Ventricular fibrillation occurs in some patients during the first 24 hours after myocardial infarction, usually within 6 hours. Late ventricular fibrillation usually indicates continued or recurrent myocardial ischemia and, when accompanied by hemodynamic deterioration, is a poor prognostic sign. Ventricular fibrillation is treated with immediate unsynchronized cardioversion. Heart Failure Heart failure is more likely in patients with Large infarctions (determined by ECG or cardiac biomarkers) Mechanical complications (eg, myocardial rupture or aneurysm, papillary muscle dysfunction) Hypertension Diastolic dysfunction Clinical findings depend on infarct size, elevation of left ventricular filling pressure, and degree of reduction in cardiac output. Dyspnea, inspiratory crackles at the lung bases, and hypoxemia
