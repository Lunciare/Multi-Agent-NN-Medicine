it is most effective when hypotension is secondary to low cardiac output with increased peripheral vascular resistance. Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine when a vasopressor effect is also required. In refractory cases of cardiogenic shock, dobutamine and dopamine may be combined. The combination of dobutamine plus a drug with more alpha-adrenergic effects (phenylephrine, norepinephrine) may be effective without causing excessive arrhythmias. An intraortic counterpulsation balloon pump may often temporarily support the patient, but it is not clear whether there is short-term or long-term benefit to this approach. Alternatives include a percutaneous or surgically implanted left ventricular assist device and occasionally heart transplantation. Definitive treatment for postinfarction cardiogenic shock is revascularization by thrombolysis of the clot, angioplasty, or emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Revascularization usually greatly improves ventricular function. If coronary anatomy is suitable, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting may be considered for persistent ischemia, refractory ventricular arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, or shock. Right Ventricular Ischemia or Infarction Right ventricular infarction rarely occurs in isolation; it usually accompanies inferior left ventricular infarction. The first sign may be hypotension developing in a previously stable patient. Right-sided ECG leads may show ST-segment changes. Volume loading with 1 to 2 L
