can occur; they are more likely if there is a preexisting sinus node disorder (common among older patients). Sinus bradycardia Sinus bradycardia, the most common sinus node disturbance, is usually not treated unless there is hypotension or the heart rate is < 50 beats/minute. A lower heart rate, if not extreme, means reduced cardiac workload and possibly reduced infarct size. For bradycardia with hypotension (which may reduce myocardial perfusion), atropine 0.5 to 1 mg IV is used; it can be repeated after several minutes if response is inadequate. Several small doses are best because high doses may induce tachycardia. Occasionally, a temporary transvenous pacemaker must be inserted. 1/14 Sinus tachycardia Persistent sinus tachycardia is usually ominous, often reflecting left ventricular failure and low cardiac output. Without heart failure or another evident cause, this arrhythmia may respond to a beta-blocker, given orally or intravenously depending on degree of urgency. Atrial Arrhythmias Atrial arrhythmias (atrial ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation, and, less commonly, atrial flutter) occur in approximately 10 to 20% of patients who have had a myocardial infarction and may reflect left ventricular failure or right atrial infarction (1). Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia is uncommon and usually occurs in patients who have had
