usually terminate atrial flutter. 3/14 Atrial Flutter (Note: Conducted with right bundle branch block.) Conduction Defects Mobitz type I block (Wenckebach block, progressive prolongation of PR interval with eventual dropped beats) is relatively common with an inferior-diaphragmatic infarction (see figure Mobitz Type I Second- Degree Atrioventricular Block); it is usually self-limited and rarely progresses to higher grade block. 4/14 Classic Mobitz Type I Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block The PR interval progressively lengthens with each beat until the atrial impulse is not conducted and the QRS complex is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon); atrioventricular nodal conduction resumes with the next beat, which has the shortest PR interval, and the sequence is repeated. Mobitz type II block (dropped beats) usually indicates massive anterior myocardial infarction, as does complete heart block with wide QRS complexes (atrial impulses do not reach the ventricle); both are uncommon. Frequency of third degree atrioventricular (complete) block depends on site of infarction (see figure Third-Degree Atrioventricular Block). Complete AV block occurs in 5 to 10% of patients with inferior infarction and is usually transient. It occurs in < 5% of patients with uncomplicated anterior infarction but in up to 26% of those with right bundle branch block and left posterior hemiblock.
