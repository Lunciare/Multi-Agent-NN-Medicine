Complications of Acute Coronary Syndromes

Numerous complications can occur as a result of an acute coronary syndrome and increase morbidity and mortality. Complications can be roughly categorized as Electrical dysfunction (conduction disturbance, arrhythmias) Mechanical dysfunction (heart failure, myocardial rupture or aneurysm, papillary muscle dysfunction) Thrombotic complications (recurrent coronary ischemia, mural thrombosis) Inflammatory complications (pericarditis, post-myocardial infarction syndrome) Electrical dysfunction occurs in > 90% of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) (see also Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders). Electrical dysfunction that commonly causes mortality in the first 72 hours includes tachycardia (from any focus) rapid enough to reduce cardiac output and lower blood pressure, Mobitz type II block (second degree) or complete (third degree) atrioventricular (AV) block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Asystole is uncommon, except as a terminal manifestation of progressive left ventricular failure and shock. Patients with disturbances of cardiac rhythm are evaluated for hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, which can be causative or contributory. Sinus Node Disturbances If the artery supplying the sinus node is affected by an acute coronary syndrome, sinus node disturbances can occur; they are more likely if there is a preexisting sinus node disorder (common among older patients). Sinus bradycardia Sinus bradycardia, the most common sinus node disturbance, is usually
