Complications of Acute Coronary Syndromes

to control heart rate for long periods. Intravenous amiodarone may also be used for treatment of acute atrial fibrillation, especially when IV beta-blockade or calcium channel blockade is not appropriate or contraindicated (such as in patients with low blood pressure or active asthma). Due to a high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients with acute MI, an initial cardioversion strategy may not be preferred. However, if atrial fibrillation compromises circulatory status (eg, causing left ventricular failure, hypotension, or chest pain), urgent electrical synchronized cardioversion is done. If atrial fibrillation returns after cardioversion, IV amiodarone should be considered for patients who continue to experience symptoms (eg chest pain) or remain hemodynamically compromised. Atrial flutter For atrial flutter (see also figure Atrial Flutter), rate is controlled as for atrial fibrillation; a heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) is required because the risk of thromboembolism is similar to that with atrial fibrillation. Rate control for atrial flutter in patients with acute MI is usually unsatisfactory. Low-energy direct current (DC) synchronized cardioversion will usually terminate atrial flutter. 3/14 Atrial Flutter (Note: Conducted with right bundle branch block.)
