Complications of Acute Coronary Syndromes

is silent (ECG changes without pain) in up to one third of patients, so serial ECGs are routinely done every 8 hours for 1 day and then daily. Recurrent ischemia is treated similarly to unstable angina. Sublingual or IV nitroglycerin is usually effective. Coronary angiography and revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered to salvage ischemic myocardium. Mural Thrombosis A retrospective cohort study including 2136 patients with acute anterior MI who were treated with PCI found that 3.9% of patients developed a left ventricular mural thrombosis during the hospitalization (1). Because risk is low, routine prophylaxis with anticoagulation is not indicated. Anticoagulant therapy may be considered for patients with STEMI and anterior wall akinesis or dyskinesis, but the patient's risk of bleeding must also be evaluated in light of dual antiplatelet therapy and resultant triple therapy should anticoagulation be chosen. Anticoagulants are recommended for patients after ACS with concomitant: Atrial fibrillation and high thromboembolic risk (eg, see table CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2) Mechanical heart valves Venous thromboembolism Hypercoagulable disorders It also is reasonable to give anticoagulants to patients with STEMI and asymptomatic confirmed LV mural thrombi (2). 12/14 The American Heart Association has
