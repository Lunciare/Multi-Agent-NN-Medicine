Complications of Acute Coronary Syndromes

hypotension due to hypovolemia, cautious fluid replacement with 0.9% saline is usually possible without left heart overload (excessive rise in left atrial pressure). However, sometimes left ventricular function is so compromised that adequate fluid replacement sharply increases pulmonary artery 10/14 occlusion pressure to levels associated with pulmonary edema (> 25 mm Hg). If left atrial pressure is high, hypotension is probably due to left ventricular failure, and if diuretics are ineffective, inotropic therapy or circulatory support may be required. Cardiogenic shock Approximately 5 to 10% of patients with acute myocardial infarction have cardiogenic shock (1). In cardiogenic shock, an alpha-agonist or beta-agonist may be temporarily effective. Dopamine, a catecholamine with alpha and beta 1 effects, is given IV at 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/minute, increased until response is satisfactory or the dose is about 10 mcg/kg/minute. Higher doses induce vasoconstriction and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Dobutamine, a beta-agonist, is another agent that may be given IV at 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/minute or in higher doses. It often causes or exacerbates hypotension; it is most effective when hypotension is secondary to low cardiac output with increased peripheral vascular resistance. Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine when a vasopressor effect is also required.
