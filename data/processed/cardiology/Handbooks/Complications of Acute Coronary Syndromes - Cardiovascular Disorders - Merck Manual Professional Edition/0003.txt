who have had a myocardial infarction and may reflect left ventricular failure or right atrial infarction (1). Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia is uncommon and usually occurs in patients who have had previous episodes of it. Atrial ectopy is usually benign, but if frequency increases, causes, particularly heart failure, are sought. Frequent atrial ectopic beats may respond to a beta-blocker. Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is usually transient if it occurs within the first 24 hours (see figure Atrial Fibrillation). Risk factors include age > 70 years, heart failure, previous history of myocardial infarction, large anterior infarction, atrial infarction, pericarditis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, a chronic lung disorder, and hypoxia. Atrial Fibrillation Fibrinolytics reduce incidence of atrial fibrillation. Recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a poor prognostic sign and increases risk of systemic emboli. For atrial fibrillation, a heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) is usually used because of the risk of systemic emboli. 2/14 Intravenous beta-blockers (eg, atenolol 2.5 to 5.0 mg over 2 minutes to total dose of 10 mg in 10 to 15 minutes, metoprolol 2 to 5 mg every 2 to 5 minutes to a total dose of 15 mg in 10 to 15 minutes) rapidly slow the ventricular rate and are
