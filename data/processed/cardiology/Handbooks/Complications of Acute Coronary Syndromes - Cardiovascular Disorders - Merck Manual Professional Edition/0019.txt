Complications of Acute Coronary Syndromes

inferior left ventricular infarction. The first sign may be hypotension developing in a previously stable patient. Right-sided ECG leads may show ST-segment changes. Volume loading with 1 to 2 L of 0.9% saline is often effective. Dobutamine or milrinone (which has better dilating effects on the pulmonary circulation) 11/14 may help. Nitrates and diuretics are not used; they reduce preload (and hence cardiac output), causing severe hypotension. Increased right-sided filling pressure should be maintained by IV fluid infusion, but excessive volume overload may compromise left ventricular filling and cardiac output. Pearls & Pitfalls With hypotension after myocardial infarction or inferior STEMI, do ECG with right-sided leads to diagnose right ventricular infarction, and, if confirmed, avoid nitrates and diuretics. Recurrent Ischemia Any chest pain that remains or recurs 12 to 24 hours after myocardial infarction may represent recurrent ischemia. Post-MI ischemic pain indicates that more myocardium is at risk of infarction. Usually, recurrent ischemia can be identified by reversible ST-T changes on the ECG; blood pressure may be elevated. Recurrent ischemia is silent (ECG changes without pain) in up to one third of patients, so serial ECGs are routinely done every 8 hours for 1 day and then daily. Recurrent ischemia
