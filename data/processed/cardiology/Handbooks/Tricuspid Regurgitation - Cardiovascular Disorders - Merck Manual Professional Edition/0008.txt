Tricuspid Regurgitation

prosthetic ring or a tailored reduction in annulus circumferential size is performed, is indicated when TR is due to annular dilation. Valve repair or replacement is indicated when TR is due to primary valve abnormalities or when annuloplasty is not technically feasible. (See table Mechanisms of Tricuspid Regurgitation.) Tricuspid valve repair is generally preferred to replacement. Specialized techniques, such as a cone reconstruction, which is performed in patients with Ebstein anomaly, are used in congenital heart disease. Tricuspid valve replacement may be indicated when TR is due to carcinoid syndrome or Ebstein anomaly. A bioprosthetic valve is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolism associated with the low pressures of the right heart; in the right heart, unlike the left heart, bioprosthetic tricuspid valves can last > 10 years (3, 4). A bioprosthetic valve requires temporary anticoagulation (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve diseases). Progress is being made toward a percutaneous valve repair procedure. Early studies have shown improvement in the degree of regurgitation and in right-sided hemodynamics (5). Development of a percutaneous repair procedure will allow lower risk repair much earlier in the natural history of severe TR (6). Prognosis for Tricuspid
