Tricuspid Regurgitation

single because of prompt pulmonary valve closing with merger of P2 and the aortic component (A2). An RV third heart sound (S3) may be audible near the sternum with RV dysfunction–induced heart failure. The murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is frequently not heard. When evident, it is a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left middle or lower sternal border or at the epigastrium with the bell of the stethoscope when the patient is sitting upright or standing. The murmur may be high-pitched if TR is trivial and due to pulmonary hypertension, or it may be medium-pitched if TR is severe and has other causes. The murmur varies with respiration, becoming louder with inspiration (Carvallo sign). When the murmur is not present at all, the diagnosis is best made by the appearance of the jugular venous wave pattern and the presence of hepatic systolic pulsations. Diagnosis of Tricuspid Regurgitation Echocardiography Mild TR is most often detected on echocardiography performed for other reasons. Less than mild ("trivial" or "physiological") TR is a normal finding. More moderate or severe TR may be suggested by history and physical examination. Confirmation is by echocardiography. Severe TR is characterized echocardiographically by ≥ 1 of the following
