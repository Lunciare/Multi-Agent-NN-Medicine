Tricuspid Regurgitation

the preferred method for evaluating RV size and function. An ECG and chest radiograph are often performed. ECG is usually normal but may show tall peaked P waves caused by right atrial enlargement, a tall R or QR wave in V1 characteristic of RV hypertrophy, or atrial fibrillation. Chest radiograph is usually normal but, in advanced cases with RV hypertrophy or RV dysfunction– induced HF, may show an enlarged superior vena cava, an enlarged right atrial or RV silhouette (behind the upper sternum in the lateral projection), or pleural effusion. Laboratory testing is not needed, but if performed, may show hepatic dysfunction in patients with severe TR. Cardiac catheterization is indicated for accurate measurement of pulmonary pressure when TR is severe and to evaluate coronary anatomy when surgery is planned. Catheterization findings include a prominent right atrial c-v pressure wave during ventricular systole.

Medical treatment of causes (eg, heart failure, endocarditis) is indicated. Medical therapy with loop diuretics can relieve congestion. Aldosterone antagonists may be of additive benefit as
