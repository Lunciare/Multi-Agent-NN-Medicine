Tricuspid Regurgitation

regurgitation and in right-sided hemodynamics (5). Development of a percutaneous repair procedure will allow lower risk repair much earlier in the natural history of severe TR (6). Prognosis for Tricuspid Regurgitation Severe tricuspid regurgitation ultimately has a poor prognosis, even if it is initially well-tolerated for years. Less severe TR also affects prognosis, though no study has conclusively shown that early intervention reduces mortality. As with left-sided valvular regurgitation, the volume-overloaded ventricle eventually decompensates irreversibly. However, in contrast to left-sided valvular regurgitation, there is no robust way to discern when the RV is starting to decompensate. Given this, patients are commonly referred late for surgery. In the context of the significant risks of surgery, the overall outcome is poor. Key Points Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) usually occurs in a normal valve affected by right ventricular dilation; less often there is an intrinsic valve disorder (eg, due to infective endocarditis, carcinoid syndrome, certain medications). Jugular venous distention may occur; severe TR may cause abdominal distension, hepatic enlargement, and peripheral edema. Heart sounds include a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left middle or lower sternal border or at the epigastrium when the patient is sitting upright or standing; the murmur becomes louder
