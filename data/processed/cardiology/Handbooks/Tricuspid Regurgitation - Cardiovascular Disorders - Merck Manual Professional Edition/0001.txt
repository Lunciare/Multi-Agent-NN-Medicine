Tricuspid Regurgitation

(Tricuspid Insufficiency; Tricuspid Incompetence) Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficiency of the tricuspid valve causing backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systole. The most common cause is dilation of the right ventricle. Symptoms and signs are usually absent, but severe TR can cause neck pulsations, a holosystolic murmur, and right ventricular–induced heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. TR usually benign; however, it is increasingly implicated as a risk factor for heart failure. Selected symptomatic patients require annuloplasty or valve repair or replacement. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) Etiology of Tricuspid Regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation may be: Primary Secondary (> 80% of cases) (1) Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common. It can be due to: Blunt chest trauma Carcinoid syndrome Congenital defects (eg, cleft tricuspid valve, endocardial cushion defects) Ebstein anomaly (downward displacement of a congenitally malformed tricuspid cusp into the right ventricle [RV]) Idiopathic myxomatous degeneration Marfan syndrome Medications (eg, ergotamine, fenfluramine, phentermine) Rheumatic fever Valvular abnormalities caused by infective endocarditis Secondary tricuspid regurgitation is due to leaflet tethering, which is the result of reduced leaflet coaptation caused by annular dilation (typical of right atrial dilation [atrial secondary]
