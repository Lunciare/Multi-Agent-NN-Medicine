normal finding. More moderate or severe TR may be suggested by history and physical examination. Confirmation is by echocardiography. Severe TR is characterized echocardiographically by ≥ 1 of the following (1): Two-dimensional failure of coaptation or flail leaflet Dense, triangular, early peaking, continuous wave Doppler of TR jet Large flow convergence zone proximal to the valve Large regurgitant jet on color Doppler (≥ 50% of right atrial area) Systolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins (specific for severe TR) Vena contracta width > 7 mm The vena contracta is the narrowest diameter of the fluid stream downstream of an abnormal valve orifice; it is slightly smaller than the anatomic valve orifice. When TR is moderate or severe, the peak regurgitant velocity will underestimate pulmonary pressure. Two-dimensional echocardiography detects the structural abnormalities present in primary TR. Assessing RV systolic function is challenging; in adults, RV dysfunction is suggested on echocardiography by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 16 mm or tricuspid annular systolic velocity < 10 cm/second. Cardiac MRI is the preferred method for evaluating RV size and function. An ECG and chest radiograph are often performed. ECG is usually normal but may show tall peaked P waves caused by
