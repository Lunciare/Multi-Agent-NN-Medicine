Tricuspid Regurgitation

and requires no action. Medical treatment of causes (eg, heart failure, endocarditis) is indicated. Medical therapy with loop diuretics can relieve congestion. Aldosterone antagonists may be of additive benefit as they counter secondary hyperaldosteronism due to hepatic congestion. Treating the etiology is important in secondary TR, potentially including antiarrhythmics, heart failure medications, and pulmonary hypertension therapy. Timing of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation depends on the patient's symptoms and RV function (1). Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation should undergo operation as soon as symptoms are present despite medical treatment or when there is moderate, progressive RV enlargement or dysfunction. Severe LV dysfunction or severe pulmonary hypertension may make the surgical risk prohibitive. During surgery for left-sided heart lesions, patients with moderate or mild TR with dilated annulus > 40 mm can undergo tricuspid annuloplasty, slowing progression to severe TR. However, tricuspid annuloplasty increases risk of the need for permanent pacing five-fold (2). Surgical options include: Annuloplasty Valve repair Valve replacement Annuloplasty, in which the tricuspid valve annulus is sutured to a prosthetic ring or a tailored reduction in annulus circumferential size is performed, is indicated when TR is due to annular dilation. Valve repair or replacement is indicated when TR is
