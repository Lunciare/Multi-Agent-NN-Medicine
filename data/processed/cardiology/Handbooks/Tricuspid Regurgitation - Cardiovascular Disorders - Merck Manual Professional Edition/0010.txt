Tricuspid Regurgitation

include a holosystolic murmur heard best at the left middle or lower sternal border or at the epigastrium when the patient is sitting upright or standing; the murmur becomes louder with inspiration. TR is usually well tolerated, but severe cases may require annuloplasty, valve repair, or valve replacement.
