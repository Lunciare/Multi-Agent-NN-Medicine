Tricuspid Regurgitation

by infective endocarditis Secondary tricuspid regurgitation is due to leaflet tethering, which is the result of reduced leaflet coaptation caused by annular dilation (typical of right atrial dilation [atrial secondary] caused by chronic atrial fibrillation) and/or papillary muscle displacement (most commonly as a result of left heart disease (ventricular secondary) causing pulmonary hypertension and leading to RV dilation or geometric distortion). Iatrogenic causes include pacemaker leads that cross the tricuspid valve and valve damage sustained during RV endomyocardial biopsy or other right heart catheterizations (pacemaker lead associated secondary) (see table Mechanisms of Tricuspid Regurgitation). Long-standing severe TR may lead to RV dysfunction–induced heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
