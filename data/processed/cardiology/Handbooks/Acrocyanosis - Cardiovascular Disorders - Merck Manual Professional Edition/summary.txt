Acrocyanosis is persistent, painless, symmetric cyanosis of the hands, feet, or face caused by vasospasm of the small vessels of the skin, and it is typically exacerbated by cold temperatures. Acrocyanosis usually occurs in women and is not associated with occlusive artery disease. The digits and hands or feet, and sometimes nose or ears, are persistently cold and bluish, sweat profusely, and may swell. In patients with dark skin, the skin may not appear blue, but there is still a distinct contrast in color (1). Clinical findings are due to vasospasm of small vessels and can be triggered or exacerbated by exposure to cold or stress. Etiology is unknown, and the condition may be associated with an underlying comorbid condition such as a rheumatologic disease or malignancy.
