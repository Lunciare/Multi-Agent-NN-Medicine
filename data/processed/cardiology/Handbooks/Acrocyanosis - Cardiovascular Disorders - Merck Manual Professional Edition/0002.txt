hypoxemia may be central or peripheral, depending upon the amount of deoxygenated hemoglobin, but acrocyanosis involves only the hands and feet and does not involve decreased arterial oxygen saturation. Health care professionals diagnose the disorder based on symptoms that are limited to symmetrical involvement of the patient’s hands or feet and that persist even though pulses in the larger arteries (such as in the wrist and ankle) are normal. Treatment, other than reassurance and avoidance of cold, is usually unnecessary. Vasodilators may be tried but are usually ineffective. Note that unlike acrocyanosis in adults, acrocyanosis in neonates is both common and normal. Neonatal acrocyanosis typically resolves within days to weeks, although it can persist through infancy.
