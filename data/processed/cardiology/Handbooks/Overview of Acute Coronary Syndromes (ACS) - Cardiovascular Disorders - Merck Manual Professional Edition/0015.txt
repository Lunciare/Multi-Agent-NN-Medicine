Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

does not indicate the cause of the damage (although any troponin elevation increases the risk of adverse outcomes in many disorders). In addition to acute coronary syndromes, many other cardiac and non-cardiac disorders can elevate cardiac troponin levels (see table Causes of Elevated Troponin Levels); not all elevated levels detected with hs-cTn represent myocardial infarction, and not all myocardial necrosis results from an acute coronary syndrome event even when the etiology is ischemic. However, by detecting lower levels of troponin, hs-cTn assays enable earlier identification of MI than other assays, and have replaced other cardiac biomarker tests in many centers. Patients suspected of having an ACS should have an hs-cTn assay done on presentation and again 2 to 3 hours later. Troponin should be measured at 0 and 6 hours if a standard cTn assay is used. An hs-cTn level must be interpreted based on the patient's pre-test probability of disease, which is estimated clinically based on Risk factors for ACS Symptoms ECG findings A high pre-test probability plus an elevated troponin level detected with an hs-cTn assay is highly suggestive of ACS, whereas a low pre-test probability plus a normal hs-cTn assay result is unlikely to represent ACS (2).
