Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

some cases other medications Often, angiography to assess coronary artery anatomy Often, reperfusion therapy: Fibrinolytics, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Supportive care Post-discharge cardiac rehabilitation and chronic management of coronary artery disease Treatment, including pharmacologic therapy, is designed to relieve distress, interrupt thrombosis, reverse ischemia, limit infarct size, reduce cardiac workload, and prevent and treat complications. An acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency; outcome is greatly influenced by rapid diagnosis and treatment. Treatment occurs simultaneously with diagnosis. Contributing disorders (eg, anemia, heart failure) are aggressively treated. 11/19 Because the chest pain of myocardial infarction usually subsides within 12 to 24 hours, any chest pain that remains or recurs later is investigated. It may indicate such complications as recurrent ischemia, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, gastritis, or ulcer. Prehospital care Oxygen Aspirin Nitrates Triage to appropriate medical center A reliable IV route must be established, oxygen given (typically 2 L by nasal cannula) if patients are hypoxemic, and continuous single-lead ECG monitoring started. Prehospital interventions by emergency medical personnel—including ECG, chewed aspirin (160 to 325 mg), pain management with nitrates (see Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes), early thrombolysis when indicated and possible, and triage to the
