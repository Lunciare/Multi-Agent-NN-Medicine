Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

emergency medical personnel—including ECG, chewed aspirin (160 to 325 mg), pain management with nitrates (see Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes), early thrombolysis when indicated and possible, and triage to the appropriate hospital where primary PCI is available—can reduce risk of mortality and complications (1, 2). Although opioids have long been used to treat pain in patients with acute coronary syndromes, data suggest that morphine attenuates activity of some P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and may contribute to worse patient outcomes (3, 4). Early diagnostic data and response to treatment can help determine the need for and timing of revascularization when primary percutaneous coronary intervention is not possible. Hospital admission Pharmacologic therapy with antiplatelets, anticoagulants, and other medications based on reperfusion strategy Risk-stratify patient and choose a reperfusion strategy (fibrinolytics or cardiac angiography with PCI or CABG for patients with STEMI and cardiac angiography with PCI or CABG for patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI) On arrival to the emergency department, the patient's diagnosis is confirmed. Pharmacologic therapy and choice of revascularization depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome as well as the clinical picture (see figure Approach to Acute Coronary Syndromes). Approach to pharmacologic therapy is discussed in Medications for Acute
