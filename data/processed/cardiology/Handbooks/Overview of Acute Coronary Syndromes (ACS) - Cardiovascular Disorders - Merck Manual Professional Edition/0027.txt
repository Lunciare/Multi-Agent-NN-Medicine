Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

Functional Evaluation After Myocardial Infarction If ECG Is Not Exercise Capacity If ECG Is Interpretable Interpretable Submaximal or symptom- Exercise echocardiography Able to exercise limited stress ECG before or nuclear scanning or after discharge Pharmacologic stress Pharmacologic stress Unable to exercise testing (echocardiography testing (echocardiography or nuclear scanning) or nuclear scanning) Activity Physical activity is gradually increased during the first 3 to 6 weeks after discharge. Resumption of sexual activity, often of great concern to the patient and partner, and other moderate physical activities may be encouraged. If good cardiac function is maintained 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction, most patients can return to all their normal activities. A regular exercise program consistent with lifestyle, age, and cardiac status reduces risk of ischemic events and enhances general well-being. Supervised cardiac rehabilitation programs decrease mortality after revascularization (1). Risk factor modification The acute illness and treatment of ACS should be used to strongly motivate the patient to modify risk factors. Evaluating the patient’s physical and emotional statuses and discussing them with the patient, advising about lifestyle (eg, smoking, diet, work and play habits, exercise), and aggressively managing risk factors may improve prognosis. Medications Several medications clearly reduce mortality risk post-MI and
