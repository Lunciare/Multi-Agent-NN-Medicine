Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

myocardial infarction, bedside echocardiography is invaluable for detecting mechanical complications. Before or shortly after discharge, patients with symptoms suggesting an ACS 10/19 but with nondiagnostic ECGs and normal cardiac biomarker levels should have a stress imaging test (radionuclide or echocardiographic imaging with pharmacologic or exercise stress). Imaging abnormalities in such patients indicate increased risk of complications in the next 3 to 6 months and suggest need for angiography (3), which should be done before discharge or soon thereafter, with PCI or CABG done as necessary. Right heart catheterization using a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter can be used to measure right heart, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures and cardiac output. This test is not routinely recommended and should be done only if patients have significant complications (eg, severe heart failure, hypoxia, hypotension) and by clinicians experienced with catheter placement and management protocols. Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndromes Prehospital care: Oxygen, aspirin, and nitrates and triage to an appropriate medical center Pharmacologic therapy: Antiplatelet agents, antianginal drugs, anticoagulants, and in some cases other medications Often, angiography to assess coronary artery anatomy Often, reperfusion therapy: Fibrinolytics, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) Supportive care Post-discharge cardiac rehabilitation
