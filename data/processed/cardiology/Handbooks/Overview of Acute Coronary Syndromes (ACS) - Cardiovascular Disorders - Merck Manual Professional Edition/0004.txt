Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

predict symptoms, it does not always predict acute thrombotic events. The resultant thrombus abruptly interferes with blood flow to parts of the myocardium. Spontaneous thrombolysis occurs in up to one third of patients (1); 24 hours later, thrombotic obstruction is found in only about 30%. However, in virtually all cases, obstruction lasts long enough to cause varying degrees of tissue necrosis. Rarer causes of acute coronary syndromes are Coronary artery embolism Coronary spasm Spontaneous coronary artery dissection 2/19 Coronary arterial embolism can occur in mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, infective endocarditis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (marantic endocarditis), or atrial fibrillation. Cocaine use and other causes of coronary spasm can sometimes result in myocardial infarction. Spasm- induced MI may occur in normal or atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a non-traumatic tear in the coronary intima with creation of a false lumen. Blood flowing through the false lumen expands it, which restricts blood flow through the true lumen, sometimes causing coronary ischemia or infarction. Dissection may occur in atherosclerotic or non-atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Non-atherosclerotic dissection is more likely in pregnant or postpartum patients and/or patients with fibromuscular dysplasia or other connective tissue disorders.
