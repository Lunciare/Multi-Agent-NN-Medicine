2 to 3 g. Sodium reduction is not required after the first 2 or 3 days if there is no evidence of heart failure. Patients are given a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats, which is used to teach healthy eating. For patients with diabetes and STEMI, intensive glucose control is not recommended; guidelines call for an insulin-based regimen to achieve and maintain glucose levels < 180 mg/dL (9.9 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia. Rehabilitation and Post-Discharge Treatment Functional evaluation Changes in lifestyle: Regular exercise, diet modification, weight loss, smoking cessation Medications: Continuation of antiplatelets, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins 15/19 Functional evaluation Patients who did not have coronary angiography during admission, have no high-risk features (eg, heart failure, recurrent angina, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation after 24 hours, mechanical complications such as new murmurs, shock), and have an ejection fraction > 40% whether or not they received fibrinolytics usually should have stress testing of some sort before or shortly after discharge (see table Functional Evaluation After Myocardial Infarction).
