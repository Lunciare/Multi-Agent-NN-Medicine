but typically involves antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and nitrates as needed (eg, for chest pain, hypertension, pulmonary edema), and a statin to improve prognosis. For unstable angina and NSTEMI, do angiography within 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization to identify coronary lesions requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); fibrinolysis is not indicated. For STEMI, do emergency PCI when door to balloon-inflation time is < 90 minutes; do fibrinolysis if such timely PCI is not available. Following recovery, initiate or continue aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, beta- blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins in most cases unless contraindicated.
