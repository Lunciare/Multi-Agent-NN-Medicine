Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

Q waves over a few days (see figure Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction) tends to confirm the diagnosis. Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction (after the first 24 hours) Significant Q waves develop with decreasing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Because nontransmural (non–Q wave) infarcts are usually in the subendocardial or midmyocardial layers, they do not produce diagnostic Q waves or distinct ST-segment elevation on the ECG. Instead, they commonly produce only varying degrees of ST-T abnormalities that are less striking, variable, or nonspecific and sometimes difficult to interpret (NSTEMI). If such abnormalities resolve (or worsen) on repeat ECGs, ischemia is very likely. However, when repeat ECGs are unchanged, acute MI is unlikely and, if still suspected clinically, requires other evidence to make the diagnosis. A normal ECG taken 6/19 when a patient is free of pain does not rule out unstable angina; a normal ECG taken when a patient is experiencing pain, although it does not rule out angina, suggests that the pain is not ischemic. If right ventricular (RV) infarction is suspected, a 15-lead ECG is usually recorded; additional leads are placed at V4R, and, to detect posterior infarction, V8 and V9. ECG diagnosis of myocardial
