Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

long-term cardioprotection by improving endothelial function. If an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated because of cough or rash (but not angioedema or renal dysfunction), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) may be substituted. Statins are also standard therapy and are routinely prescribed for MI patients with coronary artery disease, regardless of lipid levels (5). Reducing cholesterol levels after MI reduces rates of recurrent ischemic events and mortality in patients with elevated or normal cholesterol levels. The statin should be continued indefinitely, unless significant adverse effects occur, and dose should be increased to the maximally tolerated dose. A non-statin lipid-lowering medication should be added for patients whose LDL remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.81 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy after 4 to 8 weeks. Mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitors (spironolactone or eplerenone) are indicated for patients with left ventricular dysfunction following MI, especially when symptomatic, to reduce morbidity and mortality (6). Prognosis for Acute Coronary Syndromes Global risk should be estimated via formal clinical risk scores (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI], Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events [GRACE], Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy [PURSUIT]—1) or a combination of the following high-risk features: Recurrent angina/ischemia at rest
