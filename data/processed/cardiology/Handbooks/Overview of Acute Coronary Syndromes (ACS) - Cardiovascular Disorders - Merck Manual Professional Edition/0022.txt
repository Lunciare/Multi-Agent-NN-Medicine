Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

on the type of acute coronary syndrome as well as the clinical picture (see figure Approach to Acute Coronary Syndromes). Approach to pharmacologic therapy is discussed in Medications for Acute Coronary Syndrome, and choice of reperfusion strategy is further discussed in Revascularization for Acute Coronary Syndromes. 12/19 Approach to Acute Coronary Syndromes * Morphine should be used judiciously (eg, if nitroglycerin is contraindicated or if the patient has symptoms despite nitroglycerin therapy). Data suggest that morphine attenuates activity of some P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and may contribute to worse patient outcomes. † Complicated means that the hospital course was complicated by recurrent angina or infarction, heart failure, or sustained recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Absence of any of these events is termed uncomplicated. ‡ CABG is still generally preferred to PCI for patients with the following: Left main or left main equivalent disease Left ventricular dysfunction Diabetes Also, lesions that are long or near bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI. CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; GP = glycoprotein; NSTEMI = non–ST-segment elevation MI; MI = myocardial infarction; PCI = percutaneous intervention; STEMI = ST-segment elevation MI. When the diagnosis is unclear, bedside cardiac biomarker measurements can help identify low-risk patients
