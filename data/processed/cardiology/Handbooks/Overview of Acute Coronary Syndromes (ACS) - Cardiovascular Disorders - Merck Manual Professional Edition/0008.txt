Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

phase of infarction. Conduction disturbances can reflect damage to the sinus node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, or specialized conduction tissues. Most changes are transient; some are permanent. Symptoms and Signs of Acute Coronary Syndromes Symptoms of acute coronary syndromes depend somewhat on the extent and location of obstruction and are quite variable. Painful stimuli from thoracic organs, including the heart, can cause discomfort described as pressure, tearing, gas with the urge to eructate, indigestion, burning, aching, stabbing, and sometimes sharp needle-like pain. Many patients describe their symptoms as discomfort rather than pain. Except when infarction is massive, recognizing the amount of ischemia by symptoms alone is difficult. 4/19 Symptoms of ACS are similar to those of angina and are discussed in more detail in sections on unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Of note, some patients with coronary artery disease (particularly patients with diabetes) have silent myocardial ischemia, which is typically detected during stress testing. Complications After the acute event, many complications can occur. They usually involve Electrical dysfunction (eg, conduction defects, arrhythmias) Myocardial dysfunction (eg, heart failure, interventricular septum or free wall rupture, ventricular aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, mural thrombus formation, cardiogenic shock) Valvular dysfunction (typically mitral regurgitation) Electrical dysfunction can
