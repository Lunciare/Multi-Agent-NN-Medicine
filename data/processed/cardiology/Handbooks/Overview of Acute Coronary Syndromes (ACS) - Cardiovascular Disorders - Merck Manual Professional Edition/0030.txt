Registry of Acute Coronary Events [GRACE], Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy [PURSUIT]—1) or a combination of the following high-risk features: Recurrent angina/ischemia at rest or during low-level activity Heart failure Worsening mitral regurgitation High-risk stress test result (test stopped in ≤ 5 minutes due to symptoms, marked ECG abnormalities, hypotension, or complex ventricular arrhythmias) Hemodynamic instability Sustained ventricular tachycardia Diabetes mellitus PCI within past 6 months Prior CABG LV ejection fraction < 0.40 CLINICAL CALCULATORS Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Score for Unstable Angina Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction CLINICAL CALCULATORS Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Score for ST Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction Key Points Unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represent worsening degrees of myocardial ischemia and necrosis; the distinctions help differentiate prognosis and guide treatment. Diagnosis is based on serial ECG and cardiac biomarker levels, particularly using high- sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays. Immediate medical treatment depends on the specific syndrome and patient characteristics but typically involves antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and nitrates as needed (eg, for chest pain, hypertension, pulmonary edema), and a statin to improve prognosis. For unstable angina and NSTEMI, do
