Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

the patient, advising about lifestyle (eg, smoking, diet, work and play habits, exercise), and aggressively managing risk factors may improve prognosis. Medications Several medications clearly reduce mortality risk post-MI and are used unless contraindicated or not tolerated: Aspirin and other antiplatelet agents Beta blockers Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 16/19 Statins Other medications that can reduce cardiovascular events include: PCSK9 inhibitors, when added to statins when further reduction in lipid levels is needed Aspirin and other antiplatelet agents reduce mortality and reinfarction rates in patients after myocardial infarction. Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg once a day is recommended long-term. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker (eg, ticagrelor, clopidogrel) for up to 1 year is recommended (2, 3). Beta-blockers are considered standard therapy. Most available beta-blockers (eg, acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) reduce post-MI mortality rate by about 25% (4). ACE inhibitors are also considered standard therapy and are given to all post-MI patients if possible, particularly if ejection fraction post MI is < 40%. These agents may provide long-term cardioprotection by improving endothelial function. If an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated because of cough or rash (but not angioedema or renal dysfunction), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)
