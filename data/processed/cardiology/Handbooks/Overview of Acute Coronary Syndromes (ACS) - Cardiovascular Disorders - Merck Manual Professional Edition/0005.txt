coronary arteries. Non-atherosclerotic dissection is more likely in pregnant or postpartum patients and/or patients with fibromuscular dysplasia or other connective tissue disorders. Myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary artery disease (MINOCA) Myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) is found in about 5% to 6% of patients with acute MI who undergo coronary angiography (2). Patients with MINOCA tend to be younger, female, and without dyslipidemia, and they have myocardial necrosis without significant coronary atherosclerosis. Plaque disruption and coronary vasospasm are common in MINOCA. Coronary thrombosis or embolism and spontaneous coronary artery dissection are causes of MINOCA. Pathophysiology of Acute Coronary Syndromes Initial consequences vary with size, location, and duration of obstruction and range from transient ischemia to infarction. Measurement of high sensitivity troponin indicates that some cell necrosis probably occurs even with mild ischemia; thus, ischemic events occur on a continuum, and classification into subgroups, although useful, is somewhat arbitrary. Sequelae of the acute event depend primarily on the mass and type of cardiac tissue infarcted. Myocardial dysfunction Ischemic (but not infarcted) tissue has impaired contractility and relaxation, resulting in hypokinetic or akinetic segments; these segments may expand or bulge during systole (called paradoxical
