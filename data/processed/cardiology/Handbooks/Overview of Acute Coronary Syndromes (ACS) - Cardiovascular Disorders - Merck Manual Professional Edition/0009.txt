conduction defects, arrhythmias) Myocardial dysfunction (eg, heart failure, interventricular septum or free wall rupture, ventricular aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, mural thrombus formation, cardiogenic shock) Valvular dysfunction (typically mitral regurgitation) Electrical dysfunction can be significant in any form of ACS, but usually, large parts of myocardium must be ischemic to cause significant myocardial dysfunction. Other complications of ACS include recurrent ischemia and pericarditis. Pericarditis that occurs 2 to 10 weeks after an MI is known as post-MI syndrome, or Dressler syndrome. Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndromes Serial ECGs Serial cardiac biomarkers Immediate coronary angiography for patients with STEMI or complications (eg, persistent chest pain, hypotension, markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, unstable arrhythmias) Delayed angiography (24 to 48 hours) for patients with NSTEMI or unstable angina without complications noted above Acute coronary syndromes should be considered in males, usually those > age 30 years, and females usually > age 40 years (younger in patients with diabetes), whose main symptom is chest pain or discomfort. Pain must be differentiated from the pain of disorders such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, rib fracture, costochondral separation, esophageal spasm, acute aortic dissection, renal calculus, splenic infarction, or various abdominal disorders. In patients with previously diagnosed hiatus hernia, peptic ulcer,
