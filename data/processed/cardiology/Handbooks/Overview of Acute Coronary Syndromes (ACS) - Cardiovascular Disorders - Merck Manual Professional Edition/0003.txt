elevation. ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or both may be present. ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI, transmural MI) is myocardial necrosis with ECG changes showing ST- segment elevation that is not quickly reversed by nitroglycerin or showing new left bundle branch block. Troponin I or troponin T and CK-MB are elevated. Both types of MI may or may not produce Q waves on the ECG (Q wave MI, non-Q wave MI). Etiology of Acute Coronary Syndromes The most common cause of acute coronary syndromes is An acute thrombus in an atherosclerotic coronary artery Atheromatous plaque sometimes becomes unstable or inflamed, causing it to rupture or split, exposing thrombogenic material, which activates platelets and the coagulation cascade and produces an acute thrombus. Platelet activation involves a conformational change in membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors, allowing cross-linking (and thus aggregation) of platelets. Even atheromas causing minimal obstruction can rupture and result in thrombosis; in > 50% of cases, pre-event stenosis is < 40%. Thus, although the severity of stenosis helps predict symptoms, it does not always predict acute thrombotic events. The resultant thrombus abruptly interferes with blood flow to parts of the myocardium. Spontaneous thrombolysis occurs in up to one
