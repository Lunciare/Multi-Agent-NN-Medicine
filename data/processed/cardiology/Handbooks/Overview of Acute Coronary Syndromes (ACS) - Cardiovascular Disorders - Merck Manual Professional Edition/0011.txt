Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

patients with acute STEMI but not for those with NSTEMI. For STEMI, initial ECG is usually diagnostic, showing ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm in 2 or more contiguous leads subtending the damaged area (see figure Acute Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction). Acute Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction (tracing obtained within a few hours of onset of illness) There is striking hyperacute ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, V , and V and reciprocal 4 6 depression in other leads. Pathologic Q waves are not necessary for the diagnosis. The ECG must be read carefully because ST- segment elevation may be subtle, particularly in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF); sometimes the reader’s attention is mistakenly focused on leads with ST-segment depression. If symptoms are characteristic, ST-segment elevation on ECG has a specificity of up to 94% and a sensitivity of up to 55% for diagnosing MI (1). Serial tracings (obtained every 8 hours for 1 day, then daily) showing a gradual evolution toward a stable, more normal pattern or development of abnormal Q waves over a few days (see figure Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction) tends to confirm the diagnosis.
