Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes

right ventricular (RV) infarction is suspected, a 15-lead ECG is usually recorded; additional leads are placed at V4R, and, to detect posterior infarction, V8 and V9. ECG diagnosis of myocardial infarction is more difficult when a left bundle branch block configuration is present because the ECG changes resemble changes due to STEMI (see figure Left Bundle Branch Block). ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex strongly suggests MI as does > 5-mm ST- segment elevation in at least 2 precordial leads. But generally, any patient with suggestive symptoms and new-onset (or not known to be old) left bundle branch block is treated as for STEMI. Left Bundle Branch Block CLINICAL CALCULATORS M.I. Prediction Decision TreeCalc CLINICAL CALCULATORS Non Q Wave Myocardial Infarction Prediction Cardiac biomarkers Cardiac biomarkers (serum biomarkers of myocardial cell injury) are Cardiac enzymes (eg, CK-MB [creatine kinase MB isoenzyme]) Cell contents (eg, troponin I, troponin T, myoglobin) 7/19 These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream after myocardial cell necrosis. The biomarkers appear at different times after injury, and levels decrease at different rates. Sensitivity and specificity for myocardial cell injury vary significantly among these biomarkers. Assays that measure cardiac troponins (cTn), which have been in use for
