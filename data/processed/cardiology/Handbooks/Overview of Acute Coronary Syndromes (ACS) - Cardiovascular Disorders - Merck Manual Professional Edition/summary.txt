Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery. Consequences depend on degree and location of obstruction and range from unstable angina to non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and sudden cardiac death. Symptoms are similar in each of these syndromes (except sudden death) and include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography (ECG) and biomarkers. Treatment is with antiplatelets, anticoagulants, nitrates, beta-blockers, and, for STEMI, emergency reperfusion via fibrinolytic drugs, percutaneous intervention, or, occasionally, coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Classification of Acute Coronary Syndromes Acute coronary syndromes include Unstable angina Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) These syndromes all involve acute coronary ischemia and are distinguished based on symptoms, ECG findings, and cardiac biomarker levels.
