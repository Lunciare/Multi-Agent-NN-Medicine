criteria for myocardial infarction (MI): Rest angina that is prolonged (usually > 20 minutes) New-onset angina of at least class 3 severity in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification (see table Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification System for Angina Pectoris) Increasing angina, ie, previously diagnosed angina that has become distinctly more frequent, more severe, longer in duration, or lower in threshold (eg, increased by ≥ 1 CCS class or to at least CCS class 3) ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation, or T-wave inversion may occur during unstable angina but they are transient. Of cardiac biomarkers, creatine kinase MB fraction (CK- MB) is not elevated but cardiac troponin, particularly when measured using high-sensitivity troponin tests (hs-cTn), may be slightly increased. Unstable angina is clinically unstable and often a prelude to myocardial infarction or arrhythmias or, less commonly, to sudden death. Non–ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI, subendocardial MI) is myocardial necrosis (evidenced by cardiac biomarkers in blood; troponin I or troponin T and CK-MB will be elevated) without acute ST- segment elevation. ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or both may be present. ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI, transmural MI) is myocardial necrosis with ECG changes showing ST- segment elevation
