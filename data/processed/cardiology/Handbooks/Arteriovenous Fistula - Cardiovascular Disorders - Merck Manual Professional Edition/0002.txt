(machinery) murmur with accentuation during systole can be heard during auscultation. Rarely, if a significant portion of cardiac output is diverted through the fistula to the right heart, high- output heart failure develops. Diagnosis of Arteriovenous Fistula Clinical evaluation Sometimes ultrasonography Fistulas are diagnosed clinically based on presence of thrill, murmur, and other signs. 1/2 Doppler ultrasonography is the best confirmatory test. For fistulas that cannot be visualized with ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be used. Imaging with conventional angiography is typically done when a catheter-based treatment is planned. Treatment of Arteriovenous Fistula Sometimes percutaneous occlusion techniques Sometimes surgery Congenital fistulas do not require treatment unless significant complications develop. When necessary, percutaneous vascular techniques can be used to place coils or plugs into the vessels to occlude the fistula. Treatment is often effective but recurrent bleeding can still occur, especially in other locations. Acquired fistulas usually have a single large connection and can be effectively treated by surgery.
