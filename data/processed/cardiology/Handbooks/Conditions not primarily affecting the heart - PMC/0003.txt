not just the terminal forces. As the QRS complex widens it may begin to merge with the T wave and create a pattern resembling a sine wave—a “preterminal” rhythm. Death resulting from hyperkalaemia may be due to asystole, ventricular fibrillation, or a wide pulseless idioventricular rhythm. Hyperkalaemia induced asystole is more likely to be seen in patients who have had chronic, rather than acute, hyperkalaemia. 2/14 Hypokalaemia Hypokalaemia may produce several electrocardiographic changes, especially when there is total body depletion of both potassium and magnesium. The commonest changes are decreased T wave amplitude, ST segment depression, and presence of a U wave. Other findings, particularly in the presence of coexistent hypomagnesaemia, include a prolonged QT interval, ventricular extrasystoles, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation. Electrocardiographic changes are not common with mild to moderate hypokalaemia, and it is only when serum concentrations are below 2.7 mmol/l that changes reliably appear. Electrocardiographic features of hypokalaemia Broad, flat T waves ST depression QT interval prolongation Ventricular arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) A prominent U wave in association with a small T wave are considered to be the classic electrocardiographic
