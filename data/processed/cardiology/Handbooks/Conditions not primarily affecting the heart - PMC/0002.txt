Conditions not primarily affecting the heart

arrhythmias, asystole Open in a new tab The earliest changes associated with hyperkalaemia are tall T waves, best seen in leads II, III, and V2 to V4. Tall T waves are usually seen when the potassium concentration rises above 5.5-6.5 mmol/l. However, only about one in five hyperkalaemic patients will have the classic tall, symmetrically narrow and peaked T waves; the rest will merely have large amplitude T waves. Hyperkalaemia should always be suspected when the amplitude of the T wave is greater than or equal to that of the R wave in more than one lead. As the potassium concentration rises above 6.5-7.5 mmol/l, changes are seen in the PR interval and the P wave: the P wave widens and flattens and the PR segment lengthens. As the concentration rises, the P waves may disappear. The QRS complex will begin to widen with a potassium concentration of 7.0-8.0 mmol/l. Unlike right or left bundle branch blocks, the QRS widening in hyperkalaemia affects all portions of the QRS complex and not just the terminal forces. As the QRS complex widens it may begin to merge with the T wave and create a pattern resembling a sine wave—a “preterminal” rhythm. Death
