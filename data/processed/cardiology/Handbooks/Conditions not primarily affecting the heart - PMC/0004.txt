Conditions not primarily affecting the heart

Ventricular arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) A prominent U wave in association with a small T wave are considered to be the classic electrocardiographic findings of hypokalaemia. Many authors list a prolonged QT interval as a common finding in hypokalaemia. However, most cases of a presumed prolongation of the QT interval are really QU intervals. Most hypokalaemic patients with true prolongation of the QT interval have coexisting hypomagnesaemia and are at risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. Patients with a potassium concentration below 2.5-3.0 mmol/l often develop ventricular extrasystoles. Hypokalaemia may also be associated with supraventricular arrhythmias, such as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Hypothermia Hypothermia is present when the core temperature is less than 35°C. As body temperature falls below normal, many cardiovascular and electrophysiological changes occur. The earliest change seen in the electrocardiogram is an artefact due to shivering, although some hypothermic patients have relatively 3/14 normal traces. The ability to shiver diminishes as body temperature falls, and shivering is uncommon below a core temperature of 32°C.
