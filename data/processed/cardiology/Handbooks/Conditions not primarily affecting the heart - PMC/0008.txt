common Sinus bradycardia Prolonged QT interval Flat or inverted T waves Less common Heart block Low QRS voltages Intraventricular conduction defects Ventricular extrasystoles Patients with thyrotoxicosis may have other electrocardiographic findings. Non-specific ST and T wave changes are relatively common. Ventricular arrhythmias may be seen, though much less frequently than atrial arrhythmias. Thyrotoxic patients have two or three times the normal number of premature ventricular contractions. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism causes slowing of the metabolic rate and affects almost all bodily functions, including heart rate and contractility. It causes similar slowing of electrical conduction throughout the heart. The most common electrocardiographic changes associated with hypothyroidism are sinus bradycardia, a prolonged QT interval, and inverted or flat T waves. Most hypothyroid patients will have a low to normal heart rate (about 50-70 beats/min). Patients with severe hypothyroidism and those with pre-existing heart disease may also develop increasing degrees of heart block or bundle branch block (especially right bundle branch block). Conduction abnormalities due to hypothyroidism resolve with thyroid hormone therapy. Depolarisation, like all phases of the action potential, is slowed in hypothyroidism, and this results in a prolonged QT interval. Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia has been reported in 6/14 hypothyroid patients and
