Conditions not primarily affecting the heart

wave increases and the QT interval may then become normal. Digoxin may be harmful in hypercalcaemic patients and may result in tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Similarly, intravenous calcium may be dangerous in a patient who has received digitalis. The QT prolongation seen in hypocalcaemia is primarily due to ST prolongation but is not thought to be clinical important. Hypoglycaemia is a common medical emergency, although it is not often recognised as having electrocardiographic sequelae. The electrocardiographic features include flattening of the T wave and QT prolongation. Acute electrocardiographic changes commonly accompany severe subarachnoid haemorrhage. Typically these are ST depression or elevation and T wave inversion, although other changes, such as a prolonged QT interval, can also be seen. Finally, artefacts due to shivering or tremor can obscure electrocardiographic changes or simulate arrhythmias.
