extrasystoles About 50% of thyrotoxic patients have a resting pulse rate above 100 beats/min. Atrial tachyarrhythmias are common as the atria are very sensitive to the effects of triiodothyronine. Patients with thyroid storm may develop paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with rates exceeding 200 beats/min. Elderly patients may develop ischaemic ST and T wave changes because of their tachycardias. Increased voltage is a common but non-specific electrocardiographic finding in hyperthyroidism, and is more commonly seen in younger patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in thyrotoxicosis, occurring in about 20% of all cases. It is most common in elderly patients, men, those with a particularly high concentration of thyroid hormone, and patients with left atrial enlargement or other intrinsic heart disease. Treatment of atrial fibrillation in thyrotoxicosis is difficult as the rhythm may be refractory to cardioversion. However, most cases revert spontaneously to sinus rhythm when euthyroid. Multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction, and even 1:1 conduction, may also be seen. 5/14 Electrocardiographic features of hypothyroidism Most common Sinus bradycardia Prolonged QT interval Flat or inverted T waves Less common Heart block Low QRS voltages Intraventricular conduction defects Ventricular extrasystoles Patients with thyrotoxicosis may have other electrocardiographic
