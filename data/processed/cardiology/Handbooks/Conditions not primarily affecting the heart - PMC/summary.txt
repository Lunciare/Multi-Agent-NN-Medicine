To function correctly, individual myocardial cells rely on normal concentrations of biochemical parameters such as electrolytes, oxygen, hydrogen, glucose, and thyroid hormones, as well as a normal body temperature. Abnormalities of these and other factors affect the electrical activity of each myocardial cell and thus the surface electrocardiogram. Characteristic electrocardiographic changes may provide useful diagnostic clues to the presence of metabolic abnormalities, the prompt recognition of which can be life saving. It is important to recognise that some electrocardiographic changes are due to conditions other than cardiac disease so that appropriate treatment can be given and unnecessary cardiac investigation avoided Hyperkalaemia 1/14 Increases in total body potassium may have dramatic effects on the electrocardiogram. The most common changes associated with hyperkalaemia are tall, peaked T waves, reduced amplitude and eventually loss of the P wave, and marked widening of the QRS complex.
