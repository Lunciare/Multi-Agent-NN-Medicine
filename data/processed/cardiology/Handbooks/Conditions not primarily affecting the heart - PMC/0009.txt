phases of the action potential, is slowed in hypothyroidism, and this results in a prolonged QT interval. Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia has been reported in 6/14 hypothyroid patients and is related to prolongation of the QT interval, hypothyroidism induced electrolyte abnormalities, hypothermia, or hypoventilation. Hypothyroid patients are very sensitive to the effects of digitalis and are predisposed to all the arrhythmias associated with digitalis intoxication. Non-specific T wave abnormalities are very common in hypothyroid patients. The T wave may be flattened or inverted in several leads. Unlike with most other causes of T wave abnormalities, in hypothyroidism, associated ST changes are rarely seen Uncommonly, patients may develop large pericardial effusions, which give rise to electrical alternans (beat to beat variation in QRS voltages). Myxoedema coma should always be suspected in patients with altered mental states who have bradycardia and low voltage QRS complexes (<1 mV) in all leads. Other non-cardiac conditions Hypercalcaemia is associated with shortening of the QT interval. At high calcium concentrations the duration of the T wave increases and the QT interval may then become normal. Digoxin may be harmful in hypercalcaemic patients and may result in tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Similarly, intravenous calcium may be dangerous
