Conditions not primarily affecting the heart

body temperature falls, and shivering is uncommon below a core temperature of 32°C. Electrocardiographic features of hypothermia Tremor artefact from shivering Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate J waves (Osborn waves) Bradycardias, especially junctional Prolongation of PR, QRS, and QT intervals Premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation Asystole As body temperature falls further, all metabolic and cardiovascular processes slow progressively. Pacemaker (heart rate) and conduction velocity decline, resulting in bradycardia, heart block, and prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QT intervals. At core temperature below 32°C, regular and organised atrial activation disappears and is replaced by varying degrees of slow, irregular, and disorganised activity. If core temperature falls below 28°C, a junctional bradycardia may be seen. The J wave (Osborn wave) is the most specific electrocardiographic finding in hypothermia. It is considered by many to be pathognomonic for hypothermia, but it may also occasionally be seen in hypercalcaemia and in central nervous system disorders, including massive head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. The J wave may even be a drug effect or, rarely, a normal variant. The J wave is most commonly characterised by a “dome” or “hump” elevation in the terminal portion of the QRS deflection and is
