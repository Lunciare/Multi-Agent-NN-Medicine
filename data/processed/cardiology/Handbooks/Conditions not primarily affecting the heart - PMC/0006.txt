drug effect or, rarely, a normal variant. The J wave is most commonly characterised by a “dome” or “hump” elevation in the terminal portion of the QRS deflection and is best seen in the left chest leads. The size of the J wave often correlates with the severity of hypothermia (<30°C) but the exact aetiology is not known. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common mechanism of death in hypothermia. They seem to be more common during rewarming as the body temperature rises through the 28°-32°C range Thyrotoxicosis 4/14 The cardiovascular system is very sensitive to increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Increases in cardiac output and heart rate are early features in thyrotoxicosis. The most common electrocardiographic changes seen in thyrotoxicosis are sinus tachycardia, an increased electrical amplitude of all deflections, and atrial fibrillation. Electrocardiographic features of thyrotoxicosis Most common findings Sinus tachycardia Increased QRS voltages Atrial fibrillation Other findings Supraventricular arrhythmias (premature atrial beats, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter) Non-specific ST and T wave changes Ventricular extrasystoles About 50% of thyrotoxic patients have a resting pulse rate above 100 beats/min. Atrial tachyarrhythmias are common as the atria are very sensitive to the effects of triiodothyronine. Patients
