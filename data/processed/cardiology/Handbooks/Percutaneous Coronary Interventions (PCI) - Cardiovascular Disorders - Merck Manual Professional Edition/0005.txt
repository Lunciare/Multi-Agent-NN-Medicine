Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)

graft, PCI is often and increasingly being used in this scenario in selected patients. Complications of PCI 3/5 The main complications of balloon angioplasty and stent placement are Arterial dissection Bleeding caused by adjunctive anticoagulation Restenosis Standard complications of cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography Thrombosis and distal embolization Overall, risks of undergoing PCI are comparable to those of CABG. Overall mortality rate is < 1%, but varies based on individual risk factors and tends to be similar to that of CABG; Q wave MI rate is < 1%. In < 1% of patients, intimal dissection causes obstruction requiring emergency CABG. Risk of stroke with PCI is lower than with CABG. A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials reported a higher risk of stroke in patients undergoing CABG (1.2%) than PCI (0.34%,) at 30 days (1). Risk of bleeding is 1 to 2%. Of all angiographic procedures, PCI has the highest risk of contrast nephropathy (due to increased contrast load and procedural time); this risk can be reduced by preprocedural hydration and possibly by use of a nonionic contrast agent or hemofiltration in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. Compared to coronary angiography without angioplasty or stent placement, risk of death, MI, and
