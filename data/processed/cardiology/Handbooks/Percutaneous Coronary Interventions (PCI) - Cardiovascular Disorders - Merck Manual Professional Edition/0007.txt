Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)

a previous saphenous vein graft but is not commonly done. With balloon angioplasty alone, risk of acute thrombosis is about 5 to 10%. 4/5 Use of stents has almost eliminated the need for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting following PCI; the rate of acute and subacute thrombosis is < 1%. However, using a drug-eluting stent increases risk of late stent thrombosis, about 0.6%/year up to 3 years. Restenosis Restenosis is typically due to collagen deposition and thus does not occur until several weeks after the procedure or later; it may cause partial or, less commonly, complete vessel blockage. With balloon angioplasty alone, the risk of subacute restenosis is about 5%, and the overall restenosis rate is about 30 to 45%. With stent use, the rate of subacute restenosis is < 1%. With bare-metal stents, risk of late restenosis is 20 to 30%. Use of a drug-eluting stent lowers late restenosis risk significantly. Arterial dissection In < 1% of patients, intimal dissection causes obstruction requiring emergency CABG. Arterial dissection is usually detected immediately as various abnormal patterns of contrast filling within the coronary arteries. Insertion of another stent often reopens the dissected segment. Stroke Risk of stroke with PCI is lower
