Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)

used during and after PCI to reduce the incidence of thrombosis at the site of balloon dilation and stent placement. 2/5 Anticoagulation is usually initiated with unfractionated heparin. Enoxaparin and bivalirudin are alternatives. Bivalirudin or argatroban should be used in place of unfractionated heparin in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Dual antiplatelet treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) and aspirin is started at the time of the procedure in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) may be added in patients with unstable non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction periprocedurally. P2Y12 inhibitors (often in combination with aspirin) are continued for at least 6 to 12 months after PCI to decrease the risk of in-stent thrombosis until endothelialization of the stent has occurred. For patients who require anticoagulation for another reason (eg, atrial fibrillation), direct-acting oral anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) are preferred long-term over warfarin, unless there is a contraindication to them. For most patients requiring anticoagulation, triple therapy with oral anticoagulation, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin is stopped within 1 week to 1 month after intervention, and patients are continued on oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor for 6 months to 1 year.
