Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)

stenosis, then inflated to disrupt the atherosclerotic plaque and dilate the artery. Angiography is repeated after the procedure to document any changes. The procedure is commonly done in 2 or 3 vessels as needed. Stents for PCI Stents for coronary arteries are expandable wire mesh cylinders that help hold stenotic areas open. Stents are most useful for Short lesions in large native coronary arteries not previously treated with PTCA Focal lesions in saphenous vein grafts Treatment of abrupt closure during PTCA Stents are used frequently for acute myocardial infarction, ostial or left main disease, chronic total occlusions, and bifurcation lesions. Types of stents Bare-metal stents (BMS) are made of nickel-titanium alloy. Drug-eluting stents (DES) have drugs (eg, first-generation: sirolimus, paclitaxel; second-generation: everolimus, ridaforolimus, zotarolimus) bonded to the metal that limit neointimal proliferation to reduce the risk of restenosis. Biodegradable stents are being developed and initial short-term outcomes have shown promise, but their use is currently limited to clinical trials (1). Anticoagulation and ancillary therapy Various anticoagulation and antiplatelet regimens are used during and after PCI to reduce the incidence of thrombosis at the site of balloon dilation and stent placement. 2/5 Anticoagulation is usually initiated with unfractionated heparin.
