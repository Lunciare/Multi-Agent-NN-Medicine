Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI)

possibly by use of a nonionic contrast agent or hemofiltration in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. Compared to coronary angiography without angioplasty or stent placement, risk of death, MI, and stroke is greater. CLINICAL CALCULATORS PTCA Mortality Prediction Thrombosis Stent thrombosis causes complete blockage and may occur at any time: Acutely (immediately during or after the procedure) Subacutely (within 30 days) Late (> 30 days) Very late ( > 1 year) Stent thrombosis may be due to inadequate stent expansion or incomplete stent apposition at the time of the procedure, discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, due to nonadherence, need for noncardiac surgery), or both. Rarely, the stent may break up an intracoronary clot (ie, as may be present in acute MI), which may embolize distally and cause myocardial infarction. Use of protection strategies (eg, temporarily blocking blood flow within the artery using a balloon and then aspirating the emboli, deploying a small filter distal to the site of PCI to capture emboli) may improve outcome in PCI done on a previous saphenous vein graft but is not commonly done. With balloon angioplasty alone, risk of acute thrombosis is about 5 to 10%. 4/5 Use of stents has almost eliminated
