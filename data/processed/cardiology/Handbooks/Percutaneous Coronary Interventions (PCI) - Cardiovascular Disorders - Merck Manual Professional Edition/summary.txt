Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent insertion. Primary indications are treatment of Angina pectoris (stable or unstable) Myocardial ischemia Acute myocardial infarction (particularly in patients with developing or established cardiogenic shock) PTCA and stent placement within 90 minutes of onset of pain is the optimal treatment of transmural ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Elective PCI may be appropriate for post–myocardial infarction (MI) patients who have recurrent or inducible angina before hospital discharge and for patients who have angina and remain symptomatic despite medical treatment. Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is also used to treat peripheral arterial disease. PTCA is done via percutaneous femoral, radial, or brachial artery puncture. The radial approach reduces patient discomfort, improves time to ambulation, and reduces the incidence of some complications (eg, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm formation).
