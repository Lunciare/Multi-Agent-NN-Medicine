shock to the QRS complex is neither necessary nor possible. A shock applied without synchronization to a QRS complex is defibrillation. DC cardioversion or defibrillation can be delivered as Monophasic current Biphasic current Monophasic current travels in one direction between the 2 electrodes. In biphasic devices, the current reverses direction part way through the shock waveform. Most manual and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are biphasic because of potential safety and efficacy advantages. In randomized trials including patients in the controlled setting of induced ventricular fibrillation, the application of lower energy biphasic waveforms achieved similar defibrillation efficacy compared with monophasic waveforms, which may result in less myocardial injury (1). However, this potential benefit has not been proven when studied in trials of patients receiving either monophasic or biphasic waveform defibrillation in the uncontrolled situation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (2). Biphasic devices are also smaller in size (making them more portable). Procedure for DC cardioversion 1/3 When DC cardioversion is elective, patients should fast for 6 to 8 hours before the procedure to avoid the possibility of aspiration. Because the procedure is frightening and painful, brief general anesthesia or IV analgesia and sedation (eg, fentanyl and midazolam) is necessary. Equipment and personnel
