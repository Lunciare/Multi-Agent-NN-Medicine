The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, direct current (DC) cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used. A transthoracic DC shock of sufficient magnitude depolarizes the entire myocardium, rendering the entire heart momentarily refractory to repeat depolarization. Thereafter, the most rapid intrinsic pacemaker, usually the sinoatrial (SA) node, reassumes control of heart rhythm. Thus, DC cardioversion- defibrillation very effectively terminates tachyarrhythmias that result from reentry.
