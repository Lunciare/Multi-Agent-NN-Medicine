Direct Current (DC) Cardioversion-Defibrillation

to avoid the possibility of aspiration. Because the procedure is frightening and painful, brief general anesthesia or IV analgesia and sedation (eg, fentanyl and midazolam) is necessary. Equipment and personnel to maintain the airway and provide additional support, if necessary, must be present. How To Do Synchronized Cardiov... VIDEO The electrodes (pads or paddles) used for cardioversion may be placed anteroposteriorly (along the left sternal border over the third and fourth intercostal spaces and in the left infrascapular region) or anterolaterally (between the clavicle and the second intercostal space along the right sternal border and over the fifth and sixth intercostal spaces at the apex of the heart). After synchronization to the QRS complex is confirmed on the monitor, a shock is delivered. The most appropriate energy level varies with the tachyarrhythmia being treated. Cardioversion and defibrillation efficacy increases with use of biphasic shocks. For defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, the energy level for the first shock in adults is 120 to 200 joules for biphasic devices (or according to manufacturer specification) although many practitioners use the maximum device output in this setting 360 joules for monophasic devices (or according to manufacturer specification) Subsequent shocks are at
