regular, with narrow QRS complexes and a rate of 130-250 beats/min. Atrial conduction proceeds in a retrograde fashion producing inverted P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. However, since atrial and ventricular depolarisation often occurs simultaneously, the P waves are frequently buried in the QRS complex and may be totally obscured. A P wave may be seen distorting the last part of the QRS complex giving rise to a “pseudo” S wave in the inferior leads and a “pseudo” R wave in V1. Fast-slow atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia is known as long RP1 tachycardia, and it may be difficult to distinguish from an atrial tachycardia In the relatively uncommon fast-slow atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia, atrial depolarisation lags behind depolarisation of the ventricles, and inverted P waves may follow the T wave and precede the next QRS complex. Clinical presentation Episodes of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia may begin at any age. They tend to start and stop abruptly and can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by simple movements. They can last a few seconds, several hours, or days. The frequency of episodes can vary between several a day, or one episode in a lifetime. Most patients have only mild symptoms,
