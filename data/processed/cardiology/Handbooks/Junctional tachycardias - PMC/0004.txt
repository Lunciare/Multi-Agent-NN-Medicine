Junctional tachycardias

last a few seconds, several hours, or days. The frequency of episodes can vary between several a day, or one episode in a lifetime. Most patients have only mild symptoms, such as palpitations or the sensation that their heart is beating rapidly. More severe symptoms include dizziness, dyspnoea, weakness, neck pulsation, and central chest pain. Some patients report polyuria. Symptoms are commonest in patients with a very rapid heart rate and pre-existing heart disease Atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia Atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardias occur as a result of an anatomically distinct atrioventricular connection. This accessory conduction pathway allows the atrial impulse to bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricles prematurely (ventricular pre-excitation). The presence of the accessory pathway allows a re-entry circuit to form and paroxysmal atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardias to occur. The commonest kind of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia occurs as part of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome In this syndrome an accessory pathway (the bundle of Kent) connects the atria directly to the ventricles. It results from a failure of complete separation of the atria and ventricles during fetal development. The pathway can be situated anywhere around the groove between the atria and ventricles, and in 10% of cases more than one
