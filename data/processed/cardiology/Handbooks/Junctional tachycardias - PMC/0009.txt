present with heart failure or hypotension. Drugs that block the atrioventricular node—for example, digoxin, verapamil, and adenosine—may be dangerous in this situation and should be avoided. These drugs decrease the refractoriness of accessory connections and increase the frequency of conduction, resulting in a rapid ventricular response, which may precipitate ventricular fibrillation.
