(dominant R wave in V1 lead) may be confused with: Right bundle branch block Right ventricular hypertrophy Posterior myocardial infarction Type B (negative QRS complex in V1 lead) may be confused with: Left bundle branch block Anterior myocardial infarction Commonly, the accessory pathway is concealed—that is, it is capable of conducting only in a retrograde fashion, from ventricles to atria. During sinus rhythm pre-excitation does not occur and the electrocardiogram is normal. Traditionally the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has been classified into two types according to the electrocardiographic morphology of the precordial leads. In type A, the delta wave and QRS complex are predominantly upright in the precordial leads. The dominant R wave in lead V1 may be misinterpreted as right bundle branch block. In type B, the delta wave and QRS complex are predominantly negative in leads V1 and V2 and positive in the other precordial leads, resembling left bundle branch block. Mechanism of tachycardia formation Orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardias account for most tachycardias in the Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome. A premature atrial impulse is conducted down the atrioventricular node 4/14 to the ventricles and then in a retrograde fashion via the accessory pathway back to the atria. The impulse then circles
