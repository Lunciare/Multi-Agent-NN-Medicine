Junctional tachycardias

refractory. The slow pathway has a short refractory period and recovers first. An atrioventricular nodal re- entrant tachycardia is initiated, for example, if a premature atrial beat occurs at the critical moment when the fast pathway is still refractory. The impulse is conducted through the slow pathway and is then propagated in a retrograde fashion up the fast pathway, which has by now recovered from its refractory period. Thus a re-entry through the circuit is created. This type of “slow-fast” re-entry circuit is found in 90% of patients with atrioventricular nodal re- entrant tachycardia. Most of the rest have a fast-slow circuit, in which the re-entrant tachycardia is initiated by a premature ventricular contraction, and the impulse travels retrogradely up the slow pathway. This uncommon form of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia is often sustained for very long periods and is then known as permanent junctional re-entrant tachycardia and is recognised by a long RP1 interval. Electrocardiographic findings During sinus rhythm the electrocardiogram is normal. During the tachycardia the rhythm is regular, with narrow QRS complexes and a rate of 130-250 beats/min. Atrial conduction proceeds in a retrograde fashion producing inverted P waves in leads II, III, and aVF. However, since
