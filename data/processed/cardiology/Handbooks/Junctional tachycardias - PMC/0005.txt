Junctional tachycardias

of the atria and ventricles during fetal development. The pathway can be situated anywhere around the groove between the atria and ventricles, and in 10% of cases more than one accessory pathway exists. The accessory pathway allows the formation of a re-entry circuit, which may give rise to either a narrow or a broad complex tachycardia, depending on whether the atrioventricular node or the accessory pathway is used for antegrade conduction. Electrocardiographic features 3/14 In sinus rhythm the atrial impulse conducts over the accessory pathway without the delay encountered with atrioventricular nodal conduction. It is transmitted rapidly to the ventricular myocardium, and consequently the PR interval is short. However, because the impulse enters non- specialised myocardium, ventricular depolarisation progresses slowly at first, distorting the early part of the R wave and producing the characteristic delta wave on the electrocardiogram. This slow depolarisation is then rapidly overtaken by depolarisation propagated by the normal conduction system, and the rest of the QRS complex appears relatively normal. Classification of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Type A (dominant R wave in V1 lead) may be confused with: Right bundle branch block Right ventricular hypertrophy Posterior myocardial infarction Type B (negative QRS complex in V1 lead) may be
