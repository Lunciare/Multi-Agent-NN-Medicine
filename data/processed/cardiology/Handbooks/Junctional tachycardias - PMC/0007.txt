atrial impulse is conducted down the atrioventricular node 4/14 to the ventricles and then in a retrograde fashion via the accessory pathway back to the atria. The impulse then circles repeatedly between the atria and ventricles, producing a narrow complex tachycardia. Since atrial depolarisation lags behind ventricular depolarisation, P waves follow the QRS complexes. The delta wave is not observed during the tachycardia, and the QRS complex is of normal duration. The rate is usually 140-250 beats/min. Antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia is relatively uncommon, occurring in about 10% of patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The accessory pathway allows antegrade conduction, and thus the impulse is conducted from the atria to the ventricles via the accessory pathway. Depolarisation is propagated through non-specialised myocardium, and the resulting QRS complex is broad and bizarre. The impulse then travels in a retrograde fashion via the atrioventricular node back to the atria. Orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia occurs with antegrade conduction through the atrioventricular nodeAntidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia occurs with retrograde conduction through the atrioventricular node Atrial fibrillation In patients without an accessory pathway the atrioventricular node protects the ventricles from the rapid atrial activity that occurs during atrial fibrillation. In the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome the atrial
