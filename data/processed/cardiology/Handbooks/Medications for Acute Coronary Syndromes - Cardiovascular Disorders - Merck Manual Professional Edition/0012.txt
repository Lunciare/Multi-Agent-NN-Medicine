presentation and 81 mg once a day indefinitely thereafter. Chewing the first dose before swallowing quickens absorption. Aspirin reduces short- and long-term mortality risk (1). If aspirin cannot be taken, clopidogrel 75 mg orally once a day or ticlopidine 250 mg orally twice a day may be used. Clopidogrel has largely replaced ticlopidine for routine use because neutropenia is a risk with ticlopidine, and the white blood cell count must be monitored regularly if patients are taking ticlopidine. Patients not undergoing revascularization Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in whom intervention is not possible or recommended are given both aspirin and clopidogrel (or ticagrelor) for at least 12 months. In general, the concern with dosage and duration of antiplatelet agents is to balance the decreased risk of coronary thrombosis with the increased risk of bleeding. Patients undergoing revascularization In patients undergoing PCI, a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 to 600 mg orally once), prasugrel (60 mg orally once), or ticagrelor (180 mg orally once) improves outcomes (1). Some clinicians give a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor during PCI to all high-risk patients (eg, those with markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, a TIMI risk score ≥ 4, or persistent symptoms despite adequate pharmacologic therapy)
