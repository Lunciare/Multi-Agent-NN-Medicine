Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes

Treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is designed to relieve distress, interrupt thrombosis, reverse ischemia, limit infarct size, reduce cardiac workload, and prevent and treat complications. An ACS is a medical emergency; outcome is greatly influenced by rapid diagnosis and treatment. Treatment occurs simultaneously with diagnosis. Treatment includes revascularization (with percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or fibrinolytic therapy) and pharmacologic therapy to treat ACS and underlying coronary artery disease. Medications used depend on the type of ACS and include Aspirin, clopidogrel, or both (prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel if fibrinolytic therapy has not been given) Beta-blocker Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor for certain patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and high-risk lesions (eg, high thrombus burden, no reflow) A heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) or bivalirudin (particularly in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] who are at high risk of bleeding) IV nitroglycerin (unless low-risk, uncomplicated myocardial infarction) Fibrinolytics for select patients with STEMI when timely PCI unavailable Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (as early as possible) Statins Antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs, which stop clots from forming, are used routinely. Anti-ischemic drugs (eg, beta-blockers, IV nitroglycerin) are frequently added, particularly when chest pain or hypertension is
