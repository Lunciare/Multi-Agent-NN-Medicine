Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes

a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor during PCI to all high-risk patients (eg, those with markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, a TIMI risk score ≥ 4, or persistent symptoms despite adequate pharmacologic therapy) with large thrombus burden. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is continued for 6 to 24 hours, and angiography is done before the infusion period is over. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not recommended for patients receiving fibrinolytics. Abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide appear to have equivalent efficacy, and the choice of agent should depend on other factors (eg, cost, availability, familiarity). For patients receiving a stent for revascularization, aspirin is continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel 75 mg orally once a day, prasugrel 10 mg orally once a day, or ticagrelor 90 mg orally twice a day should be used for at least 1 month in patients with a bare-metal stent. Patients with a drug-eluting stent after ACS have a prolonged risk of thrombosis and benefit from up to 12 months of clopidogrel (or prasugrel or ticagrelor) treatment. Anticoagulant Agents Either a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin, or bivalirudin is given routinely to patients with acute coronary syndrome unless contraindicated (eg, by active bleeding or planned use of streptokinase or anistreplase).
