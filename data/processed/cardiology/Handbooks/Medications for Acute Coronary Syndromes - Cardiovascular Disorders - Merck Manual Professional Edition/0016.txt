CABG is indicated within the next 24 hours, and when patients are at high risk of bleeding complications (eg, history of gastrointestinal bleeding within the last 6 months) or have creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute (0.5 mL/second). For patients undergoing PCI, post-procedure heparin is no longer recommended unless patients are at high risk of thromboembolic events (eg, patients with large anterior MI, known LV thrombus, atrial fibrillation), because postprocedure ischemic events have decreased with the use of stents and antiplatelet agents. For patients not undergoing PCI, heparin is continued for 48 hours (or longer if symptoms persist). 12/17 Heparin alternatives The difficulties with the heparins (including bleeding complications, the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and, with unfractionated heparin, the need for dosing adjustments) have led to the search for alternative anticoagulants. The direct thrombin inhibitors, bivalirudin and argatroban, may have a lower incidence of serious bleeding and improved outcomes, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency (hirudin, another direct thrombin inhibitor, appears to cause more bleeding than the other agents). Bivalirudin is an acceptable alternative to unfractionated heparin for patients undergoing PCI who are at high risk of bleeding. The factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux reduces mortality and reinfarction in patients with NSTEMI
