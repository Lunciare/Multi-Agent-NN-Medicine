Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes

risk of coronary spasm. Beta-Blockers Beta-blockers are recommended unless contraindicated (eg, by bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, or asthma), especially for high-risk patients. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate, arterial pressure, and contractility, thereby reducing cardiac workload and oxygen demand. Infarct size largely determines cardiac performance after recovery. Oral beta-blockers given within the first few hours improve prognosis by reducing infarct size, recurrence rate, incidence of ventricular fibrillation, and mortality risk (1). Heart rate and BP must be carefully monitored during treatment with beta-blockers. Dosage is reduced if bradycardia or hypotension develops. Excessive adverse effects may be reversed by infusion of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol 1 to 5 mcg/minute. Nitrates A short-acting nitrate, nitroglycerin, is used to reduce cardiac workload in selected patients. Nitroglycerin dilates veins, arteries, and arterioles, reducing left ventricular preload and afterload. As a result, myocardial oxygen demand is reduced, lessening ischemia. IV nitroglycerin is recommended during the first 24 to 48 hours for patients with heart failure, large anterior myocardial infarction, persistent chest discomfort, or hypertension. BP should not be reduced to < 110 to 120 mm Hg systolic; patients who remain symptomatic at that BP should have emergency PCI rather than further BP reduction. Longer use may benefit
