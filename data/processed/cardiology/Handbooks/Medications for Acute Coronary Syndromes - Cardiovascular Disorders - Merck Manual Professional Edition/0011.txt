Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes

antianginal drugs * Clinicians may use different combinations of medications depending on the type of coronary artery disease that is present. † Refer to the manufacturer's prescribing information or a drug information database for specific dosing information. ‡ Lower doses of Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are sometimes used, based on patient- specific risk factors. § Higher doses of aspirin do not provide greater protection and increase risk of adverse effects. ¶ Of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), enoxaparin is preferred. ACS = acute coronary syndromes; BP = blood pressure; CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD = coronary artery disease; HMG = hydroxymethylglutaryl; INR = international normalized ratio; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LV = left ventricular; MI = myocardial infarction; NSTEMI = non–ST-segment elevation MI; PCI = percutaneous intervention; STEMI = ST-segment elevation MI. Antiplatelet Agents Aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine, and glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors are examples of antiplatelet agents. All patients are given aspirin 160 to 325 mg (not enteric-coated), if not contraindicated (eg, life-threatening active bleeding), at presentation and 81 mg once a day indefinitely thereafter. Chewing the first dose before swallowing quickens absorption. Aspirin reduces short- and long-term mortality risk (1). If aspirin cannot be taken,
