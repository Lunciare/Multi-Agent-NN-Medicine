Medications for Acute Coronary Syndromes

an acceptable alternative to unfractionated heparin for patients undergoing PCI who are at high risk of bleeding. The factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux reduces mortality and reinfarction in patients with NSTEMI who undergo PCI without increasing bleeding but has no clear benefit compared with unfractionated heparin in patients with STEMI (1). Although routine use of these alternative anticoagulants is thus not currently recommended, they should be used in place of unfractionated heparin or LMWH in patients with a known or suspected history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. For patients who require anticoagulation for another reason (eg, atrial fibrillation), direct-acting oral anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) are preferred long term over warfarin, unless there is a contraindication to them. For most patients requiring anticoagulation, triple therapy with oral anticoagulation, a P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin is continued up to 1 week to 1 month after intervention, and then patients are continued on oral anticoagulation and a P2Y12 inhibitor for 6 months to 1 year. Calcium channel blockers and nitrates may also be given to reduce risk of coronary spasm. Beta-Blockers Beta-blockers are recommended unless contraindicated (eg, by bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, or asthma), especially for high-risk patients. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate, arterial pressure, and contractility,
