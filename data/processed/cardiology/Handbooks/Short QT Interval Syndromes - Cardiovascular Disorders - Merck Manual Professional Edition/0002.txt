Short QT Interval Syndromes

SQTS are also prone to atrial fibrillation. An overlap syndrome with the early repolarization syndrome has been reported. Short QT interval syndromes are classified based on the specific gene that has mutated. The most common abnormal genes include KCNH2, KCNQ1, KCNJ2, and SLC4A3. Patients are asymptomatic unless atrial fibrillation or VT/VF occurs, which may cause palpitations, near syncope, syncope, or cardiac arrest. Diagnosis of Short QT Interval Syndromes Specific clinical and electrocardiographic criteria Genetic testing Screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained cardiac arrest or syncope or a family history of such when the affected people do not have structural heart disease. It should also be considered in people who are discovered to have a short QT interval when ECG is done for other reasons. Diagnosis is by ECG showing shortening of the QTc. The degree of shortening of the QTc required is debated but ranges from < 0.30 second to ≤ 0.36 second; the longer durations may be more appropriate when patients or family members have a known mutation, documented VT/VF, or unexplained cardiac arrest (1). The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society Guidelines use ≤ 0.34 second (2). This
