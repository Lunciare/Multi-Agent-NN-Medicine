Short QT Interval Syndromes

family members have a known mutation, documented VT/VF, or unexplained cardiac arrest (1). The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society Guidelines use ≤ 0.34 second (2). This criterion is met by approximately 5/10,000 persons < 21 years of age (3). Genetic testing has a low yield (approximately 20%) (4). Diagnostic criteria have been proposed (1, 5). Additional testing may include ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring and cardiac imaging. First-degree family members of patients should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia) and ECG. Genetic testing of family members is done when the patient has an identified mutation. Treatment of Short QT Interval Syndromes Treatment of any VT/VF Sometimes quinidine Usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Treatment with quinidine (which prolongs the QT interval) has been proposed, but most patients who have symptoms receive an ICD (1). Expert consensus is that an ICD may be considered for asymptomatic patients with a family history of sudden death (1, 2).
