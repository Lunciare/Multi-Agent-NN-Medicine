to V9 Right ventricular infarction Right ventricular infarction is often overlooked, as standard 12 lead electrocardiography is not a particularly sensitive indicator of right ventricular damage. Right ventricular infarction is associated with 40% of inferior infarctions. It may also complicate some anterior infarctions but rarely occurs as an isolated phenomenon. On the standard 12 lead electrocardiogram right ventricular infarction is indicated by signs of inferior infarction, associated with ST segment elevation in lead V1. It is unusual for ST segment elevation in lead V1 to occur as an isolated phenomenon. Right sided chest leads are much more sensitive to the presence of right ventricular infarction. The most useful lead is lead V4R (an electrode is placed over the right fifth intercostal space in the mid- clavicular line). Lead V4R should be recorded as soon as possible in all patients with inferior infarction, as ST segment elevation in right ventricular infarction may be short lived. 4/18 The diagnosis of right ventricular infarction is important as it may be associated with hypotension. Treatment with nitrates or diuretics may compound the hypotension, though the patient may respond to a fluid challenge Right ventricular infarction usually results from occlusion of the right coronary artery
