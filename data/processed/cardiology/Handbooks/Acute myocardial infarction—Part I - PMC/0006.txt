image” change. Extensive reciprocal ST segment depression in remote regions often indicates widespread arterial disease and consequently carries a worse prognosis. Localisation of site of infarction 3/18 The distribution of changes recorded in acute myocardial infarction allows the area of infarction to be localised, thus indicating the site of arterial disease. Proximal arterial occlusions tend to produce the most widespread electrocardiographic abnormalities. The anterior and inferior aspects of the heart are the areas most commonly subject to infarction. Anteroseptal infarcts are highly specific indicators of disease of the left anterior descending artery. Isolated inferior infarcts—changes in leads II, III, and aVF—are usually associated with disease in the right coronary or distal circumflex artery. Disease in the proximal circumflex artery is often associated with a lateral infarct pattern—that is, in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. Anatomical relationship of leads Inferior wall—Leads II, III, and aVF Anterior wall—Leads V1 to V4 Lateral wall—Leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 Non-standard leads Right ventricle—Right sided chest leads V1R to V6R Posterior wall—Leads V7 to V9 Right ventricular infarction Right ventricular infarction is often overlooked, as standard 12 lead electrocardiography is not a particularly sensitive indicator of right ventricular damage. Right ventricular infarction is
