Pericarditis overview

and sometimes bacteria). Vascular congestion of the pericardium is also present. The underlying myocardium may or may not be inflamed as well. If the myocardium is involved in the inflammatory process, it is called myopericarditis, and CK and troponin levels may be elevated. Cardiotropic viruses usually spread to the myocardium and pericardium hematogenously and cause acute inflammation with infiltration of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and pericardial vascularization. Most patients with viral pericarditis recover completely with few developing recurrences. Some patients develop constrictive pericarditis which could be disabling. Bacterial pericarditis results from contiguous spread of infection within the chest, either de novo or after surgery or trauma, spread from infective endocarditis, hematogenous, or direct inoculation as a result of penetrating injury or cardiothoracic surgery. Causes The causes of pericarditis can be divided into infectious and non-infectious ones. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal and, parasitic. While, non-infectious causes include autoimmune, neoplastic, metabolic, traumatic and iatrogenic, and drug-related. Acute myocardial infarction, Addisonian crisis, aortic dissection and rupture, blunt or penetrating chest trauma, esophageal perforation, gastric perforation, and myocardial rupture are life threatening causes of pericarditis. Common causes of pericarditis include viral, bacterial organisms, neoplasms, autoimmune and renal failure. Differentiating Pericarditis from other Diseases
