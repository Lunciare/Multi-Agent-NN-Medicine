analysis for malignancy was negative. Treatment Medical Therapy The management of pericarditis depends on whether the patient has an uncomplicated vs. complicated disease course. Uncomplicated pericarditis is generally treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Ibuprofen in cases of either viral or idiopathic pericarditis, and Aspirin in cases of post-MI pericarditis. Pericarditis complicated with either effusion or cardiac tamponade is generally treated with urgent pericardiocentesis in the case of cardiac tamponade, antibiotics in the case of purulent pericardial effusion, and either steroids or colchicine among patients with recurrent or refractory disease. Interventions Surgery Pericardiocentesis Percutaneous pericardiocentesis is a procedure where fluid is aspirated from the pericardium (the sac enveloping the heart) using a needle via a percutaneous approach. Pericardiocentesis can provide a diagnostic sampling of pericardial fluid and can be used as a therapeutic maneuver to evacuate pericardial fluid and lower the pericardial pressure. Pericardial Window Creation of a pericardial window is a cardiac surgical procedure in which an opening is made in the pericardium to drain fluid that has accumulated around the heart by creating a fistula or "window" from the pericardial space to the peritoneal cavity. Flow of fluid into the peritoneal cavity prevents the accumulation of fluid
