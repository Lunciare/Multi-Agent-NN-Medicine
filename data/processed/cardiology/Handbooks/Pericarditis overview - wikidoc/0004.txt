malignancy or viral infection. It usually follows respiratory infections, most commonly echovirus or coxsackie virus. In children, it is most commonly caused by adenovirus or coxsackie virus. In developing countries pericarditis is usually secondary to tuberculosis or HIV infection. Tuberculous pericarditis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is found in approximately 1% of all autopsied cases of TB and in 1% to 2% of instances of pulmonary TB. Risk Factors Screening There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for pericarditis. Natural History, Complications and Prognosis Pericarditis is often self-limited and most people recover in 2 weeks to 3 months. However, the condition can be complicated by significant fluid buildup around the heart (a pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade) and may require urgent intervention including pericardiocentesis. If scarring of the sac around the heart (the pericardium) occurs, then this is called constrictive pericarditis which may require surgical stripping of the scar. Diagnosis Diagnostic Study of Choice History and Symptoms Patients with pericarditis commonly present with chest pain that changes with position, cough, fever, breathlessness, and fatigue are the other common symptoms. Less common symptoms include palpitations, hiccup, odynophagia, faint, dizziness, and abdominal pain which is seen mostly in children. Physical Examination A
