Pericarditis overview

a short period of time after the surgery. Chest tubes are removed in 2-3 days once the drainage is less than 200cc/24hrs. Pericardial Stripping Pericardiectomy is the surgical removal of part or most of the pericardium. This operation is performed to relieve constrictive pericarditis or to remove a pericardium that is calcified and fibrous. Constrictive pericarditis is a progressive disease without spontaneous reversal of pericardial thickening. Some patients can be medically managed for several years. Edema can be controlled with diuretics and slowing the heart rate can maximize the diastolic filling time. Many patients eventually develop significant debility from impaired cardiac output and elevated right and left sided filling pressures. The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardiectomy which is also known as pericardial stripping. This is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. Due to the significant risks involved with pericardial stripping, many patients are treated medically, with judicious use of diuretics.
