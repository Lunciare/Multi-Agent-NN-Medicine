In the presence of a large effusion or tamponade, there may be diminished voltage and electrical alternans (alternation of QRS complex amplitude or axis between beats). X-ray A flask-shaped, enlarged cardiac silhouette will be observed on chest x-ray in pericarditis complicated with pericardial effusion or tamponade. A mass may also be seen when malignancy is the cause. Calcification of pericardium may be noted in constrictive pericarditis. Echocardiography and Ultrasound Echocardiography is generally performed to assess for the presence of a pericardial effusion and to assess and monitor its size. Echocardiography is critical in confirming the clinical suspicion cardiac tamponade. CT scan On CT, pericardial fluid adds to the thickness of pericardium as both have the similar signal intensities. In pericarditis, pericardium can generate an intermediate signal intensity and may enhance after gadolinium administration. In pericardial effusion, hemorrhagic effusions can be differentiated from a transudate or an exudate based on signal characteristics (high signal on T1- weighted images) or density (high-density clot on CT). CT is superior to MRI in the visualization of pericardial calcification which is often seen in the patient with pericardial constriction. CT imaging also helps in detecting the presence of tumors and the extent of metastasis of
