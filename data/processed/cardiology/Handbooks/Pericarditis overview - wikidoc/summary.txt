Overview Pericarditis is a condition in which the sac-like covering surrounding the heart (the pericardium) becomes inflamed. Symptoms of pericarditis include chest pain which increases with deep breathing and lying flat. Historical Perspective The pericardium is a double-walled sac that contains the heart and the roots of the great vessels. Morphologically, it is a conical-shaped, double-walled fibro-serous membrane. It rests posteriorly to the sternum at the level of second to sixth costal cartilages and T5-T8 vertebrae. Classification Pericarditis may be classified according to duration of the disease and recurrence into acute, Incessant, recurrent and chronic.
