perforation, gastric perforation, and myocardial rupture are life threatening causes of pericarditis. Common causes of pericarditis include viral, bacterial organisms, neoplasms, autoimmune and renal failure. Differentiating Pericarditis from other Diseases Pericarditis must be differentiated from diseases presenting with chest pain, shortness of breath and tachypnea which include myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, vasculitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Manifestation of the pericarditis can help in differentiation from myocardial infarction. Moreover, other differential diagnosis include aortic stenosis, coronary artery vasospasm, esophageal rupture, esophageal spasm, esophagitis,acute gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and peptic ulcer disease should be considered. Epidemiology and Demographics The incidence of acute pericarditis is approximately 27.7 per 100,000 individuals annually. The recurrence of disease is seen in almost 30% of patients after first episode. The mortality rate of acute pericarditis is approximately 1.1% in developed countries. Patients of all age groups may develop acute pericarditis. Although it commonly affects men in 20 to 50 years of age. Pericarditis in developed countries is most commonly due to malignancy or viral infection. It usually follows respiratory infections, most commonly echovirus or coxsackie virus. In children, it is most commonly caused by adenovirus or coxsackie virus. In developing countries
