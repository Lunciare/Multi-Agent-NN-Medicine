fever, breathlessness, and fatigue are the other common symptoms. Less common symptoms include palpitations, hiccup, odynophagia, faint, dizziness, and abdominal pain which is seen mostly in children. Physical Examination A careful physical examination must be performed to exclude the presence of cardiac tamponade, a dangerous complication of pericarditis. If cardiac tamponade is present, then pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, an elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema may be present. Laboratory Findings Non-specific markers of inflammation are generally elevated in pericarditis. These include the leukocyte count, C-reactive protein, and ESR. The cardiac troponin is elevated if there is an injury to the underlying myocardium, a condition termed as myopericarditis. Diagnostic pericardiocentesis and biopsy help in identifying an underlying infectious or malignant process.Non-specific markers of inflammation are generally elevated in pericarditis.

Electrocardiogram In the presence of a large effusion or tamponade, there may be diminished voltage and electrical alternans (alternation of QRS complex amplitude or axis between beats).
