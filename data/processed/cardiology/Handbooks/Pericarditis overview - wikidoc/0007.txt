Pericarditis overview

visualization of pericardial calcification which is often seen in the patient with pericardial constriction. CT imaging also helps in detecting the presence of tumors and the extent of metastasis of the neoplasm. MRI On MRI, normal pericardium appears as a thin dark band that is bordered by a bright band on both sides on T1 weighted spin imaging. These surrounding bright bands are associated with the surrounding epicardial and pericardial fat. Following the administration of gadolinium, pericardium may appear thick and inflamed in the setting of pericarditis. Lower intensity signal is observed in constrictive pericarditis than in acute pericarditis. Comprehensive visualization of the LV endocardium and the physiologic consequences of abnormal pericardial thickening can also be obtained without exposure to ionizing radiation. Other Imaging Findings Other diagnostic studies Echocardiography guided pericardiocentesis may be helpful in the diagnosis of the pericarditis etiology. Pericardial fluid aspiration for cytology and immunohistochemistry analysis should be done in pericarditis with effusion. Pericardiocentesis should be done in patients with high susceptibility of neoplastic pericarditis which cytology analysis for malignancy was negative. Treatment Medical Therapy The management of pericarditis depends on whether the patient has an uncomplicated vs. complicated disease course. Uncomplicated pericarditis is generally treated with
