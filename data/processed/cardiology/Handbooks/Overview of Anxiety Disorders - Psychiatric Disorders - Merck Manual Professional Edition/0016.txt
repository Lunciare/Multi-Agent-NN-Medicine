Overview of Anxiety Disorders

especially when used in conjunction with any of the above psychotherapeutic techniques. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines are the 2 medication classes with the strongest evidence base, though there is also a role for nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics (such as buspirone) and atypical antipsychotics (9). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally considered first-line based on their efficacy and safety profiles. These "antidepressant" medications address the symptoms of the anxiety disorders regardless of whether there is a comorbid depressive disorder. SSRI antidepressants are generally started at the lowest available dose to minimize adverse effects. Patients with anxiety may be sensitive to bodily changes and may discontinue treatment if they 8/10 experience adverse effects early on. Once the patient has tolerated the initial dose, the antidepressant can be gradually increased until a therapeutic dose or therapeutic effect is reached. A positive clinical effect may occur at any time but often takes 6 or more weeks to achieve. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) , particularly duloxetine and venlafaxine, have also demonstrated safety and efficacy for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines may be used for acute relief of anxiety but can create dependence and a desire for increasing levels that limit their benefit/risk ratio for chronic use
