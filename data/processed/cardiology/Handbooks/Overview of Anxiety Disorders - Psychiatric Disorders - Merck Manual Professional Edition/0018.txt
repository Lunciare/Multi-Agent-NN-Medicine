However, for an individual with both anxiety and a bipolar disorder, that same medication choice can trigger a manic episode consisting of intensified anxiety and irritability. A missed bipolar disorder can result in decades of inappropriate treatments. Comorbid medical disorders can also be challenging to manage. For example, asthma can physiologically cause anxiety, but so can some of the medications used to treat asthma. Anxiety can contribute to an asthma exacerbation, and fears of an asthma exacerbation can lead to avoidance behaviors (eg, diminished activity, medication nonadherence) that in turn can exacerbate asthma and lead to a diminished quality of life.
