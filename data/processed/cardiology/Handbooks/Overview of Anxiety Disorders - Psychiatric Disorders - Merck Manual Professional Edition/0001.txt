Overview of Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent and excessive fear and anxiety and the dysfunctional behavioral changes a patient may use to mitigate these feelings. Anxiety disorders are differentiated from one another based on the specific objects or situations that induce the fear, anxiety, and associated behavioral changes. Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety. Fear is an emotional, physical, and behavioral response to an immediately recognizable external threat (eg, an intruder, a car spinning on ice). Anxiety is a distressing, unpleasant emotional state of nervousness and uneasiness; its causes are less clear. Anxiety is less tied to the exact timing of a threat; it can be anticipatory before a threat, persist after a threat has passed, or occur without an identifiable threat. People often experience both fear and anxiety as changes in their body (eg, sweating, nausea) and their behaviors (eg, avoidance, anger). Often, people are aware of these physical and behavioral changes without clearly identifying that they are anxious or fearful. Adaptive anxiety can help motivate people to prepare, practice, and rehearse; it can also encourage appropriate caution in potentially dangerous situations. When anxiety causes dysfunction and undue distress, however, it is considered maladaptive and, thus, a psychiatric disorder. Anxiety
