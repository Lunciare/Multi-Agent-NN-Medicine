Overview of Anxiety Disorders

listed above generally develop in adulthood. Substance-induced/medication-induced anxiety disorder and anxiety due to another medical condition should always be considered when people present with significant anxiety. Other disorders that often present with prominent anxiety include acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because they are deemed to arise out of traumatic or stressful experiences, they are grouped separately in the DSM-5-TR. Anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with other medical and psychiatric conditions. Depression, substance use disorders, personality disorders, and other anxiety disorders are particularly common comorbidities, as are cardiovascular disease, asthma, migraines, and arthritis. Because anxiety disorders often precede other psychiatric comorbidities, early and effective treatment of the anxiety disorder can prevent or mitigate their development. Etiology of Anxiety Disorders There is no single gene or psychological cause for anxiety disorders, but they do seem to develop in the context of typical biopsychosocial factors. Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and they do so through at least 2 mechanisms (1): A childhood trait of "behavioral inhibition" appears to be somewhat inherited, and that trait is associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders in adolescence. Social fears and avoidance can be transmitted to children
