Overview of Anxiety Disorders

"behavioral inhibition" appears to be somewhat inherited, and that trait is associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders in adolescence. Social fears and avoidance can be transmitted to children through parental modeling and/or early traumatic experiences that might include childhood maltreatment or medical illnesses (eg, asthma). It has been hypothesized that these experiences and genetic vulnerabilities prime some children to be unusually attentive to their own physical and emotional reactions to stress, which can then lead to panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Many people develop an anxiety disorder, however, without an identifiable antecedent trigger. For example, most people with a snake phobia have never been bitten by a snake and do not report a characteristic traumatic experience. Anxiety can also be a response to environmental and social stressors during adulthood, such as the ending of a significant relationship or exposure to a life- threatening disaster, though most people who experience such stressors do not go on to develop an anxiety disorder. Multiple neurotransmitters are involved in the development of anxiety disorders. The 2 predominant neurotransmitters—GABA and glutamate—play a key role, as do other neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These neurotransmitters play an important role in influencing medication
