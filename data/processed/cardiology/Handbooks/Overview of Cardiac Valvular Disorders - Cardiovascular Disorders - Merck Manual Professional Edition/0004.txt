Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

(during the same operation) any moderate or severe valve lesions, even if asymptomatic. Endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated when there is a history of endocarditis and for patients with prosthetic heart valves. Choice of cardiac valve prosthesis Two kinds of cardiac valve prostheses are used: Bioprosthetic (porcine, bovine, or homograft) Mechanical (manufactured) Both types have similar survival rates and rates of valve thrombosis. Mechanical prostheses have a higher rate of bleeding complications, and bioprostheses are more likely to require re-intervention because they deteriorate more rapidly than mechanical valves. A mechanical valve is usually used (1) in patients who are not contemplating becoming pregnant and who meet one or more of the following criteria: Already taking a vitamin K antagonist (eg, for atrial fibrillation) and adhering well to therapy Under age 50 years (for aortic valve) Under age 65 years (for mitral valve) A bioprosthetic valve is recommended to replace the aortic valve for patients > 65 years. For patients aged 50 to 65 years, the recommendations are guides only because patients' preferences may deviate, particularly depending on how they perceive bleeding complications versus need for re-intervention. Anticoagulation for patients with prosthetic cardiac valves or native valve disease Anticoagulation is indicated to
