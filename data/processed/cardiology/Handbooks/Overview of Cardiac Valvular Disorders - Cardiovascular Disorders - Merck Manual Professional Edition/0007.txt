Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

prevention in patients with mechanical valves. Women who require valve replacement and plan to become pregnant must balance the teratogenic risk due to warfarin when mechanical valves are used against the risk of accelerated valve deterioration when bioprosthetic valves are used. Teratogenic risks can be reduced by use of heparin instead of warfarin in the first 12 weeks and last 2 weeks of the pregnancy, but management is difficult, complications are increased, and careful discussion is required before surgery. Anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation and native valve disease Patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis should undergo anticoagulation with a VKA. For those with other native valve disease, DOACs are an alternative to VKAs and may be preferred in some patient groups, with recommendations varying depending on the specific valve affected and the CHA2DS2-VASc score (see also Prevention of thromboembolism) (1, 3). Follow-up of prosthetic valves Prosthetic valve follow-up is facilitated by obtaining an early postoperative baseline transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and by referring to normal echocardiographic parameters (eg, transvalvular gradients) for the patient's prosthesis type, size, and position. If the postoperative baseline study is satisfactory and there has been no interval clinical change, then mechanical valves do not require routine TTE.
