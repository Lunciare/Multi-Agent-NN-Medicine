Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

preferences may deviate, particularly depending on how they perceive bleeding complications versus need for re-intervention. Anticoagulation for patients with prosthetic cardiac valves or native valve disease Anticoagulation is indicated to prevent thromboembolism after valve replacement, and in patients with atrial fibrillation or other indications for anticoagulation. The duration and medication used differ depending on the type of prosthetic valve or specific native valve affected and the presence of underlying atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation for patients with prosthetic cardiac valves Mechanical valve: Lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is needed as per the international normalized ratio [INR] targets below. Bioprosthetic valve: Lifelong aspirin is recommended (those at low bleeding risk may have 3 to 6 months anticoagulation with a VKA before changing to aspirin). Transcatheter aortic valve: Lifelong aspirin is needed. Addition of either clopidogrel or a VKA (INR target 2.5) may be considered for 3 to 6 months after implantation for patients with increased thrombosis risk. Bioprosthetic valve (including transcatheter) in patients with atrial fibrillation: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is preferred over VKA, unless a thromboembolism has occurred while taking a DOAC. (see also Prevention of thromboembolism) (1, 2, 3). DOAC (also called non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or NOAC)
