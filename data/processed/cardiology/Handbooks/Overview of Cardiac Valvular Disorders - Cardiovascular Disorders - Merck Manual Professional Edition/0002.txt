diastole Pulmonary regurgitation: Incomplete closure of the pulmonary valve, causing backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing or restricted opening of the pulmonary outflow tract or valve, causing obstruction of normal blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery during systole Tricuspid regurgitation: Incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve, causing backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systole Tricuspid stenosis: Narrowing of the tricuspid valve orifice, obstructing normal blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle in diastole Historically, diagnosis of valvular disorders by observation, palpation, and auscultation was challenging, particularly for less experienced clinicians (1). Now, with the physical examination supplemented by echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound), sometimes including handheld ultrasound, diagnosis is more straightforward. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional studies demonstrate valvular anatomy and leaflet motion. Doppler echocardiography evaluates pressure gradients and blood flow. Evaluation also includes ECG (to detect heart rhythm and chamber alterations) and chest radiograph (to detect chamber alterations, pulmonary congestion, and other lung pathology). Treatment of Valvular Disorders Valvuloplasty (valve repair, also called valvotomy) or valve replacement Management of a valvular lesion commonly requires only periodic observation, with no active
