Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

and other lung pathology). Treatment of Valvular Disorders Valvuloplasty (valve repair, also called valvotomy) or valve replacement Management of a valvular lesion commonly requires only periodic observation, with no active treatment for many years. In general, neither lifestyle measures nor medications alter the natural history of valvular lesions. Intervention is usually indicated when a moderate or severe valvular lesion causes symptoms or cardiac dysfunction. Because patients may not recognize symptoms due to their slow onset, many clinicians use exercise testing to help monitor patients. The intervention may involve valvuloplasty (valve repair), or valve replacement, which may be performed percutaneously or surgically. Investigation of different valvular interventions, including percutaneous valve replacement, has led to an increasing number of therapeutic options and evidence on how to choose one. For clinicians, the increase in complexity requires a multidisciplinary heart valve team composed of surgeons, cardiologists, and other specialists to help decide which intervention is best for a given patient. If coronary artery bypass surgery is being performed, it is usual to surgically treat (during the same operation) any moderate or severe valve lesions, even if asymptomatic. Endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated when there is a history of endocarditis and for patients with prosthetic heart
