Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

Any heart valve can become stenotic or insufficient (also termed regurgitant or incompetent), causing hemodynamic changes long before symptoms occur. Depending on which valve is involved, the most common symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. Most often, valvular stenosis or insufficiency occurs in isolation in individual valves, but multiple valvular disorders may coexist, and a single valve may be both stenosed and insufficient. Heart valve disorders include: Aortic regurgitation: Incomplete closure of the aortic valve, causing backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole Aortic stenosis: Narrowing or restricted opening of the aortic valve, obstructing normal blood flow from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta during systole Mitral regurgitation: Incomplete closure of the mitral valve, causing backflow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium during systole Mitral valve prolapse: Billowing of mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole Mitral stenosis: Narrowing of the mitral orifice, obstructing normal blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle during diastole Pulmonary regurgitation: Incomplete closure of the pulmonary valve, causing backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing or restricted opening of
