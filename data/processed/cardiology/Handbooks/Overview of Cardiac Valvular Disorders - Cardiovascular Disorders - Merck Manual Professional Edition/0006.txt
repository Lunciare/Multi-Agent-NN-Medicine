Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders

is preferred over VKA, unless a thromboembolism has occurred while taking a DOAC. (see also Prevention of thromboembolism) (1, 2, 3). DOAC (also called non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or NOAC) are ineffective for mechanical prostheses and should not be used. Target INR for most modern mechanical bileaflet prostheses is 2.5, increasing to 3.0 with any of the following: Atrial fibrillation Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35% Mitral or tricuspid position Previous thromboembolism Patients who self-monitor their INR or follow up with dedicated anticoagulation clinics have less variability in their INR and fewer adverse events. If patients have thromboembolism despite an adequate INR, consider adding low-dose aspirin. When VKA treatment is interrupted, bridging with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin is indicated, except in patients with a bileaflet (mechanical) aortic valve replacement and no other risk factors for thrombosis (previous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, LVEF < 35%, > 1 mechanical valve —1). Atrial Fibrillation CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Score for Stroke Risk Pearls & Pitfalls Warfarin is the only appropriate oral anticoagulant for thromboembolism prevention in patients with mechanical valves. Women who require valve replacement and plan to become pregnant must balance the teratogenic risk due to warfarin when mechanical valves are used against
