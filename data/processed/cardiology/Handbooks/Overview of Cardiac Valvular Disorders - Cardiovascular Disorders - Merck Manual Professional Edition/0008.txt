the patient's prosthesis type, size, and position. If the postoperative baseline study is satisfactory and there has been no interval clinical change, then mechanical valves do not require routine TTE. Patients with bioprosthetic valves should have a follow-up TTE at 5 and 10 years, and then annually. Patients with transcatheter aortic valve prostheses should have annual TTE as the long-term durability of these prostheses is not certain. Thrombus formation on bioprosthetic valves may cause hemodynamic deterioration. Thrombus formation is difficult to diagnose; computed tomography (CT) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are often required in addition to TTE. Thrombus formation should be distinguished from other causes of valve stenosis, because vitamin K antagonism usually results in relief of obstruction that is caused by thrombus formation.
