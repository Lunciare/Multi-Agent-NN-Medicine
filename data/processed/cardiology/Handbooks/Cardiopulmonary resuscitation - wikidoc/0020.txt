Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

compressions completed correctly. These devices can be split in to three broad groups - timing devices, those that assist the rescuer to achieve the correct technique, especially depth and speed of compressions, and those which take over the process completely. Timing devices They can feature a metronome (an item carried by many ambulance crews) in order to assist the rescuer in getting the correct rate. The CPR trainer cited here ( s/A_108147/article.html) has timed indicators for pressing on the chest, breathing and changing operators. Manual Assist devices These items can be devices to placed on top of the chest, with the rescuers hands going over the device, and a display giving information on depth or force.[30] Several published evaluations of one particular product, known as CPREzy, with these features show that the device can improve the performance of chest compressions.[31][32] More recently, these features have also been combined in to a wearable format, as a glove.[33] This glove also has additional features such as a basic electro-cardiogram device. This device was developed by students as part of their thesis, and has been named as one of the top ten inventions of 2007 in Popular Science magazine.[34] Automatic devices There are
