Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Resuscitation Use of impedance threshold device (ITD) is not recommended based on studies.[11] The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) approach described above has been challenged in recent years by advocates for Cardiocerebral Resuscitation (CCR). CCR is simply chest compressions without artificial respiration. The ventilation component of CPR has been a topic of major controversy over the past decade. In March 2007, a Japanese study in the medical journal The Lancet presented strong evidence that compressing the chest, not MTM ventilation, is the key to helping someone recover from cardiac arrest.[39] The CCR method is championed by the University of Arizona's Sarver Heart Center, and a recent study by the university,[40] claims a 300% greater success rate over standard CPR.[41] The exceptions were in the case of drowning or drug overdose. An editorial by Gordon Ewy MD (a proponent of CCR) in the same issue of The Lancet calls for an interim revision of the AHA/ILCOR Guidelines based on the results of the Japanese study, but the next scheduled revision of the Guidelines is not until 2010. The initial response of the AHA was that no interim change is necessary. Rhythmic Abdominal Compressions Rhythmic abdominal compression-CPR works by forcing blood
