To have the best outcome in CPR following things should be accomplished : • Ratio: compression-ventilation ratio for all age groups (except newborns) is 30:2 for one- rescuer and is 15:2 for children and infants for two-rescuer (except newborns). • Rate: chest compression rate of 100-120 pushed a minute in all age groups. More than 120 per minute does not let the cardiac to refill in chest recoil duration and less than 100 is not enough to pump blood to brain.So nor more than 120 and less than 100 chest compression per minute.
