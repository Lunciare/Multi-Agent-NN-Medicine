public place when it has a medical cause; victims in arrest from trauma, exsanguination or intoxication are less likely to receive CPR.[20] Chance of getting CPR in time CPR is only likely to be effective if commenced within 6 minutes after the blood flow stops,[21] because permanent brain cell damage occurs when fresh blood infuses the cells after that time, since the cells of the brain become dormant in as little as 4-6 minutes in an oxygen deprived environment and the cells are unable to survive the reintroduction of oxygen in a traditional resuscitation. Research using cardioplegic blood infusion resulted in a 79.4% survival rate with cardiac arrest intervals of 72±43 minutes, traditional methods achieve a 15% survival rate in this scenario, by comparison. New research is currently needed to determine what role CPR, electroshock, and new advanced gradual resuscitation techniques will have with this new knowledge[22] A notable exception is cardiac arrest occurring in conjunction with exposure to very cold temperatures. Hypothermia seems to protect the victim by slowing down metabolic and physiologic processes, greatly decreasing the tissues' need for oxygen.[23] There are cases where CPR, defibrillation, and advanced warming techniques have revived victims after substantial periods of hypothermia.[24]
