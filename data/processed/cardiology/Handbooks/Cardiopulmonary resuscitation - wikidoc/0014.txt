Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

inches for children and approximately 1.5 inches for infants. • Interruptions: Try to minimize interruptions of chest compression. • Ventilation : Do not hyperventilate the patient. when the patient have advanced airway there is no need to stop chest compression for ventilation in 30:2 ratio, continue the chest compression and perform 1 breath every 6 seconds. • If there is suspicious of opioid toxicity, inject Naloxone if available. • Check the pulse and rhythm every 2 minutes ( in less than 10 seconds). • Shock: Shock if the heart rhythm of the victim is Supraventricular Tachycardia, Ventricular Fibrillation or Ventricular Tachycardia (AED detect abnormal rhythms). Announce the warning of shock. • After shock, continue chest compression for 2 minutes then check a central pulse. -Approximately all of the above guidelines are same in all types of CPR, now we want to focus on special features of each : Adult Basic Life Support : • In witnessed victim cardiac arrest out of hospital with VF or VT, emergency medical service can perform 3 cycles of 200 continuous compressions with no active ventilation. Adult Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support : • Place an endotracheal tube when if the patient is hypercapnic • Inject
