Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

was developed by students as part of their thesis, and has been named as one of the top ten inventions of 2007 in Popular Science magazine.[34] Automatic devices There are also some devices available which take over the chest compressions for the rescuer. These devices use techniques such as pneumatics to drive a compressing pad on to the chest of the patient. One such device, known as the LUCAS, was developed at Lund University, is powered by the compressed air cylinders or lines available in ambulances or in hospitals, and has undergone numerous clinical trials, showing a marked improvement in coronary perfusion pressure[35] and return of spontaneous circulation.[36] Cookies help us deliver our services.

This is also backed by clinical studies showing increased successful return of spontaneous circulation.[37][38] Alternative Methods Cardiocerebral Resuscitation Use of impedance threshold device (ITD) is not recommended based on studies.[11] The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) approach described above has been challenged in recent years by
