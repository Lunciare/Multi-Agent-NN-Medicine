team). Because of that CPR is generally only effective if performed within 7 minutes of the stoppage of blood flow.[5] The heart also rapidly loses the ability to maintain a normal rhythm. Low body temperatures as sometimes seen in drowning prolong the time the brain survives. Following cardiac arrest, effective CPR enables enough oxygen to reach the brain to delay brain death, and allows the heart to remain responsive to defibrillation attempts. If the patient still has a pulse, but is not breathing, this is called respiratory arrest and artificial respiration is more appropriate. However, since people often have difficulty detecting a pulse, CPR may be used in both cases, especially when taught as first aid (see below). First aid CPR is part of the chain of survival, which includes early access (to emergency medical services), early CPR, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.[6] Some first aid trainers also advocate the performance of CPR as part of the choking protocol, if all else has failed.[7] Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death, happening to approximately one in 360,000 people per year in the USA.[8] CPR can double or triple the victim's chances of survival when commenced immediately (see
