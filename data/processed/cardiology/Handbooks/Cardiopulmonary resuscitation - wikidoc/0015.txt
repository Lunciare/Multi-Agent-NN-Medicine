perform 3 cycles of 200 continuous compressions with no active ventilation. Adult Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support : • Place an endotracheal tube when if the patient is hypercapnic • Inject epinephrine 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes • Inject Amiodarone or lidocaine in shock refractory [12] [13] Pediatric Basic Life Support: • ventilation is more important in infants. so chest compression plus active ventilation for children and infants is class I recommendation.[14] • Amiodarone or lidocaine in shock refractory.[11] Pediatric Advanced Life Support: • For children with "out of hospital cardiac arrest ", its better to continue Ambu bag ventilation instead of advanced airway.[15] Neonatal Resuscitation:[16] • Ratio: For neonatal resuscitation ratio of chest compression-ventilation is 3:1 • In resuscitation of newborns with ≥35 weeks of gestation use 21% oxygen, and in premature newborns ( less than 35 weeks of gestation) use 21-30% oxygen.Do not use 100 % oxygen which increase rate of death in newborns.[16] Prevalence and Effectiveness Chance of getting CPR Cookies help us deliver our services.
