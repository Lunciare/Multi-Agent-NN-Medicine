help to arrive and has been used in a hospital emergency room in cases where "standard CPR" was contraindicated. "Cough CPR" was the subject of a hoax chain e-mail entitled "How to Survive a Heart Attack When Alone" which wrongly cited "ViaHealth Rochester, Rochester General Hospital" as the source of the technique. Rochester General Hospital has denied any connection with the technique.[43][44] Cookies help us deliver our services.

One researcher has recommended that it be taught broadly to the public.[45][46] However, “cough CPR” cannot be used outside the hospital because the first symptom of cardiac arrest is unconsciousness[47] in which case coughing is impossible. Further, the vast majority of people suffering chest pain from a heart attack will not be in cardiac arrest and CPR is not needed. In these cases attempting “cough CPR” will increase the workload on the heart and may be harmful. When coughing is used on trained and monitored patients in hospitals, it has only been shown to be effective for 90 seconds.[48] The American Heart Association (AHA)
