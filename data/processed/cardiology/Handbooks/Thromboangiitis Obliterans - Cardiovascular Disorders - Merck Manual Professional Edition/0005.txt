cessation, IV prostacyclin therapy may help prevent amputation (1). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and thromboxane inhibitors, and endothelin inhibitors may be tried empirically, but data to support their use are limited (2). Use of antiendothelial cell antibody measurements to follow the course of disease is being studied. Endovascular or surgical revascularization appear to have a reasonable safety profile and outcomes in the setting of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (2, 3). Key Points Thromboangiitis obliterans is inflammatory thrombosis of small and medium-sized arteries and sometimes superficial veins in distal upper and lower extremities. It occurs almost exclusively in males aged 30 to 45 years who smoke. Claudication may occur, and patients may develop ischemic ulceration and gangrene of one or more digits. Diagnose clinically but exclude other causes of ischemia by testing. Smoking cessation is essential; prostacyclin infusion may help prevent amputation, but evidence supporting use of other medications is limited.
