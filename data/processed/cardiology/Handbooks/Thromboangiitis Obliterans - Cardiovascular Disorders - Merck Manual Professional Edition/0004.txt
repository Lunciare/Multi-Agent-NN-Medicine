Thromboangiitis Obliterans

and physical examination suggest the diagnosis. It is confirmed when: The ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankle to arm systolic blood pressure) for legs or segmental pressures for arms indicates distal ischemia Echocardiography excludes cardiac emboli Blood tests (eg, measurement of antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, complement, anticentromere antibody, anti-scleroderma [SCL] 70 antibody) exclude vasculitis Tests for antiphospholipid antibodies exclude antiphospholipid syndrome (although these levels may be slightly elevated in thromboangiitis obliterans) Angiography shows characteristic findings (segmental occlusions of the distal arteries in the hands and feet, tortuous, corkscrew collateral vessels around occlusions, and no atherosclerosis) Treatment of Thromboangiitis Obliterans Smoking cessation Local measures Sometimes medication therapy Endovascular or surgical revascularization, in cases of chronic limb-threatening ischemia Treatment is centered on cessation of tobacco use. Continuing to use tobacco inevitably leads to disease progression and severe ischemia, often requiring amputation. Other measures include: Avoiding cold Avoiding medications that can cause vasoconstriction Avoiding thermal, chemical, and mechanical injury, especially injury due to poorly fitting footwear For patients in the first phase of smoking cessation, IV prostacyclin therapy may help prevent amputation (1). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and thromboxane inhibitors, and endothelin inhibitors may be tried empirically, but data to support their use
