Overview
The right ventricle was previously recognized as a simple conduit between the systemic and the
pulmonary circulation, but its importance in maintaining hemodynamic stability and end organ
function is now well established.[1] Right heart function is an important prognostic factor in
multiple settings, including congenital heart diseases, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart
failure.[2][3]
Right heart failure can be defined as failure of the right ventricle to pump blood into the lungs
adequately. It is a clinical syndrome resulting from functional and structural cardiovascular
disorders that impair right ventricular filling and or ejection. In clinical practice, the main
physiologic determinants of right ventricular performance mirror those of the left ventricle and
include preload, afterload, contractility, and active relaxation (lusitropy).[1] Right ventricular
failure often reflects impaired right ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling and is particularly
sensitive to acute increases in pulmonary vascular load.[4]
Furthermore, isolated right ventricular failure, despite its rarity as compared to left ventricular
failure, may carry a worse prognosis in selected settings. Right heart failure is also used
interchangeably with cor pulmonale when the pathology is caused by an underlying lung
disease.[2][5]
Classification
There are many different ways to categorize right heart failure, which includes whether the
abnormality is due to insufficient contraction (systolic dysfunction); or due to insufficient
relaxation of the heart (diastolic dysfunction), or to both; whether the problem is primarily
increased venous back pressure (preload), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion
(afterload); whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high systemic vascular
resistance or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low output heart failure vs. high
output heart failure); degree of functional impairment conferred by the abnormality (as reflected
in the New York Heart Association Functional Classification[6]); and the degree of coexisting
illness, such as heart failure with systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, or
chronic renal failure.
A practical approach is to classify right ventricular failure by time course (acute vs chronic) and
predominant mechanism, including pressure overload (afterload), volume overload (preload), and
primary myocardial dysfunction affecting contractility or lusitropy.[1][7]

The pathophysiological processes underlying right heart failure can be divided broadly into three:
decreased right ventricular contractility, right ventricular pressure overload, and right ventricular
volume overload.[8] The right ventricle tries to adapt acutely by dilatation and chronically by
hypertrophy. Whether dilatation or hypertrophy occur, right heart failure gets further exacerbated
as a result of these adaptive mechanisms.
Right ventricular performance is tightly linked to ventricular interdependence and pericardial
constraint. The right ventricle and left ventricle are anatomically and physiologically integrated
through the interventricular septum, and right ventricular pressure or volume overload can impair
left ventricular filling and output by shifting the septum and increasing pericardial restraint.[1] In
addition to load dependent mechanisms, cellular and molecular changes such as myocyte
hypertrophy, fibrosis, ischemia, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation contribute to
progressive right ventricular dysfunction across etiologies.[9][1]
Causes
There are acute and chronic causes of right heart failure. Acute right heart failure is often
associated with right ventricular dilation. Chronic right heart failure is often associated with right
ventricular hypertrophy.
Common etiologic categories include:
• Acute pressure overload: pulmonary embolism, acute worsening of pulmonary hypertension,
severe hypoxemia, and acute respiratory distress with high intrathoracic pressures from
mechanical ventilation.[1][7]
• Chronic pressure overload: pulmonary arterial hypertension and other forms of chronic
pulmonary hypertension with progressive right ventricle to pulmonary artery uncoupling.[3][10]
• Primary myocardial dysfunction: right ventricular myocardial infarction and inflammatory or
infiltrative cardiomyopathies affecting the right ventricle.[11]
• Volume overload: significant tricuspid regurgitation, intracardiac shunts, and chronic right sided
valvular lesions.[7]
• Right ventricular dysfunction secondary to systemic illness and critical illness, including sepsis
and severe viral infections; right ventricular dysfunction has also been reported in hospitalized
patients with COVID 19 and is associated with adverse outcomes.[12]
Epidemiology and Demographics
The prevalence of heart failure has been increasing due to the increase in the aging population,
early detection, preventive measures, and improvement in therapy. The prevalence of heart failure
in the United States was estimated in 2006 to be 5.8 million people of all ages with an estimated
incidence of 10 per 1000 for individuals older than 65 years of age.[13]
Right ventricular failure epidemiology varies by underlying substrate, and is particularly common
in advanced pulmonary hypertension, advanced left sided heart failure, and critical illness with
acute pulmonary vascular load. Contemporary guidance emphasizes recognizing right ventricular
dysfunction as a major determinant of symptoms, exercise limitation, and outcomes across these
populations.[1][7]

Right heart failure, if left undiagnosed and untreated, may lead to impaired quality of life and
eventually death. There are several factors that define this natural history depending mainly on the
underlying etiology or mechanism of injury, the onset of illness, how early treatment was initiated,
and other comorbidities.
Progression is often driven by a cycle of rising right sided filling pressures, impaired forward flow,
worsening systemic congestion with hepatic and renal dysfunction, and further neurohormonal
activation. In pressure overload states, worsening right ventricle to pulmonary artery uncoupling is
a key inflection point associated with clinical deterioration.[1][4]
Diagnosis
In the initial approach to a patient with right heart failure, it is important to determine the
underlying etiology, assess functional status, determine the presence of end organ dysfunction
(liver and kidney most notably), and identify associated conditions.
History and Symptoms
Right heart failure is frequently associated with shortness of breath, exercise intolerance and
coughing, and in later stages chest discomfort and swelling of the feet or ankles. According to the
2009 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Consensus Conference update on right sided heart failure,
right heart failure should be suspected when a patient presents with unexplained exercise
intolerance or hypotension with signs of elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema,
hepatomegaly, or a combination of these findings.[14]
Physical Exam
Physical exam should consist of a thorough cardiovascular exam, an abdominal exam, and
examination of the extremities. Findings to be aware of are cyanosis, JVD, S2 and S3 heart sounds,
ascites, hepatomegaly, and pedal edema.
Laboratory Findings
Laboratory tests are not diagnostic for heart failure, but they are essential to identify precipitating
factors of decompensation, assess severity, monitor adverse effects of therapy, and provide
prognostic information.[15] In addition, in patients with right heart failure, an arterial blood gas
can be useful in assessing hypoxemia and guiding oxygen therapy.
Electrocardiogram
Right heart failure is often accompanied by right ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular
dilation. General electrocardiographic findings of right ventricular hypertrophy include right axis
deviation, an R S ratio greater than 1 in V1, and the presence of P pulmonale.

The plain chest radiograph has limited utility in identifying right heart failure. It might show
evidence of underlying causes such as pulmonary embolism or congenital heart disease.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography plays a key role in the diagnosis of right heart failure by
evaluating right ventricular size and function, estimating pulmonary pressures, and assessing
tricuspid regurgitation. Recommended measures of right ventricular systolic function include
tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tissue Doppler S prime, right ventricular
fractional area change, and right ventricular longitudinal strain, interpreted in the context of
loading conditions and right ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling.[16][1]
Invasive Hemodynamics
Right heart catheterization can define the hemodynamic profile, quantify pulmonary vascular load,
and guide therapy in complex or refractory cases. In acute decompensation, invasive monitoring
may help assess response to preload adjustment and afterload targeted therapies, particularly
when clinical examination and noninvasive findings are discordant.[1][7]
Treatment
Medical Therapy
Currently, the basis of therapy for right heart failure includes cautious diuresis, rhythm
management, and treatment of the underlying cause when feasible. Management can be tailored to
etiology specific therapy such as anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism or antibiotics for
endocarditis. Management also comprises optimizing right ventricular preload, afterload and
contractility.
A contemporary approach emphasizes four parallel goals: optimize preload, reduce right
ventricular afterload, augment contractility when needed, and maintain systemic perfusion
pressure while treating the precipitating cause.[1][7]
Optimization of preload includes careful diuresis and management of venous congestion, while
avoiding excessive preload reduction that may lower cardiac output. In selected patients, invasive
hemodynamic guidance may be useful for titration.[1][7]
Reduction of afterload depends on etiology and includes reperfusion or anticoagulation for
acute pulmonary embolism, correction of hypoxemia and acidosis, minimizing injurious ventilator
settings, and targeted pulmonary vasodilator therapy for appropriate forms of pulmonary
hypertension.[1][10]
Augmentation of contractility may be required in shock or low output states. Dobutamine can
increase cardiac output and stroke volume in right ventricular myocardial infarction and in
pulmonary hypertension, and milrinone may be considered with attention to systemic vasodilation
and hypotension.[1][7]

Since atrial fibrillation and high grade AV block can cause hemodynamic instability in right heart
failure, maintaining sinus rhythm and atrioventricular synchrony is important.[17]
Surgery
Surgical intervention in right heart failure is mainly indicated for valvular pathologies and
congenital heart diseases causing progressive symptoms despite adequate medical interventions.
Early correction in selected settings can improve symptoms and outcomes. Treating primary
pulmonary hypertension may lead to improved functional capacity, and in selected cases, lung
transplant or heart lung transplant can extend survival.[17][7]
Mechanical Circulatory Support
Temporary mechanical circulatory support may be considered for patients with refractory acute
right ventricular failure and shock despite optimized pharmacotherapy and correction of reversible
causes.[1][18] Device selection should account for the mechanism of failure and the presence of
pulmonary arterial hypertension, since isolated right ventricular assist strategies may be
inappropriate when pulmonary vascular resistance is markedly elevated.[1]
Future or Investigational Therapies
A right ventricular assist device (RVAD) can be a temporary therapy for patients with acute
exacerbation of right heart failure. Ongoing research focuses on improved assessment of right
ventricle to pulmonary artery coupling and therapies that directly target right ventricular
contractility and lusitropy.[1]
