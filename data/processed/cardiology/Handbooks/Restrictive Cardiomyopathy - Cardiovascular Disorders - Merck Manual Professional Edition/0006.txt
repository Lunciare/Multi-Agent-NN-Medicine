Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

include dilated atria and myocardial hypertrophy. In amyloidosis an unusually bright echo pattern from the myocardium may be observed. Technetium- 99m pyrophosphate cardiac imaging is also useful in differentiating immunoglobulin light chain (AL) from transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloid. Strongly positive scans are specific for ATTR amyloid. Weakly positive scans may occur with AL amyloid, recent myocardial infarction, or significant chronic kidney disease. Because scan results are not always specific, AL amyloid should be ruled out using serum light chain and urine/serum immunofixation studies. Identifying the type of amyloid has implications for treatment, genetic counseling, and overall prognosis (1). If the diagnosis is still in doubt, MRI can show abnormal myocardial texture in disorders with myocardial infiltration (eg, by amyloid or iron). MRI as well as cardiac CT can detect pericardial thickening, which can help diagnose pericardial constriction, which can clinically mimic restrictive cardiomyopathy. 4/6 Cardiac FDG PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) assessment may be useful to identify inflammatory myocardial disorders such as cardiac sarcoidosis, which may manifest similarly to other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy. If a definitive diagnosis is not evident after noninvasive testing, invasive work-up with cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy should be considered. Catheterization detects high atrial pressure
