Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

an early stage, specific treatment of some underlying causes, such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, and Löffler syndrome, may help. Diuretics may be used for patients with edema or pulmonary vascular congestion but must be given cautiously because they can lower preload; the noncompliant ventricles depend on preload to maintain cardiac output. Digoxin does little to alter hemodynamic abnormalities and may cause serious arrhythmias in cardiomyopathy due to amyloidosis, in which extreme digitalis sensitivity is common. If heart rate is elevated, beta-blockers or rate-limiting calcium channel blockers may be used cautiously in low doses. Afterload reducers (eg, nitrates) may cause profound hypotension and usually are not useful. Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and transplantation are sometimes recommended (1). Prognosis for Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Prognosis is poor (see table Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies) because the diagnosis is often made at a late stage. No treatment is available for most patients; symptomatic, supportive care can be provided. Standard therapies that are used in dilated cardiomyopathy (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, digoxin, beta-blockers) are poorly tolerated in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy may also have autonomic dysfunction (especially in amyloid heart disease) or low systemic blood pressure. There is a high rate of
