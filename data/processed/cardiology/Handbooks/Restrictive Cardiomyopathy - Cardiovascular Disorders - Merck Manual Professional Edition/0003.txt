regions and affects both the left and right ventricles. TABLE Some Causes of Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Cause Examples Carcinoid tumors Endocardial fibroelastosis Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) Hypereosinophilic Endomyocardial syndrome (including disorders Löffler syndrome) Metastatic cancer Medications (eg, hydroxychloroquine, ergotamine, methysergide) Radiation Infiltrative disorders Amyloidosis 2/6 Cause Examples Sarcoidosis Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy Non-infiltrative Pseudoxanthoma disorders elasticum Systemic sclerosis Fabry disease Glycogen storage Storage diseases diseases Hemochromatosis Data from Gowda SN, Ali HJ, Hussain I.

Published 2022 Mar 14. doi:10.14797/mdcvj.1078 Pathophysiology of Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Endocardial thickening or myocardial infiltration (sometimes with death of myocytes, papillary muscle infiltration, compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, and fibrosis) may occur in one, typically the left, or both ventricles. As a result, the mitral or tricuspid valves may malfunction, leading to regurgitation. If nodal and conduction tissues are affected, the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular node malfunction, sometimes causing various grades of SA block and AV block. The main hemodynamic consequence is diastolic dysfunction with a rigid, noncompliant ventricle, impaired diastolic filling, and high filling pressure, leading to pulmonary venous hypertension. Systolic function may deteriorate if compensatory hypertrophy of infiltrated or fibrosed ventricles is inadequate. Mural thrombi can form, resulting in systemic emboli.
