Please read the introduction to the 7+2 step plan first.
The sinus node (SA) is located in the roof of the right atrium. It is the fastest physiological pacemaker. When the sinus node generates an electrical impulse, the surrounding cells of the right atrium depolarize. Then the cells of the left atrium, the AV (atrioventricular)node, follow, and at last the ventricles are stimulated via the His bundle.
With this knowledge it is quite simple to recognize normal sinus rhythm on the ECG.
Criteria for normal sinus rhythm (see also Basics):
A P wave morphology P wave (atrial contraction) precedes every QRS complex
The rhythm is regular, but varies slightly during respirations
The rate ranges between 60 and 100 beats per minute
The P waves maximum height at 2.5 mm in II and/or III
The P wave is positive in I and II, and biphasic in V1
As you can see, knowledge of heart rate and P wave morphology are necessary to determine the rhythm. We have put Rhythm as step 1 as it is of great importance. Arrhythmias include the most life-threatening ECG abnormalities. In most settings, however, the rhythm will be sinus.
If the rhythm is not sinus, the Arrhythmias algorithm should be followed.
Sinus arrhythmias
Some variants of sinus rhythm exist:
Asystole
Sinustachycardia (>100 beats per minute)
Sinusbradycardia (<60 beats per minute)
Sinus arrest or pause
Sino-atrial exit block
Sick Sinus Syndrome
Sinus Arrhythmia
Arrhythmias are discussed in the Arrhythmias chapter.
If the heart rate exceeds 100 bpm, the tachcyardia flow chart should be followed.
