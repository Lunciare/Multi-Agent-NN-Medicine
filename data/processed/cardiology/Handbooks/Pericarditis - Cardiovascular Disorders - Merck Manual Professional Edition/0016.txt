Pericarditis

amplitude increases and decreases on alternate beats). Electrical alternans is associated with variation in cardiac position (swinging heart). Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Pericardial Effusion IMAGE © 2017 ELLIOT K. FISHMAN, MD. Echocardiography estimates the volume of pericardial fluid; identifies cardiac tamponade, sometimes acute myocarditis, and/or heart failure; and may suggest the cause of pericarditis. Although CT can detect a pericardial effusion (often incidentally on a scan done for other conditions), it may overestimate its size and is not a first-line test to evaluate possible pericardial effusion. Patients with a normal ECG, small (< 1 cm on echocardiogram, or 100 mL) effusion, and no suspicious findings from the history and examination may be observed with serial examination and echocardiography. Other patients must be evaluated further to determine etiology. 10/21 Constrictive pericarditis Diagnosis may be suspected based on clinical, ECG, chest x-ray, and Doppler echocardiography findings, but cardiac catheterization and CT (or MRI) are often required. Rarely, right heart biopsy is needed to exclude restrictive cardiomyopathy. ECG changes are nonspecific. QRS voltage is usually low. T waves are usually nonspecifically abnormal. Atrial fibrillation occurs in about one third of patients; atrial flutter is less common. Lateral chest x-ray often shows
