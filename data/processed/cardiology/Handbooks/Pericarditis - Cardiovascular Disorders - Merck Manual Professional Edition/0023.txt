Pericarditis

patient. Needle pericardiocentesis is often best when the etiology is known or the presence of tamponade is in question. Surgical drainage is best when the presence of tamponade is certain but (because pericardial biopsy can be done surgically) the etiology is unclear. Laboratory test results of pericardial fluid other than culture and cytology are usually nonspecific. But specific diagnoses are sometimes possible using newer visual, cytologic, and immunologic analysis of fluid obtained via pericardioscopic-guided biopsy. Cardiac catheterization may be useful for evaluating pericarditis and identifying the cause of reduced cardiac function. CT or MRI can help identify metastases, although echocardiography is usually sufficient. Other tests include complete blood count, acute-phase reactants, routine chemistry tests, cultures, autoimmune tests, and, when appropriate, tests for HIV, histoplasmosis complement fixation (in endemic areas), and antibody tests for coxsackievirus, influenza virus, echovirus, and streptococcus. Anti-DNA and anti-RNA antibody tests may be useful. A tuberculin skin test (usually PPD) or interferon gamma release assay is done, but thees tests can give false-negative results; TB pericarditis can be ruled out only by culture of pericardial fluid for acid-fast bacilli. 14/21 Diagnosis references 1.
