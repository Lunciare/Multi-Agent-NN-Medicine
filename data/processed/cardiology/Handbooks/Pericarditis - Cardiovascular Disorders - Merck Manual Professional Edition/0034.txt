Pericarditis

C, Lazarou E, Tsioufis K: New Approaches to Management of Pericardial Effusions. Curr Cardiol Rep 23(8):106, 2021. Published 2021 Jul 1. doi:10.1007/s11886-021-01539-7 Key Points Patients with pericarditis may have symptoms and signs of pericardial inflammation and/or fluid accumulation (effusion). Electrocardiography and echocardiography are usually adequate for diagnosis, but right and left heart catheterization, CT, or MRI may be needed to diagnose constrictive pericarditis. Pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or colchicine; corticosteroids may be added for selected patients in whom the cause is noninfectious. Effusions usually respond to treatment of the cause, but recurrent or persistently symptomatic effusions may require drainage (percutaneous or surgical). 20/21 Symptomatic chronic constrictive pericarditis usually requires pericardial resection, although patients with early stage constrictive pericarditis can be treated with a trial of pharmacotherapy first.
