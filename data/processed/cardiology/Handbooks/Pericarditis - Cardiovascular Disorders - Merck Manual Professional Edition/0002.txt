Pericarditis

a small amount of fluid (< 25 to 50 mL), composed mostly of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. The pericardium limits acute cardiac distention and enhances the mechanical interactions of the cardiac chambers. The pericardium is richly innervated with sympathetic and somatic afferents. Stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors sense changes in cardiac volume and tension and may be responsible for transmitting pericardial pain. The phrenic nerves are embedded in the parietal pericardium and are vulnerable to injury during surgery on the pericardium. Pathophysiology of Pericarditis Pericarditis may be Acute Subacute Chronic Acute pericarditis develops quickly, causing inflammation of the pericardial sac and often a pericardial effusion. Inflammation can extend to the epicardial myocardium (myopericarditis). Adverse hemodynamic effects and rhythm disturbances are rare, although cardiac tamponade is possible. Acute disease may resolve completely, resolve and reoccur (up to 30% of acute cases) or become subacute or chronic (1). These forms develop more slowly. Subacute pericarditis occurs within weeks to months of an inciting event and may resolve spontaneously or with medical therapy. Chronic pericarditis is defined as pericarditis persisting > 6 months. Pericardial effusion is accumulation of fluid in the pericardium. The fluid may be serous fluid (sometimes with fibrin strands), serosanguineous fluid, blood, pus,
