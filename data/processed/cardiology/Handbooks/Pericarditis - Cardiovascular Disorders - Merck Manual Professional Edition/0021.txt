Pearls & Pitfalls Significant cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis; echocardiographic findings alone are not an indication for pericardiocentesis. If tamponade is suspected but not yet confirmed (eg, by clinical findings and echocardiography), right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterization may be done. In cardiac tamponade: 13/21 There is no early diastolic dip in the ventricular pressure record. Diastolic pressures are elevated (about 10 to 30 mm Hg) and equal in all cardiac chambers and in the pulmonary artery. In the atrial pressure curve, x descent is preserved and y descent is lost. In contrast, in severe congestive states due to dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary artery occlusion or left ventricular diastolic pressure usually exceeds right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular diastolic pressure by ≥ 4 mm Hg. Right heart catheterization should be considered particularly when draining an effusion, not only to confirm tamponade, but also to uncover possible constrictive pericarditis with effusion. Diagnosis of cause After pericarditis is diagnosed, tests to determine etiology and the effect on cardiac function are
