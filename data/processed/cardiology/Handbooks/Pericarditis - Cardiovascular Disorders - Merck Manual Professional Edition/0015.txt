history and ECG findings are atypical for pericarditis. Troponin is often elevated in acute pericarditis due to epicardial 9/21 inflammation, so it cannot discriminate between pericarditis, acute infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Very high levels of troponin may indicate myopericarditis. The CK-MB (creatine kinase muscle band isoenzyme) level, which is less sensitive than the troponin level, is usually normal in acute pericarditis unless myocarditis is also present. Postpericardiotomy and post-MI syndromes may be difficult to identify and must be distinguished from recent MI, pulmonary embolism, and pericardial infection after surgery. Pain, friction rub, and fever appearing 2 weeks to several months after surgery and a rapid response to aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids aids diagnosis. Pericardial effusion Diagnosis is suggested by clinical findings but often is suspected only after finding an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph. On ECG, QRS voltage is often decreased, and sinus rhythm remains in most patients. With large, chronic effusions, the ECG may show electrical alternans (ie, P, QRS, or T wave amplitude increases and decreases on alternate beats). Electrical alternans is associated with variation in cardiac position (swinging heart). Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Pericardial Effusion IMAGE © 2017 ELLIOT
