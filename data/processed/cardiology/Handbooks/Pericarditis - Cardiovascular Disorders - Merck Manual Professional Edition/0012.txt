Pericarditis

the rigid pericardium. AUDIO Diastolic Knock Ventricular systolic function (based on ejection fraction) is usually preserved. Prolonged elevation of pulmonary venous pressure results in dyspnea (particularly during exertion) and orthopnea. Fatigue may be severe. Distention of neck veins with a rise in venous pressure during inspiration (Kussmaul sign) is present; it is absent in tamponade. Pulsus paradoxus is rare and is usually less severe than in tamponade. Lungs are not congested unless severe left ventricular constriction develops. Diagnosis of Pericarditis Electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiograph Echocardiography Tests to identify cause (eg, pericardial fluid aspiration, pericardial biopsy) ECG and chest radiograph are done. Echocardiography is done to check for effusion, cardiac filling abnormalities that may suggest cardiac tamponade, and wall motion abnormalities characteristic of myocardial involvement. Blood tests may detect leukocytosis and elevated markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), which may be used to guide duration of therapy. Acute pericarditis The diagnosis is based on the presence of the following clinical findings and ECG abnormalities (1); these findings are not present in all cases. Characteristic chest pain Pericardial rub ECG abnormalities Pericardial effusion Serial ECGs may be needed to show abnormalities. The ECG in acute pericarditis may show
