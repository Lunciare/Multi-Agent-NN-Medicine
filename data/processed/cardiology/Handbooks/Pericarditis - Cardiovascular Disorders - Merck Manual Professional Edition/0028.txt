Pericarditis

controlled with colchicine (eg, 0.5 or 0.6 to 1.0 or 1.2 mg), aspirin (325 to 650 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours), or other NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours) (1). A proton pump inhibitor should be considered to improve the gastric tolerability of NSAIDs. The intensity of therapy is dictated by the patient’s distress. Severe pain may require opioids. Risk of recurrence may be decreased with NSAID treatment if the duration of treatment is 3 to 4 weeks, but this approach has not been studied adequately. Colchicine 0.5 or 0.6 mg to 1 or 1.2 mg orally once a day for 3 months as an adjunct significantly decreases the recurrence rate and symptom persistence in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis and is increasingly being used as first-line therapy (2). Although most mild cases of idiopathic and viral pericarditis respond well within a week, the optimal duration of treatment is unclear. Typically, patients should be treated at least until any effusion and evidence of inflammation (eg, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels) have resolved. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 to 80 mg orally once a day for 1
