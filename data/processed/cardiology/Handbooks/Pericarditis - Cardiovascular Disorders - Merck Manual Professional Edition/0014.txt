Echocardiography in acute pericarditis typically shows an effusion, which helps confirm the diagnosis, except in patients with purely fibrinous acute pericarditis in whom echocardiography is often normal. Findings indicating myocardial involvement include new focal or diffuse left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac MRI can detect the presence, severity, and acuity of pericardial inflammation but is generally not required to diagnose acute pericarditis. MRI can identify extension of inflammation into the subjacent myocardium (myopericarditis), which occurs in up to 15 to 24% of cases. Unlike perimyocarditis (isolated or prevalent myocarditis), there is no identified adverse long-term outcome (2). Acute Pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG J points, except aVR and V , are elevated. T waves are essentially normal. ST segments show 1 upward concave elevation. PR segments, except aVR and V , are depressed. PR deviations are 1 commonly absent in one limb lead (here, aVL). Because the pain of pericarditis may resemble that of acute MI or pulmonary infarction, additional tests (eg, serum cardiac biomarker measurement, lung scan) may be required if the history and ECG findings are atypical for pericarditis. Troponin is often elevated in acute pericarditis due to epicardial 9/21 inflammation, so it cannot discriminate between pericarditis, acute infarction, and pulmonary
