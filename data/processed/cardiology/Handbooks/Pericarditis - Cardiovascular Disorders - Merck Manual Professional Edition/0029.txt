Pericarditis

any effusion and evidence of inflammation (eg, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels) have resolved. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 to 80 mg orally once a day for 1 week, followed by rapid tapering of the dose) may be used in patients with specific indications (eg, systemic rheumatic disease, autoimmune or uremic pericarditis, failure to respond to colchicine or NSAIDs) but are not given routinely because they enhance viral multiplication and recurrence is common when the dosage is tapered; colchicine may be particularly useful during the corticosteroid taper. An alternative approach that may have a lower rate of recurrence is the use of prednisone at a lower dose (0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg 18/21 orally once a day) for 2 to 4 weeks followed by a slow taper over approximately 3 months. Tuberculous and pyogenic pericarditis should be excluded before corticosteroid therapy is initiated. Intrapericardial 2 instillation of triamcinolone 300 mg/m avoids systemic adverse effects and is highly effective but is typically reserved for patients with recurrent or refractory disease. Anticoagulants are usually contraindicated in acute pericarditis because they may cause intrapericardial bleeding and even fatal tamponade; however, they can be given in early pericarditis complicating acute MI. Uncommonly (eg,
