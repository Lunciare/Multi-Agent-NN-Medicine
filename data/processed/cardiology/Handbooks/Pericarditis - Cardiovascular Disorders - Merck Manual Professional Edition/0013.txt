are not present in all cases. Characteristic chest pain Pericardial rub ECG abnormalities Pericardial effusion Serial ECGs may be needed to show abnormalities. The ECG in acute pericarditis may show abnormalities confined to ST and PR segments and T waves, usually in most leads. (ECG changes in lead aVR are generally in the opposite direction of other leads.) Unlike MI, acute pericarditis does not cause 8/21 reciprocal depression in ST segments (except in leads aVR and V1), and there are no pathologic Q waves. ECG changes in pericarditis can occur in 4 stages although not all stages are present in all cases. Stage 1: ST segments show upward concave elevation; the PR segments may be depressed (see figure Acute Pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG). Stage 2: ST segments return to baseline; T waves flatten. Stage 3: T waves are inverted throughout the ECG; T wave–inversion occurs after the ST segment has returned to baseline and thus differs from the pattern of acute ischemia or MI. Stage 4: T wave changes resolve. Echocardiography in acute pericarditis typically shows an effusion, which helps confirm the diagnosis, except in patients with purely fibrinous acute pericarditis in whom echocardiography is often normal.
