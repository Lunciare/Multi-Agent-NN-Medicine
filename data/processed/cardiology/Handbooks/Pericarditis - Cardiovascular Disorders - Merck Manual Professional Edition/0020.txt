Pericarditis

and catheterization), can confirm constrictive pericarditis (2). When no pericardial thickening or fluid is seen, the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is favored but not proved. A normal pericardial thickness does not exclude constrictive pericarditis. Increased T2-weighted short TI inversion recovery (STIR) signal and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI can document active inflammation and resolution of constriction in response to anti- inflammatory therapy, whereas their absence suggests chronic constrictive pericarditis that is unlikely to be responsive to medical therapy. The degree of late gadolinium enhancement of the pericardium may be especially helpful in identifying patients in whom constriction will reverse or resolve. Cardiac tamponade Low voltage and electrical alternans on the ECG suggest cardiac tamponade, but these findings lack sensitivity and specificity (4). When tamponade is suspected, echocardiography is done unless even a brief delay might be life threatening. Then pericardiocentesis is done immediately for diagnosis and treatment. Echocardiographic findings that support tamponade include the following (5): Respiratory variation of transvalvular and venous flows Compression or collapse of right cardiac chambers in the presence of a pericardial effusion Inferior vena caval plethora (decrease in the proximal vena caval diameter by < 50% during deep inspiration) However, cardiac tamponade is primarily
