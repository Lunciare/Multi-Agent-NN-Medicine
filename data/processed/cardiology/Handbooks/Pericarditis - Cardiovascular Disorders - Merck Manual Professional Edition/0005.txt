Pericarditis

treatment for cardiac tamponade Etiology of Pericarditis Acute pericarditis may result from infection, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, uremia, trauma, myocardial infarction (MI), cancer, radiation therapy, or certain medications (see table Causes of Acute Pericarditis). Infectious pericarditis is most often viral or idiopathic (often presumed to be viral). Purulent bacterial pericarditis is uncommon but may follow infective endocarditis, pneumonia, septicemia, penetrating trauma, or cardiac surgery. Often, the cause cannot be identified (called nonspecific or idiopathic pericarditis), but many of these cases are probably viral. Acute myocardial infarction causes 7 to 12% of cases of acute pericarditis (1). Post-myocardial infarction syndrome (Dressler syndrome) is a less common cause, occurring mainly when reperfusion with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or thrombolytic drugs is ineffective in patients with transmural infarction (2). Pericarditis occurs after pericardiotomy (called postpericardiotomy syndrome) in 5 to 30% of cardiac operations (3). Postpericardiotomy syndrome, post-MI syndrome, and traumatic pericarditis (which includes iatrogenic pericarditis, after, eg, percutaneous cardiac intervention, pacemaker placement, and ablation) comprise the post-cardiac injury syndrome. Causes of Acute Pericarditis Cause Examples Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic rheumatic diseases Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Systemic sclerosis Cause Examples Gram-negative bacilli Haemophilus influenzae (in children) Lyme disease Bacterial infections Rheumatic fever Staphylococci Streptococci
