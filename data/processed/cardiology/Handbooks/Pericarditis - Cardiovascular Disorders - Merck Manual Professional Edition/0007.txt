Pericarditis

prolongation of acute pericarditis and thus has the same causes. Some patients have transient constriction occurring days to weeks after recovery from acute pericarditis. Chronic pericarditis with pericardial effusion or chronic constrictive pericarditis may follow acute pericarditis of almost any etiology. In high-resource areas, the most common antecedents of constrictive pericarditis are idiopathic/viral, prior cardiac surgery, and history of radiation therapy; the most common cause worldwide is tuberculous pericarditis (4). In addition, some cases occur without antecedent acute pericarditis. Chronic pericarditis with large effusion (serous, serosanguineous, or bloody) is most commonly caused by metastatic tumors (5), most often by lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, leukemia, or lymphoma. 5/21 Hypothyroidism may cause pericardial effusion and cholesterol pericarditis. Cholesterol pericarditis is a rare disorder that may be associated with myxedema, in which a chronic pericardial effusion has a high level of cholesterol that triggers inflammation and pericarditis. Sometimes no cause of chronic pericarditis is identified. Transient constrictive pericarditis is most commonly caused by infection or postpericardiotomy inflammation or is idiopathic. Fibrosis of the pericardium, sometimes leading to chronic constrictive pericarditis, may follow purulent pericarditis or accompany a systemic rheumatic disease. In older patients, common causes are malignant tumors, MI, and tuberculosis.
