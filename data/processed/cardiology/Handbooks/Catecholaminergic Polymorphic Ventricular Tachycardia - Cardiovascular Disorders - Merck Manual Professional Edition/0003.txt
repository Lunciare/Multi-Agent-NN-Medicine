Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia
KEYWORDS: cardiac, testing, exercise, patients, ventricular, symptoms, cpvt, genetic, genetic testing, exercise testing, heart, diagnosis, cardiac arrest, family, tachyarrhythmias

Diagnosis is confirmed by exercise testing–induced polymorphic VT (especially bidirectional VT) that also reproduces the patient's symptoms. Genetic testing should then be done; it has a yield of approximately 60% (1). First-degree family members of patients have a significant risk of disease. They should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia) and exercise testing performed every 1 to 3 years. If the initial patient has a causative mutation identified, family members without the index mutation are then freed of the need for follow-up investigations. Diagnosis reference 1.

Particularly those who will not accept exercise restrictions should be counseled on the need for appropriate cautions (eg, availability of an automated external defibrillator during training and competition). For patients who have had symptoms (eg, syncope, cardiac arrest)
