Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. Patients are predisposed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (less commonly atrial tachyarrhythmias) and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased adrenergic activity (eg, from exercise). Diagnosis is by exercise testing. Treatment is exercise restriction, beta-blockade, and sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). (See also Overview of Arrhythmias and Overview of Channelopathies.) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) results from mutations affecting proteins related to intracellular calcium regulation (particularly diastolic calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor) in the heart. The abnormalities increase release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to adrenergic stimulation.
