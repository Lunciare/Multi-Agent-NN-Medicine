Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. Patients are predisposed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (less commonly atrial tachyarrhythmias) and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased adrenergic activity (eg, from exercise). Diagnosis is by exercise testing. Treatment is exercise restriction, beta-blockade, and sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). (See also Overview of Arrhythmias and Overview of Channelopathies.) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) results from mutations affecting proteins related to intracellular calcium regulation (particularly diastolic calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor) in the heart. The abnormalities increase release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to adrenergic stimulation. The resulting myocyte calcium overload causes delayed after-depolarizations and a propensity to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death may occur. The tachyarrhythmias are usually precipitated by the adrenergic stimulation of physical or emotional stress. The most characteristic ventricular tachyarrhythmia is bidirectional ventricular tachycardia which appears on ECG as 2 QRS complexes of opposite polarity in an alternating pattern. Nevertheless, any polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may occur. The incidence of CPVT is unknown but has been estimated to be about 1 in 20,000 (1) and is equally common in males and
