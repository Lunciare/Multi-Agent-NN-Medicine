Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia

or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may occur. The incidence of CPVT is unknown but has been estimated to be about 1 in 20,000 (1) and is equally common in males and females. It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation of the gene encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor, but it may be inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation of cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2). Society (LAHRS) Expert Consensus Statement on the state of genetic testing for cardiac diseases. J Arrhythm 38(4):491–553, 2022. doi: 10.1002/joa3.12717 Symptoms and Signs of CPVT Some patients are asymptomatic and identified only on family screening. When symptoms occur, they usually develop at a young age (ie, childhood or adolescence). The tachyarrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope, or cardiac arrest. Events are typically triggered by emotional or physical stress. Diagnosis of CPVT Exercise testing Genetic testing Screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained cardiac arrest or syncope or a family history of such in the absence of structural heart disease. Resting ECG is normal. Diagnosis is confirmed by exercise testing–induced polymorphic VT (especially bidirectional VT) that also reproduces the patient's symptoms. Genetic testing should then be done; it has a yield of approximately 60%
