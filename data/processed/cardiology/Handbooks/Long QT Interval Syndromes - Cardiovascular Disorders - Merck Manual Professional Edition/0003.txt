The long QT interval syndromes

acute intracranial disasters (eg, bleeding, stroke, traumatic brain injury), eating disorders, organophosphate poisoning, and structural heart disease (especially acute ischemia, myocarditis, and ventricular hypertrophy). Many medications are risk factors, particularly class Ia, Ic, and III antiarrhythmic medications, as well as other medications, including tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, and certain antivirals and antifungals (see CredibleMeds for up-to-date information). Often, several of these factors are present (2). Etiology of Long QT Interval Syndromes Long QT interval syndromes are classified based on the specific gene that has mutated. However, a specific genetic abnormality is identified in only 70 to 85% of cases (1); likelihood of detecting an abnormality varies depending on clinical factors present. More than 15 forms of LQTS have been described, but most cases fall into 3 subgroups: Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQTS1): Loss-of-function mutation of gene KCNQ1, which encodes an adrenergic-sensitive Kv7.1 channel responsible for the slow outward potassium current (IKs) Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQTS2): Loss-of-function mutation of gene KCNH2, which encodes the hERG channel responsible for the rapid outward potassium current (IKr) Long QT syndrome type 3 (LQTS3): Gain-of-function mutation of gene SCN5A, which encodes the Nav1.5 channel responsible for the inward sodium current (INa).
