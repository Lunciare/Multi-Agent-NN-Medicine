The long QT interval syndromes

activity (eg, nadolol, slow-release propranolol) is preferred. When beta-blocker therapy is ineffective at relieving symptoms, mexiletine is added (most effective in LQTS3). Permanent pacing to increase the basal ventricular rate and to prevent post-extrasystolic pauses may reduce the probability of recurrent TdeP VT. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in patients who have been resuscitated after cardiac arrest and in those who have cardiac syncope 7/8 despite therapy with a beta-blocker (see table Indications for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation). Left heart (stellate ganglion) denervation may also be used (1). Key Points Congenital long QT interval syndromes may cause torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. Numerous factors, particularly use of certain medications, increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and electrocardiographic criteria, including exercise and sometimes provocative testing. Genetic testing is done on selected patients. Family members should be screened. Long-term management includes avoidance of triggers, use of beta-blockers, mexiletine, permanent pacing, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or stellate ganglion denervation.
