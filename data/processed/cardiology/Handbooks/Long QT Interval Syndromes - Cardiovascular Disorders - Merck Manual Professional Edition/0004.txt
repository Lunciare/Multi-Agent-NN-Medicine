The long QT interval syndromes

rapid outward potassium current (IKr) Long QT syndrome type 3 (LQTS3): Gain-of-function mutation of gene SCN5A, which encodes the Nav1.5 channel responsible for the inward sodium current (INa). The vast majority of cases are LQTS1, LQTS2, or LQTS3. These 3 forms are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders with incomplete penetrance. Rare forms of LQTS with additional clinical features have been described including Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (with congenital neural deafness), Andersen-Tawil syndrome (with period paralysis and craniofacial dysmorphisms), and Timothy syndrome (with craniofacial dysmorphisms, immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, developmental delay, and syndactyly). Overview of Long QT Syndrome Symptoms and Signs of Long QT Interval Syndromes The LQTS are asymptomatic unless TdeP VT occurs, which can cause palpitations, near syncope, or syncope. Some patients experience myoclonic jerks during syncope; they may incorrectly have a diagnosis of epilepsy pursued. Because the ventricular action potential duration decreases with increasing heart rate, TdeP VT is often self-terminating. However, it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause cardiac arrest and sudden death. In patients with LQTS, there is a 5-year risk of a first episode of life-threatening arrhythmia ranging from approximately 0.3% to 17% (1).
