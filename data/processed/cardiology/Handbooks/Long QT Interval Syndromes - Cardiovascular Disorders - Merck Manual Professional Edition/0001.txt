The long QT interval syndromes (LQTS) result from any congenital or acquired disorder of cardiac ion channel function or regulation (channelopathy) that prolongs ventricular myocyte action potential duration as reflected by prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval on the ECG. Patients are at risk for torsades de pointes polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which may cease spontaneously or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Diagnosis is by clinical criteria and ECG, sometimes with exercise and/or provocative testing. Treatment is avoidance of triggers, beta-blockade, and sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Long QT interval syndromes can be acquired, congenital, or both. (For discussion of acquired causes, see Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia). The incidence of congenital LQTS is approximately 1 in 2000 (1) and is the cause of about 15% of cardiac arrests that are unexplained after clinical evaluation that includes and ECG, an echocardiogram, and ruling out coronary artery disease (2). Pathophysiology of Long QT Interval Syndromes The congenital long QT interval syndromes result from genetic disorders of cardiac ion channel function or regulation (channelopathies) that prolong ventricular myocyte action potential duration as reflected by prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval on the ECG (QTc, typically calculated using Bazett's formula).
