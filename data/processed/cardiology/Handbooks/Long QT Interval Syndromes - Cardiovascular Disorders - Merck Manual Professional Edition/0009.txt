evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia) and ECG. Thereafter, the first-degree family members of any newly identified patients undergo similar assessment (cascade screening). Genetic testing is done when the index case has a known mutation. Exercise testing is done when the results could alter the Schwartz score probability result. Some forms of LQTS are more associated with certain triggers than others. LQTS1: Physical stress, particularly swimming, or emotional stress LQTS2: Sudden loud noises like an alarm clock LQTS3: Sleep Some forms of LQTS are also associated with particular ECG patterns LQTS1: Wide T waves LQTS2: Low voltage, notched T-waves LQTS3: Long-ST segment with normal appearing T-waves However, neither the triggers nor the ECG findings are very specific and should not be used to confirm type or to direct genetic testing. Treatment of Long QT Interval Syndromes Treatment of any VT/VF Alleviation of predisposing causes and triggers, especially electrolyte abnormalities and use of certain medications Usually beta-blockade Sometimes mexiletine Sometimes an ICD Sometimes left cardiac sympathetic denervation Details of treatment of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia are discussed elsewhere but include cardioversion for torsade-induced VF and magnesium sulfate IV. Patients with frequent or long runs of torsades de pointes
