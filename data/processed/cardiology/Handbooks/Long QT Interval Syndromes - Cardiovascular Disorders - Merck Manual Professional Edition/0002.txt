prolong ventricular myocyte action potential duration as reflected by prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval on the ECG (QTc, typically calculated using Bazett's formula). QT Interval Correction (EKG) The dysfunction may involve Loss of function of repolarizing potassium current channels OR Gain of function of depolarizing sodium or depolarizing calcium current channels Prolongation of action potentials increases the probability of transmembrane voltage oscillations occurring during the depolarized myocyte action potential (early afterdepolarizations). If the action potential durations of myocytes in a local area vary, these oscillations may reactivate neighboring myocytes that have repolarized and thus create torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdeP VT). The risk of TdeP VT is dependent on the degree of QTc prolongation, particularly if it is > 0.50 second (1). LQTS (particularly LQTS3) may also cause paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Predisposing factors for arrhythmia The occurrence of TdeP VT is favored by any condition that further prolongs action potential duration, including female sex, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypothyroidism. Other risk factors include slow or irregular ventricular rate, acute intracranial disasters (eg, bleeding, stroke, traumatic brain injury), eating disorders, organophosphate poisoning, and structural heart disease (especially acute ischemia, myocarditis, and ventricular hypertrophy). Many medications are risk factors, particularly
