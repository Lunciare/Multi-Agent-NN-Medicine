with LQTS, there is a 5-year risk of a first episode of life-threatening arrhythmia ranging from approximately 0.3% to 17% (1). Predictors include the following Age Sex Use of beta-blocker therapy (yes or no) Syncope (none, while not on beta-blocker therapy, or while on beta-blocker therapy) QTc interval Genotype (if available; higher in LQTS2 and LQTS3 than in LQTS-1) An online risk calculator for patients who have not yet had a life-threatening arrhythmia is available. Diagnosis of Long QT Interval Syndromes Characteristic clinical and electrocardiographic manifestations Sometimes exercise testing Sometimes ambulatory ECG monitoring Sometimes provocative testing using IV epinephrine or isoproterenol Often genetic testing Screening of relatives Diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained cardiac arrest or syncope or a family history of such when the affected people do not have structural heart disease. It should also be considered in people who are discovered to have a long QT interval when ECG is done for other reasons. A long QT interval is diagnosed by ECG showing prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc). Normal QTc values are < 0.43 second for males and < 0.45 second for females and are considered prolonged when > 0.45 second for males or
