ventricular outflow tract, and the impulse spreads inferiorly. The electrocardiogram typically shows right axis deviation, with a left bundle branch block pattern. The tachycardia may be brief and self terminating or sustained, and it may be provoked by catecholamine release, sudden changes in heart rate, and exercise. The tachycardia usually responds to drugs such as β blockers or calcium antagonists. Occasionally the arrhythmia stops with adenosine treatment and so may be misdiagnosed as a supraventricular tachycardia. Torsades de pointes tachycardia Torsades de pointes (“twisting of points”) is a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in which the cardiac axis rotates over a sequence of 5-20 beats, changing from one direction to another and back again. The QRS amplitude varies similarly, such that the complexes appear to twist around the baseline. In sinus rhythm the QT interval is prolonged and prominent U waves may be seen. Torsades de pointes may be drug induced or secondary to electrolyte disturbances Torsades de pointes is not usually sustained, but it will recur unless the underlying cause is corrected. Occasionally it may be prolonged or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. It is associated with conditions that prolong the QT interval. Transient prolongation of the QT interval is
