Broad complex tachycardia—Part II - PMC

is, they relate to the heart rate and the underlying cardiac reserve rather than to the origin of the arrhythmia. It is wrong to assume that a patient with ventricular tachycardia will inevitably be in a state of collapse; some patients look well but present with dizziness, palpitations, syncope, chest pain, or heart failure. In contrast, a supraventricular tachycardia may cause collapse in a patient with underlying poor ventricular function. Clinical evidence of atrioventricular dissociation—that is, “cannon” waves in the jugular venous pulse or variable intensity of the first heart sound—indicates a diagnosis of a ventricular tachycardia The absence of these findings, however, does not exclude the diagnosis. Electrocardiographic differences Direct evidence of independent P wave activity is highly suggestive of ventricular tachycardia, as is the presence of fusion beats or captured beats. The duration of QRS complexes is also a key differentiating feature: those of >0.14 s generally indicate a ventricular origin. Concordance throughout the chest leads also indicates ventricular tachycardia. 6/14 In ventricular tachycardia the rhythm is regular or almost regular; if the rhythm is obviously irregular the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation with either aberrant conduction or pre-excitation A previous electrocardiogram may give valuable information.
