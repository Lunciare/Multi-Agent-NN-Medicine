It is much less common than torsades de pointes. If sustained, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often leads to haemodynamic collapse. It can occur in acute myocardial infarction and may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia must be differentiated from atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation, as both have the appearance of an irregular broad complex tachycardia with variable QRS morphology (see last week's article). 3/14 Differentiation between ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with bundle branch block If the tachycardia has a right bundle branch block morphology (a predominantly positive QRS complex in lead V1), a ventricular origin is suggested if there is: QRS complex with duration >0.14 s Axis deviation A QS wave or predominantly negative complex in lead V6 Concordance throughout the chest leads, with all deflections positive A single (R) or biphasic (QR or RS) R wave in lead V1 A triphasic R wave in lead V1, with the initial R wave taller than the secondary R wave and an S wave that passes through the isoelectric line If the tachycardia has a left bundle branch block morphology (a predominantly negative deflection in lead V1), a ventricular origin is suggested if there is: Axis deviation QRS complexes with duration >0.16
