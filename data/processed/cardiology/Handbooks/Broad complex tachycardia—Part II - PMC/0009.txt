Broad complex tachycardia—Part II - PMC

or almost regular; if the rhythm is obviously irregular the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation with either aberrant conduction or pre-excitation A previous electrocardiogram may give valuable information. Evidence of a myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of ventricular tachycardia, and if the mean frontal plane axis changes during the tachycardia (especially if the change is >40° to the left or right) this points to a ventricular origin. Adenosine can also be used to block conduction temporarily through the atrioventricular node to ascertain the origin of a broad complex tachycardia, but failure to stop the tachycardia does not necessarily indicate a ventricular origin Ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with bundle branch block may produce similar electrocardiograms. If a previous electrocardiogram shows a bundle branch block pattern during sinus rhythm that is similar to or identical with that during the tachycardia, the origin of the tachycardia is likely to be supraventricular. But if the QRS morphology changes during the tachycardia, a ventricular origin is indicated. The emergency management of a broad complex tachycardia depends on the wellbeing of the patient and the origin of the arrhythmia. Vagal stimulation—for example, carotid sinus massage or the Valsalva manoeuvre—does not usually affect a ventricular
