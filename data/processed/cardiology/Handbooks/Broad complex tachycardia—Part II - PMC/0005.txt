Broad complex tachycardia—Part II - PMC

tachycardia has a left bundle branch block morphology (a predominantly negative deflection in lead V1), a ventricular origin is suggested if there is: Axis deviation QRS complexes with duration >0.16 s A QS or predominantly negative deflection in lead V6 Concordance throughout the chest leads, with all deflections negative An rS complex in lead V1 Broad complex tachycardias of supraventricular origin In the presence of aberrant conduction or ventricular pre-excitation, any supraventricular tachycardia may present as a broad complex tachycardia and mimic ventricular tachycardia. Atrial tachycardia with aberrant conduction Aberrant conduction is defined as conduction through the atrioventricular node with delay or block, resulting in a broader QRS complex. Aberrant conduction usually manifests as left or right bundle branch block, both of which have characteristic features. The bundle branch block may predate the tachycardia, or it may be a rate related functional block, occurring when atrial impulses arrive too rapidly for a bundle branch to conduct normally. When atrial fibrillation occurs with aberrant 4/14 conduction and a rapid ventricular response, a totally irregular broad complex tachycardia is produced. The Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is discussed in more detail in an earlier article, on junctional tachycardias Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Broad complex tachycardias may also
