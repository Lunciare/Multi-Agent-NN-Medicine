the atrioventricular node and produce a normal QRS complex or a fusion beat. The result is a completely irregular and often rapid broad complex tachycardia with a fairly constant QRS pattern, except for occasional normal complexes and fusion beats. Differentiating between ventricular and supraventricular origin 5/14 Clinical presentation Age is a useful factor in determining the origin of a broad complex tachycardia: a tachycardia in patients aged over 35 years is more likely to be ventricular in origin. A history that includes ischaemic heart disease or congestive cardiac failure is 90% predictive of ventricular tachycardia. Danger of misdiagnosis The safest option is to regard a broad complex tachycardia of uncertain origin as ventricular tachycardia unless good evidence suggests a supraventricular origin If a ventricular tachycardia is wrongly treated as supraventricular tachycardia, the consequences may be extremely serious Giving verapamil to a patient with ventricular tachycardia may result in hypotension, acceleration of the tachycardia, and death The symptoms associated with broad complex tachycardia depend on the haemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmia—that is, they relate to the heart rate and the underlying cardiac reserve rather than to the origin of the arrhythmia. It is wrong to assume that a patient with ventricular
