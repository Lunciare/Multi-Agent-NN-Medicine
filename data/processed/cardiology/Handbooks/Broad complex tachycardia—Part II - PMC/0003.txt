Broad complex tachycardia—Part II - PMC

cause is corrected. Occasionally it may be prolonged or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. It is associated with conditions that prolong the QT interval. Transient prolongation of the QT interval is often seen in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, and this may lead to torsades de pointes. Ability to recognise torsades de pointes is important because its management is different from the management of other ventricular tachycardias. 2/14 Causes of torsades de pointes Drugs Electrolyte disturbances • Antiarrhythmic drugs: class Ia • Hypokalaemia (disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine); class III (amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol) • Antibacterials: • Hypomagnesaemia erythromycin, fluoquinolones, Congenital syndromes trimethoprim • Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome • Other drugs: terfenadine, cisapride, tricyclic • Romano-Ward syndrome antidepressants, haloperidol, lithium, phenothiazines, chloroquine, thioridazine Other causes • Ischaemic heart disease • Myxoedema • Bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or complete heart block • Subarachnoid haemorrhage Open in a new tab Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia has the electrocardiographic characteristics of torsades de pointes but in sinus rhythm the QT interval is normal. It is much less common than torsades de pointes. If sustained, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia often leads to haemodynamic collapse. It can occur in acute myocardial infarction and may deteriorate into
