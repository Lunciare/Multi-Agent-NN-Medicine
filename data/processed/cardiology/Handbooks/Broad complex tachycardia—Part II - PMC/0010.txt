Broad complex tachycardia—Part II - PMC

complex tachycardia depends on the wellbeing of the patient and the origin of the arrhythmia. Vagal stimulation—for example, carotid sinus massage or the Valsalva manoeuvre—does not usually affect a ventricular tachycardia but may affect arrhythmias of supraventricular origin. By transiently slowing or blocking conduction through the atrioventricular node, an atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia or atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia may be terminated. In atrial flutter transient block may reveal the underlying flutter waves.
