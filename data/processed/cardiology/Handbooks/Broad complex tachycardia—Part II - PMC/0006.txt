a totally irregular broad complex tachycardia is produced. The Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is discussed in more detail in an earlier article, on junctional tachycardias Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Broad complex tachycardias may also occur in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, either as an antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia or in association with atrial flutter or fibrillation. Antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia In this relatively uncommon tachycardia the impulse is conducted from the atria to the ventricles via the accessory pathway. The resulting tachycardia has broad, bizarre QRS complexes. Atrial fibrillation In patients without an accessory pathway the atrioventricular node protects the ventricles from the rapid atrial activity that occurs during atrial fibrillation. In the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome the atrial impulses are conducted down the accessory pathway, which may allow rapid conduction and consequently very fast ventricular rates. Drugs that block the atrioventricular node—such as digoxin, verapamil, and adenosine —should be avoided as they can produce an extremely rapid ventricular response The impulses conducted via the accessory pathway produce broad QRS complexes. Occasionally an impulse will be conducted via the atrioventricular node and produce a normal QRS complex or a fusion beat. The result is a completely irregular and often rapid broad complex tachycardia with a fairly constant QRS
