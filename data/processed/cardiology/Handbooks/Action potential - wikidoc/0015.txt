model membranes containing ion channels, such as this one containing at channels for sodium (blue) and potassium (green). Propagation In unmyelinated axons, action potentials propagate as an interaction between passively spreading membrane depolarization and voltage-gated sodium channels. When one patch of cell membrane is depolarized enough to open its voltage-gated sodium channels, sodium ions enter the cell by facilitated diffusion. Once inside, positively-charged sodium ions "nudge" adjacent ions down the axon by electrostatic repulsion (analogous to the principle behind Newton's cradle) and attract negative ions away from the adjacent membrane. As a result, a wave of positivity moves down the axon without any individual ion moving very far. Once the adjacent patch of membrane is depolarized, the voltage-gated sodium channels in that patch open, regenerating the cycle. The process repeats itself down the length of the axon, with an action potential regenerated at each segment of membrane. 8/14 Propagating action potentials can be modeled by joining several RC circuits, each one representing a patch of membrane. Speed of propagation See also: Time constant and Length constant Action potentials propagate faster in axons of larger diameter, other things being equal. They typically travel from 10 – 100 m/s.
