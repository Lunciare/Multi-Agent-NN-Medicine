Action potential
KEYWORDS: potential, action, membrane, cell, sodium, action potential, channels, potentials, action potentials, potassium, ions, resting, membrane potential, current, axon

A schematic view of an idealized action potential illustrates its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a cell membrane. Actual recordings of action potentials are often distorted compared to the schematic view because of variations in electrophysiological techniques used to make the recording Action potentials are not the same in all cell types and can even vary in their properties at different locations in the same cell. For example, cardiac action potentials are significantly different from the action potentials in most neurons. This article is primarily concerned with the "typical" action potential of axons. There is always a difference in electrostatic potential between the inside and outside of a cell, i.e. the cell is polarized.
