voltage relationship. It represents the peak current through channels at a given voltage 6/14 before any inactivation has taken place (i.e. ~ 1 ms after stepping to that voltage) for the Na current. The most positive voltages in this plot are only attainable by the cell through artificial means - i.e. voltages imposed by the voltage-clamp apparatus). A plot of current (ion flux) against voltage (transmembrane potential) illustrates the action potential threshold (red arrow) of an idealized cell. Four significant points in the I/V curve are indicated by arrows in the figure: 1. • The green arrow indicates the resting potential of the cell and also the value of the equilibrium potential for potassium (E ). As the K+ channel is the only one open at these negative voltages, k the cell will rest at E . k 2. • The yellow arrow indicates the equilibrium potential for Na+ (E ). In this two-ion system, E Na Na is the natural limit of membrane potential beyond which a cell cannot pass. Current values illustrated in this graph that exceed E are measured by artificially pushing the cell's voltage Na past its natural limit. Note however, that E could only be
