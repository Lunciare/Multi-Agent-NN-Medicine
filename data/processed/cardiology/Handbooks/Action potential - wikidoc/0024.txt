Action potential

all scientists working in the field. However there are a few observations not easily reconciled with the model: • A signal traveling along a neuron is accompanied by a slight local thickening of the membrane and a force acting outwards.[3] • An action potential traveling along a neuron results in a slight increase in temperature followed by a decrease in temperature;[4] electrical charges traveling through a resistor however always produce heat. One recent alternative, the soliton model, attempts to explain signals in neurons as pressure (or sound) solitons traveling along the membrane, accompanied by electrical field changes resulting from piezo-electric effects.
