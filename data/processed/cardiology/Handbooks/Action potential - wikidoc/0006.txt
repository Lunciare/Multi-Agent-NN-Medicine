resting cell membrane is approximately 75 times more permeable to potassium than to sodium because potassium leak 4/14 channels are always open. As a result, the cell's resting membrane potential is closer to the equilibrium potential of potassium (=E =−80 mV) than the equilibrium potential of sodium K (=E =+60 mV). Na Like the resting potential, action potentials depend upon the permeability of the cell membrane to sodium and potassium ions. Transient changes in conductance for different ions cause the changes in membrane potential necessary to initiate, sustain, and terminate action potentials. Phases The sequence of events that underlie the action potential are outlined below: Resting potential At resting potential some potassium leak channels are open but the voltage-gated sodium channels are closed. Even though no net current flows, potassium, the major ion species, moves across the membrane, thus pulling the resting potential close to the K+ equilibrium potential. Stimulation A local membrane depolarization caused by an excitatory stimulus causes some voltage-gated sodium channels in the neuron cell surface membrane to open, allowing sodium ions to diffuse in through the channels along their electrochemical gradient. Because they are positively charged, they begin a reversal in the potential difference across the
