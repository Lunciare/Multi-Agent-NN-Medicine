pass. Current values illustrated in this graph that exceed E are measured by artificially pushing the cell's voltage Na past its natural limit. Note however, that E could only be reached if the potassium current were Na absent. 3. • The blue arrow indicates the maximum voltage that the peak of the action potential can approach. This is the actual natural maximum membrane potential that this cell can reach. It cannot reach E because of the counteracting influence of the potassium current. Na 4. • The red arrow indicates the action potential threshold. This is where I becomes net-inward. sum Note that this is a zero-current crossing, but with a negative slope. Any such "negative slope crossing" of the zero current level in an I/V plot is an unstable point. At any voltage negative to this crossing, the current is outward and so a cell will tend to return to its resting potential. At any voltage positive of this crossing, the current is inward and will tend to depolarize the cell. This depolarization leads to more inward current, thus the sodium current become regenerative. The point at which the green line reaches its most negative value is the point where
