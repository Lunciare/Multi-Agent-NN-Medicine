by augmentation with the Jendrassik maneuver (eg, asking the patient to try to pull the hands apart while they are clasped together). Hyporeflexia may be normal throughout life or occur with aging, but findings should be symmetric and augmentation should elicit reflexes that are otherwise absent. The plantar (Babinski) reflex is tested. The following responses suggest certain disorders or locations of lesions: The classic Babinski reflex (the great toe extends and the other toes fan apart) is highly specific for a corticospinal tract lesion (except in infants, where the reflex is physiologic because the corticospinal tract is immature). A normal jaw jerk and hyperreflexic arms and legs suggest a cervical lesion affecting the corticospinal tract, usually cervical stenosis. Anal tone, anal wink reflex, or both are reduced or absent in spinal cord injury but are preserved in ascending paralysis due to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Abdominal reflexes are absent below the level of spinal cord injury (except in ALS where they are inexplicably preserved). A cremasteric reflex can test the integrity of the upper lumbar cord and roots in males. Evaluation also includes: Testing for back tenderness to percussion (present with vertebral inflammation, some vertebral tumors, and epidural abscess) Straight leg raising
