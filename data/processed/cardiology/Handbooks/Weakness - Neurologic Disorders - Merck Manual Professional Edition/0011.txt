particularly about the ability to do specific tasks, including brushing teeth or hair, speaking, swallowing, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and walking. Clinicians should also ask about the onset of weakness (sudden or gradual), whether it varies throughout the day (diurnal variation as occurs in myasthenia gravis) and progression (eg, constant, worsening, intermittent) of symptoms. Close questioning is needed to differentiate sudden onset from sudden recognition; patients may suddenly recognize symptoms only after slowly progressive weakness crosses a threshold that prevents them from doing some normally routine task (eg, walking, tying shoes). Important associated symptoms include sensory changes, double vision, memory loss, difficulty using language, seizures, and headaches. Factors that worsen weakness, such as heat (suggesting multiple sclerosis) or repetitive use of a muscle (suggesting myasthenia gravis), are noted. Review of systems should seek symptoms suggesting possible causes, including the following: Daily fatigue and weakness that increases with heat and humidity: Multiple sclerosis Diurnal variation of fatigue and weakness: Myasthenia gravis Rash: Dermatomyositis, Lyme disease, or syphilis Fevers: Chronic infection Muscle pain: Myositis Neck pain: Cervical myelopathy Vomiting or diarrhea: Botulism Shortness of breath: Heart failure, a pulmonary disorder, or anemia Anorexia and weight loss: Cancer or other chronic
