VDRL = Venereal Disease Research Laboratory. Fatigue Many patients report weakness when their problem is fatigue. Fatigue can prevent maximal effort and muscle performance during strength testing. Common causes of fatigue include acute severe illness of almost any cause, cancers, chronic infections (eg, HIV infection, hepatitis, endocarditis, mononucleosis), endocrine disorders, renal failure, hepatic failure, heart failure, and anemia. Multiple sclerosis can cause daily fatigue that increases with exposure to heat and humidity. Patients with fibromyalgia, depression, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome may report weakness or fatigue but have no defined objective abnormalities. Evaluation of Weakness Evaluation of weakness should try to distinguish true muscular weakness from fatigue, then check for findings that help establish the location or mechanism (eg, whether weakness is caused by dysfunction of the brain, spinal cord, plexuses, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscles) and, when possible, the cause. History History of present illness should begin with open-ended questions, asking patients to describe in detail what they are experiencing as weakness. Then, specific questions can be asked, particularly about the ability to do specific tasks, including brushing teeth or hair, speaking, swallowing, rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and walking. Clinicians should also ask about the onset
