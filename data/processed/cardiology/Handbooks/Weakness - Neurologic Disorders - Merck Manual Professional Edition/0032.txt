include electromyography and nerve conduction studies to confirm the diagnosis and exclude treatable disorders that mimic motor neuron disorders (eg, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block). Brain MRI may show degeneration of the corticospinal tracts when ALS is advanced. Spinal cord MRI (or CT myelography) is done routinely to exclude spinal cord compression or other myelopathies (see table Some Causes of Muscle Weakness). Testing for specific disorders may be needed: If findings suggest myasthenia gravis, an ice pack test and serologic testing (eg, acetylcholine receptor antibody levels, sometimes anti–muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies) If findings suggest vasculitis, autoantibody testing If family history suggests a hereditary disorder, genetic testing If findings suggest polyneuropathy, other tests (see table Some Causes of Muscle Weakness) If myopathy is unexplained by drugs, metabolic, or endocrine disorders, possibly muscle biopsy 17/19 Treatment of Weakness Causes of muscle weakness are treated. For patients with life-threatening, acute weakness, ventilatory support may be needed. Physical and occupational therapy can help people adapt to permanent weakness and minimize loss of function, regardless of the cause. Geriatrics Essentials: Weakness Some decrease in deep tendon reflexes is common with aging, but asymmetry or absence of these reflexes with augmentation
