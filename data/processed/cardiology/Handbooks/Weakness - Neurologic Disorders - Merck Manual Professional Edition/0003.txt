in legs than arms) and produce signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction (eg, decreased reflexes and muscle tone). The most common disorder of the neuromuscular junction—myasthenia gravis— typically causes fluctuating weakness that worsens with activity and lessens with rest. Diffuse muscle dysfunction (eg, in myopathies) tends to be most noticeable in the largest muscle groups (proximal muscles). Etiology of Weakness The many causes of muscle weakness are categorized by location of the lesion (see table Some Causes of Muscle Weakness). Lesions in a given location usually manifest with similar clinical findings. However, some disorders have characteristics of lesions in more than one location. For example, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may have findings of both upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction. Disorders of the spinal cord may affect tracts from upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons (anterior horn cells), or both. Common causes of focal weakness include: Stroke (the most common cause of unilateral weakness) Neuropathies, including those caused by trauma or entrapment (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome) and those that are immune-mediated (eg, Bell palsy) Spinal root entrapment (eg, herniated intervertebral disk) Spinal cord compression (eg, cervical spondylosis, epidural cancer metastasis, trauma) Multiple sclerosis Temporary focal weakness may be
