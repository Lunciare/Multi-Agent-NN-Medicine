Weakness

that are immune-mediated (eg, Bell palsy) Spinal root entrapment (eg, herniated intervertebral disk) Spinal cord compression (eg, cervical spondylosis, epidural cancer metastasis, trauma) Multiple sclerosis Temporary focal weakness may be due to postictal (Todd) paralysis, which usually resolves over several hours, or result from a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A rare cause of temporary weakness is periodic paralysis, often caused by changes in potassium concentrations. The most common causes of generalized weakness are: Deconditioning due to inactivity (disuse atrophy) resulting from illness or frailty, especially in older patients Generalized muscle wasting due to prolonged immobilization in an intensive care unit (ICU) —a condition called critical illness myopathy Critical illness polyneuropathy (ICU neuropathy) Common myopathies (eg, alcohol myopathy, hypokalemia, glucocorticoid-induced myopathy) Some Causes of Muscle Weakness Cause Suggestive Findings Diagnostic Approach*,† Brain upper motor neuron lesions Increased muscle tone, Brain imaging with CT or hyperreflexia, extensor MRI Brain tumors plantar (Babinski) reflex For multiple sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis Possibly more stiffness MRI of the brain and the and loss of fine motor cervical and thoracic spinal Stroke control (finger dexterity) cord (not CT); sometimes than weakness (hand grip) lumbar puncture Myelopathies (involving upper or lower motor neuron dysfunction or both) Autoimmune disorders
