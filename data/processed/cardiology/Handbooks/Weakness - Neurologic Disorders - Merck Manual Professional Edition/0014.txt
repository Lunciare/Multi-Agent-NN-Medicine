is suggested by inability to clearly articulate certain consonants (eg, saying "ta-ta-ta") and slurring of speech (lingual dysarthria). Mild asymmetry during tongue protrusion may be normal. Tongue fasciculations may be seen in patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius strength is tested by having the patient rotate the head and shrug the shoulders against resistance. The patient is asked to blink repeatedly to see whether blinking fatigues. Motor examination includes inspection, assessment of tone, and strength testing. The body is inspected for kyphoscoliosis (sometimes suggesting chronic weakness of paraspinal muscles) and for surgical and traumatic scars. Dystonic posturing (eg, torticollis) may interfere with movement, mimicking weakness. Muscles are inspected for fasciculations and atrophy; both may begin focally or asymmetrically in patients with ALS. Diffuse atrophy may be most evident in the hands, face, and 9/19 shoulder girdle. If myasthenia gravis is suspected, patients are asked to look up for a prolonged period (minutes), noting if the eyelids start to droop. Muscle tone is assessed using passive motion. Tapping a muscle (eg, hypothenar) may induce fasciculations in neuropathies or a myotonic contraction in myotonic dystrophy. Strength testing should include muscles that are proximal, distal, extensor, and flexor. Some
