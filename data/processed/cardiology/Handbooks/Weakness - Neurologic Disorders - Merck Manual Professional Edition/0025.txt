of the body: A contralateral hemispheric lesion, most often a stroke Upper or lower motor neuron signs (or both) plus loss of sensation below a segmental spinal cord level and loss of bowel or bladder control (or both): A spinal cord lesion Lower motor pattern of weakness in the hands (flexors and extensors both involved, with atrophy of the hands and hyporeflexia) with upper motor neuron distribution weakness in the legs (flexors weaker than extensors, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski and spasticity): Structural cervical spinal cord disease (cervical spondylosis), syringomyelia (often associated with a cape-like loss of pain and temperature and sparing vibration and proprioception distally), or motor neuron disease (eg, ALS) Weakness with lower motor neuron signs may result from a disorder affecting one or more peripheral nerves; such a disorder has very specific patterns of weakness (eg, wristdrop in radial nerve injury). When the brachial or lumbosacral plexus is damaged, motor, sensory, and reflex deficits are often patchy and do not follow any one peripheral nerve pattern. Determination of a specific causative disorder Sometimes combinations of findings suggest a cause (see table Findings Related to Weakness Suggesting a Specific Disorder).
