Weakness

when corticospinal tract lesions are the cause of weakness. Spastic gait is notable for scissoring (legs flexed slightly at the hips and knees, giving the appearance of crouching, with the knees and thighs hitting or crossing in a scissors-like movement) and walking on the toes. A steppage gait (also referred to as marching gait: foot lifted high to avoid scraping toe) and foot drop may occur with peroneal nerve palsy. Sensation is tested; sensory deficits can help localize some lesions causing weakness (eg, sensory level localizes the lesion to a spinal cord segment) or suggest certain specific causes of weakness (eg, distal sensory loss helps confirm clinical suspicion of Guillain-Barré syndrome). A truncal bandlike tingling and pressure in a dermatomal distribution is a spinal cord sign that occurs with both intrinsic (within the spinal cord, such as with multiple sclerosis) and extrinsic lesions. Extrinsic lesions may arise from a tumor, blood, abscess, or a sequestrated vertebral disk. Reflexes are tested. If deep tendon reflexes appear absent, they may be elicited by augmentation with the Jendrassik maneuver (eg, asking the patient to try to pull the hands apart while they are clasped together). Hyporeflexia may be normal throughout life or occur
