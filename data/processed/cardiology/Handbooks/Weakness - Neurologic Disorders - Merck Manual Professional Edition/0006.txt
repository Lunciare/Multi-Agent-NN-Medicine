HTLV-1 or VDRL, genetic Classically dermatomal Spinocerebellar ataxias sensory level testing, serum copper and ceruloplasmin Subacute combined degeneration Transverse myelitis Motor neuron disorders (upper, lower, or both) 3/19 Cause Suggestive Findings Diagnostic Approach*,† Progressive weakness and Electromyography and Amyotrophic lateral fatigability, clumsiness, brain and spinal cord MRI, sclerosis spasticity (upper motor CT myelography, or both Inherited motor neuron neuron) Other tests as needed to diseases (eg, spinal Hyporeflexia or flaccidity help identify the cause: muscular or (lower motor neuron) Possibly including 24-hour spinocerebellar atrophies, urine heavy metal screen including Kennedy Muscle atrophy (lower to exclude lead disease) motor neuron) neuropathy, anti-GM1 Postpoliomyelitis Fasciculations (lower antibody titers (for syndrome motor neuron) multifocal motor Gynecomastia, diabetes, neuropathy), and genetic Progressive bulbar palsy and testicular atrophy testing (eg, for Kennedy Viral polio-like disorders (Kennedy disease) disease) Polyneuropathies (mostly, peripheral polyneuropathies)†,‡ Alcohol-related Hyporeflexia, sometimes Tests to confirm the neuropathy fasciculations presence of neuropathy: Electrodiagnostic testing Critical illness If chronic, muscle atrophy polyneuropathy Other tests as needed to In peripheral help identify the cause: Demyelinating polyneuropathy, Possibly including plasma neuropathies (eg, CIDP, disproportionate glucose, 2-hour oral Guillain-Barré syndrome) weakness of most distal glucose tolerance test, muscles and often sensory Diabetic neuropathy hemoglobin A1C, RPR, HIV
