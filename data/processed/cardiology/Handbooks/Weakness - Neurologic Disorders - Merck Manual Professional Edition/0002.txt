junction Muscle (eg, due to myopathies) The location of certain lesions correlates with physical findings: Upper motor neuron dysfunction disinhibits lower motor neurons, resulting in increased muscle tone (spasticity) and increased muscle stretch reflexes (hyperreflexia). An extensor plantar (Babinski) reflex is specific for corticospinal tract dysfunction. However, upper motor neuron dysfunction can decrease tone and reflexes if motor paralysis is sudden and severe (eg, in spinal cord transection, in which tone first decreases, then increases gradually over days to weeks) or if the lesion damages the motor cortex of the precentral gyrus and not nearby motor association areas. The distribution of weakness tends to follow upper motor neuron distribution, primarily affecting the extensors of the upper extremities and flexors of the lower extremities. Lower motor neuron dysfunction disrupts reflex arcs, causing hyporeflexia and decreased muscle tone (flaccidity), and may cause fasciculations; with time, muscles atrophy. Peripheral polyneuropathies tend to primarily affect the longest nerves (ie, weakness is more prominent in the distal than the proximal limb and is more prominent in legs than arms) and produce signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction (eg, decreased reflexes and muscle tone). The most common disorder of the neuromuscular junction—myasthenia gravis— typically causes fluctuating
