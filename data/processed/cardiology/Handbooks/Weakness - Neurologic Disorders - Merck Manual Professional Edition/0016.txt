Weakness

(inability to focus attention on completing a motor task), motor perseveration, apraxia, or incomplete effort. Malingering and other functional weakness is often characterized by give-way weakness, in which normal strength of effort suddenly gives way. Coordination testing includes finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin maneuvers and toe-heel tandem gait to check for cerebellar dysfunction, which can accompany cerebellar stroke, vermian atrophy (eg, due to alcohol use disorder), some hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias, multiple sclerosis, and the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Gait is observed for the following: Ignition failure (temporary freezing in place when starting to walk, followed by involuntary speeding up of gait [festination]): Parkinson disease Apraxia, as when feet stick to the floor: Normal pressure hydrocephalus or other frontal lobe disorders Festination: Parkinson disease Limb asymmetry, as when patients drag a leg, have reduced arm swing, or both: Hemispheric stroke Ataxia: Midline cerebellar disease Instability during turns: Parkinsonism 10/19 Walking on the toes and heels is tested; distal muscle weakness makes these maneuvers difficult. Walking on the heels is particularly difficult when corticospinal tract lesions are the cause of weakness. Spastic gait is notable for scissoring (legs flexed slightly at the hips and knees, giving the appearance of crouching, with the
