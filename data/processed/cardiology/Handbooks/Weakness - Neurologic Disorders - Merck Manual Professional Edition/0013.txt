Weakness

go unrecognized in families because of variable, incomplete phenotypic expression. Hammer toes, high arches in the feet, and poor performance in sports may indicate an undiagnosed hereditary motor neuropathy. Social history should note the following: Use of alcohol: Suggesting alcohol myopathy Illicit drug use: Suggesting increased risk of HIV infection, bacterial infections, tuberculosis, or stroke due to cocaine use Occupational or other exposure to toxins (eg, organophosphate insecticides, heavy metals, industrial solvents) Recent travel: Suggesting Lyme disease, tick paralysis, diphtheria, or a parasitic infection Social stressors: Suggesting depression Physical examination A complete neurologic and muscle examination is done to identify localizing or diagnostic findings. Key findings usually involve: Cranial nerves Motor function Coordination Gait Sensation Reflexes Cranial nerve examination includes inspection of the face for gross asymmetry and ptosis; mild facial asymmetry can be normal. Extraocular movements and facial muscles, including masseters (for strength), are tested. Palatal weakness is suggested by a nasal voice quality; testing the gag reflex and looking at the palate directly are less helpful. Tongue weakness is suggested by inability to clearly articulate certain consonants (eg, saying "ta-ta-ta") and slurring of speech (lingual dysarthria). Mild asymmetry during tongue protrusion may be normal. Tongue fasciculations may be
