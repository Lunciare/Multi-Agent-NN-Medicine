cervical and thoracic spinal Stroke control (finger dexterity) cord (not CT); sometimes than weakness (hand grip) lumbar puncture Myelopathies (involving upper or lower motor neuron dysfunction or both) Autoimmune disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, myelin-oligodendrocyte Spinal cord MRI, CT Dysfunction of upper associated disorder myelography, or both motor neurons, lower (MOGAD), vasculitis) Somatosensory evoked motor neurons, or both Cauda equina syndrome potentials Commonly erectile Copper deficiency Other tests as needed to dysfunction, bowel and help identify the cause: Infections (eg, HTLV-1, HIV bladder incontinence or Possibly including CSF retention, absence of infection, syphilis, human analysis (eg, protein, VDRL, sphincter reflexes (eg, anal herpes simplex 6, EBV IgG index, oligoclonal wink, bulbocavernosus) infection, varicella-zoster) banding, viral titers, PCR), Progressive limb weakness Spinal cord compression vitamin B12 level, HIV test, and fatigability, (eg, due to spondylosis, ANA, RPR, MOG-IgG clumsiness, spasticity (legs epidural tumor, autoantibody and NMO- first, then arms with hematoma, or abscess) IgG autoantibody (anti– gradual spinal cord aquaporin-4 antibody) for Spinal cord ischemia or compression) neuromyelitis optica, infarction HTLV-1 or VDRL, genetic Classically dermatomal Spinocerebellar ataxias sensory level testing, serum copper and ceruloplasmin Subacute combined degeneration Transverse myelitis Motor neuron disorders (upper, lower, or both) 3/19 Cause Suggestive
