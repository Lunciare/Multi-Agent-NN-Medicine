specific causative disorder Sometimes combinations of findings suggest a cause (see table Findings Related to Weakness Suggesting a Specific Disorder). TABLE Findings Related to Weakness Suggesting a Specific Disorder Findings Disorders to Consider Rapidly progressive generalized Botulism weakness; prominent ophthalmoplegia, 14/19 Findings Disorders to Consider dysarthria, and dysphagia, particularly if preceded by gastroenteritis Symptoms and signs suggesting dissemination of lesions in time and space, history of relapses and Multiple sclerosis remissions, monocular visual loss due to optic neuritis, diplopia due to internuclear ophthalmoplegia Acute or chronic weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, hyporeflexia, excessive cholinergic symptoms and signs (eg, Organophosphate poisoning salivation, lacrimation, urination, pupillary constriction, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, bradycardia) Single brain lesion, such as acute stroke Unilateral weakness, upper motor (ischemic or hemorrhagic), tumor, or neuron signs abscess Chronic progressive quadriparesis, upper motor neuron signs, preserved Cervical myelopathy due to spondylosis cranial nerves, normal jaw jerk Prominent extraocular muscle palsy Myasthenia gravis, botulism, Miller (possibly only diplopia during extreme Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré gaze) syndrome Fatigability detected by sequential Myasthenia gravis testing (eg, eye blinking) Asymmetric limb weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, prominent tongue Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis fasciculations If no symptoms or signs of true weakness (eg, characteristic anatomic and temporal pattern, objective signs)
