through lymph nodes, which filter out cellular material, including cancer cells, and foreign particles. Lymph nodes also are key participants in the immune system because they are packed with lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells that are poised to respond to any antigens transported from tissues in the lymph. Lymph nodes are categorized as Superficial: Superficial nodes are located just below the skin; they are present throughout the body, but particular collections are present in the neck, axillae, and groin. Deep: Deep lymph nodes are located in the abdominal or thoracic cavity. Lymphatic System 3D MODEL Disorders of the lymphatic system Disorders of the lymphatic system involve ≥ 1 of the following: Obstruction Infection or inflammation Cancer Obstruction leads to accumulation of lymphatic fluid in tissues (lymphedema) and is usually secondary to surgery, radiation therapy, injury, or, in tropical countries, lymphatic filariasis. Rarely, the cause is a congenital disorder (see Primary lymphedemas). Infection or inflammation may cause reactive lymph node enlargement (lymphadenopathy). The nodes themselves may become infected (causing lymphadenitis) by organisms spread through the lymphatic system from the primary site of infection. Various cancers may metastasize to local or regional lymph nodes. Rarely, a primary cancer (eg, lymphangiosarcoma) develops in
