Atrioventricular Block

I second-degree AV block, the PR interval progressively lengthens with each beat until the atrial impulse is not conducted and the QRS complex is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon); AV nodal conduction resumes with the next beat, and that beat has the shortest PR interval; the sequence is repeated (see figure Classic Mobitz Type I Second-Degree AV block). Commonly, the PR interval prolongation during the sequence is more variable but then always shortens with the first conducted beat after the pause (3). 2/7 Classic Mobitz Type I Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block The PR interval progressively lengthens with each beat until the atrial impulse is not conducted and the QRS complex is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon); atrioventricular nodal conduction resumes with the next beat, which has the shortest PR interval, and the sequence is repeated. Classic 4:3 Mobitz Type I Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block IMAGE IMAGE COURTESY OF L. BRENT MITCHELL, MD. Mobitz type I second-degree AV block may be physiologic in younger and more athletic patients. If the QRS complex is narrow, Mobitz type I second-degree AV block is nearly always in the AV node; if the QRS complex is wide (> 0.12 second), Mobitz I second-degree AV block is more likely to be in
