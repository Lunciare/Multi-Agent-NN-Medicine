Atrioventricular Block

Atrioventricular (AV) block is partial or complete interruption of impulse transmission from the atria to the ventricles. The most common cause is idiopathic fibrosis and sclerosis of the conduction system. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography; symptoms and treatment depend on degree of block, but treatment, when necessary, usually involves pacing. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) The most common causes of AV block are (1) Idiopathic fibrosis and sclerosis of the conduction system (about 40% of patients) Ischemic heart disease (20%) The remaining cases of AV block are caused by Medications (eg, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone) Increased vagal tone Cardiac sarcoidosis Valvulopathy Congenital heart, genetic, or other disorders Up to one-third of patients age 18 years to 60 years with new-onset Mobitz II second-degree or third- degree AV block without evident structural heart disease are diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis after targeted investigations (2). Transient or reversible causes of AV block can include Lyme carditis and neurologically mediated (vagal) heart blocks. Atrioventricular block may be partial or complete. First-degree and second-degree blocks are partial. Third-degree blocks are complete. First-degree AV block 1/7 All normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but the PR interval is longer than normal (> 0.20
