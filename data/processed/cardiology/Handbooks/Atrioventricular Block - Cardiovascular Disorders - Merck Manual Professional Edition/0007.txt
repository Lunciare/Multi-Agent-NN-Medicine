Atrioventricular Block

rate is greater than the QRS rate. The underlying rhythm here is a junctional escape rhythm with narrow QRS complexes and a rate of approximately 65 beats/minute. There is no electrical communication between the atria and ventricles and thus no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes (AV dissociation). Cardiac function is maintained by an escape junctional or ventricular pacemaker. Escape rhythms originating above the bifurcation of the His bundle produce narrow QRS complexes, relatively rapid (35 to 50 beats/minute) and reliable heart rates, and mild symptoms (eg, fatigue, postural light-headedness, effort intolerance). Escape rhythms originating below the bifurcation produce wider QRS complexes, slower (20 to 40 beats/minute) and unreliable heart rates, and more severe symptoms (eg, presyncope, syncope, heart failure). Signs include those of AV dissociation, such as cannon a waves, blood pressure fluctuations, and variation in loudness of the first heart sound (S1). Risk of asystole-related syncope and sudden death is greater if low escape rhythms are present. Overview of Atrioventricular B... VIDEO 5/7 Most patients require a pacemaker. If the block is caused by antiarrhythmic medications, stopping the medication may be effective, although temporary pacing may be needed. However, even if the block reverses after stopping a
