Atrioventricular Block

pacemaker. If the block is caused by antiarrhythmic medications, stopping the medication may be effective, although temporary pacing may be needed. However, even if the block reverses after stopping a negative dromotropic medication, block may later recur in the absence of the medication. Thus, ongoing surveillance is necessary. AV block caused by acute inferior myocardial infarction usually reflects atrioventricular nodal dysfunction due to increased parasympathetic tone and/or local adenosine release. It may respond to atropine or aminophylline and in most cases resolves spontaneously over several days. AV block caused by anterior myocardial infarction usually reflects extensive myocardial necrosis involving the His-Purkinje system and requires immediate transvenous pacemaker insertion with interim external pacing as necessary (5) Spontaneous resolution may occur but warrants evaluation of AV nodal and infranodal conduction (eg, electrophysiologic study, exercise testing, 24-hour ECG). Most patients with isolated congenital third-degree AV block have a junctional escape rhythm that maintains a reasonable rate, but they require a permanent pacemaker before they reach middle age. Less commonly, patients with congenital AV block have a slow escape rhythm and require a permanent pacemaker at a young age, perhaps even during infancy. Key Points There are 3 degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block: first,
