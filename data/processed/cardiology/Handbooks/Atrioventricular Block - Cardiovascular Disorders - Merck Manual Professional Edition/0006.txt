figure Second- Degree AV Block (High Grade)). Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block (High Grade) Every second P wave is blocked in this example of high-grade second-degree AV block. In patients with high-grade second-degree AV block, the distinction between Mobitz type I AV block and Mobitz type II AV block is difficult to make because 2 P waves are never conducted in a row. Risk of complete AV block is difficult to predict, and a pacemaker is usually indicated (5). Patients with any form of second-degree AV block and a structural heart disorder should be considered candidates for permanent pacing unless there is a transient or reversible cause. Third-degree AV block In third-degree AV block, no P waves conduct to make QRS complexes. By definition, the P wave rate is greater than the QRS rate. Thus, heart block is complete in third-degree AV block (see figure Third- 4/7 Degree AV Block). Third-Degree Atrioventricular Block There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes (AV dissociation) in third-degree AV block. The P wave rate is greater than the QRS rate. The underlying rhythm here is a junctional escape rhythm with narrow QRS complexes and a rate of approximately 65 beats/minute. There is no
