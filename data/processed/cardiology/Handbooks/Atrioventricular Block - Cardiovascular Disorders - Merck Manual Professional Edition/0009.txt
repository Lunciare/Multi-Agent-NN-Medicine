block have a slow escape rhythm and require a permanent pacemaker at a young age, perhaps even during infancy. Key Points There are 3 degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block: first, second, and third. First-degree and second-degree blocks are partial and third-degree block is complete. First-degree AV block is rarely symptomatic, and no treatment is required. Second-degree AV block Mobitz type I may be physiologic and if heart rate slows, a reliable junctional escape rhythm typically develops and treatment is therefore unnecessary unless symptomatic bradycardia occurs. Second-degree AV block Mobitz type II and third-degree AV block are always pathologic, and a pacemaker is typically required unless the cause is transient or reversible.
