the block is equal to twice the other RR intervals. Mobitz Type II Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block The PR interval remains constant. Beats are intermittently nonconducted, and QRS complexes dropped, usually in a repeating cycle of every third (3:1 block) or fourth (4:1 block) P wave. Mobitz type II second-degree AV block is always pathologic; the block occurs at the His bundle in 25% of patients and in the bundle branches in the rest (4). Patients may be asymptomatic or experience light- headedness, presyncope, and syncope, depending on the ratio of conducted to blocked beats. Progression of Mobitz type II second-degree AV block to complete heart block is typical and may be sudden, and the ventricular escape rhythm is both slower (20 to 40 beats/minute) than a junctional escape rhythm (35 to 50 beats/minute) and may be unreliable, giving way to asystole; therefore, in the absence of a transient or reversible cause, a pacemaker is indicated (3). In high-grade second-degree AV block, every second (or more) P wave is blocked (see figure Second- Degree AV Block (High Grade)). Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block (High Grade) Every second P wave is blocked in this example of high-grade second-degree AV block. In patients with high-grade
