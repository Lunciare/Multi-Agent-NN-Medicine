Atrioventricular Block

second-degree AV block is nearly always in the AV node; if the QRS complex is wide (> 0.12 second), Mobitz I second-degree AV block is more likely to be in the His-Purkinje system (60 to 70%) than in the AV node (30 to 40%) (2). AV nodal block usually progresses slowly, and if the block becomes complete, a reliable junctional escape rhythm at a reasonable rate (35 to 55 beats/minute) typically develops. Treatment is therefore often unnecessary unless the block causes symptomatic bradycardia and transient or reversible causes have been excluded. Treatment is pacemaker insertion, which may also benefit patients without symptoms who have Mobitz type I second-degree AV block at infranodal sites detected by electrophysiologic studies done for other reasons. In Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, the PR interval remains constant. Beats are intermittently nonconducted and QRS complexes dropped, usually in a repeating cycle of every third (3:1 block) or 3/7 fourth (4:1 block) P wave (see figure Mobitz Type II Second-Degree AV Block). The RR interval spanning the block is equal to twice the other RR intervals. Mobitz Type II Second-Degree Atrioventricular Block The PR interval remains constant.
