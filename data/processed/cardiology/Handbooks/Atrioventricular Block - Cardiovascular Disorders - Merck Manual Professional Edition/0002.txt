Atrioventricular Block

blocks are partial. Third-degree blocks are complete. First-degree AV block 1/7 All normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but the PR interval is longer than normal (> 0.20 second—see figure First-Degree Atrioventricular Block). First-Degree Atrioventricular Block For first-degree block, conduction is slowed without skipped beats. All normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but the PR interval is longer than normal (> 0.2 second). First-degree AV block may be physiologic in younger patients with high vagal tone and in well-trained athletes. First-degree AV block is rarely symptomatic, and usually no treatment is required. When the PR interval is very long (> 0.3 second), exercise intolerance due to dyspnea or fatigue may occur due to loss of AV synchrony. Further investigation may be indicated when first-degree AV block accompanies another heart disorder or appears to be caused by medication. Second-degree AV block Some normal P waves are followed by QRS complexes, but some are not. Two types exist: Mobitz type I Mobitz type II In classic Mobitz type I second-degree AV block, the PR interval progressively lengthens with each beat until the atrial impulse is not conducted and the QRS complex is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon); AV nodal conduction
