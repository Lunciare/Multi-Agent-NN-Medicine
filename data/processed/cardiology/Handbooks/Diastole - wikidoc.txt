Diastole is the period of time when the heart relaxes after contraction.
Ventricular diastole is when the ventricles are relaxing, while atrial
diastole is when the atria are relaxing.

Inside the heart
During ventricular diastole, the pressure in the (left and right) ventricles drops from the peak that
it reaches in systole. When the pressure in the left ventricle drops to below the pressure in the left
atrium, the mitral valve (bicuspid valve) opens, causing accumulated blood from the atrium to flow
into the ventricle.
Inside the arteries
The adjective "diastolic" is used to refer to the relaxation of the heart between muscle contractions.
It is used to describe portions of the cardiac cycle related to contraction. More typically it is used as
one component of measurement of blood pressure. "Diastolic pressure" refers to the lowest
pressure within the arterial blood stream occurring during each heart beat. The other component
of blood pressure is systolic pressure, which refers to the highest arterial pressure during each
heart beat. When stating blood pressure, systole and then diastole is mentioned; for example:
120/80.
