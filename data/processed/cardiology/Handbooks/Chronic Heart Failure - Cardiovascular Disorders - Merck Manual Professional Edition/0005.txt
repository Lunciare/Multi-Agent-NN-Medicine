dietary and lifestyle changes, medications, devices, and sometimes percutaneous coronary interventions or surgery. Treatment is multidisciplinary and tailored to the patient, considering causes, symptoms, and response to medications, including adverse effects. There are several evidence-based therapies for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (1, 2). There are fewer evidence-based treatments for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), chronic heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and improved ejection fraction (HFmrEF and HRimpEF), and chronic right ventricular failure (3). Medications See Medications for Heart Failure for detailed information on specific medications and classes. Guideline-directed medical therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) Guideline-directed medical therapy consists of evidence-based medications that have been shown to improve clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Medical treatment of chronic HRrEF generally consists of 4 foundational classes of therapy for all patients, as all classes have been demonstrated to reduce mortality (1, 2, 4). These include: Beta-blockers Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) 3/11 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Doses of medications in these pharmacologic classes are generally titrated to maximum tolerable doses to achieve optimal benefit. Beta-blockers (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol) reduce sympathetic nervous system tone and
