Chronic Heart Failure

activity does not appear to improve survival or decrease hospitalizations (1, 2). Rest is appropriate during acute exacerbations. Formal exercise through cardiac rehabilitation is useful for patients with chronic HFrEF and is likely helpful for patients with chronic HFpEF. Patients should have annual influenza vaccination because influenza can precipitate HF exacerbations, particularly in institutionalized or older patients. Patients should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. If causes such as hypertension, persistent tachyarrhythmia, severe anemia, hemochromatosis, uncontrolled diabetes, thyrotoxicosis, beriberi, alcohol use disorder, or toxoplasmosis are successfully treated, patients may dramatically improve. Anemia is common among patients with chronic heart failure and is frequently multifactorial. Anemia is associated with worse symptoms and outcomes in HF and so reversible causes should be sought and treated. Iron deficiency is among the most common causes of anemia in HF, and iron replacement therapy should be considered once treatable causes such as blood loss (gastrointestinal or other) have 6/11 been excluded (2). Oral iron replacement is often less effective due to poor absorption and other reasons, thus intravenous iron replacement is preferred. Management of extensive ventricular infiltration (eg, in amyloidosis) has improved considerably. Treatments for amyloidosis have markedly improved prognosis for many of these patients.
