Chronic Heart Failure

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is not able to meet the demands of the body, manifested by low cardiac output, elevated ventricular filling pressure, or both. Chronic heart failure refers to the long- term state of this clinical syndrome. Chronic heart failure may be compensated, indicating a relatively stable state that may or may not be symptomatic. When chronic heart failure involves an acute or subacute worsening of symptoms or hemodynamics, it becomes acute decompensated heart failure. Diagnosis is by examination, blood tests, and imaging. Treatment focuses on management of lifestyle and risk factors and guideline-directed medical therapy. In addition to the 6.7 million people in the United States with heart failure, about one-third of the adult population is at risk for developing heart failure, and about 1 in 4 people will develop it at some point in their lifetime (1). The definition, pathophysiology, and causes of heart failure, including chronic heart failure, are reviewed in Overview of Heart Failure. Chronic heart failure is staged as follows (2): A: Risk of HF but no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities or symptoms B: Structural or functional cardiac abnormalities but no symptoms C: Structural heart disease
