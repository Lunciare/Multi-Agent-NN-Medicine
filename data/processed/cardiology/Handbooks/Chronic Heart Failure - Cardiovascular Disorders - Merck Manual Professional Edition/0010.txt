Chronic Heart Failure

patients who must take such medications should be followed closely. Medical therapy of heart failure with mildly reduced or improved ejection fraction (HRmrEF and HRimpEF) In general, the therapeutic approach for HRmrEF and HRimpEF is similar to that for HRrEF, although far less evidence exists to support specific medications or classes (1, 2). Diuretics are recommended for anti-congestive therapy. SGLT2 inhibitors may be beneficial in preventing hospitalization in HRmrEF. Data directly supporting beta blockade, angiotensin-renin system inhibition, and mineralocorticoid antagonists are lacking and recommendations are based on observational or post-hoc analyses. Medical therapy of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HRpEF) Recommended therapies for HRpEF include an SGLT2 inhibitor for all patients, diuretics for patients with congestion and symptoms, and mineralocorticoid antagonists and angiotensin-renin system inhibition for select patient groups (1, 2, 13). Cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, and atrial fibrillation should be treated. As with HRmrEF, SGLT2 inhibitors, beta blockers, angiotensin-renin system inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid antagonists may be considered. See Medications for Heart Failure for more detailed information on specific medication classes. Disease management General measures, especially patient and caregiver education and diet and lifestyle modifications, are important for all patients with heart failure (1).
