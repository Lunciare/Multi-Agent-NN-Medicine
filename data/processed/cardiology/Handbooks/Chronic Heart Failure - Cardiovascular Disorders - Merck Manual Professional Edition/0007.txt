a sinus node inhibitor, can be used to achieve heart rate reduction. Treatment with an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril/valsartan) is the standard for patients with chronic heart failure (1, 2, 5, 6, 7). This medication combination is a potent vasodilator and may induce symptomatic hypotension. Therefore, caution is recommended when initiating or uptitrating sacubitril/valsartan, especially for patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. Sacubitril/valsartan has demonstrated superior mortality reduction, compared to angiotensin- converting enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, although both classes of medication are still used routinely, particularly in patients who are intolerant of sacubitril/valsartan. Spironolactone and eplerenone are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists used for the treatment of chronic heart failure (1, 2, 8). Agents, such as finerenone, are under investigation in different patient subpopulations, including those with significant diabetes and those with significant renal dysfunction. Spironolactone has a relatively weak diuretic effect, but is potassium sparing and can be associated with hyperkalemia. Potassium levels must be monitored in patients when initiating spironolactone or when increasing the dose. Spironolactone can also be associated with gynecomastia, and should be discontinued If this adverse effect develops. Eplerenone has a more favorable adverse effect profile, including less relative
