Chronic Heart Failure

staged as follows (2): A: Risk of HF but no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities or symptoms B: Structural or functional cardiac abnormalities but no symptoms C: Structural heart disease with symptoms D: Refractory HF requiring advanced therapies or palliative care Patient functional status in stages B to D can be further classified based on symptoms using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification system. The type of heart failure can be further classified based on the left ventricular ejection fraction. Symptoms and Signs of Chronic Heart Failure Common chronic heart failure symptoms include exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and peripheral edema (particularly in the ankles and feet) (1). Other symptoms may include anorexia or early satiety, nausea, presyncope or syncope, and coughing or wheezing (part of cardiac asthma). In earlier or milder stages, dyspnea occurs with varying degrees of exertion. As HF worsens, dyspnea can occur during rest and at night, sometimes causing nocturnal cough. Dyspnea occurring immediately or soon after lying flat and relieved promptly by sitting up (orthopnea) is common as heart failure advances. In paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,dyspnea awakens patients several hours after they lie down and is relieved only after they sit up for 15 to 20
