Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is not able to meet the demands of the body, manifested by low cardiac output, elevated ventricular filling pressure, or both. Chronic heart failure refers to the long- term state of this clinical syndrome. Chronic heart failure may be compensated, indicating a relatively stable state that may or may not be symptomatic. When chronic heart failure involves an acute or subacute worsening of symptoms or hemodynamics, it becomes acute decompensated heart failure. Diagnosis is by examination, blood tests, and imaging. Treatment focuses on management of lifestyle and risk factors and guideline-directed medical therapy.
