is common as heart failure advances. In paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,dyspnea awakens patients several hours after they lie down and is relieved only after they sit up for 15 to 20 minutes. In severe HF, periodic cycling of breathing (Cheyne-Stokes respiration—from a brief period of apnea, patients breathe progressively faster and deeper, then slower and shallower until they become apneic and repeat the cycle)—can occur during the day or night; the sudden hyperpneic phase may awaken the patient from sleep. Cheyne-Stokes breathing differs from paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in that the hyperpneic phase is short, lasting only 10 to 15 seconds, but the cycle recurs regularly, lasting 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is associated with pulmonary congestion, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration with low cardiac output. Severely reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxemia can cause chronic irritability and impair mental performance. Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea (central and obstructive), are common in HF and may both aggravate HF and be worsened by HF. Physical signs specific to heart failure included jugular venous distention or elevated jugular venous pulsations, a third heart sound (S3) or summation gallop, displaced apical impulse due to cardiomegaly, and the hepatojugular reflex (1).
