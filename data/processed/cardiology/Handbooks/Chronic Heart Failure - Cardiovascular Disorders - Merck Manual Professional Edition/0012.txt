g/day by consuming only low-sodium foods (1, 2). Monitoring daily morning weight helps detect sodium and water accumulation early (1, 2). If weight increases > 2 kg over a few days, patients may be able to adjust their diuretic dose themselves, but if weight gain continues or symptoms occur, patients should seek medical attention. Intensive case management, particularly by monitoring medication adherence and frequency of unscheduled visits to the physician or emergency department and hospitalizations, can identify when intervention is needed (1, 2). Nurses who specialize in the care of patients with HF are valuable in education, follow-up, and dosage adjustment according to predefined protocols. Patients with atherosclerosis or diabetes should strictly follow a diet appropriate for their disorder. Obesity may cause and always aggravates the symptoms of HF; patients should attain a body mass 2 2 index (BMI) ≤ 30 kg/m (ideally 21 to 25 kg/m ). Regular light activity (eg, walking), tailored to symptoms, is encouraged (1, 2). Activity prevents skeletal muscle deconditioning, which worsens functional status; however, activity does not appear to improve survival or decrease hospitalizations (1, 2). Rest is appropriate during acute exacerbations. Formal exercise through cardiac rehabilitation is useful for patients with chronic HFrEF
