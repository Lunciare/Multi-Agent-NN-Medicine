increasing the dose. Spironolactone can also be associated with gynecomastia, and should be discontinued If this adverse effect develops. Eplerenone has a more favorable adverse effect profile, including less relative hyperkalemia and gynecomastia. SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) have demonstrated significant survival benefit for patients with heart failure, regardless of ejection fraction (1, 2, 9, 10). They are generally well tolerated and have a relatively weak diuretic effect. Originally developed as oral hypoglycemic agents, they can reduce blood glucose levels. Other pharmacologic therapies are available for specific populations of patients with chronic heart failure, particularly those who remain symptomatic despite optimal doses of the foundational pharmacologic therapy classes (1, 2). 4/11 Digoxin can be used to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalizations in patients with reduced ejection fraction. Digoxin is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease due to the risk of toxicity. Additional diuretic therapy, particularly loop diuretics, are frequently used in patients with ongoing symptoms of congestion, despite optimal medical therapy for chronic heart failure. Ivabradine can be used to control resting heart rate in patients who are in sinus rhythm who are either poorly tolerant of beta-blockers or do not achieve satisfactory resting
