Chronic Heart Failure

fraction < 35%, and a widened QRS complex with a left bundle branch block pattern (> 0.15 second—the wider the QRS, the greater potential benefit) (2). Many CRT devices also incorporate an ICD in their mechanism. An implantable device that remotely monitors invasive hemodynamics (eg, pulmonary artery pressure) to guide therapy can help reduce frequency of heart failure exacerbation and hospitalization in selected patients (4, 15). Durable or ambulatory LV assist devices (LVADs) are longer-term implantable pumps that augment LV output. They are commonly used to maintain patients with severe HF who are awaiting transplantation and are also used as "destination therapy" (ie, as a long-term or permanent solution) in some patients who are not candidates for transplant. Surgery and percutaneous procedures Surgery may be appropriate when certain underlying disorders are present. Surgery in patients with advanced HF should be done in a specialized center. Surgical closure of congenital or acquired intracardiac shunts can be curative. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for patients with LV systolic dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease and evidence of myocardial viability may be beneficial (1, 2); however, those patients with prior myocardial infarction and non-viable myocardium are less likely to benefit from CABG. Thus,
