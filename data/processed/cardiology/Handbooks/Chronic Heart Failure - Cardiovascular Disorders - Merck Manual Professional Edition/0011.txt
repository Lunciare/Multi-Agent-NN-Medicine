on specific medication classes. Disease management General measures, especially patient and caregiver education and diet and lifestyle modifications, are important for all patients with heart failure (1). Education Sodium restriction 5/11 Appropriate weight and fitness levels Correction of underlying conditions Patient and caregiver education are critical to long-term success. The patient and family should be involved in treatment choices. They should be taught the importance of medication adherence, warning signs of an exacerbation, and how to link cause with effect (eg, increased salt in the diet with weight gain or symptoms). Many centers (eg, specialized outpatient clinics) have integrated health care practitioners from different disciplines (eg, HF nurses, pharmacists, social workers, rehabilitation specialists) into multidisciplinary teams or outpatient heart failure management programs. These approaches can improve outcomes and reduce hospitalizations and are most effective in the sickest patients. Dietary sodium restriction helps limit fluid retention. All patients should eliminate salt in cooking and at the table and avoid salted foods; the most severely ill should limit sodium to < 2 g/day by consuming only low-sodium foods (1, 2). Monitoring daily morning weight helps detect sodium and water accumulation early (1, 2). If weight increases > 2 kg over a few
