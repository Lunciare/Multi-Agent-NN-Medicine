Chronic Heart Failure

intravenous iron replacement is preferred. Management of extensive ventricular infiltration (eg, in amyloidosis) has improved considerably. Treatments for amyloidosis have markedly improved prognosis for many of these patients. Device therapy Use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is appropriate for some patients. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for patients with an otherwise good life expectancy if they have symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation or if they remain symptomatic and have an left ventricular ejection fraction persistently < 35% while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (2). The data for ICD use in HFrEF are stronger for ischemic cardiomyopathy than in nonischemic cardiomyopathy. A clinical trial that included patients with HFrEF with nonischemic cardiomyopathy demonstrated no mortality benefit from prophylactic (primary prevention) ICD placement (14). Cardiac resynchronization therapy is a mode of pacing that synchronizes contraction of the left ventricle by simultaneously pacing its opposing wall, thereby improving stroke volume. CRT may relieve symptoms and reduce heart failure hospitalizations for patients who have HF, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, and a widened QRS complex with a left bundle branch block pattern (> 0.15 second—the wider the QRS, the greater potential benefit) (2). Many CRT devices also
