Chronic Heart Failure

artery disease and evidence of myocardial viability may be beneficial (1, 2); however, those patients with prior myocardial infarction and non-viable myocardium are less likely to benefit from CABG. Thus, the decision to use revascularization in a patient with HF and multivessel coronary artery disease should be made on a case-by-case basis. 7/11 If HF is primarily due to a valvular disorder, valve repair or replacement should be considered (1, 2). Patients with primary mitral regurgitation are more likely to benefit than patients with mitral regurgitation secondary to LV dilation, in whom poor myocardial function is likely to continue postoperatively. Surgery is preferably done before myocardial dilation and damage become irreversible. Percutaneous mitral valve repair procedure (also called transcatheter end-to-end repair [TEER]), in which a clip is applied to approximate the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets, has been shown to reduce death and HF hospitalization in carefully selected patients with symptomatic HF despite optimal medical management and moderate to severe or severe mitral regurgitation with preserved LV size (end-systolic dimension ≤ 70 mm) (16). Heart transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients < 70 years who have severe HF refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy (1, 2). Some older patients
