For some patients, improving quality of life is as important as increasing quantity of life. Thus, it is important to determine patients’ wishes about resuscitation (eg, endotracheal intubation, CPR [cardiopulmonary respiration]) if their condition deteriorates, especially when HF is already severe. All patients should be reassured that symptoms will be relieved, and they should be encouraged to seek medical attention early if their symptoms change significantly. Involvement of pharmacists, nurses, social workers, and clergy (when desired), who may be part of an interdisciplinary team or disease management program already in place, is particularly important in end-of-life care. Prognosis for Chronic Heart Failure HF usually involves gradual deterioration, interrupted by bouts of severe decompensation, and ultimately death, although the time course is being lengthened with modern therapies. However, death can also be sudden and unexpected, without prior worsening of symptoms. Overall 1-year mortality in patients with chronic HF is approximately 7 to 14% (1, 2, 3). Specific factors that suggest a poor prognosis include older age at diagnosis, male gender, New York Heart Assocation class III or IV symptoms, ejection fraction < 30%, frequent or recent hospitalization, presence of chronic kidney, lung, or pulmonary disease, diabetes, lower measures of exercise tolerance
