failure. Ivabradine can be used to control resting heart rate in patients who are in sinus rhythm who are either poorly tolerant of beta-blockers or do not achieve satisfactory resting heart rate control with them. Ivabradine is recommended therapy for patients with HRrEF and an EF < 35% with a resting heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute on beta blocker therapy (11). Vericiguat is an oral, soluble guanylate cyclase agonist that has vasodilator effects. It can be added to other heart failure therapies in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with ongoing symptoms who have also had an acute decompensation within the last 6 months (12). Vasodilators, as a combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, can be used in patients with persistent symptoms of congestion, particularly those who are unable to tolerate ARNIs or when they are contraindicated due to poor kidney function. Calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, thiazolidinediones, and class 1C antiarrhythmic medications can worsen heart failure and should be avoided unless no alternative exists; patients who must take such medications should be followed closely. Medical therapy of heart failure with mildly reduced or improved ejection fraction (HRmrEF and HRimpEF) In general, the therapeutic approach
