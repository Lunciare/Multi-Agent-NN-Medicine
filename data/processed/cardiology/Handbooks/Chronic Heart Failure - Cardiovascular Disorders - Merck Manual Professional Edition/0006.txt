inhibitor Doses of medications in these pharmacologic classes are generally titrated to maximum tolerable doses to achieve optimal benefit. Beta-blockers (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol) reduce sympathetic nervous system tone and overall neurohormonal activation and have been a main stay of chronic heart failure therapy (1, 2). Beta-blockers can also help to control arrhythmias associated with heart failure, in addition to being antianginal agents for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Reduction of basal heart rate has been demonstrated to be an important marker of outcome. Because of their negative inotropic effects, beta- blockers are avoided in the acute decompensated phase of heart failure; they are initiated when a patient is stable and well compensated. Beta-blockers are the only foundational class of pharmacologic chronic heart failure agents that have demonstrated value only for patients with reduced ejection fraction, and not for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. For patients who are unable to tolerate beta-blockers or who achieve suboptimal resting heart rate reduction (> 77 beats/minute for those in sinus rhythm), ivabradine, a sinus node inhibitor, can be used to achieve heart rate reduction. Treatment with an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril/valsartan) is the standard for patients with chronic heart failure (1, 2,
