Chronic Heart Failure

included jugular venous distention or elevated jugular venous pulsations, a third heart sound (S3) or summation gallop, displaced apical impulse due to cardiomegaly, and the hepatojugular reflex (1). Signs of pulmonary edema (crackles, hypoxemia), poor perfusion (cool extremities, delayed capillary refill), decreased stroke volume (narrow pulse pressure), or a compensatory response (tachycardia, hypertension) may also occur. Weight loss and cardiac cachexia may occur in advanced heart failure. Diagnosis of Chronic Heart Failure Diagnostic techniques in heart failure are discussed in detail under Acute Heart Failure. Attention to symptoms, weight, serial imaging (eg, echocardiography) and measurement of natriuretic peptides and other biomarkers can help guide treatment and identify acute decompensation. Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure Diet and lifestyle changes Treatment of cause Medication therapy Multidisciplinary care Sometimes device therapy (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy, mechanical circulatory support) Sometimes cardiac transplantation Treatment goals for chronic heart failure include correcting hypertension, preventing myocardial infarction and progression of atherosclerosis, improving cardiac function, reducing hospitalizations, improving quality of life, and lengthening survival. Treatment involves dietary and lifestyle changes, medications, devices, and sometimes percutaneous coronary interventions or surgery. Treatment is multidisciplinary and tailored to the patient, considering causes, symptoms, and response to medications, including adverse
