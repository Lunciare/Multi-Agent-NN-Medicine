Limb pain

(complex regional pain syndrome). Family and social history should address family history of early vascular disease and cigarette smoking (limb or myocardial ischemia) and illicit use of parenteral drugs (infections). Physical examination 5/9 Vital signs are reviewed for fever (suggesting infection) and tachycardia and/or tachypnea (compatible with DVT with pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and infection with sepsis). The painful limb is inspected for color, edema, and any skin or hair changes, and palpated for pulses, temperature, tenderness, and crepitation (a subtle crackling sensation indicating soft-tissue gas). Strength, sensation and deep tendon reflexes are compared between affected and unaffected sides. Systolic blood pressure (BP) is measured in the ankle of the affected extremity and compared with systolic BP of an arm; the ratio of the two is the ankle-brachial index. Red flags Sudden, severe pain Signs of acute limb ischemia (eg, coolness, pallor, pulse deficits, delayed capillary refill) Dyspnea, chest pain, and/or sweating Signs of systemic toxicity (eg, delirium, tachycardia, shock, pallor) Crepitation, tenseness, foul discharge, bullae, necrosis Risk factors for deep venous thrombosis Neurologic deficits Interpretation of findings Streptococcal Cellulitis It can be helpful to categorize pain by acuity of symptom onset and then further narrow the differential diagnosis based
