Limb pain may affect all or part of an extremity (for joint pain, see Pain in and Around a Single Joint and Pain in Multiple Joints). Pain may be constant or intermittent, and unrelated to motion or precipitated by it. Accompanying symptoms and signs often suggest a source. Etiology of Limb Pain The most common causes of pain in a limb are also readily apparent by history. Musculoskeletal injuries and overuse This discussion covers extra-articular limb pain unrelated to injury or strain. Pain that is in only one joint or in multiple joints is discussed elsewhere.
