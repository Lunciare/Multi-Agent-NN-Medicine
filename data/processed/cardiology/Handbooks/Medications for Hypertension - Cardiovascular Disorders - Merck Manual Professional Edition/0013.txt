patients with COPD with Labetalol‡, § (except for pindolol, severe disease, heart acebutolol, carteolol, and failure, or who are taking Metoprolol* labetalol) insulin 9/13 Selected Adverse Medication Comments Effects Metoprolol (extended- Should not be stopped release) abruptly in patients with coronary artery disease Nadolol Bisoprolol, carvedilol, and Nebivolol metoprolol can be used to Pindolol† treat heart failure Propranolol Propranolol, long-acting Timolol * Cardioselective. † With intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. ‡ Alpha-beta-blockers. Labetalol can also be given IV for hypertensive emergencies. § Can also be given for hypertensive emergencies. Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (eg, acebutolol, pindolol) do not adversely affect serum lipids; they are less likely to cause severe bradycardia. Beta-blockers have central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects (sleep disturbances, fatigue, lethargy) and exacerbate depression. Nadolol affects the CNS the least and may be best when CNS effects must be avoided. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction. Beta-blockers should generally be avoided in patients with asthma because, in addition to bronchospasm, they can also cause resistance to the effects of inhaled or oral beta receptor agonists (3). Alpha Adrenergic Modifiers for Hypertension Adrenergic modifiers include central alpha-2-agonists, postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers, and peripheral- acting
