Beta-blockers (see table Oral Beta-Blockers for Hypertension) slow the heart rate and reduce myocardial contractility, thus reducing blood pressure. All beta-blockers are similar in antihypertensive efficacy. Cardioselective beta blockers (eg, acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol) are often preferred over nonselective agents because of potentially less bronchoconstriction and peripheral vasodilation, which is particularly relevant for patients with diabetes (increasing risk of hypoglycemia), chronic peripheral artery disease (impairing function), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, by potentiating bronchospasm). However, cardioselectivity is only relative and decreases as dose increases. Even cardioselective beta-blockers should be used with caution in patients with COPD with a prominent bronchospastic component.
