can increase serum cholesterol slightly (mostly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and also increase triglyceride levels, although these effects may not persist > 1 year (5). The increase is apparent within 4 weeks of treatment and can be ameliorated by a low-fat diet. The possibility of a slight increase in lipid levels does not contraindicate diuretic use in patients with dyslipidemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics are not as effective as thiazide-type diuretics in controlling hypertension and thus are not used for initial treatment. They do not cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperglycemia, and thus may be helpful for patients who develop these adverse effects of thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements are not needed when an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker is used because these medications increase serum potassium. Loop diuretics are used to treat hypertension only in patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/minute; these diuretics are given at least twice a day (except for torsemide which can be given once a day). All diuretics except the potassium-sparing distal tubular diuretics (eg, spironolactone) cause significant potassium loss, so serum potassium is measured monthly until the level stabilizes. Unless serum potassium is normalized, potassium
