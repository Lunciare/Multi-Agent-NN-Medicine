All diuretics except the potassium-sparing distal tubular diuretics (eg, spironolactone) cause significant potassium loss, so serum potassium is measured monthly until the level stabilizes. Unless serum potassium is normalized, potassium channels in the arterial walls close and the resulting vasoconstriction makes achieving the blood pressure (BP) goal difficult. Patients with potassium levels < 3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) are given potassium supplements. Supplements may be continued long-term at a lower dose, or a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) may be added. Addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic or potassium supplements is also recommended for patients who are also taking digoxin, have a known heart disorder, have an abnormal ECG, have ectopy or arrhythmias, or develop ectopy or arrhythmias while taking a diuretic. 2/13 In most patients with diabetes, thiazide-type diuretics do not affect control of diabetes. Uncommonly, diuretics precipitate or worsen type 2 diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome. A hereditary predisposition probably explains the few cases of gout due to diuretic-induced hyperuricemia. Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia without gout does not require treatment or discontinuation of the diuretic. Diuretics may slightly increase mortality in patients with a history of heart failure who do not have pulmonary congestion, particularly in those who are
