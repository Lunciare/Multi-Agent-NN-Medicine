Medications for Hypertension

can also cause resistance to the effects of inhaled or oral beta receptor agonists (3). Alpha Adrenergic Modifiers for Hypertension Adrenergic modifiers include central alpha-2-agonists, postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers, and peripheral- acting non-selective adrenergic blockers (see table Adrenergic Modifiers for Hypertension). TABLE Alpha Adrenergic Modifiers for Hypertension Selected Adverse Medication* Comments Effects Alpha-2-agonists (central acting) Drowsiness, sedation, dry Should be used cautiously Clonidine mouth, fatigue, sexual in older patients because dysfunction, rebound of orthostatic hypotension hypertension with abrupt Clonidine TTS (patch) Interferes with discontinuance measurements of urinary (particularly if doses are catecholamine levels by Guanfacine high or concomitant beta- fluorometric methods blockers are continued), localized skin reaction to Should not be combined Methyldopa clonidine patch; possibly with an alpha-1-blocker liver damage, Coombs- because of a risk of positive hemolytic anemia significant orthostatic Alpha-1 blockers with methyldopa hypotension. Should be used cautiously Doxazosin in older patients because First-dose syncope, of orthostatic hypotension orthostatic hypotension, Prazosin weakness, palpitations, Relieves symptoms of headache benign prostatic Terazosin hyperplasia * Peripheral-acting adrenergic blockers (eg, guanadrel, guanethidine, reserpine) are not available in the United States. TTS = transdermal therapeutic system. Alpha-2-agonists (eg, methyldopa, clonidine, guanfacine) stimulate alpha-2-adrenergic receptors in the brain stem and reduce sympathetic nervous activity, lowering
