The treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle modifications (eg, dietary modification, weight loss, exercise), alone or in combination with medications. The decision to treat with medication is based on the blood pressure (BP) level, the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or its risk factors, and other considerations. A number of medication classes are effective for initial and subsequent management of hypertension (1): Diuretics Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) Calcium channel blockers Direct renin inhibitors Beta-blockers Alpha adrenergic modifiers Direct vasodilators Selection and use of medications in the treatment of stable hypertension is discussed elsewhere. For treatment of hypertensive emergencies, see table Parenteral Medications for Hypertensive Emergencies. (See also Hypertension and Hypertensive Emergencies.) General medication reference 1.
