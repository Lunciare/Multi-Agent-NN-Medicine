Medications for Hypertension

(ie, with high heart rate and spiking blood pressures) already on the maximum dose of a beta-blocker. Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension Direct vasodilators, including minoxidil and hydralazine (see table Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension), work directly on blood vessels, independently of the autonomic nervous system. Minoxidil is more potent than hydralazine but has more adverse effects, including sodium and water retention and hypertrichosis, which may be poorly tolerated. Minoxidil should be reserved for severe, refractory hypertension. Hydralazine may be used during pregnancy (eg, for preeclampsia) and as an adjunct antihypertensive. Hydralazine (particularly at doses > 200 mg/day) has been associated with drug-induced lupus, which resolves when the medication is stopped (1). It is also associated with drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (2).
