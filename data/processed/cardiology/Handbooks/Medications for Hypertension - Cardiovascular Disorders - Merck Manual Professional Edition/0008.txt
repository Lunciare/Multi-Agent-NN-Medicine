Medications for Hypertension

Adverse Effects ACE inhibitors* Benazepril Rash, cough, angioedema, hyperkalemia (particularly in patients with renal Captopril insufficiency or taking nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, potassium-sparing Enalapril diuretics, or potassium supplements), Fosinopril dysgeusia, reversible acute kidney injury if stenosis affecting one or both kidneys Lisinopril threatens renal function, proteinuria Perindopril (rare at recommended doses), neutropenia (rare), hypotension with Quinapril initiation of treatment (particularly in patients with high plasma renin activity Ramipril or with hypovolemia due to diuretics or Trandolapril other conditions) ARBs Azilsartan Candesartan Dizziness, angioedema (very rare); Irbesartan theoretically, same adverse effects as Losartan ACE inhibitors on renal function (except proteinuria and neutropenia), serum Olmesartan potassium, and blood pressure Telmisartan Valsartan * All ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are contraindicated in pregnancy (can cause injury or death to the developing fetus). Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension Angiotensin II receptor blockers (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension) block angiotensin II receptors and therefore interfere with the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors are equally effective as antihypertensives. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide added benefits via tissue ACE blockade. The 2 classes have the same beneficial effects in patients with left
