Medications for Hypertension

ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension) reduce blood pressure by interfering with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and by inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin, thereby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without causing reflex tachycardia. These medications reduce BP in many patients with hypertension, regardless of plasma renin activity. Because these medications provide renal protection, they (along with angiotensin II receptor blockers) are the medications of choice for patients with diabetes. They are not recommended for initial treatment in patients with African ancestry, in whom they appear to increase the risk of stroke when used for initial treatment (1). A dry, irritating cough is the most common adverse effect, with estimates of occurrence in up to 20% in North American and Europe populations and up to 40% in Asian populations (2, 3). Angioedema is the most serious adverse effect and, if it affects the oropharynx, can be fatal. Angioedema is most common among patients with African ancestry and those who smoke. ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium and creatinine levels, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease and those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy. In
