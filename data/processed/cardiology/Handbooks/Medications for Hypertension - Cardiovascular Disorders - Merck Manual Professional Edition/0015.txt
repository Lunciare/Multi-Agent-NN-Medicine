Medications for Hypertension

are not available in the United States. TTS = transdermal therapeutic system. Alpha-2-agonists (eg, methyldopa, clonidine, guanfacine) stimulate alpha-2-adrenergic receptors in the brain stem and reduce sympathetic nervous activity, lowering blood pressure (BP). Because they have a central action, they are more likely than other antihypertensives to cause drowsiness, lethargy, and depression; they are not widely used. Clonidine can be applied transdermally once a week as a patch; thus, it may be useful for patients who have difficulty adhering to treatment (eg, those with dementia). Rebound hypertension can occur with abrupt discontinuation of oral clonidine. Postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers (eg, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin) are not used for primary treatment of hypertension because of their adverse effects and no reduction in mortality. Doxazosin used alone or with antihypertensives other than diuretics increases the risk of heart failure. Other adverse effects include first-dose syncope, orthostatic hypotension, weakness, palpitations, and headache. However, postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers may be used in patients who have prostatic hypertrophy and need a fourth antihypertensive or in people with high sympathetic tone (ie, with high heart rate and spiking blood pressures) already on the maximum dose of a beta-blocker. Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension Direct vasodilators, including minoxidil and hydralazine (see table Direct
