Hypertension) are potent peripheral vasodilators and reduce blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR); they sometimes cause reflexive tachycardia. The nondihydropyridines verapamil and diltiazem slow the heart rate, decrease atrioventricular conduction, and decrease myocardial contractility. These medications should not be prescribed for patients with second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block or with left ventricular failure.
