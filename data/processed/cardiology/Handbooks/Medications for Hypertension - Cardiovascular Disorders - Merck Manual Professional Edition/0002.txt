diuretics used for hypertension (see table Oral Diuretics for Hypertension) are Thiazide diuretics Potassium-sparing diuretics Loop diuretics Diuretics modestly reduce plasma volume and reduce vascular resistance, possibly via shifts in sodium from intracellular to extracellular loci. Thiazide-type diuretics (thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics) are most commonly used. Chlorthalidone and indapamide, thiazide-like diuretics, are preferred over hydrochlorothiazide because of their higher potency (1) and longer duration of action. However, one retrospective analysis from The Diuretic Comparison Project (2), and another pragmatic trial conducted in Veterans (3) demonstrated that chlorthalidone, despite its greater potency, did not have an advantage over hydrochlorothiazide in reducing cardiovascular or kidney disease progression events. Although thiazide diuretics had been thought to be ineffective in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, chlorthalidone has been shown to be effective in improving blood pressure in patients with glomerular filtration rates < 30 mL/minute (4). In addition to other antihypertensive effects, thiazide diuretics cause a small amount of vasodilation when intravascular volume is normal. In a few patients, thiazide-type diuretics can increase serum cholesterol slightly (mostly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and also increase triglyceride levels, although these effects may not persist > 1 year (5). The increase is apparent within 4
