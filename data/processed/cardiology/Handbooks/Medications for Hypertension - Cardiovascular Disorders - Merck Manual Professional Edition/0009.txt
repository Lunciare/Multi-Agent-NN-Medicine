Medications for Hypertension

inhibitors are equally effective as antihypertensives. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide added benefits via tissue ACE blockade. The 2 classes have the same beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular failure or with nephropathy due to type 1 diabetes. An angiotensin II receptor blocker should not be used together with an ACE inhibitor, but when used with a beta-blocker may reduce the hospitalization rate for patients with heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may be safely used in anyone with an estimated GFR > 30 mL/minute to reduce cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression. Incidence of adverse events is low; angioedema occurs but much less frequently than with ACE inhibitors. Precautions for use of angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with renovascular hypertension, hypovolemia, and severe heart failure are the same as those for ACE inhibitors (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension). Angiotensin II receptor blockers are contraindicated during pregnancy. Calcium Channel Blockers for Hypertension Dihydropyridines (see table Oral Calcium Channel Blockers for Hypertension) are potent peripheral vasodilators and reduce blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR); they sometimes cause reflexive tachycardia. The nondihydropyridines verapamil and diltiazem slow the heart rate,
