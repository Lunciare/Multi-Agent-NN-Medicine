sustained- block release Verapamil: Constipation Use of short-acting nifedipine should be avoided because of an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (1). A calcium channel blocker is preferred to a beta-blocker in patients with angina pectoris who also have a bronchospastic disorder, with coronary spasms, or with Raynaud phenomenon. Direct Renin Inhibitor for Hypertension Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, is used in the management of hypertension. As with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren causes elevation of serum potassium and creatinine. Aliskiren should not be combined with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with diabetes or renal disease (estimated GFR < 60 mL/minute). It is also contraindicated during pregnancy. Beta-Blockers for Hypertension Beta-blockers are not first-line agents for treatment of hypertension. However, they may be useful in patients with hypertension who have other disorders that may benefit from a beta-blocker, such as angina, previous myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Otherwise, beta-blockers are less protective against stroke and overall mortality than some other antihypertensives (1, 2). Beta-blockers (see table Oral Beta-Blockers for Hypertension) slow the heart rate and reduce myocardial contractility, thus reducing blood pressure. All beta-blockers are similar in antihypertensive efficacy. Cardioselective beta blockers (eg,
