treatment or discontinuation of the diuretic. Diuretics may slightly increase mortality in patients with a history of heart failure who do not have pulmonary congestion, particularly in those who are also taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker and who do not drink at least 1400 mL (48 oz) of fluid daily. The increased mortality is probably related to diuretic-induced hyponatremia and hypotension. 3/13 TABLE Oral Diuretics for Hypertension Medication Selected Adverse Effects Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone and indapamide) Hypokalemia (which increases digitalis Chlorothiazide toxicity), hyperuricemia, glucose Chlorothiazide intolerance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, Hydrochlorothiazide sexual dysfunction in men, weakness, rash Indapamide Potassium-sparing diuretics Hyperkalemia (particularly in patients Amiloride with renal failure and in patients treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme Eplerenone* inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), Spironolactone* nausea, gastrointestinal distress, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities Triamterene (with spironolactone) Loop diuretics Bumetanide Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, Ethacrynic acid hypomagnesemia, dehydration, postural Furosemide hypotension, tinnitus, hearing loss Torsemide * Aldosterone receptor blockers. ACE Inhibitors for Hypertension ACE inhibitors (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension) reduce blood pressure by interfering with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and by inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin,
