potassium and creatinine levels, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease and those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy. In patients with a renal disorder, serum creatinine and potassium levels are monitored at least every 3 months. Patients who have stage 3 nephropathy (estimated GFR of < 60 mL/minute to > 30 mL/minute) and are given ACE inhibitors can usually tolerate an increase in serum creatinine up to 30 to 35% above baseline. ACE inhibitors can cause acute kidney injury in patients who have hypovolemia, severe heart failure, severe bilateral renal artery stenosis, or severe stenosis in the artery to a solitary kidney. Thiazide-type diuretics enhance the antihypertensive activity of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers more than that of other classes of antihypertensives (4, 5). Spironolactone and eplerenone also appear to enhance the effect of ACE inhibitors.
