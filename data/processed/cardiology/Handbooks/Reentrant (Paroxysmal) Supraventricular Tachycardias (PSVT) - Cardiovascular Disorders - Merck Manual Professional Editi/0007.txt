interval for this beat. When antegrade conduction through the AV node is sufficiently slow, it can find the distal accessory AV connection ready to conduct, but in the retrograde direction. When this retrograde accessory AC connection transmission finds the atria and, subsequently, the AV node ready to conduct again in the antegrade direction, around-and-around atrioventricular reentry occurs. The ECG then shows a rapid regular tachycardia. This orthodromic atrioventricular tachycardia is the usual (95%) type of AV reentrant tachycardia (4). Less commonly, and more often induced by a ventricular premature beat, the reentry occurs in the opposite direction (antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia). An uncommon near-incessant form of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, permanent junctional reentrant tachycardia (PJRT), occurs in the setting of an antegrade concealed, usually posteroseptal, accessory AV connection that has very slow retrograde conduction. Although the tachycardia may be incessant (typically with each spontaneous termination followed by a sinus beat that re-initiates the tachycardia), some patients have a paroxysmal pattern similar to other PSVTs. The incessant form may lead to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Since 5% of patients with an accessory AV connection have multiple accessory AV connections (2), it is also possible to have a dual accessory AV
