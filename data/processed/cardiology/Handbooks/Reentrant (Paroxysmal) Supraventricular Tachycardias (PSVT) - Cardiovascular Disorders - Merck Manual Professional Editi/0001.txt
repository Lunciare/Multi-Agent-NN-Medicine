(Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia) Reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) involve reentrant pathways with a component above the bifurcation of the His bundle. Subtypes include atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using an accessory pathway, atrial reentrant tachycardia, and sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia. Patients have sudden episodes of palpitations that begin and terminate abruptly; some have dyspnea or chest discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical and by electrocardiography. Initial treatment is usually with vagotonic maneuvers. If these maneuvers are ineffective, treatment is with IV adenosine or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for narrow QRS rhythms or for wide QRS rhythms known to be a reentrant SVT with aberrant conduction that requires atrioventricular nodal conduction. Procainamide or amiodarone are effective for other wide QRS rhythms. Synchronized cardioversion can be done for all cases in which medications are ineffective or there is hemodynamic instability. Pathophysiology of Reentrant SVTs Reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardias are defined as the sudden-onset, sudden-offset, rapid (120 to 250 beats per minute), regular (successive RR interval variations ≤ 0.04 seconds), narrow QRS complex (or wide QRS complex with bundle branch block) tachycardias that are not sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter. So defined, the incidence of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia
