Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

with symptoms of paroxysmal tachycardia, define the classic (manifest) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (3). When the accessory AV connection does not conduct in the antegrade direction, the ECG is normal, and the presence of the accessory AV connection is concealed (concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). In either event, if the accessory AV connection conducts in the retrograde direction, it can support a form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia called orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia (AVNRT) ECG The accessory AV connection tends to have a longer refractory period than the AV node. At a premature atrial depolarization coupling interval less than the refractory period of the accessory AV pathway, but longer than the refractory period of the AV node, antegrade accessory AV pathway transmission is blocked but antegrade AV nodal conduction proceeds. In patients with classic (manifest) Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome, the ECG shows a sudden increase in the PR interval and loss of the delta for this beat. In patients with concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the ECG only shows an increase in the PR interval for this beat. When antegrade conduction through the AV node is sufficiently slow, it can find the distal accessory AV connection ready to conduct, but in the retrograde direction.
