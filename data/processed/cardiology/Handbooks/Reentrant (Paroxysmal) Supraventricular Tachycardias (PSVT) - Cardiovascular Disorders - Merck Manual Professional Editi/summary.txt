(Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia) Reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) involve reentrant pathways with a component above the bifurcation of the His bundle. Subtypes include atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using an accessory pathway, atrial reentrant tachycardia, and sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia. Patients have sudden episodes of palpitations that begin and terminate abruptly; some have dyspnea or chest discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical and by electrocardiography. Initial treatment is usually with vagotonic maneuvers. If these maneuvers are ineffective, treatment is with IV adenosine or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for narrow QRS rhythms or for wide QRS rhythms known to be a reentrant SVT with aberrant conduction that requires atrioventricular nodal conduction.
