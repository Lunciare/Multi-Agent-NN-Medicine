occur transiently without termination of the tachycardia. This produces a long RR interval in which previously hidden P-wave should become more evident on the ECG. Although atrial reentrant tachycardias do not require AV nodal conduction for their perpetuation, some such rhythms may terminate with vagal maneuvers or adenosine, particularly if their mechanism is triggered automaticity or micro-reentry. Termination with the final event being a P-wave on the ECG strongly suggests that the SVT is not atrial in origin as this would require the coincidence that the atrial driver terminated at exactly the same time as the AV node failed to conduct. Vagal maneuvers or adenosine are also useful to distinguish reentrant SVTs from atrial flutter (the usual response being to produce AV block without termination of the flutter but with the flutter waves being evident on the ECG) or sinus tachycardia (the usual response being gradual slowing to a new rate followed by gradual acceleration to the previous rate). Pearls & Pitfalls Although most supraventricular tachycardias have a narrow QRS complex, some have a wide QRS complex and, unless the rhythm is known to be supraventricular, it must by treated acutely as ventricular tachycardia.
