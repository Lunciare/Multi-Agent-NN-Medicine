Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

QRS complex (or wide QRS complex with bundle branch block) tachycardias that are not sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter. So defined, the incidence of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia is approximately 35/100,000, and the prevalence is 2 to 3/1000 people in the United States (1). In adult patients, the proportions of subtypes are (2): Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (50% to 60%) Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) using accessory bypass tract (20% to 30%) OR Atrial reentrant tachycardia and sinoatrial (SA) node reentrant tachycardia (10% to 15%) Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is the most common type seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In children, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is much less common; atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, atrial reentrant tachycardia, and junctional ectopic tachycardia are more common. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) AVNRT occurs most often in otherwise healthy people. It is most commonly triggered by an atrial premature beat. The AV node has multiple extensions that serve as routes for atrial activations to enter the AV node. In most people, the superior/anterior extension bypasses much of the AV node and the antegrade conduction time to the His-Purkinje system and ventricles is short (a fast pathway) while the inferior/posterior extension uses all of
