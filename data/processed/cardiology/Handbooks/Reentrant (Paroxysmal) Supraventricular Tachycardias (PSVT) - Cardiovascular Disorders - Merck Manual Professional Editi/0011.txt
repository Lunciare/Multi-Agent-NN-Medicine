Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

the RR interval (RP > PR), a long RP tachycardia. In each of these paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the P-wave morphology is negative in the inferior leads (II, III, and AVF), indicating that the atrial activation wavefront is moving from low to high through the atria. In atrial reentrant tachycardia, the P-wave may fall anywhere in the RR interval as determined by the relationship between the tachycardia rate and the AV conduction delay; the P-wave morphology may or may not be negative in the inferior leads (II, III, and AVF), depending on the site of origin of atrial depolarization. The QRS complex is narrow except with coexisting bundle branch block. Wide QRS complexes also result from activation of the ventricles exclusively down an accessory AV connection in antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia or dual accessory connection atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. If a wide-complex tachycardia is not known to be supraventricular in origin, it must be treated acutely as ventricular tachycardia. In addition to the position of the P-wave, the 2 most common forms of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia, typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia amd orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, also differ in that typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia patients are more often female and
