Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Since 5% of patients with an accessory AV connection have multiple accessory AV connections (2), it is also possible to have a dual accessory AV connection atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia that uses one accessory AV connection for antegrade conduction and another accessory AV connection for retrograde conduction. Atrial reentrant tachycardia and sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia Atrial reentrant tachycardias include the micro-reentrant atrial tachycardias (see Focal atrial tachycardia) and the macro-reentrant atrial tachycardias. The latter most commonly occur in patients with structural heart disease but may occur in isolation. The macro-reentrant tachycardias are produced by wide area reentry around normal or abnormal, anatomical or functional barriers. When the ECG shows continuous atrial electrical activity (flutter waves without intervening isoelectric periods), such rhythms are also called atypical atrial flutter. When the ECG shows discrete P-waves with intervening isoelectric periods, the distinction from focal atrial tachycardia due to micro-reentry is arbitrary and requires intracardiac mapping. Sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia is a focal atrial tachycardia with a P-wave morphology the same as that during sinus rhythm. The reentry in this instance is located in the upper crista terminalis near the sinus node, and it is debatable whether the sinus node
