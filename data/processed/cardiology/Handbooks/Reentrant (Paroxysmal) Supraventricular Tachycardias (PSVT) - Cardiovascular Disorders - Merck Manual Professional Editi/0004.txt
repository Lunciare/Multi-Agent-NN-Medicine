interval shorter than the refractory period of both pathways neither antegrade transmission reaches the His-Purkinje system and ventricles. The ECG shows a blocked premature atrial beat. At a premature atrial depolarization coupling interval less than the refractory period of the fast pathway but longer than the refractory period of the slow pathway, antegrade fast pathway transmission is blocked, but antegrade slow pathway conduction proceeds. The ECG shows a sudden increase in the PR interval for this beat (see figure Initiation of Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia). Initiation of an Atrioventricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia There is an abnormal P wave (P′) and atrioventricular nodal delay (long P′R interval) before onset of the tachycardia. When antegrade conduction through the slow pathway is sufficiently slow, it can find the lower portion of the fast pathway ready to conduct, but now in the retrograde direction. When this retrograde fast pathway transmission finds the upper portion of the slow pathway ready to conduct again in the antegrade conduction, around-and-around AV nodal reentry occurs. The ECG then shows a rapid, regular, tachycardia. Such typical, or slow-fast, AV nodal reentry is the usual (90%) type of AV nodal reentry (2). Less commonly, and more often induced by a
