WPW syndrome or pre-existing bundle branch block. P waves vary. In most cases of typical (slow-fast) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, retrograde P waves are in the terminal portion of the QRS complex (often producing a pseudo-R′ deflection in lead V1); about one-third occur just after the QRS complex, and very few occur immediately before. P waves always follow the QRS complex in orthodromic typical atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia using an accessory AV connection as in WPW syndrome. In either instance the P wave, when identified, is in the first half of the RR interval (RP < PR), a short RP tachycardia. The exception is the rare typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia with a P wave immediately (≤ 0.12 seconds) before the QRS complex; this tachycardia is too short to have conducted through the AV node to have created that QRS complex. The P wave, when identified, in atypical (fast-slow) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, in permanent junctional reentrant tachycardia (PJRT), and in antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia is in the second half of the RR interval (RP > PR), a long RP tachycardia. In each of these paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the P-wave morphology is negative in the inferior leads (II, III, and AVF),
