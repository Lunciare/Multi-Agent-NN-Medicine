of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia, typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia amd orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, also differ in that typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia patients are more often female and usually present in their third or fourth decade with a tachycardia in the 150 to 200 beats/minute range. Patients with orthodromic atrioventricular tachycardia are more often male and usually present in their second or third decade with a tachycardia in the 180 to 220 beats/minute range. The reentrant SVTs may also differ in their response to vagal maneuvers or adenosine administration. Although each of the reentrant SVTs may have no response to these interventions, the SVTs with conduction through the AV as part of their reentrant circuit must terminate if a single AV nodal transmission is blocked. These SVTs are both typical and atypical AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and both orthodromic and antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardias. Other than no response, the most common response of an atrial reentrant tachycardia to vagal maneuvers or adenosine is for AV nodal block to occur transiently without termination of the tachycardia. This produces a long RR interval in which previously hidden P-wave should become more evident on the ECG. Although atrial reentrant tachycardias do
