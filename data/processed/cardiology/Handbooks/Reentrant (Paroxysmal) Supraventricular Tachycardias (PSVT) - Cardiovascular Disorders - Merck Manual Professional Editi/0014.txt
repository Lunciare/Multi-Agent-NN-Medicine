Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

complex, some have a wide QRS complex and, unless the rhythm is known to be supraventricular, it must by treated acutely as ventricular tachycardia. Narrow QRS Tachycardia: Orthodromic Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia Using an Accessory AV Connection in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome Activation is as follows: atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, ventricle, accessory connection, atria. The P wave occurs shortly after the QRS complex; it is a short RP interval tachycardia (RP < PR). Treatment of Reentrant SVTs Vagotonic maneuvers Adenosine Verapamil, diltiazem, or a beta-blocker if narrow, regular QRS complex For frequent recurrence, ablation Many episodes stop spontaneously before treatment. Vagotonic maneuvers (eg, Valsalva maneuver, unilateral carotid sinus massage, ice water facial immersion, swallowing of ice-cold water), particularly if used early, may terminate the tachyarrhythmia; some patients use these maneuvers at home (1). AV node blockers are used if vagotonic maneuvers are ineffective and the QRS complex is narrow (indicating orthodromic conduction) and regular (indicating the episode is not atrial fibrillation); blocking conduction through the AV node for one beat interrupts the reentrant cycle. Adenosine is the first choice. Dose is 6 mg by rapid IV bolus (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg in children), followed by a 20-mL saline bolus. If this dosage is
