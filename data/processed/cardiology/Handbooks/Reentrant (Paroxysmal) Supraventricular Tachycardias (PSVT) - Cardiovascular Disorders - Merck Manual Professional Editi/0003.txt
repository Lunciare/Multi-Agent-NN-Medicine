extension bypasses much of the AV node and the antegrade conduction time to the His-Purkinje system and ventricles is short (a fast pathway) while the inferior/posterior extension uses all of the AV node and the antegrade conduction time to the His- Purkinje system and ventricles is long (a slow pathway). The fast pathway tends to have a longer refractory period, which blocks antegrade transmission of a premature atrial depolarization at longer AA intervals, while the slow pathway tends to have a shorter refractory period, which blocks antegrade transmission of a premature atrial depolarization at shorter AA intervals. At a premature atrial depolarization coupling interval longer than the refractory period of both pathways the antegrade transmission through the fast pathway reaches the His-Purkinje system and the ventricles while the antegrade transmission through the slow pathway finds the His-Purkinje system refractory, having just been activated by the fast pathway, and the slow pathway transmission is blocked. The ECG shows a normal PR interval for this beat. At a premature atrial depolarization coupling interval shorter than the refractory period of both pathways neither antegrade transmission reaches the His-Purkinje system and ventricles. The ECG shows a blocked premature atrial beat. At a premature atrial
