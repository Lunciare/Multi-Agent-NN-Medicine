Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

same as that during sinus rhythm. The reentry in this instance is located in the upper crista terminalis near the sinus node, and it is debatable whether the sinus node is actually involved in the circuit. (See also figure Mechanism of Typical Reentry.) Symptoms and Signs of Reentrant SVTs Most patients present during young adulthood or middle age. They typically have episodes of sudden- onset, sudden-offset, rapid, regular palpitations often associated with symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort, light-headedness). Attacks may last only a few seconds or persist for several hours (rarely, > 12 hours). Infants present with episodic breathlessness, lethargy, feeding problems, or rapid precordial pulsations. If the episode of tachycardia is protracted, infants may present with heart failure. Examination is usually unremarkable except for a heart rate of 120 to 240 beats/minute, most commonly 180 to 210 beats/minute. Diagnosis of Reentrant SVTs Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia is by ECG showing rapid, regular tachycardia. Previous tracings, if available, are reviewed for ECG signs of manifest WPW syndrome or pre-existing bundle branch block. P waves vary. In most cases of typical (slow-fast) AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, retrograde P waves are in the terminal portion of the
