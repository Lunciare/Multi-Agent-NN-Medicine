Reentrant (Paroxysmal) Supraventricular Tachycardias (PSVT)

quick and safe and may be preferred to these more toxic agents (2). When episodes of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardia are frequent or bothersome, transvenous catheter ablation is the preferred treatment and is usually curative (2). If ablation is not acceptable, medication prophylaxis usually begins with digoxin and proceeds, as required, to beta- blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or both, then to one or more class Ia, class Ic, or class III antiarrhythmics (see table Antiarrhythmic Medications). However, postadolescent patients with manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (in whom atrial fibrillation becomes more likely) should not receive digoxin, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or a beta-blocker alone (2) (see also Atrial Fibrillation and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome). Key Points Symptoms of reentrant (paroxysmal) supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) begin and end suddenly. AV nodal re-entry is the most common PSVT. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, whether manifest or concealed, is the most common accessory pathway PSVT. QRS complexes are typically narrow, rapid, and regular; however, wide complexes may occur and must be differentiated from ventricular tachycardia. Vagotonic maneuvers (eg, Valsalva maneuver) sometimes help. Use atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers for narrow complex tachycardia; adenosine is the first choice, and if ineffective, verapamil or diltiazem are alternatives. Avoid AV nodal blockers for
