shows a rapid, regular, tachycardia. Such typical, or slow-fast, AV nodal reentry is the usual (90%) type of AV nodal reentry (2). Less commonly, and more often induced by a ventricular premature beat, the reentry occurs in the opposite direction (atypical or fast-slow AV nodal reentry). Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) AVRT occurs in patients with an accessory AV connection and is the most common type seen in Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome. It runs most commonly from an atrium to a ventricle and rarely from an atrium to a portion of the conduction system or from a portion of the conduction system to the ventricle. An accessory pathway connecting an atrium and a ventricle is the substrate for the Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome. When the accessory AV connection conducts in the antegrade direction, the AV nodal delay is bypassed, and a portion of ventricular myocardium is activated before the remainder of ventricular myocardium is activated by the normal conduction system. This ventricular pre-excitation produces the short PR interval and delta wave that, along with symptoms of paroxysmal tachycardia, define the classic (manifest) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (3). When the accessory AV connection does not conduct in the antegrade direction, the ECG is normal, and the
