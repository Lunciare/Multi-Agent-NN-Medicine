thrill (because resistance is always lower in the vein than in the artery during systole and diastole). Neck veins 6/14 The neck veins are examined to estimate venous wave height and waveform. Height is proportional to right atrial pressure, and waveform reflects events in the cardiac cycle; both are best observed in the internal jugular vein. The jugular veins are usually examined with the patient reclining at 45°. The top of the venous column is normally just above the clavicles (upper limit of normal: 4 cm above the sternal notch in a vertical plane) (1). The venous column is elevated in right heart failure, intravascular volume overload, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, superior vena cava obstruction, or reduced compliance of the right ventricle. If such conditions are severe, the venous column can extend to jaw level, and its top can be detected only when the patient sits upright or stands. The venous column is low in hypovolemia. Jugular Venous Distention IMAGE DR P. MARAZZI/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Normally, the venous column can be briefly elevated by firm hand pressure on the abdomen (hepatojugular or abdominojugular reflux); the column falls back in a few seconds (maximum 3 respiratory cycles
