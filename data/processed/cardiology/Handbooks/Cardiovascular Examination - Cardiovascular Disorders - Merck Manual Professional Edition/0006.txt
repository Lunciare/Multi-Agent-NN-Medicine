noncompressible leg vessels, as may occur in conditions that are associated with blood vessel calcification (eg, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis). A high index may suggest that further vascular studies are needed (toe-brachial index or arterial duplex studies). Orthostatic changes 3/14 Blood pressure and heart rate are measured with the patient supine, seated, and standing; a 1-minute interval is needed between each change in position. Orthostatic hypotension is typically defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of > 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing; the difference in blood pressure tends to be a little greater in older patients due to loss of vascular elasticity (4). The patient should be asked about symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion, including lightheadedness or vision changes. However, the sensitivity of these measurements to detect hypovolemia (eg, secondary to blood loss) is low. Causes of abnormal orthostatic vital signs include hypovolemia, baroreflex dysfunction (eg, due to neurodegenerative disorders such as autonomic neuropathies, peripheral neuropathies, older age) and, less commonly, valvular disease (eg, aortic stenosis), heart failure, or arrhythmias. Certain medications (eg, diuretics, vasodilators) can also contribute to abnormal orthostatic vital signs (5, 6). Additionally, heart
