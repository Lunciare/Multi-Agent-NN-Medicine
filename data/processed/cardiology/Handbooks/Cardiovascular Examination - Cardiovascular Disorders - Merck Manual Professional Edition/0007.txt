age) and, less commonly, valvular disease (eg, aortic stenosis), heart failure, or arrhythmias. Certain medications (eg, diuretics, vasodilators) can also contribute to abnormal orthostatic vital signs (5, 6). Additionally, heart rate changes may be helpful to diagnosis various conditions. For example, an increase upon standing of ≥ 30 beats per minute (≥ 40 beats per minute in adolescents) compared to supine or sitting can indicate hypovolemia or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (7). Pulsus paradoxus Normally during inspiration, systolic arterial blood pressure can decrease as much as 10 mm Hg. An exaggeration of this normal response with a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure or weakening of the pulse during inspiration is considered pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus occurs in Cardiac tamponade (commonly) Constrictive pericarditis Restrictive cardiomyopathy Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (occasionally) Severe asthma Severe pulmonary embolism Hypovolemic shock (rarely) During inspiration, negative intrathoracic decreases LV preload and increased LV afterload, thus decreasing cardiac output and blood pressure. This mechanism (and the drop in systolic BP) is exaggerated in disorders that cause high negative intrathoracic pressure (eg, asthma) or that also restrict RV filling (eg, cardiac tamponade, cardiomyopathy) or outflow (eg, pulmonary embolism) (8). Pulsus paradoxus is quantified by inflating a BP
