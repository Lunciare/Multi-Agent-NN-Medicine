Cardiovascular Examination

Unlike an arterial bruit, a venous hum is usually continuous, heard best with the patient sitting or standing, and is eliminated by compression of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein. TABLE Carotid Pulse Amplitude and Associated Disorders Carotid Pulse Amplitude Associated Disorder Bifid (double-peaked) with normal or Combined aortic stenosis and aortic delayed rise regurgitation Disorders with a rapid rise and fall of pressure (eg, patent ductus arteriosus) Bounding and prominent Hypermetabolic states with increased stroke volume Hypertension Diminished unilaterally or bilaterally, Extracranial carotid stenosis due to often with a systolic bruit atherosclerosis Bifid with a rapid rise Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Jerky, with full expansion followed by Aortic regurgitation sudden collapse (Corrigan’s or water- hammer pulse) Aortic stenosis (obstructing left Low in amplitude and volume with a ventricular outflow) delayed peak Shock Veins Peripheral veins The peripheral veins are observed for varicosities, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and shunts, and for overlying inflammation and tenderness due to thrombophlebitis. An AVM or a shunt produces a continuous murmur (heard on auscultation) and often a palpable thrill (because resistance is always lower in the vein than in the artery during systole and diastole). Neck veins 6/14 The neck veins are examined to estimate venous wave height
