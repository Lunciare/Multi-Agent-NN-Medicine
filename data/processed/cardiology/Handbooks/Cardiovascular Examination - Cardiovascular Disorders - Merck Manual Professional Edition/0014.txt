Cardiovascular Examination

The precordium is palpated for pulsations (determining apical impulse and thus cardiac situs) and thrills. Inspection Chest wall deformities may occur in a number of disorders. 8/14 Pectus carinatum (a prominent birdlike sternum) may be associated with Marfan syndrome (which may be accompanied by aortic root or mitral valve disease) or Noonan syndrome (which may be accompanied by pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defects, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Rarely, a localized upper chest bulge indicates aortic aneurysm due to syphilis. Pectus excavatum (depressed sternum) with a narrow anteroposterior chest diameter and an abnormally straight thoracic spine may be associated with hereditary disorders involving congenital cardiac defects (eg, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome) and sometimes Marfan syndrome.
