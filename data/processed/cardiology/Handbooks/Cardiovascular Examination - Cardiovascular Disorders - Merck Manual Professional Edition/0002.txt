Cardiovascular Examination

40% of the circumference. When measured by auscultation, the first sound heard as the mercury column falls is systolic pressure; disappearance of the sound is diastolic pressure (fifth-phase Korotkoff sound). Up to a 15 mm Hg pressure differential between the right and left arms is normal; a greater differential suggests a vascular abnormality (eg, dissecting thoracic aorta) or a peripheral vascular disorder. Leg pressure is usually 15 to 20 mm Hg higher than arm pressure due to normal pulse amplification (1). In many clinical settings, blood pressure is measured using an automated device (2). To obtain an accurate blood pressure measurement, the patient should Be seated in a chair (not on the examination table) for > 5 minutes, feet on floor, back supported Have the limb supported at heart level with no clothing covering the area of cuff placement Abstain from exercising, consuming caffeine, or using tobacco for at least 30 minutes before the measurement is taken Blood Pressure Measurement IMAGE JIM VARNEY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Heart rate and rhythm are assessed by palpating the carotid or radial pulse, by using a pulse oximeter or automated blood pressure cuff with that function, or, if arrhythmia is suspected, by cardiac auscultation; some
