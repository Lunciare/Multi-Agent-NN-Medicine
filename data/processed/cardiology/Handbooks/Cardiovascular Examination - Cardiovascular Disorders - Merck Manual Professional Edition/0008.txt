high negative intrathoracic pressure (eg, asthma) or that also restrict RV filling (eg, cardiac tamponade, cardiomyopathy) or outflow (eg, pulmonary embolism) (8). Pulsus paradoxus is quantified by inflating a BP cuff to just above systolic BP and deflating it very slowly (eg, ≤ 2 mm Hg/heartbeat). The pressure is noted when Korotkoff sounds are first heard (at first, only during expiration) and when Korotkoff sounds are heard continuously. The difference between the pressures is the “amount” of pulsus paradoxus, and a difference of > 10 mm Hg is considered abnormal.

Elasticity of the arterial wall is noted. Absence of pulses may suggest an arterial disorder (eg, atherosclerosis) or systemic embolism. Peripheral pulses may be difficult to feel in patients with obesity or in those who are muscular. In disorders with a rapid runoff of arterial blood (eg, arteriovenous communication, aortic regurgitation), the pulse has a rapid upstroke, then collapses. The pulse is
