in those who are muscular. In disorders with a rapid runoff of arterial blood (eg, arteriovenous communication, aortic regurgitation), the pulse has a rapid upstroke, then collapses. The pulse is rapid and bounding in hyperthyroidism and hypermetabolic states; it is slow and sluggish in hypothyroidism. If pulses are asymmetric, auscultation over peripheral vessels may detect a bruit due to stenosis. Carotid pulses Observation, palpation, and auscultation of both carotid pulses may suggest a specific disorder (see table Carotid Pulse Amplitude and Associated Disorders). Aging and arteriosclerosis lead to vessel rigidity, which tends to eliminate the characteristic findings. In very young children, the carotid pulse may be normal, even when severe aortic stenosis is present. Auscultation over the carotid arteries can distinguish bruits from cardiac murmurs. Murmurs originate in the heart or great vessels and are usually louder over the upper precordium and diminish toward the 5/14 neck. Bruits are higher-pitched, are heard only over the arteries, and seem more superficial. An arterial bruit must be distinguished from a venous hum. Unlike an arterial bruit, a venous hum is usually continuous, heard best with the patient sitting or standing, and is eliminated by compression of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein. TABLE
