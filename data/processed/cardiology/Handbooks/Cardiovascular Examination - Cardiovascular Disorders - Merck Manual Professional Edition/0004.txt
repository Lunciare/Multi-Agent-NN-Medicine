Cardiovascular Examination

wearing a similar amount of clothing. In patients with heart failure, weight gain may indicate hypervolemia, while weight loss may indicate cardiac cachexia (unintentional, non-edematous weight loss of > 5% within the last 12 months—3). History and additional findings from the physical examination (jugular veins, lung and extremity examinations) are required to determine whether weight changes are related to changes in volume status and/or amount of muscle or fat. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) (pulse oximetry) measures the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood and serves as a rapid, noninvasive estimation of tissue oxygenation. Pulse oximetry is obtained by using a probe attached to a finger or earlobe. SpO2 ≥ 95% is considered normal, whereas values < 95% suggest hypoxemia. Baseline oxygen saturation is lower in many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in these patients, when supplemental oxygen is used, the target SpO2 is typically 88 to 92%. When hypoxemia is present, potential cardiac etiologies include pulmonary edema in patients with heart failure and right-to-left intracardiac shunts (a patent foramen ovale in patients with pulmonary hypertension and cyanotic congenital heart disease such as tetralogy of Fallot). Ankle-brachial index (ABI) The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of
