Cardiovascular Examination

Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart (1). Examination includes the following: General appearance Vital sign measurement Pulse palpation and auscultation Vein observation Chest inspection and palpation Cardiac percussion, palpation, and auscultation Lung examination, including percussion, palpation, and auscultation Extremity and abdomen examination Cardiac auscultation is discussed in a separate topic. Despite the ever-increasing use of cardiac imaging, bedside auscultation remains useful as it is always available and can be repeated as often as desired without cost. Examination also includes the collection of other patient data. Vital Signs Vital signs include Blood pressure Heart rate and rhythm Respiratory rate 1/14 Temperature Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) Weight and height provide additional important data. Blood pressure (BP) is measured in both arms and, for suspected congenital cardiac disorders or peripheral vascular disorders, in both legs. The bladder of an appropriately sized cuff encircles 80% of the limb’s circumference, and the bladder’s width is 40% of the circumference. When measured by auscultation, the first sound heard as the mercury column falls is systolic pressure; disappearance of the sound is diastolic pressure (fifth-phase Korotkoff sound).
