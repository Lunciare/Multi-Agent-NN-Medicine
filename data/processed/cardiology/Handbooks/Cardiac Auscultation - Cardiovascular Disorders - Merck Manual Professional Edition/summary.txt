Cardiac Auscultation
KEYWORDS: murmurs, mitral, valve, stenosis, heart, ventricular, sound, diastolic, sounds, murmur, aortic, left, systolic, right, regurgitation

Auscultation of the heart requires excellent hearing ,experience, and the ability to distinguish subtle differences in pitch and timing. Hearing-impaired health care professionals can use amplified stethoscopes. High-pitched sounds are best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Low-pitched sounds are best heard with the bell. Very little pressure should be exerted when using the bell. Excessive pressure converts the underlying skin into a diaphragm and eliminates very low-pitched sounds.
