fourth heart sound (S ) and systolic thrill (T ) are present. a = aortic closure sound; p 4 S = pulmonic closure sound; S = first heart sound; S = second heart sound; 3/6 = grade of 1 2 crescendo-diminuendo murmur (radiates to both sides of neck); 2/6 =grade of pansystolic apical crescendo murmur; 1+ = mild precordial lift of RV hypertrophy (arrow shows direction of lift); 2 += moderate LV thrust (arrow shows direction of thrust). Systolic heart sounds Systolic sounds include the following: First heart sound (S1) Clicks S1 and the second heart sound (S2, a diastolic heart sound) are normal components of the cardiac cycle, the familiar “lub-dub” sounds. S1 occurs just after the beginning of systole and is predominantly due to mitral closure but may also include tricuspid closure components. It is often split and has a high pitch. S1 is loud in mitral stenosis. 3/15 It may be soft or absent in mitral regurgitation due to valve leaflet sclerosis and rigidity but is often distinctly heard in mitral regurgitation due to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral apparatus or due to ventricular myocardial abnormality (eg, papillary muscle dysfunction, ventricular dilation). S1 is often soft or
