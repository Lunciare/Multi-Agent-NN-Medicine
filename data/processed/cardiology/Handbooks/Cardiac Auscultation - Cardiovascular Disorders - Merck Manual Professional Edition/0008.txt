of the common secundum type, P2 is delayed but does not vary with respiration, resulting in a wide fixed split of S2. Left-to-right shunts with normal right ventricular volume (eg, ventricular septal defects) do not cause fixed splitting. If aortic valve closure is late (as in left bundle branch block or aortic stenosis), S2 may split in expiration and be single in inspiration when the delayed P2 occurs at the same time as the delayed A2; this is known as paradoxical splitting. Finally, a single S2 may occur when the aortic valve is regurgitant, severely stenotic, or atretic (or in truncus arteriosus when there is a single common valve). Diastolic Heart Sounds Split Second Heart Sound in Left Bundle Branch Block Sound is that of paradoxical splitting, ie, S1–P2–A2 at rest (“out”) and S1–S2 with inspiration (“in”). Left bundle branch block delays aortic valve closure, so that split is audible at rest; inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure, drawing more blood into the right ventricle and postponing pulmonic valve closure until it is superimposed on A2 and splitting becomes inaudible.
