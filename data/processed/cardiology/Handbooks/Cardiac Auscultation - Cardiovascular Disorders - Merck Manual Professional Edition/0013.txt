Cardiac Auscultation

loud when leaflets remain elastic, but it gradually softens and ultimately disappears as sclerosis, fibrosis, and calcification of the valve develop. Mitral opening snap, although sometimes heard at the apex, is often heard best or only at the lower left sternal border. Approach to murmurs 7/15 Timing of the murmur in the cardiac cycle correlates with the cause (see table Etiology of Murmurs by Timing); auscultatory findings correlate with specific heart valve disorders. Various maneuvers (eg, inspiration, Valsalva, handgrip, squatting, amyl nitrate inhalation) can modify cardiac physiology slightly, making differentiation of causes of heart murmur possible (see table Maneuvers That Aid in Diagnosis of Murmurs). TABLE Etiology of Murmurs by Timing Timing Associated Disorders Outflow obstruction (aortic sclerosis, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, subvalvular stenosis, supravalvular stenosis) Dilation of ascending aorta (aneurysm of aorta, aortitis, atheroma ) Dilation of pulmonary artery Increased blood flow across the aortic Mid systolic (ejection) valve (aortic regurgitation, hyperkinetic states) Increased blood flow across the pulmonic valve (hyperkinetic states, left- to-right shunt due to atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect) Pulmonic obstruction (infundibular stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, supravalvular pulmonary artery stenosis, branch pulmonary artery stenosis) Mitral valve prolapse Mid-late systolic Papillary muscle dysfunction
