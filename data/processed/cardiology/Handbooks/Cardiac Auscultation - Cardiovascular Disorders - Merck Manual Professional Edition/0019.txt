Cardiac Auscultation

click, are typical of mitral valve prolapse or papillary muscle dysfunction. Shunt murmurs may originate at the site of the shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect) or result from altered hemodynamics remote from the shunt (eg, pulmonic systolic flow murmur due to an atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt). Atrial shunt murmurs are rarely, if ever, audible. 12/15 AUDIO Mitral Valve Prolapse (With Late-Systolic Click) Various maneuvers are usually required for more accurate diagnosis of timing and type of murmur (see table Maneuvers That Aid in Diagnosis of Murmurs). Systolic Murmurs Aortic Stenosis Murmur The 6th beat is a ventricular premature beat (VPB). The 7th beat illustrates post-VPB potentiation of the murmur due to increased left ventricular filling during the post-VPB compensatory pause. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Pulmonary Stenosis Murmur The murmur becomes audible only with inspiration (“in”) because inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure, drawing more blood into the right ventricle and increasing right ventricular outflow.
