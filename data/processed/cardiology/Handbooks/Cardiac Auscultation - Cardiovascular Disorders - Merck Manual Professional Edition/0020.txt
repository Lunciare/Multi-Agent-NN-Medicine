Cardiac Auscultation

mitral regurgitation murmur maintains the same intensity throughout systole and extends from S1 to S2. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Ventricular Septal Defect Murmur The murmur of a ventricular septal defect is similar to that of mitral regurgitation but is louder at the left lower sternal border than at the apex. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Diastolic murmurs 13/15 Diastolic murmurs are always abnormal; most are early or mid diastolic, but they may be late diastolic (presystolic). Early diastolic murmurs are typically due to aortic regurgitation or pulmonic regurgitation. Mid diastolic (or early to mid diastolic) murmurs are typically due to mitral stenosis or tricuspid stenosis. In a patient in sinus rhythm, a late diastolic murmur may be due to rheumatic mitral stenosis. A mitral or tricuspid murmur due to an atrial tumor or thrombus may be evanescent and may vary with position and from one examination to the next because the position of the intracardiac mass changes. Pearls & Pitfalls Systolic murmurs may be normal or abnormal, but diastolic murmurs are always abnormal. Continuous murmurs Continuous murmurs occur throughout the cardiac cycle. They are always abnormal, indicating shunt flow throughout systole and diastole, hence remaining audible through
