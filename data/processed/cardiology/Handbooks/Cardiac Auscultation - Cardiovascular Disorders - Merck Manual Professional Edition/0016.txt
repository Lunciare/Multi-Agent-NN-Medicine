Cardiac Auscultation

heart sounds heart Reduces murmurs of aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, or papillary Increases afterload and muscle dysfunction Isometric handgrip peripheral arterial resistance Augments murmurs of mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation and diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis Augments murmurs of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (after 4 or 5 beats), and pulmonic Release of Valsalva Increases volume of RV regurgitation or pulmonic maneuver and left ventricle (LV) stenosis* (immediately) Reduces murmur of tricuspid stenosis Augments murmurs of aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, mitral Simultaneously increases regurgitation and diastolic venous return to the right murmur of mitral stenosis Squatting heart and increases afterload and peripheral Reduces murmur of resistance hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral valve prolapse Augments murmur of hypertrophic obstructive Increases intrathoracic cardiomyopathy and pressure, which reduces mitral valve prolapse size of LV; decreases Valsalva maneuver venous return to the right Reduces murmurs of heart and subsequently to aortic stenosis, mitral the left heart regurgitation, and tricuspid stenosis 11/15 * Patient may need to be standing for effect on pulmonic stenosis to be heard. All patients with heart murmurs are evaluated by chest radiography and electrocardiography (ECG). Echocardiography is required to confirm the diagnosis, determine severity, and track severity
