Cardiac Auscultation

is superimposed on A2 and splitting becomes inaudible. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. 5/15 Split Second Heart Sound in Right Bundle Branch Block Sound is that of wide splitting, ie, S1–A2–P2 at rest (“out”) with an even wider A2–P2 interval with inspiration (“in”). Right bundle branch block delays pulmonic valve closure so that S2 splitting becomes audible at rest. Inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure, drawing more blood into the right ventricle and postponing pulmonic valve closure even more, so that the normal split becomes wider. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Split Second Heart Sound With Atrial Septal Defect Sound is that of fixed second heart sound (S2) splitting, ie, S1–A2–P2 at rest (“out”) and with inspiration (“in”). Splitting is fixed because the volume of flow through the right ventricle is increased throughout the respiratory cycle, eliminating the normal delay in closure of the pulmonic valve associated with inspiration. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Third Heart Sound Sound is that of S1–S2–S3. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Fourth Heart Sound Sound is that of S4–S1–S2. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Summation Gallop Sound is that of S4–S1–S2–S3 in rapid succession. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Diastolic
