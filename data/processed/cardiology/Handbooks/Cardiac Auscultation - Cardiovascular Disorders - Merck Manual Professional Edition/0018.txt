producing these soft ejection murmurs. (A Still murmur is a vibratory, systolic, innocent murmur thought to be caused by vibration of the chordae tendineae of the mitral valve.) Older patients often have ejection murmurs due to valve and vessel sclerosis. During pregnancy, many women have soft ejection murmurs at the second intercostal space to the left or right of the sternum. The murmurs occur because a physiologic increase in blood volume and cardiac output increases flow velocity through normal structures. The murmurs may be greatly exaggerated if severe anemia complicates the pregnancy. These murmurs are distinct from the venous hum sometimes caused by engorged breast vessels during pregnancy (mammary souffle). Regurgitant murmurs represent retrograde flow (eg, due to mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation). A similar murmur can occur with a ventricular septal defect. Both are typically holosystolic and tend to be louder with high-velocity, low-volume regurgitation or shunts and softer with high-volume regurgitation or shunts. AUDIO Mitral Valve Prolapse Late systolic murmurs, which may or may not be preceded by a click, are typical of mitral valve prolapse or papillary muscle dysfunction. Shunt murmurs may originate at the site of the shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect) or result
