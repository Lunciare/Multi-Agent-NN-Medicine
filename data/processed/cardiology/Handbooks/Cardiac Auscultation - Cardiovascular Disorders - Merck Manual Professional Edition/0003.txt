Cardiac Auscultation

or 3 separate components, which may vary according to body position; during tachycardia, the sound may be almost continuous. The clinician focuses attention sequentially on each phase of the cardiac cycle, noting each heart sound and murmur. Intensity, pitch, duration, and timing of the sounds and the intervals between them are analyzed, often providing an accurate diagnosis. Historically, a diagram of the major auscultatory and palpatory findings of the precordium was drawn in the patient’s chart each time the patient’s cardiovascular system was examined (see figure Diagram of Physical Findings). With such diagrams, findings from each examination could be compared. Subsequent examination findings should be interpreted in the context of available imaging results (including echocardiogram and cardiac MRI) to diagnose and monitor valvular and other abnormalities. 2/15 Diagram of Physical Findings in a Patient With Aortic Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation Murmur, character, intensity, and radiation are depicted. Sound of pulmonic closure exceeds that of aortic closure. Left ventricular (LV) thrust and right ventricular (RV) lift (heavy arrows) are identified. A fourth heart sound (S ) and systolic thrill (T ) are present. a = aortic closure sound; p 4 S = pulmonic closure sound; S = first heart sound; S
