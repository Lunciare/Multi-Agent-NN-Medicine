Cardiac Auscultation

any time during systole but move toward S1 during maneuvers that transiently decrease ventricular filling volume (eg, standing, Valsalva maneuver). If ventricular filling volume is increased (eg, by lying supine), clicks move toward S2, particularly in mitral valve prolapse. For unknown reasons, characteristics of the clicks may vary greatly between examinations, and clicks may come and go. Systolic Heart Sounds Split First Heart Sound S1 splitting is normal in many patients and is thought to be caused by mitral valve closure followed by an aortic ejection sound. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Pulmonary Ejection Click High pulmonary artery pressures may dilate the pulmonary artery, stretching the valve ring and causing a click when taut cusps open rapidly. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Split Second Heart Sound 4/15 Sound is that of S1–S2 with expiration (“out”) and S1–A2–P2 with inspiration (“in”). S2 splits with inspiration because intrathoracic pressure decreases, drawing more blood into the right ventricle and postponing pulmonic valve closure. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Diastolic heart sounds Diastolic sounds include the following: Second, third, and fourth heart sounds (S2, S3, and S4) Diastolic knocks Mitral valve sounds Unlike systolic sounds, diastolic sounds are low-pitched; they are
