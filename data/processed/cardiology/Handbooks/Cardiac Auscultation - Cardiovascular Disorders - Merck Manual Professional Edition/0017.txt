pulmonic stenosis to be heard. All patients with heart murmurs are evaluated by chest radiography and electrocardiography (ECG). Echocardiography is required to confirm the diagnosis, determine severity, and track severity over time. Usually, a cardiac consultation is obtained if significant disease is suspected. Systolic murmurs Systolic murmurs may be normal or abnormal. They may be early, mid, or late systolic, or holosystolic (pansystolic). Systolic murmurs may be divided into ejection, regurgitant, and shunt murmurs. Ejection murmurs are due to turbulent forward flow through narrowed or irregular valves or outflow tracts (eg, due to aortic stenosis or pulmonic stenosis). They are typically mid systolic and have a crescendo-diminuendo character that usually becomes louder and longer as flow becomes more obstructed. The greater the stenosis and turbulence, the longer the crescendo phase and the shorter the diminuendo phase. Systolic ejection murmurs may occur without hemodynamically significant outflow tract obstruction (called innocent or functional murmurs) and thus do not necessarily indicate a disorder. In normal infants and children, flow is often mildly turbulent, producing these soft ejection murmurs. (A Still murmur is a vibratory, systolic, innocent murmur thought to be caused by vibration of the chordae tendineae of the mitral valve.) Older patients
