sounds Diastolic sounds include the following: Second, third, and fourth heart sounds (S2, S3, and S4) Diastolic knocks Mitral valve sounds Unlike systolic sounds, diastolic sounds are low-pitched; they are softer in intensity and longer in duration. Except for S2, these sounds are usually abnormal in adults, although an S3 may be physiologic up to age 40 years and during pregnancy. S2 occurs at the beginning of diastole, and includes aortic and pulmonic valve closure. Normally, aortic valve closure (A2) precedes pulmonic valve closure (P2), with a greater delay in P2 during inspiration due to increased right ventricular filling. When P2 is delayed enough to be audibly distinct from A2, it produces splitting of S2. The change in this delay with respiration causes physiologic splitting of S2, with the split typically audible only during inspiration. In some conditions in which pulmonic valve closure is delayed (eg, complete right bundle branch block, pulmonic valve stenosis), S2 is widely split but still varies with the respiratory cycle. With an atrial septal defect of the common secundum type, P2 is delayed but does not vary with respiration, resulting in a wide fixed split of S2. Left-to-right shunts with normal right ventricular volume (eg,
