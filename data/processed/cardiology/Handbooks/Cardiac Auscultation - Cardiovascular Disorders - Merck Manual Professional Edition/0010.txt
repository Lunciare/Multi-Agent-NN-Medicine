Cardiac Auscultation

Heart Sound Sound is that of S4–S1–S2. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Summation Gallop Sound is that of S4–S1–S2–S3 in rapid succession. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. Diastolic Knock A diastolic knock is a loud third heart sound (S3) caused by constrictive pericarditis. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. 6/15 Mitral Valve Opening Snap Sound is that of S1–A2–OS with a relatively long A2–OS interval. The opening snap (OS), most commonly caused by mitral stenosis, is thought to be caused by abrupt downward bulging (snapping) of the anterior leaflet as left ventricular pressure drops below left atrial pressure during diastole. A2–OS can be distinguished from a split S2 by dynamic maneuvers (OS intensity increases with inspiration, A2–OS interval widens with standing), a triple S2 (ie, A2–P2–OS), and a louder volume at the apex. Recording provided by Jules Constant, MD. S3 occurs in early diastole, when the ventricle is dilated and noncompliant. It occurs during passive diastolic ventricular filling and usually indicates serious ventricular dysfunction in adults; in children, it can be normal, sometimes persisting even to age 40 years. S3 also may be normal during pregnancy. Right ventricular S3 is heard best (sometimes only) during inspiration (because negative
