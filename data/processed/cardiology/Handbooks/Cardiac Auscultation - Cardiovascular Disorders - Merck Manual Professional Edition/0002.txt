Cardiac Auscultation

transient sounds produced by valve opening and closure; they are divided into systolic and diastolic sounds. Gallops are diastolic sounds (third heart sound [S3] and fourth heart sound [S4]) caused by ventricular filling; a gallop is usually, but not always, abnormal. Murmurs are produced by blood flow turbulence and are more prolonged than heart sounds; they may be systolic, diastolic, or continuous. They are graded by intensity and are described by their location and when they occur within the cardiac cycle. Systolic murmurs are graded in intensity on a scale of 1 to 6 (see table Systolic Heart Murmur Intensity), while diastolic murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 4. TABLE Systolic Heart Murmur Intensity 1/15 Grade Description 1 Barely audible 2 Soft but easily heard Loud, without a thrill (a palpable buzzing 3 sensation) 4 Loud, with a thrill Loud, audible with minimal contact 5 between stethoscope and chest Loud, audible with no contact between 6 stethoscope and chest Rubs are high-pitched, scratchy sounds often with 2 or 3 separate components, which may vary according to body position; during tachycardia, the sound may be almost continuous. The clinician focuses attention sequentially on each phase of the cardiac
