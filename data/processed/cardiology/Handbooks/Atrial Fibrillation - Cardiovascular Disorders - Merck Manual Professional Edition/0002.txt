Atrial Fibrillation

(AV) conduction system is bombarded with many electrical stimuli, causing inconsistent impulse transmission and an irregularly irregular ventricular rate, which is usually in the tachycardia rate range. Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, affecting between 3 and 6 million adults in the United States (1). Males and White people are more likely to have atrial fibrillation than females and Black people. The lifetime risk of developing atrial fibrillation is approximately 25% in males and 20% in females. Prevalence increases with age; < 1% at age 50 years, 1 to 4% at age 65 years, and 6 to 15% at age 80 years (2). Atrial fibrillation tends to occur in patients with an underlying heart disorder. Complications of atrial fibrillation 1/14 The absent atrial contractions predispose to thrombus formation; the overall annual risk of cerebrovascular embolic events is 3 to 5%, and atrial fibrillation is responsible for approximately 20 to 25% of all strokes (2). Risk of stroke is higher in older patients and in patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valve, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or previous thromboembolic events. These factors are considered in scoring systems that predict the risk of
