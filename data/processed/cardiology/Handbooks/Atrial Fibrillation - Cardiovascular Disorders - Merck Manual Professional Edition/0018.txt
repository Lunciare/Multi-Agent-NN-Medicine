Atrial Fibrillation

which the most commonly used is HAS-BLED (11) (see table HAS-BLED Tool for Predicting Risk of Bleeding in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation). The HAS-BLED score serves best in identifying conditions that, if modified, reduce bleeding risk rather than in identifying patients with a higher risk of bleeding who should not receive anticoagulation. TABLE HAS-BLED Tool for Predicting Risk of Bleeding in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Variable Points Uncontrolled hypertension 1 Abnormal kidney function 1 Abnormal liver function 1 Prior stroke 1 Prior bleeding 1 10/14 Variable Points Labile international normalized ratios (INRs) if being treated with warfarin 1 (defined as a time in the therapeutic range less than 60%) Older age (> 65 years) 1 Medication use (defined as concomitant use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 1 drug [NSAID] or an antiplatelet medication) Alcohol use (defined as > 8 alcohol units 1 per week) CLINICAL CALCULATORS HAS-BLED Bleeding Risk Score Prevention of thromboembolism in patients undergoing cardioversion Guidelines suggest the following measures for prevention around the time of cardioversion (1): 11/14 Anticoagulation in Patients Ungergoing Cardioversion * Anticoagulant can be given for < 3 weeks if TEE does not show atrial thrombus.
