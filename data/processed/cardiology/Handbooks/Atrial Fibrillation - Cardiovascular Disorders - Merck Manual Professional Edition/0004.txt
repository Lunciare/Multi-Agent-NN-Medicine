Overview of Atrial Fibrillatio... VIDEO Classification of Atrial Fibrillation Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is atrial fibrillation that lasts < 1 week having converted spontaneously or by an intervention to normal sinus rhythm. Episodes may recur (1). Persistent atrial fibrillation is continuous atrial fibrillation that lasts > 1 week (1). Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation lasts > 1 year, but there is still the possibility of restoring sinus rhythm (1). Permanent atrial fibrillation cannot be converted to sinus rhythm (the term also includes patients for whom a decision has been made not to attempt conversion to sinus rhythm [1]). The longer atrial fibrillation is present, the less likely is spontaneous conversion and the more difficult is cardioversion because of atrial remodeling (rapid atrial rate-induced changes in atrial electrophysiology, including a decrease in atrial refractoriness, spatial dispersion of atrial refractoriness, slowed atrial conduction velocity, or
