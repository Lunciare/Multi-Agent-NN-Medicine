difficult is cardioversion because of atrial remodeling (rapid atrial rate-induced changes in atrial electrophysiology, including a decrease in atrial refractoriness, spatial dispersion of atrial refractoriness, slowed atrial conduction velocity, or combinations of these) (2). Symptoms and Signs of Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic, but many patients have palpitations, chest discomfort, or symptoms of heart failure (eg, weakness, light-headedness, dyspnea), particularly when the ventricular rate is very rapid (often 140 to 160 beats/minute). Patients may also present with symptoms and signs of acute stroke or of other organ damage due to systemic emboli. The pulse is irregularly irregular with loss of a waves in the jugular venous pulse. A pulse deficit (the apical ventricular rate is faster than the rate palpated at the wrist) may be present because left ventricular stroke volume is not always sufficient to produce a peripheral pressure wave for a beat closely coupled to the previous beat. Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation Electrocardiography (ECG) Echocardiography Thyroid function tests Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is by ECG (see figure Atrial Fibrillation). Findings include Absence of P waves Presence of f (fibrillatory) waves between QRS complexes; f waves are irregular in timing and irregular in morphology; baseline undulations at
