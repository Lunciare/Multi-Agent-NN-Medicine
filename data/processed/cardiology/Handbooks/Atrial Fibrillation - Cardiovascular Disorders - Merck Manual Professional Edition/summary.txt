Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm. Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope. Atrial thrombi may form, causing a significant risk of embolic stroke. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment involves rate control with medications, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulation, and sometimes conversion to sinus rhythm by medications or cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation is initiated and maintained by multiple electrophysiologic and structural mechanisms.
