Anticoagulation in Patients Ungergoing Cardioversion * Anticoagulant can be given for < 3 weeks if TEE does not show atrial thrombus. TEE = transesophageal echocardiography (to rule out left atrial thrombus). If atrial fibrillation has been present > 48 hours, patients should typically be given an oral anticoagulant for > 3 weeks before medical or DC conversion. If immediate cardioversion is desirable, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended to exclude atrial thrombus prior to cardioversion. Anticoagulation can be given for a shorter time before conversion if TEE does not show left atrial thrombus. Anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion (each is a class I recommendation). If atrial fibrillation has been present < 48 hours in patients with a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of ≥ 2 and therapeutic anticoagulation for > 3 weeks has not been done, TEE should be done to rule out left atrial thrombus before cardioversion (class IIb recommendation). If atrial fibrillation has been present < 12 hours and patients have a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 0 to 1 (see table CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score), the benefit of precardioversion TEE and of pericardioversion anticoagulation is uncertain (implying, without so stating, that the latter group of patients may undergo cardioversion
