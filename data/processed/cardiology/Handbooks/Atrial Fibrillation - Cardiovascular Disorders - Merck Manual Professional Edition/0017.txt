These general guidelines are altered in patients with more than moderate renal impairment with decreasing enthusiasm for anticoagulation as renal impairment progresses from chronic kidney disease stages 1, 2, and 3 (eGFR > 30 mL/minute [class I recommendation]), through chronic kidney disease stage 4 (eGFR 15 to 30 mL/minute [class IIa recommendation]), to chronic kidney disease stage 5 (eGFR < 15 mL/minute or on dialysis [class IIb recommendation]). Because 90% of left atrial thrombi in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are located in the left atrial appendage, stroke prevention in such patients may be accomplished by surgical ligation of the left atrial appendage or by occlusion with a transcatheter device. Guidelines give a class IIa indication for left atrial appendage closure in patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of ≥ 2 when appropriate antithrombotic therapy is contraindicated and a class IIb indication in such patients based on patient preference (1). An individual patient's risk of bleeding may be estimated with any of a number of prognostic tools, of which the most commonly used is HAS-BLED (11) (see table HAS-BLED Tool for Predicting Risk of Bleeding in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation). The HAS-BLED score serves best in identifying conditions
