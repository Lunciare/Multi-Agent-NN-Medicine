Atrial Fibrillation

approximately 90% of patients, although recurrence rate is high (2). Efficacy and maintenance of sinus rhythm after the procedure is improved with use of class Ia, Ic, or III antiarrhythmic medications during the 24 to 48 hours before the procedure. Cardioversion is more effective in patients with shorter duration of atrial fibrillation, lone atrial fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation with a reversible cause; it is less effective when the left atrium is enlarged (> 5 cm) or if a significant underlying structural heart disorder is present. Medications for conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm include class Ia (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide), class Ic (flecainide, propafenone), and class III (amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, ibutilide, sotalol, vernakalant) antiarrhythmics (see table Antiarrhythmic Medications). A meta-analysis reported 4-hour, medication-specific cardioversion rates ranging from approximately 25% to 65%; the most effective agents were IV vernakalant, IV flecainide, IV propafenone, oral flecainide, and IV ibutilide (3). Excepting amiodarone and sotalol, which also slow ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation, these medications should not be used until the rate has been controlled. The converting medications with oral formulations are also used for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (with or without previous cardioversion). A Cochrane review found antiarrhythmic medication efficacy
