Atrial Fibrillation

thromboembolism for these patients is between 1 and 2%. Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is not recommended for patients with: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores of 0 in males and 1 in females The annual risk of thromboembolism for these patients is < 1%. The following recommendations apply to the means of anticoagulation: Patients with atrial fibrillation and a mechanical heart valve(s) are treated with warfarin (class I recommendation). 9/14 Patients with atrial fibrillation and moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis are treated with warfarin (class I recommendation). Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are treated with an oral anticoagulant are given warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban (class I recommendation). When warfarin is given, target international normalized ratio (INR) is 2.0 to 3.0. For patients eligible for anticoagulant therapy with either warfarin (or another vitamin K antagonist) or a non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, the non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants are preferred (class I recommendation). Aspirin monotherapy is not recommended for prevention of thromboembolism. These general guidelines are altered in patients with more than moderate renal impairment with decreasing enthusiasm for anticoagulation as renal impairment progresses from chronic kidney disease stages 1, 2, and
