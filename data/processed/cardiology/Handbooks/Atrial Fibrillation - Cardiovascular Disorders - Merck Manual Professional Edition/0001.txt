Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm. Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope. Atrial thrombi may form, causing a significant risk of embolic stroke. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment involves rate control with medications, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulation, and sometimes conversion to sinus rhythm by medications or cardioversion. Atrial fibrillation is initiated and maintained by multiple electrophysiologic and structural mechanisms. Early in its course the dominant mechanisms are focal automaticity and micro-reentry (drivers) predominantly originating from muscular sleeves in venous structures adjacent to the atria, especially the pulmonary veins. Atrial electrical remodeling then encourages functional reentrant circuits, including leading circle reentry and rotors (spatiotemporal organization of activation wavefronts as rapid, localized reentrant spiral waves with centrifugal spread). Finally, atrial structural remodelling, including atrial fibrosis, permits structural reentry (reentrant activation wavefronts circling an anatomical barrier such as scar), which, in addition to the other phenomena, produces multiple atrial wavelets of disorganized activations. In atrial fibrillation, the atria do not contract, and the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system is bombarded with many electrical stimuli, causing inconsistent impulse transmission and an irregularly irregular ventricular rate, which is usually in the tachycardia rate range. Atrial fibrillation is
