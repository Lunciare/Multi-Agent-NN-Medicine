be desirable in some patients who are not receiving an anticoagulant (see Prevention of thromboembolism). Rhythm control In patients with heart failure or other hemodynamic compromise directly attributable to new-onset atrial fibrillation, restoration of normal sinus rhythm is indicated to improve cardiac output (1). In other cases, conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm is optimal, but the antiarrhythmic medications that are capable of doing so (class Ia, Ic, III) have a risk of adverse effects and may increase mortality. Conversion to sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation. 6/14 For acute conversion, synchronized cardioversion or medications can be used. Before conversion is attempted, the ventricular rate should be controlled to < 120 beats/minute, and most patients should be anticoagulated (for criteria and methods, see Prevention of thromboembolism) because conversion of atrial fibrillation, regardless of the method used, transiently increases the risk of thromboembolism. Synchronized cardioversion (200 joules biphasic, followed by 300 and 360 joules biphasic as needed) converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in approximately 90% of patients, although recurrence rate is high (2). Efficacy and maintenance of sinus rhythm after the procedure is improved with use of class Ia, Ic, or III antiarrhythmic
