Atrial Fibrillation

branch block, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease. Its major hazard (estimated at 1%) is the possibility of converting atrial fibrillation to a slowish atrial flutter that conducts 1:1 in the 200 to 240 beat/minute range (5). This potential complication can be reduced in frequency by coadministration of an AV nodal–suppressing medication (eg, a beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone blockers may attenuate the myocardial fibrosis that provides a substrate for atrial fibrillation, but the role of these medications in routine atrial fibrillation treatment has yet to be defined. Ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation 7/14 For patients who are not candidates for rate control or rhythm control or in whom these approaches fail, ablation of the AV node may be done to cause complete heart block; insertion of a permanent pacemaker is then necessary. Ablation of the slow AV nodal pathway (AV node modification) reduces the number of atrial impulses reaching the ventricles and eliminates the need for a pacemaker, but this approach is considered less effective than complete ablation and is rarely used. Catheter ablation procedures that accomplish electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins from the
