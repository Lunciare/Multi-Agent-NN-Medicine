Atrial Fibrillation

to severe mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valve, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or previous thromboembolic events. These factors are considered in scoring systems that predict the risk of future thromboembolic events such as the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, which is widely used in patients without moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve (who need anticoagulation regardless of their CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score). Systemic emboli can also cause malfunction or necrosis of other organs (eg, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, eyes) or a limb. Atrial fibrillation also may impair cardiac output; loss of atrial contraction can lower cardiac output at normal heart rate by as much as 20% (3). Such a decrease is usually well tolerated except when the ventricular rate becomes too fast (eg, > 140 beats/minute), or when patients have borderline or low cardiac output to begin with. In such cases, heart failure may develop. CLINICAL CALCULATORS Atrial Fibrillation CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc Score for Stroke Risk Etiology of Atrial Fibrillation The most common causes of atrial fibrillation are Hypertension Coronary artery disease Cardiomyopathy Valvular heart disorders: mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation Hyperthyroidism Binge alcohol drinking (holiday heart) 2/14 Less common causes of atrial fibrillation include Pulmonary embolism Atrial septal defects
