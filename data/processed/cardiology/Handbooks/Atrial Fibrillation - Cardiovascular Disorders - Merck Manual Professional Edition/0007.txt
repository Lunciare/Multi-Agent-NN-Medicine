initial evaluation (2). Echocardiography is done to assess structural heart defects (eg, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggesting past or present ischemia, valvular disorders, cardiomyopathy) and to identify additional risk factors for stroke (eg, atrial blood stasis or thrombus, complex aortic plaque). Atrial thrombi are more likely in the atrial appendages, where they are best detected by transesophageal rather than transthoracic echocardiography. Pearls & Pitfalls Atrial fibrillation with a wide QRS complex may indicate Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; in such cases, use of atrioventricular node-blocking medications may be fatal. Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation Rate control with medications or AV node ablation Sometimes rhythm control with synchronized cardioversion, medications, or atrial fibrillation substrate ablation Prevention of thromboembolism Patients with hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation may benefit from hospitalization. Patients with recurrent episodes do not require hospitalization unless other symptoms suggest the need for it. Once causes have been managed, treatment of atrial fibrillation focuses on ventricular rate control, rhythm control, and prevention of thromboembolism. Ventricular rate control Patients with atrial fibrillation of any duration require rate control (typically to < 100 beats/minute at rest) to control symptoms and prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (1). For acute paroxysms of rapid rate (eg, 140 to
