The guidelines in the United States are as follows (1). Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation with the following (class I recommendation): Moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis Mechanical artificial heart valve (with or without atrial fibrillation) Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (ie, absent moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve) with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores of ≥ 2 in males and ≥ 3 in females Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy The annual risk of thromboembolism for these patients is ≥ 2%. Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is reasonable for (class IIa recommendation): Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores of 1 in males and 2 in females The annual risk of thromboembolism for these patients is between 1 and 2%. Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is not recommended for patients with: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores of 0 in males and
