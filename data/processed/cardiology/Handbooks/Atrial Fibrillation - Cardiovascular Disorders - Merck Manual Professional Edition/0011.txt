has been controlled. The converting medications with oral formulations are also used for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (with or without previous cardioversion). A Cochrane review found antiarrhythmic medication efficacy ranged from 33% to 57%, with amiodarone being most effective (4). Nevertheless, antiarrhythmic medication for this purpose was associated with more adverse events, including mortality. For paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that occurs only or almost only at rest or during sleep when vagal tone is high, medications with vagolytic effects (eg, disopyramide) may be particularly effective. Exercise-induced atrial fibrillation may be better prevented with a beta-blocker. For certain patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who also can identify its onset by symptoms, some clinicians provide a single oral loading dose of flecainide (300 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 200 mg) or propafenone (600 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 450 mg) that patients carry and self-administer when palpitations develop (“pill-in-the-pocket” approach) (5). This approach must be limited to patients who have no sinoatrial or AV node dysfunction, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease. Its major hazard (estimated at 1%) is the possibility of converting atrial fibrillation to a slowish atrial flutter that conducts
