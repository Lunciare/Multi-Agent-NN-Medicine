figure Atrial Fibrillation). Findings include Absence of P waves Presence of f (fibrillatory) waves between QRS complexes; f waves are irregular in timing and irregular in morphology; baseline undulations at rates > 300 beats/minute, usually best seen in lead V1 and not always apparent in all leads Irregularly irregular R-R intervals 4/14 Atrial Fibrillation Other irregular rhythms may resemble atrial fibrillation on ECG but can be distinguished by the presence of discrete P or flutter waves, which can sometimes be made more visible with vagal maneuvers. Muscle tremor or electrical interference may resemble f waves, but the underlying ventricular rhythm is regular. Atrial fibrillation may also cause a phenomenon that mimics ventricular extrasystoles or ventricular tachycardia (Ashman phenomenon). This phenomenon typically occurs when a short R-R interval follows a long R-R interval; the longer interval lengthens the refractory period of the infra-Hisian conduction system, and the subsequent short R-R QRS complex(es) are conducted aberrantly, typically with right bundle branch morphology (1). Echocardiography and thyroid function tests are important in the initial evaluation (2). Echocardiography is done to assess structural heart defects (eg, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggesting past or present ischemia, valvular disorders, cardiomyopathy) and to
