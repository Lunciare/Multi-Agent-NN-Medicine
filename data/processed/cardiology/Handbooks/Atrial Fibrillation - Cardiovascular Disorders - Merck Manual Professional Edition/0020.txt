Atrial Fibrillation

to 1 (see table CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score), the benefit of precardioversion TEE and of pericardioversion anticoagulation is uncertain (implying, without so stating, that the latter group of patients may undergo cardioversion without a precardioversion TEE or precardioversion anticoagulation. 12/14 Pearls & Pitfalls When possible, give anticoagulation before attempting to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Conversion to sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation in patients who meet criteria for it. Key Points Atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm that may be episodic or continuous. QRS complexes are typically narrow; a wide complex may occur with intraventricular conduction defects or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Patients should have electrocardiography, echocardiography, and thyroid function testing. Heart rate is controlled typically to < 100 beats/minute at rest; first-line medications include beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem). Restoration of sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for anticoagulation but may help patients with continuing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise (eg, heart failure); synchronized cardioversion or medication can be used. Long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke is required for patients with risk factors for thromboembolism. Anticoagulation is usually necessary before cardioversion.
