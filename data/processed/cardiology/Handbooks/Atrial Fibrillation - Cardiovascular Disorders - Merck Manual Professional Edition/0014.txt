atrial fibrillation in whom a rhythm control approach with antiarrhythmic medication has failed, in patients with coexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and in selected patients as first-line therapy early in the course of atrial fibrillation (1). There is also an open heart surgical ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation treatment (the maze procedure), but it is mostly reserved for patients with another indication for open heart surgery rather than used as a stand-alone procedure (9). Randomized clinical trials addressing the need for continued long-term oral anticoagulation after an apparently successful ablation procedure are underway. Guidelines recommend long-term anticoagulation after ablation using the same guidelines as for patients who have not had an ablation regardless of the apparent success of the procedure (1). Prevention of thromboembolism Long-term measures to prevent thromboembolism are taken for certain patients with atrial fibrillation depending on their estimated risk of stroke versus risk of bleeding (eg, as per the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score [8] and the HAS-BLED tool [10]).
