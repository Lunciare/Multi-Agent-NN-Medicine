Atrial Fibrillation

for a pacemaker, but this approach is considered less effective than complete ablation and is rarely used. Catheter ablation procedures that accomplish electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins from the left atrium can prevent atrial fibrillation without causing AV block. Pulmonary vein isolation has a lower success rate (60 to 80%) and a higher major complication rate (1 to 5%) than ablation procedures used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias (6). Randomized trials in patients who have not had antiarrhythmic medications have shown a lower recurrence rate for atrial tachyarrhythmias with ablation (approximately 30%) than with pharmacotherapy (approximately 50%) after 17 months of follow up and no significant difference in major adverse events (7). Furthermore, meta-analysis suggests that, compared to medical therapy, catheter ablation reduces all-cause mortality, most evident in patients with coexisting heart failure, and reduces hospitalizations in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and in those with persistent atrial fibrillation with or without heart failure (8). Accordingly, guidelines give catheter ablation for rhythm control a class I indication in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom a rhythm control approach with antiarrhythmic medication has failed, in patients with coexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and in selected patients as first-line therapy
