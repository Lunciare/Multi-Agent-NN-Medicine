where the arrhythmia is initiated and propagated. SVTs can be separated into two groups, based on whether they involve the AV node for impulse maintenance or not. Those that involve the AV node can be terminated by slowing conduction through the AV node. Those that do not involve the AV node will not usually be stopped by AV nodal blocking maneuvers. These maneuvers are still useful however, as transient AV block will often unmask the underlying rhythm abnormality. Once the acute episode has been terminated, ongoing treatment may be indicated to prevent a recurrence of the arrhythmia. Patients who have a single isolated episode, or infrequent and minimally symptomatic episodes usually do not warrant any treatment except observation. Patients who have more frequent or disabling symptoms from their episodes generally warrant some form of preventative therapy. A variety of drugs including simple AV nodal blocking agents like beta-blockers and verapamil, as well as antiarrhythmics may be used, usually with good effect, although the risks of these therapies need to be weighed against the potential benefits. Classification There are several classification systems for supraventricular tachycardia, based on site of origin, QRS width, pulse regularity, and AV node dependence.[1][2] • Supraventricular tachycardia
