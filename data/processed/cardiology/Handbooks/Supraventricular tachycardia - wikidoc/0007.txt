Supraventricular tachycardia

pain, stress Differentiating Among the Different Types of Supraventricular Tachycardia The individual subtypes of SVT can be distinguished from each other by certain physiological and electrical characteristics, many of which present in the patient's EKG. Supraventricular tachycardias must be differentiated from each other because the management strategies may vary[5].
