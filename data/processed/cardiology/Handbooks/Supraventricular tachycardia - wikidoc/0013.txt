Supraventricular tachycardia

slightly slower rate. • No P wave activity is seen. • This is a supraventricular tachycardia with a form of aberrancy. • In this case, we are probably seeing a rate-dependent left bundle branch block or the effect of a left bundle branch block which persists for the nine complexes because of continued block in the left bundle from the depolarizations from the intact right bundle. Treatment Acute Treatment • In general, SVT is not life threatening, but episodes should be treated or prevented. While some treatment modalities can be applied to all SVTs with impunity, there are specific therapies available to cure some of the different sub-types[7]. • Cure requires intimate knowledge of how and where the arrhythmia is initiated and propagated. • The SVTs can be separated into two groups, based on whether they involve the AV node for impulse maintenance or not. • Those that involve the AV node can be terminated by slowing conduction through the AV node. • Those that do not involve the AV node will not usually be stopped by AV nodal blocking maneuvers. • These maneuvers are still useful however, as transient AV block will often unmask the underlying rhythm abnormality[8].
