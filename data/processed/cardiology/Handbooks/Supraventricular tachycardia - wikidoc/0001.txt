Overview There are several classification systems for supraventricular tachycardia, based on site of origin, QRS width, pulse regularity, and AV node dependence. There are different types of supraventricular tachycardia, including sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, sinus node re-entry tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV nodal re-entry tachycardia, AV reciprocating tachycardia, junctional tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, and Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome. The general symptoms of SVTs include anxiety, chest pain or sensation of tightness, dizziness or fainting, palpitations, shortness of breath, syncope in cases of AVNRT, and sweating. The individual subtypes of SVT can be distinguished from each other by certain physiological and electrical characteristics, many of which present in the patient's EKG. Supraventricular tachycardias must be differentiated from each other because the management strategies may vary. In general, SVT is not life threatening, but episodes should be treated or prevented. While some treatment modalities can be applied to all SVTs with impunity, there are specific therapies available to cure some of the different sub-types. Cure requires intimate knowledge of how and where the arrhythmia is initiated and propagated. SVTs can be separated into two groups, based on whether they involve the AV node for impulse maintenance or not. Those that involve
