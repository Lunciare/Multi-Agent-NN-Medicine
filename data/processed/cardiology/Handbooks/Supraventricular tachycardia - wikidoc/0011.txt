In brief, the diagnosis of VT is more likely if: • There is a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or structural heart disease • VT is more common in the elderly • The electrical axis is -90 to -180 degrees (a “northwest” or “superior” axis) • The QRS is > 140 msec • There is AV dissociation. P waves are normal in morphology, upright, but dissociated from the QRS complex (i.e. "march through" the QRS complex) • There are positive or negative QRS complexes in all the precordial leads • The morphology of the QRS complexes resembles that of a previous premature ventricular contraction (PVC). • Rate: More than 100 bpm and usually 150-200 bpm • Rhythm: The rhythm is regular • PR interval: Variable PR interval • Response to Maneuvers: VT does not terminate in response to adenosine or vagal
