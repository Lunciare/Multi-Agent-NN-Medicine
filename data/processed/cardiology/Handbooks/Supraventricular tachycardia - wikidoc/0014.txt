node will not usually be stopped by AV nodal blocking maneuvers. • These maneuvers are still useful however, as transient AV block will often unmask the underlying rhythm abnormality[8]. Acute Pharmacotherapy • Another modality involves treatment with medications[9]. • Pre-hospital care providers and hospital clinicians might administer adenosine, an ultra short acting AV nodal blocking agent. • If this works, follow-up therapy with diltiazem, verapamil or metoprolol may be indicated. • SVT that does NOT involve the AV node may respond to other anti-arrhythmic drugs such as sotalol or amiodarone. • In pregnancy, metoprolol is the treatment of choice as recommended by the American Heart Association[8]. Prevention • Once the acute episode has been terminated, ongoing treatment may be indicated to prevent a recurrence of the arrhythmia[10]. • Patients who have a single isolated episode, or infrequent and minimally symptomatic episodes usually do not warrant any treatment except observation. • Patients who have more frequent or disabling symptoms from their episodes generally warrant some form of preventative therapy. • A variety of drugs including simple AV nodal blocking agents like beta-blockers and verapamil, as well as antiarrhythmics may be used, usually with good effect, although the risks of these therapies
