Chest Pain

needle-like pain. When the sensation is visceral in origin, many patients deny they are having pain and insist it is merely “discomfort.” Etiology of Chest Pain Many disorders cause chest pain or discomfort. These disorders may involve the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurologic, or musculoskeletal systems (see table Some Causes of Chest Pain). Some disorders are immediately life threatening: Acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction/unstable angina) Thoracic aortic dissection Tension pneumothorax Esophageal rupture Pulmonary embolism (PE) 1/13 Other causes range from serious, potential threats to life to causes that are simply uncomfortable. Overall, the most common causes are Chest wall disorders (ie, those involving muscle, rib, or cartilage) Pleural disorders Gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal spasm, ulcer disease, cholelithiasis) Acute coronary syndromes and stable angina In some cases, no cause can be confirmed even after a full evaluation.
