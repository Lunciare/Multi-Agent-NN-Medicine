Chest pain is a very common presenting symptom. Many patients are well aware that it is a warning of potential life-threatening disorders and seek evaluation for minimal symptoms. Other patients, including many with serious disease, minimize or ignore its warnings. Pain perception (both character and severity) varies greatly between individuals as well as between males and females. However described, chest pain should never be dismissed without an explanation of its cause.
