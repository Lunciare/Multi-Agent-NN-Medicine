Chest Pain

a possible acute coronary syndrome. With improved negative predictive value, high sensitivity troponin also has the potential to decrease the necessity of further testing in patients with negative biomarkers and has been demonstrated to allow patients to be discharged more quickly (4). Guidelines recommend using normal troponin levels and negative coronary CT scanning as a reliable strategy to exclude acute coronary syndrome in patients with chest pain and no red flags (5 ). Following up negative initial testing (acutely or within several days) with a stress ECG or a stress imaging test is also reasonable, particularly when there is an intermediate to high clinical suspicion for coronary artery disease or elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (HEART score [6]). If a pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered possible, D-dimer testing is done in patients who are at low or intermediate risk. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism is affected by a number of clinical factors, which can be used to derive an approach to testing. Many of these factors are included in scoring systems that help determine the probability of PE such as the Wells Scoring System, the Revised Geneva Scoring System, and the Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC—7, 8,
