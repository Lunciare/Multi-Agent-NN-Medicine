Chest Pain

and the third heart sound (S3), which is present with systolic dysfunction. The chest is inspected for skin lesions due to trauma or herpes zoster infection and palpated for crepitance (suggesting subcutaneous air) and tenderness. The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, 8/13 organomegaly, and masses or tenderness, particularly in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. The legs are examined for arterial pulses, adequacy of perfusion, edema, varicose veins, and signs of DVT (eg, swelling, erythema, tenderness). Pulsus paradoxus may be measured if there is clinical concern for pericardial tamponade (distant heart sounds, jugular venous distension, unexplained dyspnea, tachycardia, or hypotension). Red flags Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chest pain: Abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, bradycardia, tachypnea, hypotension) Signs of hypoperfusion (eg, confusion, ashen color, diaphoresis) Shortness of breath Hypoxemia on pulse oximetry Asymmetric breath sounds or pulses New heart murmurs Pulsus paradoxus > 10 mm Hg Interpretation of findings Symptoms and signs of thoracic disorders vary greatly, and those of serious and nonserious conditions often overlap. Although red flag findings indicate a high likelihood of serious disease, and many disorders have “classic” manifestations (see table Some Causes of Chest Pain), many patients who have serious
