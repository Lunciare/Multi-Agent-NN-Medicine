with acute chest pain, immediate life threats must be ruled out. Most patients should initially have pulse oximetry, ECG, and chest radiographs. Sometimes, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability, either a point-of- care ultrasound (POCUS) or a complete echocardiogram can also be useful in further evaluating potential life-threatening causes (2). Echocardiography can be particularly useful in identifying left ventricular or right ventricular dysfunction, evidence of right ventricular pressure overload, valvular pathology, pericardial effusions, and signs of pericardial tamponade. If symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome or if no other cause is clear (particularly in patients who are at risk), troponin levels are measured. Expeditious evaluation is essential because if myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome is present, the patient should be considered for urgent heart catheterization (when available). Immediate catheterization is indicated in patients with ST- elevation on ECG or in patients with non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) plus high-risk features (eg, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, persistent chest pain despite optimal medical management), or high risk score (GRACE risk score [3]). In these patients, catheterization within 90 minutes of arrival is considered standard of care. For patients at low risk and possible NSTEMI, non- urgent catheterization along with expeditious non-invasive
