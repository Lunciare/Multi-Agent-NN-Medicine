Chronic disorders (eg, chronic kidney disease) are often present and may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Key Points Immediate life threats must be ruled out first. Some serious disorders, particularly coronary ischemia and pulmonary embolism, often do not have a classic presentation. Most patients should have pulse oximetry, ECG, cardiac marker measurement, and chest radiograph. Evaluation must be prompt so that patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or other criteria for intervention can be in the heart catheterization laboratory (or have thrombolysis) within the 90-minute standard. If pulmonary embolism is highly likely, anticoagulants should be given while the diagnosis is pursued; another embolus in a patient who is not receiving anticoagulants may be fatal.
