KEYWORDS: pain, chest, patients, chest pain, pulmonary, findings, coronary, disorders, acute, cause, embolism, pulmonary embolism, cardiac, heart, evaluation

Pulses are palpated in both arms and both legs, blood pressure is measured in both arms. General appearance is noted (eg, pallor, diaphoresis, cyanosis, anxiety). The neck is inspected for venous distention and hepatojugular reflux. The neck is palpated for carotid pulses, lymphadenopathy, or thyroid abnormality. The carotid arteries are auscultated for bruit. Lungs are percussed and auscultated for presence and symmetry of breath sounds, signs of congestion (dry or wet crackles, rhonchi), consolidation (pectoriloquy), pleural friction rubs, and effusion (decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion). The cardiac examination notes the intensity and timing of the first heart sound (S1) and second heart sound (S2), the respiratory movement of the pulmonic component of S2, pericardial friction rubs, murmurs, and gallops. When murmurs are detected, the timing, duration, pitch, shape, and intensity and the response to changes of position, handgrip, and the Valsalva maneuver should be noted. When gallops are detected, differentiation should be made between the fourth heart sound (S4), which is often present with diastolic dysfunction or myocardial ischemia, and the third heart sound (S3), which is present with systolic dysfunction. The chest is inspected for skin lesions due to trauma or herpes zoster infection and palpated for crepitance
