Ventricular action potential
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)
Overview
The ventricular action potential is composed of four phases: phase 0 is depolarization, phase 1 is
early repolarization, phase 2 is a plateau, phase 3 is rapid repolarization and phase 4 is the resting
potential. The different phases depend on the opening and/or closure of specific ion channels.
Ventricular Action Potential
At rest, the ventricular myocyte membrane potential is about -90 mV, which is close to the
potassium reversal potential. When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises
above this level in four distinct phases.
The beginning of the action potential, phase 1, specialized membrane proteins (voltage-gated
sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes
the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s. As the membrane voltage rises (to about
40 mV) sodium channels close due to a process called inactivation.
The sodium channel opening is followed by inactivation. Sodium inactivation comes with slowly
inactivating Ca2+ channels at the same time as a few fast K+ channels open. There is a balance
between the centrifugal flow of K+ and the centripetal flow of Ca2+ causing a plateau of length in
variables. The delayed opening of more Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which are activated by build-
up of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm, while the Ca2+ channels close, ends the plateau. This leads to
repolarisation.
The depolarization of the membrane allows calcium channels to open as well. As sodium channels
close calcium provides current to maintain the potential around 10 mV. The plateau lasts on the
order of 100 ms. At the time that calcium channels are getting activated, channels that mediate the
transient outward potassium current open as well. This outward potassium current causes a small
dip in membrane potential shortly after depolarization. This current is observed in human and dog
action potentials, but not in guinea pig action potentials.
Repolarization is accomplished by channels that open slowly and are mostly activated at the end of
the action potential (slow delayed-rectifier channels), and channels that open quickly but are
inactivated until the end of the action potential (rapid delayed rectifier channels). Fast delayed
rectifier channels open quickly but are shut by inactivation at high membrane potentials. As the
membrane voltage begins to drop the channels recover from inactivation and carry current.
