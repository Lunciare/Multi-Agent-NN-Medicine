Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

that cause dependent edema (eg, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, estrogen, high-dose opioids), venous hypertension (usually due to right heart failure), and hypoalbuminemia; however, such swelling may be asymmetric if venous insufficiency coexists and is worse in one leg. Common causes of calf pain that mimic acute DVT include Venous insufficiency and post-thrombotic syndrome Cellulitis that causes painful erythema of the calf Ruptured popliteal (Baker) cyst (pseudo-DVT), which causes calf swelling, pain, and sometimes bruising in the region of the medial malleolus Partial or complete tears of the calf muscles or tendons Diagnosis of Deep Venous Thrombosis Ultrasonography Sometimes D-dimer testing History and physical examination help determine probability of DVT before testing (see table Probability of Deep Venous Thrombosis Based on Clinical Factors). Diagnosis is typically by ultrasonography with Doppler flow studies (duplex ultrasonography). The need for additional tests (eg, D-dimer testing) and their choice and sequence depend on pretest probability and sometimes ultrasonography results. No single testing protocol is best; one approach is described in the figure One Approach to Testing for Suspected Deep Venous Thrombosis. 6/14 One Approach to Testing for Suspected Deep Venous Thrombosis CLINICAL CALCULATORS DVT Probability: Wells Score System Ultrasonography 7/14 Doppler Ultrasound of a Patient
