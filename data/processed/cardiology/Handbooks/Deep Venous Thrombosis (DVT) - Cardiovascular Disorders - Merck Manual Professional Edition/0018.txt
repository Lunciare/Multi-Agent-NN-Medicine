prevent DVT than to treat it, particularly in patients who are at high risk. The following modalities are used (for a more complete discussion, see DVT Prevention). Prevention of immobility Prophylactic anticoagulation (eg, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, adjusted- dose warfarin, direct oral anticoagulant) Intermittent pneumatic compression Patients who should not receive anticoagulants may benefit from intermittent pneumatic compression devices, elastic stockings, or both. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not prevent DVT but are sometimes placed in an attempt to prevent PE. An IVC filter may help prevent PE in patients with lower extremity DVT who have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy or in patients with recurrent DVT (or emboli) despite adequate anticoagulation. IVC filters are also sometimes used for the primary prevention of PE after certain types of surgery or in patients with multiple severe injuries; however, their use is not routinely recommended for these indications given the lack of evidence of efficacy (1). Key Points Symptoms and signs are nonspecific, so clinicians must be alert, particularly in high-risk patients. Low-risk patients may have D-dimer testing, as a normal result essentially excludes deep venous thrombosis (DVT); others should have ultrasonography. Treatment initially is with an injectable heparin (unfractionated or
