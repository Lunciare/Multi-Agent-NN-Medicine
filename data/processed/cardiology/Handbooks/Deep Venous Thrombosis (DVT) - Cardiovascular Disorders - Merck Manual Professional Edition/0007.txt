Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

affected leg Dilated collateral superficial veins Active cancer (treatment ongoing or given within the previous 6 months) Immobilization of lower extremity (eg, due to paralysis, paresis, casting, or recent long-distance travel) Surgery leading to immobility for > 3 days within the past 4 weeks Probability Probability equals the number of factors, subtracting 2 if another diagnosis is as likely as or more likely than deep venous thrombosis. High probability: ≥ 3 points Moderate probability: 1–2 points Low probability: ≤ 0 points Based on data from Anand SS, Wells PS, Hunt D, et al: Does this patient have deep vein thrombosis? Journal of the American Medical Association 279 (14):1094–1099, 1998. Common causes of asymmetric leg swelling that mimic DVT are Soft-tissue trauma Cellulitis 5/14 Compression of a pelvic vein Obstruction of a lymphatic vessel in the pelvis Popliteal cyst (Baker cyst) that obstructs venous return Less common causes include abdominal or pelvic tumors that obstruct venous or lymphatic return. Symmetric bilateral leg swelling is the typical result of use of medications that cause dependent edema (eg, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, estrogen, high-dose opioids), venous hypertension (usually due to right heart failure), and hypoalbuminemia; however, such swelling may be asymmetric if venous
