systemic administration when used for DVT. Surgery Surgery is rarely needed. However, thrombectomy, fasciotomy, or both are mandatory for phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens unresponsive to thrombolytics to try to prevent limb- threatening gangrene. Prognosis for Deep Venous Thrombosis Without adequate treatment, lower extremity DVT has a 3% risk of fatal PE (1, 2); death due to upper extremity DVT is very rare. Risk of recurrent DVT is lowest for patients with transient risk factors (eg, surgery, trauma, temporary immobility) and greatest for patients with persistent risk factors (eg, cancer), idiopathic DVT, or incomplete resolution of past DVT (residual thrombus). A normal D-dimer level obtained after anticoagulation is stopped for 3 to 4 weeks may help predict a relatively low risk of DVT or PE recurrence, more so in women than in men. Risk of venous insufficiency is difficult to predict. Risk factors for post-thrombotic syndrome include proximal thrombosis, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and 2 body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 kg/m . It is preferable and safer to prevent DVT than to treat it, particularly in patients who are at high risk. The following modalities are used (for a more complete discussion, see DVT Prevention). Prevention of immobility
