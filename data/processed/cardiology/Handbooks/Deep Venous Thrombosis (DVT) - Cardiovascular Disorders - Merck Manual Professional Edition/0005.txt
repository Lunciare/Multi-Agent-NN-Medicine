because venous return is occluded or massive edema cuts off arterial blood flow. Venous gangrene may result. Infection rarely develops in venous clots. Jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis (Lemierre syndrome), a bacterial (usually anaerobic) infection of the internal jugular vein and surrounding soft tissues, may follow tonsillopharyngitis and is often complicated by bacteremia and sepsis. In septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, pelvic thromboses develop postpartum and become infected, causing intermittent fever. Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis, a bacterial infection of a superficial peripheral vein, comprises infection and clotting and usually is caused by venous catheterization Symptoms and Signs of Deep Venous Thrombosis DVT may occur in ambulatory patients or as a complication of surgery or major medical illness. Among patients who are hospitalized and at high risk, most deep vein thrombi occur in the small calf veins, are asymptomatic, and may not be detected. When present, symptoms and signs of DVT (eg, vague aching pain, tenderness along the distribution of the veins, edema, erythema) are nonspecific, vary in frequency and severity, and are similar in arms and legs. Dilated collateral superficial veins may become visible or palpable. Calf discomfort elicited by ankle 4/14 dorsiflexion with the knee extended (Homans sign) occasionally occurs with distal leg
