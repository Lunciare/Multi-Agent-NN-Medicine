in a few days or additional imaging, such as venography, depending on clinical suspicion. Additional testing If symptoms and signs suggest PE, additional imaging (eg, CT pulmonary angiography or, less often, ventilation/perfusion [V/Q] scanning) is required. Alternative imaging Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic venography and magnetic resonance venography are other imaging modalities rarely used in the diagnosis of DVT. They are generally reserved for cases in which ultrasonography results are negative or indeterminate and the clinical suspicion for DVT remains high. These imaging tests are less well validated for DVT, are more costly, and may be associated with other complications (eg, related to exposure to radiation and contrast agents). Contrast venography was the definitive test for the diagnosis of DVT in the past but has been largely replaced by ultrasonography, which is noninvasive, more readily available, and almost equally accurate for detecting DVT. Determination of cause Patients with confirmed DVT and an obvious cause (eg, immobilization, surgical procedure, leg trauma) need no further testing. Testing to detect hypercoagulability is controversial but is sometimes done in selected patients who have idiopathic (or unprovoked) DVT or recurrent DVT, in patients who have a personal or family history of other thromboses, and in young patients
