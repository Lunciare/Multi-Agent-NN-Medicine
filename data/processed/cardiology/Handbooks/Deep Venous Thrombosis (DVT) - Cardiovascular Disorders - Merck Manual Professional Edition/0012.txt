Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

sometimes done in selected patients who have idiopathic (or unprovoked) DVT or recurrent DVT, in patients who have a personal or family history of other thromboses, and in young patients with no obvious predisposing factors. Some evidence suggests that testing for the presence of hypercoagulability in patients with or without clinical risk factors does not predict DVT recurrence (5, 6, 7) . Screening patients with DVT for cancer has a low yield. Selective testing guided by complete history and physical examination and basic "routine" tests (complete blood count, chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver enzymes, and serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine) aimed at detecting cancer is probably adequate. In addition, patients should have any appropriate cancer screening (eg, mammography, colonoscopy) that is due. Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis Anticoagulation Sometimes inferior vena cava filter, thrombolytic therapy, or surgery Treatment is aimed primarily at pulmonary embolism prevention and secondarily at symptom relief and prevention of DVT recurrence, chronic venous insufficiency, and post-thrombotic syndrome. Treatment of lower and upper extremity DVT is generally the same. General supportive measures include pain control with analgesics, which may include short (3- to 5-day) courses of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Extended treatment with NSAIDs and
