Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

during strenuous arm activity (effort thrombosis, or Paget- Schroetter syndrome, which is rare). 3/14 Deep venous thrombosis usually begins in venous valve cusps. Thrombi consist of thrombin, fibrin, and red blood cells with relatively few platelets (red thrombi); without treatment, thrombi may propagate proximally or travel to the lungs. Complications Common complications of DVT include Chronic venous insufficiency Post-thrombotic syndrome Pulmonary embolism Much less commonly, acute massive DVT lead to phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens, both of which, unless promptly diagnosed and treated, can result in venous gangrene. In phlegmasia alba dolens, a rare complication of DVT during pregnancy, the leg turns milky white. Pathophysiology is unclear, but edema may increase soft-tissue pressure beyond capillary perfusion pressures, resulting in tissue ischemia and venous gangrene. Phlegmasia alba dolens may progress to phlegmasia cerulea dolens. In phlegmasia cerulea dolens, massive iliofemoral venous thrombosis causes near-total venous occlusion; the leg becomes ischemic, extremely painful, and cyanotic. Pathophysiology may involve complete stasis of venous and arterial blood flow in the lower extremity because venous return is occluded or massive edema cuts off arterial blood flow. Venous gangrene may result. Infection rarely develops in venous clots. Jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis (Lemierre syndrome), a
