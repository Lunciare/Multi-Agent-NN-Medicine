Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

generally the same. General supportive measures include pain control with analgesics, which may include short (3- to 5-day) courses of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Extended treatment with NSAIDs and aspirin should be avoided because their antiplatelet effects may increase the risk of bleeding complications. In addition, elevation of legs (supported by a pillow or other soft surface to avoid venous compression) is recommended during periods of inactivity. Patients may be as physically active as they can tolerate; there is no evidence that early activity increases risk of clot dislodgement and PE and may help to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome. Anticoagulants (For details on medications and their complications, see Medications for Deep Venous Thrombosis) Almost all patients with DVT are treated with anticoagulants (1, 2). Various anticoagulants are suitable for initial therapy, and the choice of agent is influenced by patient comorbidities (eg, renal dysfunction, cancer), preferences, cost, and convenience. Some patients are initially given an injectable heparin (typically low molecular weight) for 5 to 7 days, followed by longer term treatment with an oral agent. Warfarin, if used, is started within 24 hours after the start of the injectable heparin. Although heparin acts rapidly and provides
