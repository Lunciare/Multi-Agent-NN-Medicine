Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

followed by longer term treatment with an oral agent. Warfarin, if used, is started within 24 hours after the start of the injectable heparin. Although heparin acts rapidly and provides immediate anticoagulation, warfarin takes about 5 days to achieve a therapeutic effect; hence, heparin is required for 5 to 7 days. For patients who are to start edoxaban (an oral factor Xa inhibitor) or dabigatran (an oral direct thrombin inhibitor), the oral agent is started after 5 days of injectable heparin. 10/14 Alternatively, anticoagulation may be initiated immediately with selected direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban or apixaban) without first giving an injectable heparin. Starting rivaroxaban or apixaban without heparin is justified based on results of clinical trials. Fondaparinux, a parenteral factor Xa inhibitor, is sometimes substituted for low molecular weight heparin and can also be used to treat acute DVT. For selected patients (eg, with extensive iliofemoral DVT or cancer), continued treatment with a low- molecular-weight heparin rather than switching to an oral agent may be preferred. Inadequate anticoagulation in the first 24 to 48 hours may increase risk of recurrence or of PE. Acute DVT can be treated on an outpatient basis unless severe symptoms require parenteral analgesics, other disorders
