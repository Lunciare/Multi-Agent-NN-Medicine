Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

brain or pancreatic cancers where 10 to 15% of patients can develop VTE (1). Occult cancers may be present in patients with apparently idiopathic DVT, but extensive workup of patients for tumors is not recommended unless patients have major risk factors for cancer or symptoms suggestive of an occult cancer. Pathophysiology of Deep Venous Thrombosis Lower extremity DVT most often results from Impaired venous return (eg, in immobilized patients) Endothelial injury or dysfunction (eg, after leg fractures) Hypercoagulability Upper extremity DVT most often results from Endothelial injury due to central venous catheters, pacemakers, or injection drug use Upper extremity DVT occasionally occurs as part of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome (compression or invasion of the superior vena cava by a tumor and causing symptoms such as facial swelling, dilated neck veins, and facial flushing) or results from a hypercoagulable state or subclavian vein compression at the thoracic outlet (1). The compression may be due to a normal or an accessory first rib or fibrous band (thoracic outlet syndrome) or occur during strenuous arm activity (effort thrombosis, or Paget- Schroetter syndrome, which is rare). 3/14 Deep venous thrombosis usually begins in venous valve cusps. Thrombi consist of thrombin, fibrin, and red
