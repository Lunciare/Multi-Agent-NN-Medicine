Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

Deep Veins of the Legs Lower extremity DVT is much more likely to cause pulmonary embolism (PE), possibly because of the higher clot burden. Approximately 90% of proximal DVTs involve the femoral or popliteal veins and 10% extend more proximally to involve the iliofemoral veins (2). DVT of the distal or calf veins usually involve the posterior tibial or peroneal veins. Distal or calf vein DVT is less likely to be a source of large emboli but can propagate to the proximal thigh veins and from there cause PE. About 50% of patients with DVT have occult PE, and at least 30% of patients with PE have demonstrable DVT (3). Pearls & Pitfalls About 50% of patients with DVT have occult pulmonary emboli. Etiology of Deep Venous Thrombosis Many factors can contribute to DVT (see table Risk Factors for Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism). Cancer is a risk factor for DVT, particularly in older patients and in patients with recurrent thrombosis. The association is strongest for lung, ovarian, gastric, brain or pancreatic cancers where 10 to 15% of patients can develop VTE (1). Occult cancers may be present in patients with apparently idiopathic DVT, but extensive workup of patients
