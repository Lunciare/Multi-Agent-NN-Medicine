arms and legs. Dilated collateral superficial veins may become visible or palpable. Calf discomfort elicited by ankle 4/14 dorsiflexion with the knee extended (Homans sign) occasionally occurs with distal leg DVT but is neither sensitive nor specific. Tenderness, swelling of the whole leg, > 3 cm difference in circumference between calves, pitting edema, and collateral superficial veins may be most specific; DVT is likely with a combination of ≥ 3 in the absence of another likely diagnosis (see table Probability of Deep Venous Thrombosis Based on Clinical Factors). Low-grade fever may be present; DVT may be the cause of fever without an obvious source, especially in postoperative patients. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism, if it occurs, may include shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain.
