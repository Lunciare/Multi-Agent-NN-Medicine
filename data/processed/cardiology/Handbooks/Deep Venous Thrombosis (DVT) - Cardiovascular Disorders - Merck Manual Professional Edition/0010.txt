Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

a sensitivity of about 95% (2). D-dimer levels also increase with age, which further decreases the specificity in older patients (3). The Pulmonary Embolism Graduated D-dimer (PEGeD) strategy is a diagnostic approach for pulmonary embolism that adjusts for D-dimer levels according to the patient's clinical pretest probability(4): If pretest probability of DVT is low, DVT can generally be excluded in patients with a D- dimer level < 1000 ng/mL(< 5476 nmol/L) on a sensitive test. If pretest probability of DVT is moderate, DVT can be excluded in patients with a normal D-dimer level (ie, < 500 ng/mL) on a sensitive test. Patients with a positive test require additional testing to rule out DVT. If pretest probability of DVT is high, D-dimer testing can be done at the same time as duplex ultrasonography. A positive ultrasound result confirms the diagnosis regardless of the D-dimer level. If ultrasonography does not reveal evidence of DVT, a normal D-dimer level helps exclude DVT. Patients with an elevated D-dimer level should have repeat 8/14 ultrasonography in a few days or additional imaging, such as venography, depending on clinical suspicion. Additional testing If symptoms and signs suggest PE, additional imaging (eg, CT pulmonary angiography or, less
