Testing for Suspected Deep Venous Thrombosis. 6/14 One Approach to Testing for Suspected Deep Venous Thrombosis CLINICAL CALCULATORS DVT Probability: Wells Score System Ultrasonography 7/14 Doppler Ultrasound of a Patient with a Thrombus in Femoral Vein Ultrasonography identifies thrombi by directly visualizing the venous lining and by demonstrating abnormal vein compressibility or, with Doppler flow studies, impaired venous flow. The test is > 90% sensitive and > 95% specific for femoral and popliteal vein thrombosis but is less accurate for iliac or calf vein thrombosis (1). D-Dimer D-Dimer is a byproduct of fibrinolysis; elevated levels suggest recent presence and lysis of thrombi. D- Dimer assays vary in sensitivity and specificity; however, most are sensitive and not specific. A positive test result is nonspecific because levels can be elevated by other conditions (eg, liver disease, trauma, pregnancy, positive rheumatoid factor, inflammation, recent surgery, cancer), and further testing is necessary. Only the most accurate tests should be used. For example, a highly sensitive test is enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which has a sensitivity of about 95% (2). D-dimer levels also increase with age, which further decreases the specificity in older patients (3). The Pulmonary Embolism Graduated D-dimer (PEGeD) strategy is a
