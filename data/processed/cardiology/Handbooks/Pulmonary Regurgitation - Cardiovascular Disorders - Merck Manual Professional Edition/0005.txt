requires no intervention. Establishing the severity of pulmonary regurgitation by echocardiography can be challenging; criteria exist but are most useful when regurgitation is clearly severe (with diastolic flow reversal in the branch pulmonary arteries, a pressure half-time of 100 msec or less, and a wide color Doppler jet), or clearly mild (small color jet with minimal or no flow reversal in the main pulmonary artery). Cardiac MRI can be used to quantify the regurgitant fraction and more precisely grade the severity, along with quantifying the presence and degree of right ventricle dilation (1, 2). An ECG and chest radiograph are usually also obtained. ECG may show signs of RV hypertrophy; chest radiograph may show RV enlargement and evidence of conditions underlying pulmonary hypertension. Treatment of Pulmonary Regurgitation Treatment of cause Sometimes pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) Treatment is management of the condition causing pulmonary regurgitation, particularly when pulmonary hypertension is the cause. Pulmonary valve replacement is an option if RV dilation or dysfunction develops, particularly if the patient has symptoms. Pulmonary valve replacement is the treatment of choice for patients with moderate or greater PR after intervention for pulmonary stenosis, who have right ventricle dilation and symptoms or progressive decrease in
