Pulmonary (pulmonic) regurgitation (PR) is incomplete closure of the pulmonary valve causing backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole. The most common cause is pulmonary hypertension. PR is usually asymptomatic. Signs include a decrescendo diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Usually, no specific treatment is necessary except for management of pulmonary hypertension.
