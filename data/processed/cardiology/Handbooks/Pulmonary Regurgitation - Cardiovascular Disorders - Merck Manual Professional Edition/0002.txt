Pulmonary Regurgitation

contribute to development of right ventricular (RV) dilatation and eventually RV dysfunction– induced heart failure (HF), but in most cases, pulmonary hypertension contributes to this complication much more significantly. Rarely, acute RV dysfunction–induced HF develops when endocarditis causes acute PR. Symptoms and Signs of Pulmonary Regurgitation Pulmonary regurgitation is usually asymptomatic. A few patients develop symptoms and signs of RV dysfunction–induced HF (eg, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion). Palpable signs are attributable to pulmonary hypertension and RV hypertrophy. They include a palpable pulmonic component (P2) of the second heart sound (S2) at the left upper sternal border and a sustained RV impulse that is increased in amplitude at the left middle and lower sternal border. Auscultation High-pitched, early diastolic decrescendo murmur On auscultation, the first heart sound (S1) is normal. The S2 may be split or single. When split, P2 may be loud and audible shortly after the aortic component of S2 (A2) because of pulmonary hypertension, or P2 may be delayed because of increased RV stroke volume. S2 may be single because of prompt pulmonary valve closing with a merged A2-P2 or, rarely, because of congenital absence of the pulmonary valve. An RV third heart sound (S3),
