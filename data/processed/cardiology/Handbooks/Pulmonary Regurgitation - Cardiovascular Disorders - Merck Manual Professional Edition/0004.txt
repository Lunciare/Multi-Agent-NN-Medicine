Pulmonary Regurgitation

PR murmur louder) and by Valsalva release. After Valsalva release, the PR murmur immediately becomes loud (because of immediate venous return to the right side of the heart), but the aortic regurgitation murmur requires 4 or 5 beats to do so. Also, a soft PR murmur may sometimes become even softer during inspiration because this murmur is usually best heard at the second left intercostal space, where inspiration pushes the stethoscope away from the heart. In some forms of congenital heart disease, the murmur of severe PR is quite short because the pressure gradient between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle equalizes rapidly in diastole. Mixed pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency, as in the case of a deteriorating bioprosthetic valve or a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, can be heard as a to-fro murmur in both systole and diastole. Diagnosis of Pulmonary Regurgitation Echocardiography Pulmonary regurgitation is usually incidentally detected during a physical examination or Doppler echocardiography performed for other reasons. Mild PR is a common echocardiographic finding that requires no intervention. Establishing the severity of pulmonary regurgitation by echocardiography can be challenging; criteria exist but are most useful when regurgitation is clearly severe (with diastolic flow reversal in
