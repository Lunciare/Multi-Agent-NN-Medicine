Pulmonary (pulmonic) regurgitation (PR) is incomplete closure of the pulmonary valve causing backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole. The most common cause is pulmonary hypertension. PR is usually asymptomatic. Signs include a decrescendo diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Usually, no specific treatment is necessary except for management of pulmonary hypertension. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) In adults, the most common cause by far of pulmonary regurgitation, also called pulmonic regurgitation or pulmonary insufficiency, is: Secondary pulmonary hypertension Less common causes are: Congenital heart disease Idiopathic pulmonary artery dilation Infective endocarditis Surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot or other congenital heart disease involving the pulmonary valve Rare causes are: Carcinoid syndrome Rheumatic fever Following intervention for valvular pulmonary stenosis (early or late) Congenital heart disease such as absent pulmonary valve syndrome and severe Ebstein anomaly Severe pulmonary regurgitation is rare and most often results from an isolated congenital defect involving dilation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve annulus. PR may contribute to development of right ventricular (RV) dilatation and eventually RV dysfunction– induced heart failure (HF), but in most cases, pulmonary hypertension contributes to this complication much more significantly.
