Purkinje fibers
Purkinje fibers work with the sinoatrial node (SA node) and the atrioventricular node (AV node) to
control the heart rate.
During the ventricular contraction portion of the cardiac cycle, the Purkinje fibers carry the
contraction impulse from the left and right bundle branches to the myocardium of the
ventricles. This causes the muscle tissue of the ventricles to contract and force blood out of the
heart — either to the pulmonary circulation (from the right ventricle) or to the systemic circulation
(from the left ventricle).
The impulse through the Purkinje fibers is associated with the QRS complex.
Purkinje fibers also have the ability of automaticity - they generate action potentials, but at a
slower rate than sinoatrial node and other atrial ectopic pacemakers. Thus they serve as the last
resort when other pacemakers fail.
Historical Perspective
They were discovered in 1839 by Jan Evangelista Purkinje, who gave them his name.
