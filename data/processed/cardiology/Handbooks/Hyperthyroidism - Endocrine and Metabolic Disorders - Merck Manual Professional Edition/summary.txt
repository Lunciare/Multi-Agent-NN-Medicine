Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones. Symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, weight loss, heat intolerance, anxiety, and tremor. Diagnosis is clinical and with thyroid function tests. Treatment depends on cause. (See also Overview of Thyroid Function.) Hyperthyroidism affects about 1% of people in the United States. It can occur at any age but is more common in females between the ages of 20 and 50 years (1).
