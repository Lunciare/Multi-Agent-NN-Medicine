cause and generally causes less severe manifestations). It may be precipitated by infection, trauma, surgery, embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or preeclampsia. Thyroid storm causes abrupt florid symptoms of hyperthyroidism with one or more of the following: fever, marked weakness and muscle wasting, extreme restlessness with wide emotional swings, confusion, psychosis, coma, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatomegaly with mild jaundice. The patient may present with tachycardia or cardiovascular collapse and shock. Thyroid storm is a life- threatening emergency requiring prompt treatment. Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism TSH measurement Free T4, plus either free T3 or total T3 measurement Sometimes radioactive iodine uptake Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is based on history, physical examination, and thyroid function tests. Serum TSH measurement is the best test because TSH is suppressed in patients with hyperthyroidism except in the rare instance when the etiology is a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or pituitary resistance to the normal inhibition by thyroid hormone. Free T4 is increased in hyperthyroidism. However, T4 can be falsely normal in true hyperthyroidism in patients with a severe systemic illness (similar to the falsely low levels that occur in euthyroid sick syndrome) and in T3 toxicosis. If free T4 level is normal and TSH is low in a patient
