Hyperthyroidism

illness (similar to the falsely low levels that occur in euthyroid sick syndrome) and in T3 toxicosis. If free T4 level is normal and TSH is low in a patient with subtle symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, then serum T3 should be measured to detect T3 toxicosis; an elevated level confirms that diagnosis. The cause can often be diagnosed clinically (eg, the presence of signs specific to Graves disease). If not, radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid may be measured by using iodine-123. When hyperthyroidism is due to hormone overproduction, radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid is usually elevated (diffusely in Graves disease, focally in uninodular or multinodular goiter). When hyperthyroidism is due to thyroiditis, iodine ingestion, or overtreatment with thyroid hormones, radioactive iodine uptake is low. TSH receptor antibodies can be measured to evaluate for Graves disease. Measurement is done in pregnant women with a history of Graves disease during the third trimester of pregnancy to assess the risk of neonatal Graves disease; TSH receptor antibodies readily cross the placenta to stimulate the fetal thyroid. Most patients with Graves disease have circulating antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and fewer have antithyroglobulin antibodies. 8/15 Inappropriate TSH secretion is uncommon. The diagnosis is
