from functioning metastatic follicular carcinoma, especially in pulmonary metastases. Struma ovarii develops when ovarian teratomas contain enough thyroid tissue to cause true hyperthyroidism. Radioactive iodine uptake occurs in the pelvis, and uptake by the thyroid is usually suppressed. Pathophysiology of Hyperthyroidism In hyperthyroidism, serum T3 usually increases more than does T4, probably because of increased secretion of T3 as well as conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. In some patients, only T3 is elevated (T3 toxicosis). T3 toxicosis may occur in any of the common disorders that cause hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease, multinodular goiter, and the autonomously functioning solitary thyroid nodule. If T3 toxicosis is untreated, the patient usually also develops laboratory abnormalities typical of hyperthyroidism (ie, elevated T4 and increased iodine-123 uptake). The various forms of thyroiditis commonly have a hyperthyroid phase followed by a hypothyroid phase. Symptoms and Signs of Hyperthyroidism 3/15 Most symptoms and signs are the same regardless of the cause. Exceptions include infiltrative ophthalmopathy and infiltrative dermopathy, which occur only in Graves disease. Pearls & Pitfalls Older adults with hyperthyroidism may have symptoms similar to depression or dementia. The clinical presentation may be dramatic or subtle. A goiter or nodule may be present.
