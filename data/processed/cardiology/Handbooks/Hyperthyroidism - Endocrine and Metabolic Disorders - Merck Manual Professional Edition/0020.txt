Hyperthyroidism

in 1 L 0.9% saline solution 0.5 to 1 g IV given slowly once a day. Complications of iodine therapy include inflammation of the salivary glands, conjunctivitis, and rash. Surgery Surgery is indicated for patients with Graves disease whose hyperthyroidism has recurred after courses of antithyroid medications and who refuse iodine-131 therapy, patients who cannot tolerate antithyroid medications, patients with very large goiters, and in some younger patients with toxic adenoma and multinodular goiter. Surgery may be done in older patients with giant nodular goiters. Surgery usually restores normal function. Postoperative recurrences vary between 2 and 16%; risk of hypothyroidism is directly related to the extent of surgery. Vocal cord paralysis and hypoparathyroidism are uncommon complications. Saturated solution of potassium iodide 3 drops (about 100 to 150 mg) orally 3 times a day should be given for 10 days before surgery to reduce the vascularity of the gland. Methimazole must be given first because the patient should be euthyroid before iodide is given. Dexamethasone can be added to rapidly restore euthyroidism. Surgical procedures on the anterior neck are more difficult in patients who previously underwent thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy because of scar tissue.
