these complications. Treatment of Hyperthyroidism Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause (1) but may include Radioactive iodine Methimazole or propylthiouracil Beta-blockers Iodine Surgery Radioactive sodium iodine (iodine-131, radioiodine) In the United States, iodine-131 is the most common treatment for hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine is often recommended as the treatment of choice for Graves disease and toxic nodular goiter in all patients, including children. Epidemiologic studies report a very small increased risk of secondary malignancies with I-131 treatment, depending on the type of cancer and length of follow-up (2), so some clinicians use antithyroid medications instead. Dosage of iodine-131 is difficult to adjust because the response of the gland cannot be predicted; some clinicians give a standard dose of 8 to 15 millicurie. Others adjust the dose based on estimated thyroid size and the 24-hour uptake to provide a dose of 80 to 120 microcurie/g thyroid tissue. When sufficient iodine-131 is given to cause euthyroidism, approximately 25 to 50% of patients become hypothyroid 1 year later, and the incidence continues to increase yearly. Thus, most patients eventually become hypothyroid and require thyroid hormone replacement. However, if smaller doses are used, incidence of recurrence is higher. Larger doses, such as 10 to 20
