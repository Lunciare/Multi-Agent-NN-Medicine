with pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone, in whom TSH levels are high. The TSH produced in both of these pituitary disorders is biologically more active than normal TSH. An increase in the alpha-subunit of TSH in the blood (helpful in differential diagnosis) occurs in patients with a TSH- secreting pituitary adenoma. Medication-induced hyperthyroidism can result from amiodarone, checkpoint inhibitors used in cancer therapy, alemtuzumab used in treatment of multiple sclerosis, or interferon-alfa, which may induce thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism and other thyroid disorders. Although more commonly causing hypothyroidism, lithium can rarely cause hyperthyroidism. Patients receiving these medications should be closely monitored. 2/15 Thyrotoxicosis factitia is hyperthyroidism resulting from intentional or accidental overingestion of thyroid hormone. Excess iodine ingestion causes hyperthyroidism with a low thyroid radioactive iodine uptake. It most often occurs in patients with underlying nontoxic nodular goiter (especially older patients) who are given medications that contain iodine (eg, amiodarone) or who undergo radiologic studies using iodine- rich contrast agents. The etiology may be that the excess iodine provides substrate for functionally autonomous (ie, not under TSH regulation) areas of the thyroid to produce hormone. Hyperthyroidism usually persists as long as excess iodine remains in the circulation. Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy)
