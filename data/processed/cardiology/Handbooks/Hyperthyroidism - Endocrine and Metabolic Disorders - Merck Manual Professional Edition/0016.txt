Hyperthyroidism

hours. Such dosages or higher ones (up to 400 mg every 8 hours) are generally reserved for severely ill patients, including those with thyroid storm, to block the conversion of T4 to T3. Maintenance dosing with propylthiouracil is 50 mg twice a day or 3 times a day Approximately 20 to 50% of patients with Graves disease remain in remission after a 1- to 2-year course of either methimazole or propylthiouracil. The return to normal or a marked decrease in gland size, the restoration of a normal serum TSH level, and resolution of hyperthyroid symptoms are good prognostic signs of long-term remission. The concomitant use of antithyroid medications and levothyroxine does not improve the remission rate in patients with Graves disease. Because toxic nodular goiter rarely goes into remission, antithyroid medication is given only in preparation for surgical treatment or iodine-131 therapy. Adverse effects include rash, allergic reactions, abnormal liver function (including hepatic failure with propylthiouracil), and, in approximately 0.1% of patients, reversible agranulocytosis. Patients allergic to one medication can be switched to the other, but cross-sensitivity may occur. If agranulocytosis occurs, the patient cannot be switched to the other medication; other therapy (eg, radioiodine, surgery) should be used. 10/15
