Hyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormones. Symptoms include palpitations, fatigue, weight loss, heat intolerance, anxiety, and tremor. Diagnosis is clinical and with thyroid function tests. Treatment depends on cause. (See also Overview of Thyroid Function.) Hyperthyroidism affects about 1% of people in the United States. It can occur at any age but is more common in females between the ages of 20 and 50 years (1). Hyperthyroidism can be classified on the basis of thyroid radioactive iodine uptake and the level of circulating thyroid hormones (see table Results of Thyroid Function Tests in Various Clinical Situations). Etiology of Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism may result from increased synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) from the thyroid, caused by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) or by autonomous thyroid hyperfunction. It can also result from excessive release of thyroid hormone from the thyroid without increased synthesis. Such release is commonly caused by the destructive changes of various types of thyroiditis. The most common causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves disease Multinodular goiter Single, autonomous, hyperfunctioning "hot" nodule 1/15 Thyroiditis Graves disease (toxic diffuse goiter), the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is characterized by hyperthyroidism and one
