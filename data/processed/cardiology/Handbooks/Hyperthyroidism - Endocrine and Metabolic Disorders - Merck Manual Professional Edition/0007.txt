Pearls & Pitfalls Older adults with hyperthyroidism may have symptoms similar to depression or dementia. The clinical presentation may be dramatic or subtle. A goiter or nodule may be present. Many common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are due to enhanced sensitivity to adrenergic hormones, such as nervousness, palpitations, hyperactivity, increased sweating, heat hypersensitivity, fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, weakness, and frequent bowel movements (occasionally diarrhea). Hypomenorrhea may be present. Signs may include warm, moist skin, tremor, tachycardia, widened pulse pressure, and atrial fibrillation. Graves Disease (Enlarged Thyroid Gland) Older patients, particularly those with toxic nodular goiter, may present atypically (apathetic or masked hyperthyroidism) with symptoms more akin to depression or dementia. Most do not have exophthalmos or tremor. Atrial fibrillation, syncope, altered sensorium, heart failure, and weakness are more likely. Symptoms and signs may involve only a single organ system. Eye signs Eye signs of hyperthyroidism include stare, eyelid lag, eyelid retraction, and mild conjunctival injection and are largely due to excessive adrenergic stimulation. They usually remit with successful treatment to normalize thyroid hormone levels. 4/15 Infiltrative ophthalmopathy, also called thyroid eye disease, is a more serious development and is specific to Graves disease.
