Hyperthyroidism

the high dosages used (over 800 mg a day) partially block the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 in addition to decreasing production in the thyroid. The combination of high-dose propylthiouracil and dexamethasone, also a potent inhibitor of T4 to T3 conversion, can relieve symptoms of severe hyperthyroidism in patients with thyroid storm and restore the serum T3 level to normal within a week. Beta-blockers Symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism due to adrenergic stimulation may respond to beta-blockers; propranolol has had the greatest use, but atenolol or metoprolol may be preferable. Manifestations that typically respond to beta-blockers include Tachycardia Tremor Some mental symptoms (eg, anxiety) Eyelid lag Occasionally heat intolerance and sweating, diarrhea, and proximal myopathy also respond to beta- blockers. Manifestations that typically do not respond to beta-blockers include Goiter Exophthalmos Weight loss Bruit 11/15 Increased oxygen consumption Increased circulating thyroxine levels Propranolol is indicated in thyroid storm (see table Treatment of Thyroid Storm). It rapidly decreases heart rate, usually within 2 to 3 hours when given orally and within minutes when given intravenously. Esmolol should be used only in the intensive care unit because it requires careful titration and monitoring. Beta-blockers are also indicated for tachycardia with hyperthyroidism,
