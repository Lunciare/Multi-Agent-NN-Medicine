be switched to the other, but cross-sensitivity may occur. If agranulocytosis occurs, the patient cannot be switched to the other medication; other therapy (eg, radioiodine, surgery) should be used. 10/15 Pearls & Pitfalls If agranulocytosis occurs with one of the antithyroid peroxidase medications (methimazole or propylthiouracil), avoid using another medication in the same class; use another therapy (eg, radioiodine, surgery) instead. Potential adverse effects or other characteristics vary between the 2 medications and guide the indications for each. Methimazole need only be given once a day, which improves adherence. Furthermore, when methimazole is used in dosages of < 20 mg a day, agranulocytosis is less common; with propylthiouracil, agranulocytosis may occur at any dosage. Methimazole has been used successfully in pregnant and nursing women without fetal or infant complications, but rarely methimazole has been associated with scalp and gastrointestinal defects in neonates and with a rare embryopathy. Because of these complications, propylthiouracil is used in the first trimester of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil is preferred for the treatment of thyroid storm, because the high dosages used (over 800 mg a day) partially block the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 in addition to decreasing production in the thyroid. The combination of high-dose
