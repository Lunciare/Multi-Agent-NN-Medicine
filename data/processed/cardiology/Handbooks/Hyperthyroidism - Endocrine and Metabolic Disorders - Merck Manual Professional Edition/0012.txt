placenta to stimulate the fetal thyroid. Most patients with Graves disease have circulating antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and fewer have antithyroglobulin antibodies. 8/15 Inappropriate TSH secretion is uncommon. The diagnosis is confirmed when hyperthyroidism occurs with elevated circulating free T4 and T3 concentrations and normal or elevated serum TSH. If thyrotoxicosis factitia is suspected, serum thyroglobulin can be measured; it is usually low or low- normal—unlike in all other causes of hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hyperthyroidism Subclinical hyperthyroidism is low serum TSH in patients with normal serum free T4 and T3 and absent or minimal symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is far less common than subclinical hypothyroidism. Many patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism are taking levothyroxine. The other causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism are the same as those for clinically apparent hyperthyroidism. Patients with serum TSH < 0.1 microU/mL (0.1 mU/L) have an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (particularly older patients), reduced bone mineral density, increased fractures, and increased mortality. Patients with serum TSH that is only slightly below normal are less likely to have these complications. Treatment of Hyperthyroidism Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause (1) but may include Radioactive iodine Methimazole or propylthiouracil Beta-blockers Iodine Surgery Radioactive sodium iodine (iodine-131, radioiodine) In
