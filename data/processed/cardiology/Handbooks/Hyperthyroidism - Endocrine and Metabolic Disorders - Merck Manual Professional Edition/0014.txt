yearly. Thus, most patients eventually become hypothyroid and require thyroid hormone replacement. However, if smaller doses are used, incidence of recurrence is higher. Larger doses, such as 10 to 20 millicurie, often cause hypothyroidism within 6 months. 9/15 Radioactive iodine is not used during lactation because it can enter breast milk and cause hypothyroidism in the infant. It is not used during pregnancy because it crosses the placenta and can cause severe fetal hypothyroidism. There is no proof that radioiodine increases the incidence of tumors, leukemia, thyroid cancer, or birth defects in children born to previously hyperthyroid women who become pregnant after treatment was completed. Methimazole and propylthiouracil These antithyroid medications block thyroid peroxidase, decreasing the organification of iodide, and impair the coupling reaction. Propylthiouracil in high doses also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Methimazole is the preferred medication. The usual starting dose of methimazole is 5 to 20 mg orally 1 to 3 times a day. Normalization of TSH lags normalization of T4 and T3 levels by weeks. Therefore, when T4 and T3 levels normalize, the dosage is decreased to the lowest effective amount, usually methimazole 2.5 to 10 mg once a day in order to
