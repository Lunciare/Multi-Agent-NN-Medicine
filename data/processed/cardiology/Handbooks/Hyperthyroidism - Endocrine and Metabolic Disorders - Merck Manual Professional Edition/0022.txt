Hyperthyroidism

if necessary for atrial fibrillation Treatment of underlying disorder, such as infection Corticosteroids: Hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously every 8 hours or Dexamethasone 2 mg intravenously every 6 hours Definitive therapy after control of the crisis via ablation of the thyroid with iodine- 131 or surgical treatment Treatment of infiltrative dermopathy In infiltrative dermopathy (in Graves disease), topical corticosteroids or corticosteroid injections into the lesions may decrease the dermopathy. Dermopathy sometimes remits spontaneously after months or years. Treatment of infiltrative ophthalmopathy 13/15 Ophthalmopathy should be treated jointly by the endocrinologist and ophthalmologist and may require selenium, corticosteroids, orbital radiation, and surgery. Surgical thyroidectomy may help resolve or prevent progression of ophthalmopathy. Teprotumumab, an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor inhibitor, is very effective therapy for moderately severe ophthalmopathy (3). Radioiodine therapy may accelerate progression of ophthalmopathy when ophthalmopathy is active, and is thus contraindicated in this active phase. Management of subclinical hyperthyroidism In patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism who are taking levothyroxine, reduction of the dose is the most appropriate management unless therapy is aimed at maintaining suppressed TSH levels in patients with thyroid cancer. Therapy is indicated for patients with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism (serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L [ < 0.1
