Atrial Fibrillation and Wolff-Parkinson-White

Syndrome Ventricular response is very fast (RR intervals minimum of 160 msec). Shortly thereafter, ventricular fibrillation develops (lead II continuous rhythm strip at bottom). General reference 1. Klein GJ, Bashore TM, Sellers TD, et al: Ventricular fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. N Engl J Med 301(20):1080–1085, 1979. doi: 10.1056/NEJM197911153012003 Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation and WPW Syndrome Direct-current cardioversion The treatment of choice for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation is direct current cardioversion (1). The usual rate-slowing medications used in atrial fibrillation are not effective, and digoxin, adenosine, and the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) that may be used in many other forms of supraventricular tachycardia are contraindicated because they may increase the ventricular rate and cause ventricular fibrillation. If cardioversion is impossible, medications that prolong the refractory period of the accessory connection should be used. IV procainamide or ibutilide is preferred (1), but any class Ia, class Ic, or class III antiarrhythmic medication can be used. 2/3 Pearls & Pitfalls Do not give digoxin, adenosine, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) to patients with atrial fibrillation and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because these medications may trigger ventricular fibrillation.
