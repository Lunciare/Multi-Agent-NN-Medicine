ven- tricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This was based on the original treatment trials in heart failure that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in patients with 2/12 LVEF above 40%. The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guideline uses the following classification of heart failure: Reduced LVEF (HFrEF): 40% or less; significant reduction in LV systolic function. Mildly reduced LV systolic function (HFmrEF): LVEF between 41% and 49%. Preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): 50% or higher. Heart failure is divided into: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction : defined as heart failure with an ejection fraction less than 40%. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction . Usually relaxation rather than con- traction of the left ventricle is affected, and ejection fraction is normal or at least above 40%. The ESC guidelines also define a heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) of 40-49%, which they consider a grey area where normal ejection fraction is 50 or more. The definition of normal varies somewhat between ex- perts, but NICE and the ESC guidelines agree on the 40% cut off for reduced vs preserved ejection fraction definitions. This distinction is clinically important, as the two main types of heart failure are rep- resentative of different
