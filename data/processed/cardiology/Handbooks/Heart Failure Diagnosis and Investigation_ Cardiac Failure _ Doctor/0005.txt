Heart failure diagnosis and investigation
KEYWORDS: heart, failure, heart failure, ejection fraction, ejection, fraction, acute, disease, echocardiography, people, reduced, symptoms, cardiac, years, chronic

Europe is about 5 per 1,000 person/years in adults, and the prevalence is 1-2% in adults (1% for those under 55 years, and more than 10% for those aged over 70 years). In people with heart failure, about 50% have reduced ejection fraction and 50% have preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction. Heart failure accounts for about 2% of all NHS hospitalised bed-days, and 5% of all NHS medical emergency admissions. Aetiology Coronary heart disease and hypertension are the most common causes of heart failure in the UK. Valvular heart disease: Aortic stenosis can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) due to chronic excessive afterload. Aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation, atrial septal defect (ASD), ven- tricular septal defect (VSD) and tricuspid incompetence cause excessive preload. Heart failure secondary to myocardial disease: Coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemia, arrhyth- mias - eg, atrial fibrillation (AF), heart block). Hypertension (increased vascular resistance, often with LVH but preserved ejection fraction). Cardiomyopathies. Drugs - eg, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, anti-arrhythmics, cytotoxics. Toxins - eg, alcohol, cocaine, mercury, cobalt, arsenic. 4/12 Endocrine - eg, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syn- drome, adrenal insufficiency, excessive growth hormone, phaeochromocy- toma. Nutritional - eg, deficiencies of thiamine, selenium, carnitine,
