Heart failure diagnosis and investigation

rate control and anticoagulation for AF or pacing for bradycardia. A normal ECG makes heart failure very unlikely (sensi- tivity 89%).[1] Echocardiography Following referral, all patients should have transthoracic echocardiography per- formed within the timescale above. This identifies valve disease and ventricular dys- function, and detects shunts. In people presenting with new suspected acute heart failure, consider performing transthoracic echocardiography within 48 hours of admission to guide early special- ist management.[2] Other tests Consider further tests to exclude other diagnoses and to ascertain aetiology, including: Blood tests: FBC, U&E and eGFR, LFTs, HbA1c, lipids, TFTs; consider cardiac en- zymes if an undiagnosed MI is possible in the preceding few days. 8/12 CXR - provides supportive evidence for heart failure and helps to exclude other potential causes of breathlessness. Typical findings in heart failure include: Cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio >50%). Ventricular hypertrophy. Prominent upper lobe veins (upper lobe diversion). Peribronchial cuffing. Diffuse interstitial or alveolar shadowing - classical perihilar 'bat's wings' or nodular (especially with pre-existing COPD). Fluid in the fissures. Pleural effusions. Kerley B lines. Apart from pulmonary congestion, CXR findings are only predictive of heart fail- ure where there are co-existing typical signs and symptoms. Urinalysis. Lung function tests (peak
