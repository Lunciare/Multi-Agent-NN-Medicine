alcohol, cocaine, mercury, cobalt, arsenic. 4/12 Endocrine - eg, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syn- drome, adrenal insufficiency, excessive growth hormone, phaeochromocy- toma. Nutritional - eg, deficiencies of thiamine, selenium, carnitine, and obesity, cachexia. Infiltrative - eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, haemochromatosis, Löffler's eosinophilia, connective tissue disease. Infective - eg, Chagas' disease, HIV. Arrhythmias - tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Conditions where there is increased peripheral demand on the heart - this oc- curs when cardiac output is normal or increased in the face of much increased needs. It can occur with a normal heart but even earlier if there is heart disease. This can be termed high-output cardiac failure. Causes include: Anaemia. Pregnancy. Sepsis. Hyperthyroidism. Paget's disease of bone. Arteriovenous malformations. Beriberi. Presentation[4] In general, the heart fails as a whole. However, sometimes a disproportionate burden falls on one ventricle and this influences the pattern of symptoms and signs. There is no symptom or sign that is both sensitive and specific for chronic heart failure.[5] Symptoms of heart failure Patients do not necessarily have all and some may be predominant at times. In ad- dition, patients may be depressed or complain of drug-related side-effects. 5/12 Dyspnoea on exertion and fatigue (may limit exercise tolerance).
