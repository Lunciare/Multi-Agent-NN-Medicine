effusions. Kerley B lines. Apart from pulmonary congestion, CXR findings are only predictive of heart fail- ure where there are co-existing typical signs and symptoms. Urinalysis. Lung function tests (peak flow or spirometry). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging - the gold standard for assessing ventric- ular volumes, mass and wall motion. It can be used with contrast to identify in- flammation, infiltration and scarring of the myocardium. MRI or radionuclide imaging may be useful where there was poor imaging on echocardiography. Staging The New York Heart Association's (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure has provided a clinically useful, functional classification, outlined below:[6] Class I: no symptoms on ordinary physical activity. Class II: slight limitation of physical activity by symptoms. Class III: less than ordinary activity leads to symptoms. Class IV: inability to carry out any activity without symptoms. 9/12 Indications for specialist referral[3] [4] All those with suspected heart failure should be referred to a specialist cardiac fail- ure multidisciplinary team. Refer for immediate assessment all those with severe symptoms or pregnant women with suspected heart failure. Adults with suspected heart failure should have specialist assessment and transtho- racic echocardiography within two weeks of referral if they have a very high N-termi-
