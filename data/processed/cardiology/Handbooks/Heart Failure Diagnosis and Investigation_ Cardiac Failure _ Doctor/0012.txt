women with suspected heart failure. Adults with suspected heart failure should have specialist assessment and transtho- racic echocardiography within two weeks of referral if they have a very high N-termi- nal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level (over 2,000 ng/L), or six weeks if they have a high NT-proBNP level (between 400 and 2,000 ng/L).[7] Prognosis of heart failure[4] Prognosis is poor on the whole, with approximately 50% of people with heart fail- ure dying within five years of diagnosis. The mortality rate in the UK appears to be improving. The UK National Heart fail- ure audit found the mortality of patients hospitalised with heart failure to be 9% in 2020-21. The prognosis for people with heart failure and preserved LV ejection fraction is a little better than the prognosis for people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Generally, the lower the ejection fraction, the poorer the prognosis. Other poor prognostic factors (although this does depend on the type of heart failure) include:[8] Increasing age. Smoking. Diabetes and other comorbidities (such as atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, COPD). Obesity or low BMI. Management of heart failure is discussed in the separate Heart Failure Management article.
