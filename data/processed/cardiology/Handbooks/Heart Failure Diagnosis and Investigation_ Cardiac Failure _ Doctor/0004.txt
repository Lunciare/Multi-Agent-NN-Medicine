Heart failure diagnosis and investigation

on the 40% cut off for reduced vs preserved ejection fraction definitions. This distinction is clinically important, as the two main types of heart failure are rep- resentative of different causes, demographics and comorbidities, and most impor- tantly treatment is different. Other classifications Other terms have been used in the past but are no longer in use. High vs low output failure has been replaced by ejection fraction terms. Systolic and diastolic failure are similarly no longer used. Classification by severity of symptoms is discussed in the 'Staging' section later, although symptom severity does not necessarily correlate with assessment of left ventricular function. Epidemiology[3] [4] The prevalence of heart failure increases with age. The average age at first diagnosis is 76 years. In the UK, the prevalence of heart failure is estimated to be about: 3/12 1 in 35 people 65-74 years of age. 1 in 15 people 75-84 years of age. Just over 1 in 7 people 85 years of age or older. The incidence of heart failure in Europe is about 5 per 1,000 person/years in adults, and the prevalence is 1-2% in adults (1% for those under 55 years, and more than 10% for those aged over
