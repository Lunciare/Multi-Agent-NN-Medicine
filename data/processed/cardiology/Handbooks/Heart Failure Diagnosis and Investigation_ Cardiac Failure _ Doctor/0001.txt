Heart failure diagnosis and investigation

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or ele- vated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress. characterised by: Typical symptoms: shortness of breath, fatigue, ankle swelling. Typical signs: tachycardia, tachypnoea, pulmonary rales, pleural effusion, raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly. Objective evidence of a structural or functional abnormality of the heart at rest: cardiomegaly, third heart sound, cardiac murmurs, echocardiogram abnormali- ties, raised natriuretic peptide concentration. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines require that there be symp- toms, signs and objective evidence present before a diagnosis of heart failure can be made.[1] Heart failure has a number of different aetiologies (see 'Aetiology', be- low) - always try to determine the cause. Heart failure should never be the only diag- nosis, as it is a syndrome occurring as a result of other diagnostic entities. Classification of heart failure Acute and chronic Heart failure has traditionally been described as acute heart failure or chronic heart failure, but this can be confusing and should be used to describe time, rather than severity. Acute heart failure can present as new-onset heart failure in people without known cardiac dysfunction, or as acute decompensation of chronic heart
