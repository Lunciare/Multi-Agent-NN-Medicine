2,000 ng/L (47 to 236 pmol/L) are referred to have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within six weeks. (This is equivalent to a BNP level between 100-400 pg/mL (29-116 pmol/L) where NT-proBNP is not available.) ≤ If the levels are normal (NT-proBNP level <400 ng/L or BNP 100 pg/ml), heart fail- ure is unlikely and other diagnoses should be considered. If there is still clinical suspicion of heart failure, discuss with a specialist physician. Note that BNP levels can be elevated in other situations than heart failure - for example: Left ventricular hypertrophy. Ischaemia. Tachycardia. Hypoxaemia. Renal dysfunction (eGFR <60). Age over 70. Liver cirrhosis. 7/12 Sepsis. COPD. Diabetes. Note that BNP levels can be reduced in certain circumstances such as: Obesity. African-Caribbean origin. Medication - diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, beta- blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. ECG Arrange an ECG in all patients with suspected heart failure. This not only identifies potential aetiological factors (for example, myocardial infarction or arrhythmias) but is also necessary for treatment decisions - eg, rate control and anticoagulation for AF or pacing for bradycardia. A normal ECG makes heart failure very unlikely (sensi- tivity 89%).[1] Echocardiography Following referral, all patients should have transthoracic echocardiography
