Orthopnoea (breathlessness on lying flat). Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). Fluid retention (may cause pulmonary or peripheral oedema. If the latter, the pa- tient may complain of weight gain, ankle swelling, or a bloating sensation). Nocturnal cough (± pink frothy sputum) or wheeze. Light-headedness or syncope. Anorexia. Signs of heart failure There may be a tachycardia at rest, low systolic blood pressure (BP), a displaced apex (LV dilatation) or RV heave (pulmonary hypertension), a narrow pulse pres- sure or pulsus alternans (alternating large and small pulse pressures) and a raised JVP. There may be a gallop rhythm due to presence of S3 (see also the separate Heart Auscultation article) or murmurs of mitral or aortic valve disease. Bilateral basal end-inspiratory crackles ± wheeze ('cardiac asthma'). Tachypnoea. Pleural effusions. Tender hepatomegaly - pulsatile in tricuspid regurgitation, with ascites. Often extensive peripheral oedema. There may be swollen ankles, sacral oede- ma or ascites. In acute failure the patient may look ill and exhausted and there may be cyanosis.
