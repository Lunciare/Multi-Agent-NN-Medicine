Heart failure diagnosis and investigation

be used to describe time, rather than severity. Acute heart failure can present as new-onset heart failure in people without known cardiac dysfunction, or as acute decompensation of chronic heart failure. NICE divides heart failure into two entities in this way, with separate guidelines for acute and chronic heart failure.[2] [3] The first is essentially aimed at an acute ad- mission in secondary care, whereas the second concentrates more on diagnosis of the longer-standing condition in primary care and referral on to a specialist sec- ondary care service, and the subsequent management there and follow-up in the community. The ESC guideline addresses acute and chronic heart failure together within one document.[1] Ejection fraction[1] [3] The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the percentage of the blood in the left ventricle which is pumped out with each heartbeat. It is measured on transthoracic echocardiography, and also can be assessed by MRI, transoesophageal echocar- diography and nuclear medicine scans. Heart failure has been grouped by severity based on the measurement of left ven- tricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This was based on the original treatment trials in heart failure that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in patients with 2/12 LVEF above 40%. The European
