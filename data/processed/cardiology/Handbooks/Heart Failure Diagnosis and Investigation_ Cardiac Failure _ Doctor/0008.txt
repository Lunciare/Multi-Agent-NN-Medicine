There may be swollen ankles, sacral oede- ma or ascites. In acute failure the patient may look ill and exhausted and there may be cyanosis. The peak expiratory flow rate may be reduced but, if it is <150 litres/minute, suspect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. 6/12 Investigations[3] Having taken a history and performed an examination then the following investiga- tions are recommended by NICE. Measure NT-proBNP A blood test to check N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) should be done in all people with heart failure. Previous NICE guidance distinguished be- tween management of those with a prior history of MI and those without, but updat- ed 2018 guidelines recommend that: All those with suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level >2,000 ng/L (236 pmol/L) be referred urgently, to have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within two weeks. (This is equivalent to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP level) >400 pg/mL (116 pmol/L) where NT-proBNP is not available.) All those with suspected heart failure and an NT-proBNP level between 400 and 2,000 ng/L (47 to 236 pmol/L) are referred to have specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography within six weeks. (This is equivalent to a BNP level between 100-400 pg/mL (29-116 pmol/L)
