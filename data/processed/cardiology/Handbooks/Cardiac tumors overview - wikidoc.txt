Cardiac tumors overview
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)
Overview
The primary tumors of the heart are tumors that arise from the normal tissues that make up
the heart. This is in contrast to secondary tumors of the heart, which are typically either metastatic
from another part of the body, or infiltrate the heart via direct extension from the surrounding
tissues.
History and Symptoms
Cardiac tumors present with a wide variety of symptoms. Many patients remain asymptomatic,
and the tumor is an incidental finding. Some patients may present with symptoms of mimicking
those of valve abnormalities such as mitral stenosis. Patients may also present with rhythm
disturbances,endocarditis or even heart failure.
Physical Examination
A "tumor plop" (a sound related to movement of the tumor), abnormal heart sounds, or murmur
may be heard. These sounds may change when the patient changes position.
Electrocardiogram
There are no specific ECG abnormalities associated with heart tumors. The ECG changes vary
depending on the location of the tumor and aid in the diagnosis of tumors when used in
conjunction with other diagnostic modalities.
Historical Perspective
As early as 1559, Dr. Realdo Colombo wrote about heart tumors, and the first successful surgery to
remove a left atrial myxoma was performed in 1954 by Dr. Clarence Crafoord. After the discovery
of cardiac tumors, new chemotherapeutic agents and treatments have been developed.
Classification
Based on their origin, cardiac tumors are classed as either primary or secondary. Primary cardiac
tumors are classified as either benign, malignant, or intermediate.
Pathophysiology
Cardiac tumors' exact pathogenesis remains an enigma. Some cardiac tumors are linked to genetic
predispositions or are a part of syndromes.

• Cardiac fibromas may be related with Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by congenital anomalies and a predisposition to tumorigenesis.
• Cardiac myxomas may be related with Carney complex, an autosomal dominant disorder.
• Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy is occasionally inherited, however the underlying genetic
abnormalities are still unclear.
• The majority of undifferentiated cardiac sarcomas share the same genetic profile as pulmonary
artery intimal sarcomas, which are defined by recurrent mutations in the MDM2, PDGFRA, and
CDKN2A genes.
• Papillary fibroelastomas have been reported following cardiac instrumentation and thoracic
irradiation.
Causes
Numerous genetic abnormalities are linked to cardiac tumors however no direct causes have been
established as of yet. Some genetic disorders closely related with a high incidence of cardiac
tumors are Tuberous Sclerosis, Gorlin Syndrome, and Carneys Triad.
Differentiating Cardiac Tumors from other Diseases
Common cardiac tumor symptoms include fever, weight loss, and other constitutional symptoms.
Each tumor has unique traits that distinguish it from others.
Epidemiology and Demographics
Risk Factors
There are no recognized cardiac tumor risk factors. However, HIV increases the risk of Kaposi
sarcoma of the heart. Certain disorders, including Gorlin syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, LAMB,
NAME, and Paragangliomas, are linked to an elevated risk of cardiac tumors. The presence of
other tumors also increases the risk of secondary tumors in heart
Risk Factors for Embolization
Screening
The USPSTF does not suggest screening for heart tumors routinely. Transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) is the preferred screening tool for cardiac cancers. Valvular lesions are
frequently detected by Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

Cardiac tumors can originate in numerous ways, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations.
Regardless of the type of heart tumor, cardiac symptoms depend mostly on tumor location and
size. Patients with cardiac tumors can experience systemic constitutional symptoms, such as fever,
tiredness, and joint issues. Depending on the location of tumors, particular symptoms may
develop. The prognosis for benign cardiac tumors is good, but recurrence is possible, whereas the
prognosis for malignant tumors is dismal.
Diagnosis
Multiple cardiovascular imaging techniques could be utilized to outline the anatomy of the cardiac
mass and its potential functional consequences.
The primary purpose of cardiovascular imaging is to assess the location, extent, and vascularity of
the tumor, as well as any hemodynamic consequences and myopericardial invasion.
All patients should receive two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). A biopsy
provides the definitive diagnosis. The technique for a final diagnosis is carried out using
percutaneous cardiac biopsy and transvenous cardiac biopsy, guided by echocardiography,
mediastinoscopy, or thoracotomy.

Treatment
The vast majority of cardiac tumors are treated surgically. Primary malignant cardiac tumors have
a propensity for fast metastatic dissemination.
Systemic neoadjuvant therapy should be vigorously sought in hemodynamically stable patients
with localized disease because it permits: (a) faster removal by lowering the size of the tumor, and
(b) a reduction in the likelihood of systemic recurrence.
In certain instances, surgery may be an option for malignant tumors. Patients with a solitary heart
problem and a controlled primary tumor are the best candidates. The tumor must be amenable to
excision while preserving sufficient heart function to sustain life.
