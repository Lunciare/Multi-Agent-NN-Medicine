Restrictive cardiomyopathy

granuloma includes 3 histological stages: edema, granulomatous infiltration, and fibrosis. Hemochromatosis • Due to excessive accumulation of iron within the cells of various organs liver, pancreas, heart, and several endocrine glands leading to cirrhosis, diabetes, heart failure, skin pigmentation. Genetics Genes involved in the pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy include[9][10][11][12]: • Cardiac genes for desmin, α-actin, troponin I and troponin T. • Missense mutation (D190H) in the region of the cTnI gene (TNNI3). • De novo mutations (R192H and K178E) in the TNNI3 gene. • Mutations in the α-cardiac actin (ACTC), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and cTnT (TNNT2) genes have been noticed to have etiological causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy.
