Restrictive cardiomyopathy

ones directed at individual causes have been proven to be effective.[14][4][35][36] • The main purpose of treatment in restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the elevated filling pressures without significantly lowering the cardiac output. • Pharmacologic therapy may include: • Beta blockers • Amiodarone • Cardioselective calcium channel blockers • Diuretics • Anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation 7/8 • Digoxin (use with caution) • Melphalan (for antiplasma cell therapy in systemic amyloidosis) • Chemotherapy (in amyloidosis) • Corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents (eg, hydroxyurea), and interferon (in Loeffler endocarditis) • Chelation therapy or therapeutic phlebotomy (in hemochromatosis) • Other treatments: • Pacemaker implantation • Endomyocardectomy • Cardiac transplantation • Novel approches (eg, RNA interference or gene silencing molecules that target abnormal protein production in familial amyloidosis)
