Restrictive cardiomyopathy

of the lung bases/apices unilaterally/bilaterally • Rhonchi Heart • S1 • S2 • S3 • S4 • Gallops Abdomen • Hepatomegaly Back • Back examination of patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually normal. Genitourinary • Genitourinary examination of patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually normal. Neuromuscular • Neuromuscular examination of patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy is usually normal. Extremities • Peripheral edema of the lower extremities Laboratory Findings • The laboratory findings depends on the cause of the cardiomyopathy.[27][28] • Hematocrit, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, 24 hr urine total protein, and liver function should be assessed. • Arterial blood gas (ABG) should be checked for possibility of hypoxia. • Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T are indicative of the heart failure. 6/8 • Other Specific lab findings will depend upon the cause (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in sarcoidosis, complete blood count (CBC) with peripheral smear helping to establish eosinophilia in hypereosinophilic syndromes, serum iron concentrations, total iron-binding capacity and ferritin levels in hemocromatosis, immunoglobulin free light κ, λ chain testing, and serum and urine immunofixation in amyloidosis, etc. Electrocardiogram Shown below is an example of restrictive cardiomyopathy with low voltage
