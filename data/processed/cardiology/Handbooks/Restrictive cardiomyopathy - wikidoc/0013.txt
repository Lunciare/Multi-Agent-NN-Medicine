Restrictive cardiomyopathy

structures, perfusion, ventricular function, as well as tissue characterization.[29][30] • Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) depending on the pattern of scar formation can help the doctor in establishing the diagnosis to specific subtypes of restrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM). • MRI can also quantify the myocardial iron load in patients with haemochromatosis or thalassemia who receive transfusions. Other Imaging Findings • Radionuclide imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography (PET), is also used for the diagnostic work-up of amyloidosis.[31][32][33][34] • An increased myocardial uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate or Tc-99m 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid helps to identify patients with familial transthyretin-related amyloidosis(ATTR) and also it can differentiate them from those with light chain amyloid(AL). • Radionuclide imaging with 18fluorodeoxyglucose- (FDG-) PET is recently being used to assist in the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. • Decrease in myocardial perfusion with enhanced 18FDG uptake is consistent with inflammation, while decreased perfusion with reduced 18FDG uptake is associated with scarring. Other Diagnostic Studies Treatment Medical Therapy • Restrictive cardiomyopathy has no definitive treatment. But However, the ones directed at individual causes have been proven to be effective.[14][4][35][36] • The main purpose of treatment in restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the elevated filling
