Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Beta blockers, Amiodarone, Cardioselective [[calcium channel blockers], Diuretics, Anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation, Melphalan (for antiplasma cell therapy in systemic amyloidosis), Chemotherapy (in amyloidosis). Other approaches like Pacemaker implantation and endomyocardectomy are also available. Historical Perspective • In 1957 for the first time Brigden coined the term ‘cardiomyopathy’ to describe group of uncommon, non-coronary myocardial diseases.[1][2][3] • But later in 1961 Goodwin redefined cardiomyopathies as “myocardial diseases of unknown cause”. Infact he is the one who put them into 3 seperate entities “dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive”, which we are still using today. • In 1980 World Health Organization (WHO) and International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC) combinedly published a classification which included the three subgroups proposed by Goodwin. Classification • There is no established system for the classification of restrictive cardiomyopathy[4] [5][6][7][8] • It may be classified into: • Primary • EMF(endomyocardial fibrosis) • Loffler’s endocarditis • Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy • Secondary • Infiltrative diseases(e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and radiation carditis) • Storage diseases (e.g., hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disorders, and Fabry’s disease) Pathophysiology Pathogenesis • The exact pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is not completely understood[4]. • Mainly characterized by impaired ventricular filling and reduced diastolic volume of one or
