Restrictive cardiomyopathy

and Fabry’s disease) Pathophysiology Pathogenesis • The exact pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is not completely understood[4]. • Mainly characterized by impaired ventricular filling and reduced diastolic volume of one or both ventricles, with either normal or near-normal systolic function. • Hemodynamic abnormalities constitute the main pathological aspect of restrictive cardiomyopathy. • The primary abnormality of restrictive cardiomyopathy is impaired myocardial relaxation along with interstitial fibrosis as well as calcifications. • Restrictive filling can been seen which is due to higher diastolic pressure. Cardiac Amyloidosis • It is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM). OK 1/8 • Mainly due to deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space and misfolding into β-pleated sheets which are antiparallel to each other making them resistant to proteolysis, and also cause oxidative stress as a result leading to myocardial damage. Sarcoidosis • Characterised by noncaseating granulomas formation in various tissues including heart. • The usual location is basal septum, AV node, bundle of His, the ventricular free walls, and papillary muscles. • Formation of granuloma includes 3 histological stages: edema, granulomatous infiltration, and fibrosis. Hemochromatosis • Due to excessive accumulation of iron within the cells of various organs liver, pancreas, heart, and several endocrine
