It may be classified into primary i.e EMF(endomyocardial fibrosis),Loffler’s endocarditis, Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy and secondary i.e, infiltrative diseases(e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and radiation carditis) and storage diseases (e.g., hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disorders, and Fabry’s disease). Cardiac amyloidosis is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Mainly due to deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space and misfolding into β-pleated sheets which are antiparallel to each other making them resistant to proteolysis, and also cause oxidative stress as a result leading to myocardial damage. Sarcoidosis characterized by noncaseating granulomas formation in various tissues including heart and hemochromatosis due to excessive accumulation of iron within the cells of various organs liver, pancreas, heart, and several endocrine glands leading to cirrhosis, diabetes, heart failure, skin pigmentation is also the common causes. Cardiac genes for desmin, α-actin, troponin I and troponin T are involved in the pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy should be differentiated from dilated cardiomyopathy,
