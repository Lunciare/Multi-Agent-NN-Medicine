levels in hemocromatosis, immunoglobulin free light κ, λ chain testing, and serum and urine immunofixation in amyloidosis, etc. Electrocardiogram Shown below is an example of restrictive cardiomyopathy with low voltage and flipped anterior T waves. X-ray A chest X-ray may show atrial dilatation most of the times. Echocardiography and Ultrasound Echocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Findings on an echocardiography suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy include: • Normal or increased wall thickness • Transmitral spectral Doppler often shows restrictive filling pattern. • Marked left or biatrial dilatation usually as a consequence of chronically elevated filling pressures. • Ejection fraction (EF) is normal or near normal. • The main purpose of echo is the differential diagnosis between constrictive pericarditis(CP) and resrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM). • Both present as heart failure with normal-sized ventricles and preserved EF, dilated atria, and doppler findings of increased filling pressure often seen in restrictive cardiomyopathy. CT scan MRI • Magnetic Resonance imaging and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is very helpful in providing information about anatomic structures, perfusion, ventricular function, as well as tissue characterization.[29][30] • Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) depending on the pattern of scar formation can help the doctor in establishing the diagnosis to
