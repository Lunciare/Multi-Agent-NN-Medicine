Aneurysm overview
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)
Overview
An aneurysm (or aneurism) is a localized, blood-filled dilation (bulge) of a blood vessel caused
by disease or weakening of the vessel wall.[1] Aneurysms most commonly occur in arteries at the
base of the brain (the circle of Willis) and in the aorta (the main artery coming out of the heart), a
so-called aortic aneurysm. The bulge in a blood vessel can burst and lead to death at any time. The
larger an aneurysm becomes, the more likely it is to burst. Aneurysms can usually be treated.
Historical Perspective
Surgical clipping for the treatment of aneurysm was introduced by Walter Dandy of the Johns
Hopkins Hospital in 1937.
Classification
Aneurysms may involve arteries or veins and have various causes. They are commonly further
classified by shape, structure and location.
Pathophysiology
Most frequent site of occurrence is in the anterior cerebral artery from the circle of Willis. The
occurrence and expansion of an aneurysm in a given segment of the arterial tree involves local
hemodynamic factors and factors intrinsic to the arterial segment itself.
Treatment
Primary Prevention
Control of high blood pressure may help prevent some aneurysms. Following a healthy diet, getting
regular exercise, and keeping your cholesterol at a healthy level may also help prevent aneurysms
or their complications. Do not smoke. If you do, quitting will lower your risk of an aneurysm.
