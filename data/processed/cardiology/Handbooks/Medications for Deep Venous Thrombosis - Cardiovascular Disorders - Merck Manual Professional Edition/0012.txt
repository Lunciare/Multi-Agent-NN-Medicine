≥ 2 units of blood in ≤ 7 days) In a critical location (eg, intracranial, intraocular) In a location where hemostasis is difficult to achieve (eg, small bowel, posterior nasal cavity, lung) Risk factors for severe bleeding include Age ≥ 65 years History of prior gastrointestinal bleeding or stroke Recent myocardial infarction Coexisting anemia (hematocrit < 30%), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL [115 micromol/L]), or diabetes 7/11 Supportive care for severe bleeding includes local measures to stop bleeding (eg, direct pressure, cauterization, injection). Patients with signs and symptoms of volume loss and those with heavy ongoing bleeding may require intravenous fluid resuscitation and packed red blood cell transfusions. These measures are sufficient for many bleeding episodes. In patients with life-threatening and/or ongoing bleeding or bleeding in a critical location, clinicians also consider giving Reversal agents Clotting factors (eg, prothrombin complex concentrate, fresh frozen plasma) Antifibrinolytics However, by definition these agents are prothrombotic and the risks of continued bleeding should be balanced with the increased risk of thrombosis. Anticoagulant reversal Many of the anticoagulants have specific reversal agents. If these are unavailable or ineffective, clotting factors, typically in the form of 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate or sometimes fresh frozen
