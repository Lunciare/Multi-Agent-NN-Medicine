Almost all patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are given anticoagulants and in rare cases thrombolytics. A number of anticoagulants are effective for management of deep venous thrombosis (see also Deep Venous Thrombosis). Non-pharmacologic treatments include surgery and inferior vena cava filters. Anticoagulants The anticoagulants (see figure Anticoagulants and Their Sites of Action and table Oral Anticoagulants) include Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) Unfractionated heparin (UFH) Factor Xa inhibitors: oral (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and parenteral (fondaparinux) Direct thrombin inhibitors: oral (dabigatran etexilate) and parenteral (argatroban, bivalirudin, desirudin) Warfarin Oral factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors are sometimes referred to as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). However, there are also parenteral agents that inhibit both factor Xa and thrombin (unfractionated heparin), that inhibit mainly factor Xa (LMWH), or that inhibit only factor Xa (fondaparinux). These agents can be used both for patients with DVT and those with pulmonary embolism (PE).
