lowered to 10 mg once a day after 6– 12 months of treatment. Factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor Initial treatment with low molecular weight heparin is needed for 5 days. Dabigatran should Dabigatran 150 mg twice a day not be used for DVT if creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/minute 2 (0.5mL/s/m ). DVT = deep venous thrombosis; PE = pulmonary embolism. 3/11 Anticoagulation strategies for DVT There are several strategies for anticoagulation of patients with DVT: Initial treatment with an injectable heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) followed after several days by long-term treatment with an oral drug (warfarin, a factor Xa inhibitor, or a direct thrombin inhibitor) Initial and long-term treatment with a LMWH Initial and long-term treatment with certain oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban or apixaban) Dosing regimens for treatment of DVT differ from those used for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Some, but not all, of the direct oral anticoagulants are alternatives to warfarin as 1st-line treatment for DVT and PE and may also be used as monotherapy (see table Oral Anticoagulants). Compared to warfarin, these medications have been shown to give similar protection against recurrent DVT and have similar (or with apixaban, perhaps
