be used as monotherapy (see table Oral Anticoagulants). Compared to warfarin, these medications have been shown to give similar protection against recurrent DVT and have similar (or with apixaban, perhaps lower) risk of serious bleeding (1). Their advantages are that they are effective within several hours and thus do not require a period of overlapping treatment with heparin (bridging treatment), although edoxaban and dabigatran require at least 5 days of pretreatment with an injectable anticoagulant. Also, they are given as a fixed dose and thus, unlike warfarin, do not require ongoing laboratory testing. The main disadvantage is the higher cost compared to warfarin and the high cost of DOAC reversal agents in the case of bleeding or need for an urgent surgery or procedure. Duration of treatment varies. Patients with transient risk factors for DVT (eg, immobilization, surgery) can usually stop taking anticoagulants after 3 to 6 months. Patients with idiopathic (or unprovoked) DVT with no known risk factors, or recurrent DVT should take anticoagulants for at least 6 months and, in selected patients, probably for life unless they are at high risk for bleeding complications. Patients with cancer-associated thrombosis should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation. Treatment is
