be more effective at reversing bleeding than 3-factor PCC. If 3- factor PCC is used, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can also be given because FFP contains factor VII, which is not contained in 3-factor PCC. Typical dose is 50 units/kg IV. Because evidence of benefit is uncertain and risk of clotting is significant, PCCs should be reserved for life-threatening bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma contains all the clotting factors but only at normal plasma levels. It is now typically used only if PCC is unavailable; there is no evidence it is effective in bleeding due to factor Xa inhibitors Individual clotting factors such as activated recombinant factor VII are available but are not thought to be helpful for anticoagulant-related bleeding. Antifibrinolytics and other agents Antifibrinolytic agents can also be tried; however, their use has not been studied for reversal of bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants. Tranexamic acid 10 to 20 mg/kg IV bolus followed by 10 mg/kg IV every 6 to 8 hours may be used. Aminocaproic acid may be started at 2 gm IV every 6 hours. Resumption of anticoagulation after bleeding Clinical judgment is necessary when deciding whether to permanently stop or lower the dose of anticoagulant. 9/11 If
