5 days). Complications of UFH are similar to those of LMWHs, except that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is rare and may be life-threatening, is more common with UFHs. Long-term use of UFH causes hyperkalemia, liver enzyme elevations, and osteopenia. Rarely, UFH given subcutaneously causes skin necrosis. Inpatients and possibly outpatients being given UFH should be screened for bleeding. Factor Xa inhibitors Rivaroxaban and apixaban can be started as monotherapy immediately upon diagnosis or used in transition from an injectable heparin at any time without overlap. Dosing of rivaroxaban is 15 mg orally twice a day for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg orally once a day for a total of 3 to 6 months. Apixaban dosing is 10 mg orally twice a day for 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice a day for 3 to 6 months. For patients at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism who require long-term anticoagulation, low- intensity dosing (apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily) following 6 months of standard dosing is associated with a lower risk of major bleeding events and is non-inferior in preventing recurrent thrombosis (4, 5). 5/11 Before edoxaban is started, an initial 5 to
