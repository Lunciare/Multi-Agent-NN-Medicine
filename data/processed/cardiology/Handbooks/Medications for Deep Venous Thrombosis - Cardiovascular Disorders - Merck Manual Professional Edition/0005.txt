and, in selected patients, probably for life unless they are at high risk for bleeding complications. Patients with cancer-associated thrombosis should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation. Treatment is usually longer in patients receiving ongoing cancer therapy and in patients with advanced, metastatic disease. Patients with selected hypercoagulable states (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome or protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency) should also be considered for extended-duration anticoagulation. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) A low molecular weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin) is one of the initial treatments of choice because LMWHs can be given on an outpatient basis. LMWHs are as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH) for reducing DVT recurrence, thrombus extension, and risk of death due to PE (2). Like UFH, LMWHs catalyze the action of antithrombin (which inhibits coagulation factor proteases), leading to inactivation of coagulation factor Xa and, to a lesser degree, factor IIa. LMWHs also have some antithrombin–mediated anti-inflammatory properties, which facilitate clot organization and resolution of symptoms and inflammation. 4/11 LMWHs are typically given subcutaneously in a standard weight-based dose (eg, enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously once a day or 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours or dalteparin 200 units/kg subcutaneously once a day).
