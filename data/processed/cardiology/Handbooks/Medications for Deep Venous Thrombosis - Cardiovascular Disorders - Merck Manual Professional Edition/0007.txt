Medications for Deep Venous Thrombosis

a 2nd-line alternative due to its low cost, but use requires careful monitoring. Complications of LMWHs include bleeding, thrombocytopenia, urticaria, and, rarely, thrombosis and anaphylaxis. Inpatients and possibly outpatients should be screened for bleeding with serial complete blood counts and, where appropriate, testing for occult blood in stool. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) Unfractionated heparin may be used instead of LMWH for patients who are hospitalized and for patients who have renal insufficiency or failure (creatinine clearance 10 to 30 mL/minute, (0.17 to 2 0.5mL/s/m ) because UFH is not cleared by the kidneys. UFH is given as a bolus and infusion to achieve full anticoagulation (eg, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] 1.5 to 2.5 times that of the reference range). For outpatients, UFH 333 units/kg initial bolus, then 250 units/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours can be substituted for IV UFH to facilitate mobility; the dose does not need adjustment based on aPTT. If warfarin is used after initial anticoagulation, UFH is continued until full anticoagulation has been achieved with warfarin (about 5 days). Complications of UFH are similar to those of LMWHs, except that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is rare and may be life-threatening, is more common with UFHs. Long-term use of
