anticoagulation can theoretically be reversed with andexanet alfa although this has not been studied in research trials. If andexanet alfa is unavailable, 4- factor prothrombin complex concentrate may be considered. Oral activated charcoal is an option in patients who took an oral factor Xa inhibitor within a few hours of presentation (8 hours for rivaroxaban, 6 hours for apixaban, and 2 hours for edoxaban). Hemodialysis is not effective for removal of the oral factor Xa inhibitors. Other reversal agents for direct oral anticoagulants are currently being developed (eg, ciraparantag). Clotting factors Clotting factors are available in the form of Prothrombin complex concentrate Fresh frozen plasma Individual clotting factors Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is available in several forms. Three-factor PCC contains high levels of factors II, IX, and X, and 4-factor PCC adds factor VII; both also have proteins C and S. PCCs can be unactivated, or activated, in which some of the factors have been cleaved to the active form. The 4- factor PCC is preferred as it tends to be more effective at reversing bleeding than 3-factor PCC. If 3- factor PCC is used, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can also be given because FFP contains factor VII, which is
