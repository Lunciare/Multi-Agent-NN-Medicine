standard dosing is associated with a lower risk of major bleeding events and is non-inferior in preventing recurrent thrombosis (4, 5). 5/11 Before edoxaban is started, an initial 5 to 7 days of treatment with LMWH or UFH is required. Then edoxaban is given 60 mg orally once a day. To transition from an injectable anticoagulant, the factor Xa inhibitor is typically started within 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of a twice-daily LMWH regimen and within 12 to 24 hours after a once-daily LMWH regimen. There is evidence that apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban can be used in select patients with cancer- associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) as an alternative to monotherapy with LMWH (6, 7, 8). Fondaparinux, a parenteral selective factor Xa inhibitor, may be used as an alternative to UFH or LMWH for the initial treatment of DVT or PE. It is given in a fixed dose of 7.5 mg subcutaneously once a day (10 mg for patients > 100 kg, 5 mg for patients < 50 kg). It has the advantage of fixed dosing and is less likely to cause thrombocytopenia. Direct thrombin inhibitors Dabigatran 150 mg orally twice a day is given only after an
