Medications for Deep Venous Thrombosis

is not available, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate 50 units/kg IV can be given. Hemodialysis also may help because dabigatran is not highly protein bound. Oral activated charcoal is an option if the last dose of dabigatran was within 2 hours. 8/11 With factor Xa inhibitors, andexanet alfa is an antidote available in the United States; however, its use is restricted in part due to its high cost (1). If the patient is on a high dose of a factor Xa inhibitor (eg, rivaroxaban > 10 mg or apixaban > 5 mg), or if the patient took the medication < 8 hours before presentation, a high dose of andexanet alfa (800 mg IV at 30 mg/minute followed by 960 mg IV at 8 mg/minute) is given. If the patient is on a low dose of a factor Xa inhibitor or took the medication > 8 hours before presentation, a lower dose of andexanet alfa (400 mg IV at 30 mg/minute followed by 480 mg IV at 8 mg/minute) is given. Fondaparinux anticoagulation can theoretically be reversed with andexanet alfa although this has not been studied in research trials. If andexanet alfa is unavailable, 4- factor prothrombin complex concentrate may be considered.
