be considered only in highly selected patients with DVT. Patients who may benefit from thrombolytic agents include those with extensive iliofemoral DVT who are younger (< 60 years) and do not have risk factors for bleeding. Thrombolytic therapy should be given stronger consideration in patients with extensive DVT who have evolving or existing limb ischemia (eg, phlegmasia cerulea dolens). For patients with PE, thrombolytic therapy should be considered if patients have clinically massive PE, defined as PE associated with systemic hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, or respiratory failure. Most other patients, with submassive PE, do not appear to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. However, in selected patients with submassive PE, thrombolytic therapy may be considered if there is clinical deterioration despite conventional anticoagulant therapy. In patients with submassive PE and right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy should not be routinely used. For either DVT or PE, available evidence comparing local (ie, catheter-directed) with systemic administration of thrombolytic therapy has not shown a clear benefit of either modality with respect to mortality. Bleeding, if it occurs, is most often at the site of arterial or venous puncture sites. This complication can be treated by stopping the thrombolytic agent
