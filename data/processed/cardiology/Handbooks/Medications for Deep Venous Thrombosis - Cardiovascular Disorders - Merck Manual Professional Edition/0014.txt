typically not given to patients who have received UFH > 60 to 120 minutes beforehand) or is given at a reduced dose based on the amount of heparin estimated to be remaining in plasma, based on the half-life of UFH. Warfarin anticoagulation can be reversed with vitamin K; the dose is 1 to 2.5 mg orally if INR is 5 to 9, 2.5 to 5 mg orally if INR is > 9, and 5 to 10 mg IV (given slowly to avoid anaphylaxis) if there is active hemorrhage. If hemorrhage is severe, prothrombin complex concentrate should be given; fresh frozen plasma may be used if prothrombin complex concentrate is unavailable. Selected patients with overanticoagulation (INR 5 to 9) who are neither actively bleeding nor at increased risk of bleeding can be managed by omitting 1 or 2 warfarin doses and monitoring INR more frequently, then giving warfarin at a lower dose. With dabigatran, a humanized monoclonal antibody idarucizumab 5 g IV is an effective antidote to bleeding. If the agent is not available, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate 50 units/kg IV can be given. Hemodialysis also may help because dabigatran is not highly protein bound. Oral activated charcoal is an option
