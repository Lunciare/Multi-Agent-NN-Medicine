Medications for Deep Venous Thrombosis

subcutaneously in a standard weight-based dose (eg, enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously once a day or 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours or dalteparin 200 units/kg subcutaneously once a day). Patients with renal insufficiency may be treated with UFH or with reduced doses of LMWH. Monitoring is not reliable because LMWHs do not significantly prolong the results of global tests of coagulation. Furthermore, they have a predictable dose response, and there is no clear relationship between the anticoagulant effect of LMWH and bleeding. If warfarin is used after initial anticoagulation, treatment with LMWH is continued until full anticoagulation is achieved with warfarin (typically about 5 days). Transition to the oral agents rivaroxaban or apixaban can be done at any time with no overlap. Transition to edoxaban or dabigatran requires at least 5 days of LMWH treatment, but no overlap is needed. LMWHs and direct oral anticoagulants are first-line treatment options for patients with cancer- associated DVT (3), including in patients who have a central venous catheter and develop DVT. Warfarin is a 2nd-line alternative due to its low cost, but use requires careful monitoring. Complications of LMWHs include bleeding, thrombocytopenia, urticaria, and, rarely, thrombosis and anaphylaxis. Inpatients and possibly outpatients should
