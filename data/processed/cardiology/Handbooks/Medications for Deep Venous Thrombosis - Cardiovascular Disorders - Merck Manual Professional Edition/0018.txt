Resumption of anticoagulation after bleeding Clinical judgment is necessary when deciding whether to permanently stop or lower the dose of anticoagulant. 9/11 If a patient has almost completed their treatment course of anticoagulant and has a severe bleeding episode, the anticoagulant can be stopped. However, if a patient has just started or is mid-way through their treatment course and has a severe bleed, the decision of whether to stop or reduce the dose of anticoagulant is not as straightforward and should be made in consultation with a multidisciplinary team and keeping in mind the patient's priorities. Thrombolytic (Fibrinolytic) Agents Thrombolytic agents, which include alteplase, tenecteplase, and streptokinase, lyse clots and may be more effective than heparin alone in selected patients with DVT, but the risk of bleeding is higher than with heparin alone. For patients with DVT, a clinical trial showed that catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy did not reduce the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome compared with conventional anticoagulant therapy (1). Consequently, thrombolytic agents should be considered only in highly selected patients with DVT. Patients who may benefit from thrombolytic agents include those with extensive iliofemoral DVT who are younger (< 60 years) and do
