disorder typically require lower warfarin doses. Therapeutic goal is an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. INR is monitored weekly for the first 1 to 2 months of warfarin treatment and monthly thereafter; the dose is increased or decreased by 0.5 to 3 mg to maintain the INR within this range. Patients taking warfarin should be informed of possible drug interactions, including interactions with foods and nonprescription medicinal herbs. Rarely, warfarin causes skin necrosis in patients with inherited protein C deficiency or protein S deficiency. Bleeding During Use of Anticoagulants Bleeding is the most common complication of anticoagulants and ranges on a continuum from minor to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage. For minor bleeding (eg, epistaxis), local measures to stop bleeding (eg, direct pressure) are often sufficient. The anticoagulant is usually not discontinued or reversed unless bleeding becomes more severe. For severe bleeding (eg, heavy gastrointestinal bleeding), the anticoagulant is usually withheld (at least temporarily) and other measures taken. Bleeding is generally considered severe when it is: Heavy (loss of ≥ 2 units of blood in ≤ 7 days) In a critical location (eg, intracranial, intraocular) In a location where hemostasis is difficult to achieve (eg, small bowel, posterior nasal
