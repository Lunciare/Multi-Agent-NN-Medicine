Overview of Heart Failure

to develop HF symptoms in response to the stress of systemic disorders or relatively modest cardiovascular insults. Stressors include infections (particularly pneumonia), hyperthyroidism, anemia, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, hyperthermia, renal failure, perioperative IV fluid loads, nonadherence to medication regimens or to low-salt diets, and use of certain medications (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). Etiology of Heart Failure Both cardiac and systemic factors can impair cardiac performance and cause or aggravate heart failure (see table Causes of Heart Failure). TABLE Causes of Heart Failure Type Examples Cardiac Cardiomyopathy Myocardial infarction Myocardial damage Myocarditis Some chemotherapy agents Valvular disorders Aortic stenosis 10/15 Type Examples Mitral regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation Bradyarrhythmias Arrhythmias Tachyarrhythmias Atrioventricular block Conduction defects Left bundle branch block Reduced substrate availability (eg, of free Ischemia fatty acids or glucose) Amyloidosis Infiltrative or matrix disorders Chronic fibrosis (eg, systemic sclerosis) Hemochromatosis Systemic Anemia Disorders that increase demand for Hyperthyroidism cardiac output Paget disease Aortic stenosis Disorders that increase resistance to output (afterload) Hypertension LV failure characteristically develops in ischemic heart disease, hypertension, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, most forms of cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disorders (eg, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus with large shunts). RV failure is most commonly caused
