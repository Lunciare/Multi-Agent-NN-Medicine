Overview of Heart Failure

Cardiac contractility (force and velocity of contraction), ventricular performance, and myocardial oxygen requirements are determined by: Preload Afterload Substrate availability (eg, oxygen, fatty acids, glucose) Heart rate and rhythm Amount of viable myocardium Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate; it is also affected by venous return, peripheral vascular tone, and neurohumoral factors. Preload is the loading condition of the heart at the end of its relaxation and filling phase (diastole) just before contraction (systole). Preload represents the degree of end-diastolic fiber stretch and end- diastolic volume, which is influenced by ventricular diastolic volume and pressure and the composition of the myocardial wall. Typically, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, especially if higher than normal, is a reasonable measure of preload. LV dilation, hypertrophy, and changes in myocardial distensibility (compliance) modify preload. Preload is not identical to, but is largely a function of, the body's overall intravascular volume status. Afterload is the force resisting myocardial fiber contraction at the start of systole. It is determined by LV chamber pressure, radius, and wall thickness at the time the aortic valve opens. Clinically, systemic systolic blood pressure at or shortly after the aortic valve opens correlates with peak systolic
