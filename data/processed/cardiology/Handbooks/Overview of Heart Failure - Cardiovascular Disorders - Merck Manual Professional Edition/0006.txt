abnormality can be a change in cardiomyocyte function, there are also changes in collagen turnover of the extracellular matrix. Cardiac structural defects (eg, congenital defects, valvular disorders), rhythm abnormalities (including persistently high heart rate), and high metabolic demand (eg, due to thyrotoxicosis) also can cause heart failure. Classification of heart failure 4/15 Overview of Heart Failure VIDEO Heart failure can be classified as primarily left or right heart failure, or by the Universal Definition and Classification of Heart Failure (1), which uses the left ventricular ejection fraction. The traditional distinction between left and right ventricular failure is somewhat misleading because the heart is an integrated pump, and changes in one chamber ultimately affect the whole heart. However, these terms indicate the major site of pathology leading to heart failure and can be useful for initial evaluation and treatment. Other common terms used to differentiate types of and causes for heart failure include acute or chronic; high output or low output; dilated or nondilated; and ischemic, hypertensive, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment also differs based on whether the presentation is acute or chronic HF. LV failure Heart failure most commonly occurs as a result of left ventricular dysfunction (2). As a
