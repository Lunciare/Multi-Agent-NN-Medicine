mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, most forms of cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disorders (eg, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus with large shunts). RV failure is most commonly caused by previous LV failure (which increases pulmonary venous pressure and leads to pulmonary hypertension, thus overloading the RV) or by a severe lung disorder (in which case it is called cor pulmonale). Other causes are multiple pulmonary emboli, RV infarction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, mitral stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonic valve stenosis, pulmonary venous occlusive disease, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or congenital disorders such as Ebstein anomaly or Eisenmenger syndrome. Some conditions mimic RV failure, except cardiac function may be normal; they include volume overload and increased systemic venous pressure in polycythemia or overtransfusion, acute kidney injury with retention of sodium and water, obstruction of either vena cava, and hypoproteinemia due to any cause resulting in low plasma oncotic pressure and peripheral edema. Biventricular failure results from disorders that affect the whole myocardium (eg, viral myocarditis, amyloidosis, Chagas disease) or long-standing LV failure causing RV failure. 11/15 High-output HF results from a persistently high cardiac output, which may eventually result in an inability of a normal heart
