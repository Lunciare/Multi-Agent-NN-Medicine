important cause of HF. Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have HFpEF; the prevalence increases with age and in patients with diabetes (3). HFpEF is a complex, heterogenous, multiorgan, systemic syndrome, often with multiple concomitant pathophysiologies. Data suggest that multiple comorbidities (eg, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease) lead to systemic inflammation, widespread endothelial dysfunction, cardiac 6/15 microvascular dysfunction, and, ultimately, molecular changes in the heart that cause increased myocardial fibrosis and ventricular stiffening. Thus, although HFrEF is typically associated with primary myocardial injury, HFpEF may be associated with secondary myocardial injury due to abnormalities in the periphery. Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is defined as an LV ejection fraction of 41 to 49%. It is unclear whether this group is a distinct population or consists of a mixture of patients with either HFpEF or HFrEF. Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) Patients with HF whose LV ejection fraction has improved by more than an absolute of 10% from a prior value and also measures over 40% are categorized as having HFimpEF. RV failure Right ventricular failure most commonly occurs as a consequence of or in tandem with
