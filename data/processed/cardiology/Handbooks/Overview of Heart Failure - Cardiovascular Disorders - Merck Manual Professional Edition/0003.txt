Overview of Heart Failure

chamber pressure, radius, and wall thickness at the time the aortic valve opens. Clinically, systemic systolic blood pressure at or shortly after the aortic valve opens correlates with peak systolic wall stress and approximates afterload. The Frank-Starling principle describes the relationship between preload and cardiac performance. It states that, normally, systolic performance (often estimated by stroke volume) is proportional to preload within the normal physiologic range (see figure Frank-Starling Principle). In patients with heart failure, systolic performance and myocardial contractility are reduced when compared to those with a healthy heart at the same preload. Contractility is difficult to measure clinically (because it requires cardiac catheterization with pressure-volume analysis) but is reasonably reflected by the ejection fraction (EF), which is the percentage of end-diastolic volume ejected with each contraction (stroke volume/end-diastolic volume). EF can generally be adequately assessed noninvasively with echocardiography, nuclear imaging, or MRI. The force-frequency relationship refers to the phenomenon in which repetitive stimulation of a muscle within a certain frequency range results in increased force of contraction. Normal cardiac muscle at typical heart rates exhibits a positive force-frequency relationship, so a faster rate causes stronger contraction (and corresponding greater substrate requirements). During some types of heart 2/15 failure,
