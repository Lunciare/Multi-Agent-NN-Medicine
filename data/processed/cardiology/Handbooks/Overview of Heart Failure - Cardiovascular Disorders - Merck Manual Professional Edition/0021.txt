prevention (1, 2): A: High risk of HF but no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities or symptoms B: Structural or functional cardiac abnormalities but no symptoms of HF C: Structural heart disease with symptoms of HF D: Refractory HF requiring advanced therapies (eg, mechanical circulatory support, cardiac transplantation) or palliative care Clinical severity (or functional classification) varies significantly and is usually classified according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) system (see table NYHA Functional Classification of Heart Failure); the examples of ordinary activity may be modified for older, debilitated patients.
