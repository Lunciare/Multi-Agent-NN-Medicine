Overview of Heart Failure

from a prior value and also measures over 40% are categorized as having HFimpEF. RV failure Right ventricular failure most commonly occurs as a consequence of or in tandem with left ventricular failure. Isolated right heart failure is observed much less commonly. In heart failure that involves right ventricular dysfunction (see Right Heart Failure), systemic venous pressure increases, causing fluid extravasation and consequent edema, primarily in dependent tissues (feet and ankles of ambulatory patients) and abdominal viscera. The liver is most severely affected, but the stomach and intestine also become congested; fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity (ascites) can occur. RV failure commonly causes moderate hepatic dysfunction, with usually modest increases in conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), and hepatic enzymes (particularly alkaline phosphatase and gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT]). The impaired liver breaks down less aldosterone, further contributing to fluid accumulation. Chronic venous congestion in the viscera can cause anorexia, malabsorption of nutrients and medications, protein-losing enteropathy (characterized by diarrhea and marked hypoalbuminemia), chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, and rarely ischemic bowel infarction. Responses to heart failure Myocardial response When left ventricular contractility is impaired, as is the case in HRrEF, a higher preload is required to maintain cardiac output.
