cardiac muscle at typical heart rates exhibits a positive force-frequency relationship, so a faster rate causes stronger contraction (and corresponding greater substrate requirements). During some types of heart 2/15 failure, the force-frequency relationship may become negative, so that myocardial contractility decreases as heart rate increases above a certain rate. Cardiac reserve is the ability of the heart to increase its performance above resting levels in response to emotional or physical stress; body oxygen consumption may increase from 250 mL/minute to ≥ 1500 mL/minute during maximal exertion. Mechanisms include: Increasing heart rate Increasing diastolic filling volumes Increasing contractility and stroke volume Selectively altering systemic vascular resistance to direct blood flow toward certain organs (eg, skeletal muscle during exercise) Increasing tissue extraction of oxygen (the difference between oxygen content in arterial blood and in mixed venous or pulmonary artery blood) In well-trained young adults during maximal exercise, heart rate may increase from 55 to 70 beats/minute at rest to > 180 beats/minute, and cardiac output may increase from 6 L/minute to ≥ 25 L/minute. At rest, arterial blood contains approximately 18 mL oxygen/dL of blood, and mixed venous or pulmonary artery blood contains approximately 14 mL/dL. Oxygen extraction is thus approximately 4
