Overview of Heart Failure

Treatment also differs based on whether the presentation is acute or chronic HF. LV failure Heart failure most commonly occurs as a result of left ventricular dysfunction (2). As a result, the Universal Classification of Heart Failure has categorized heart failure according to reduced, preserved, minimally reduced, and improved ejection fraction based on left ventricular systolic function (1). In left heart failure, cardiac output decreases and pulmonary venous pressure increases. When pulmonary capillary pressure exceeds the oncotic pressure of plasma proteins (approximately 24 mm Hg), fluid extravasates from the capillaries into the interstitial space and alveoli, reducing pulmonary compliance and increasing the work of breathing. Lymphatic drainage increases but cannot compensate for the increase in pulmonary fluid. Marked fluid accumulation in alveoli (pulmonary edema) significantly alters ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) relationships. Deoxygenated pulmonary arterial blood passes through poorly ventilated alveoli, decreasing systemic arterial oxygenation (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2]) and causing dyspnea. However, dyspnea may occur before V/Q abnormalities, probably because of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and increased work of breathing; the precise mechanism is unclear. 5/15 In severe or chronic LV failure, pleural effusions characteristically develop, further aggravating dyspnea. Minute ventilation increases; thus, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2)
