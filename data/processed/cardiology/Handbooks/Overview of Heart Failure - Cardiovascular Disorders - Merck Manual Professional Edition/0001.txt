Overview of Heart Failure

Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the body due to a structural and or functional cardiac abnormality, leading to low cardiac output, elevated ventricular filling pressure, or both. HF can involve systolic and/or diastolic function, in the left and/or right heart. Left ventricular (LV) failure typically causes shortness of breath and fatigue, and right ventricular (RV) failure typically causes peripheral and abdominal fluid accumulation; the ventricles can be involved together or separately. Diagnosis is initially clinical, supported by chest radiography, echocardiography, hemodynamic evaluation, and laboratory testing. Treatment includes patient education, treating the cause(s) of the HF syndrome, pharmacologic therapy including neurohormonal modulation, implantable pacemakers/defibrillators, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation. Heart failure affects more than 64 million people worldwide (1). In the United States, there are approximately 6.7 million people with heart failure and approximately 1 million new cases per year; 8.7 million people are projected to have heart failure by 2030 (2, 3). Cardiovascular Physiology Cardiac contractility (force and velocity of contraction), ventricular performance, and myocardial oxygen requirements are determined by: Preload Afterload Substrate availability (eg, oxygen, fatty acids, glucose) Heart rate and rhythm Amount
