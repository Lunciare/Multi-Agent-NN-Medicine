Chagas disease) or long-standing LV failure causing RV failure. 11/15 High-output HF results from a persistently high cardiac output, which may eventually result in an inability of a normal heart to maintain adequate output. Conditions that may increase cardiac output include severe anemia, end-stage liver disease, beriberi, thyrotoxicosis, advanced Paget disease, arteriovenous fistula, and persistent tachycardia. Cardiomyopathy is a general term indicating disease of the myocardium. Most commonly, the term refers to a primary disorder of the ventricular myocardium that is not caused by congenital anatomic defects; valvular, systemic, or pulmonary vascular disorders; isolated pericardial, nodal, or conduction system disorders; or epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). The term is sometimes used to reflect etiology (eg, ischemic vs hypertensive cardiomyopathy). Cardiomyopathy does not always lead to symptomatic HF. It is often idiopathic and is classified as dilated, congestive, hypertrophic, infiltrative- restrictive, or apical-ballooning cardiomyopathy (also known as takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy). Staging of Heart Failure International consensus defines the staging system for heart failure (HF) to highlight the need for HF prevention (1, 2): A: High risk of HF but no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities or symptoms B: Structural or functional cardiac abnormalities but no symptoms of HF C: Structural
