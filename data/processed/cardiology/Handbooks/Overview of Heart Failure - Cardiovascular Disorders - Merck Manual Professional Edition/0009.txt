Overview of Heart Failure

is impaired, resulting in: Increased LV end-diastolic pressure at rest or during exertion Usually, normal LV end-diastolic volume Global contractility and hence LV ejection fraction remain normal (≥ 50%). However, in some patients, marked restriction to LV filling can cause inappropriately low LV end- diastolic volume and thus cause low cardiac output and systemic symptoms. Elevated left atrial pressures can cause pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary congestion. Diastolic dysfunction usually results from impaired ventricular relaxation (an active process), increased ventricular stiffness, valvular disease, or constrictive pericarditis. Acute myocardial ischemia is also a cause of diastolic dysfunction. Resistance to filling increases with age, reflecting cardiomyocyte dysfunction and cardiomyocyte loss, and increased interstitial collagen deposition; thus, diastolic dysfunction is particularly common among older adults. Diastolic dysfunction predominates in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, other disorders with ventricular hypertrophy (eg, hypertension, significant aortic stenosis), and amyloid infiltration of the myocardium. LV filling and function may also be impaired if marked increases in RV pressure shift the interventricular septum to the left. Diastolic dysfunction is recognized as an important cause of HF. Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have HFpEF; the prevalence increases with age and in patients with diabetes (3). HFpEF is a complex, heterogenous, multiorgan,
