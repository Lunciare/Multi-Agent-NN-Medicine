Overview of Heart Failure

the precise mechanism is unclear. 5/15 In severe or chronic LV failure, pleural effusions characteristically develop, further aggravating dyspnea. Minute ventilation increases; thus, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) decreases and blood pH increases (respiratory alkalosis). Marked interstitial edema of the small airways may interfere with ventilation, elevating PaCO2—a sign of impending respiratory failure. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) In HFrEF (also called systolic heart failure), global LV systolic dysfunction predominates. The LV contracts poorly and empties inadequately, leading to: Increased diastolic volume and pressure Decreased ejection fraction (≤ 40%) Many defects in energy utilization, energy supply, electrophysiologic function, and contractile element interaction occur, with abnormalities in intracellular calcium modulation and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production. Predominant systolic dysfunction is common in heart failure due to myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction may affect primarily the LV or the right ventricle (RV); LV failure often leads to RV failure. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) In HFpEF (also called diastolic heart failure), LV filling is impaired, resulting in: Increased LV end-diastolic pressure at rest or during exertion Usually, normal LV end-diastolic volume Global contractility and hence LV ejection fraction remain normal (≥ 50%). However,
