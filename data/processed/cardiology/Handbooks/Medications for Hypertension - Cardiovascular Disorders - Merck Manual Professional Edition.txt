Medications for Hypertension
By Matthew R. Weir, MD, University of Maryland School of Medicine
Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary
Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025 | Modified Dec 2025
The treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle modifications (eg, dietary modification, weight loss,
exercise), alone or in combination with medications. The decision to treat with medication is based on
the blood pressure (BP) level, the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or its risk
factors, and other considerations.
A number of medication classes are effective for initial and subsequent management of hypertension
(1):
Diuretics
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
Calcium channel blockers
Direct renin inhibitors
Beta-blockers
Alpha adrenergic modifiers
Direct vasodilators
Selection and use of medications in the treatment of stable hypertension is discussed elsewhere. For
treatment of hypertensive emergencies, see table Parenteral Medications for Hypertensive
Emergencies.
(See also Hypertension and Hypertensive Emergencies.)

Main classes of diuretics used for hypertension (see table Oral Diuretics for Hypertension) are
Thiazide diuretics
Potassium-sparing diuretics
Loop diuretics
Diuretics modestly reduce plasma volume and reduce vascular resistance, possibly via shifts in sodium
from intracellular to extracellular loci.
Thiazide-type diuretics (thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics) are most commonly used.
Chlorthalidone and indapamide, thiazide-like diuretics, are preferred over hydrochlorothiazide because
of their higher potency (1) and longer duration of action. However, one retrospective analysis from The
Diuretic Comparison Project (2), and another pragmatic trial conducted in Veterans (3) demonstrated
that chlorthalidone, despite its greater potency, did not have an advantage over hydrochlorothiazide in
reducing cardiovascular or kidney disease progression events. Although thiazide diuretics had been
thought to be ineffective in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, chlorthalidone has been shown
to be effective in improving blood pressure in patients with glomerular filtration rates < 30 mL/minute
(4). In addition to other antihypertensive effects, thiazide diuretics cause a small amount of vasodilation
when intravascular volume is normal. In a few patients, thiazide-type diuretics can increase serum
cholesterol slightly (mostly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and also increase triglyceride levels,
although these effects may not persist > 1 year (5). The increase is apparent within 4 weeks of treatment
and can be ameliorated by a low-fat diet. The possibility of a slight increase in lipid levels does not
contraindicate diuretic use in patients with dyslipidemia.
Potassium-sparing diuretics are not as effective as thiazide-type diuretics in controlling hypertension
and thus are not used for initial treatment. They do not cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, or
hyperglycemia, and thus may be helpful for patients who develop these adverse effects of thiazide
diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements are not needed when an angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker is used because these medications
increase serum potassium.
Loop diuretics are used to treat hypertension only in patients who have an estimated glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/minute; these diuretics are given at least twice a day (except for torsemide
which can be given once a day).
All diuretics except the potassium-sparing distal tubular diuretics (eg, spironolactone) cause significant
potassium loss, so serum potassium is measured monthly until the level stabilizes. Unless serum
potassium is normalized, potassium channels in the arterial walls close and the resulting
vasoconstriction makes achieving the blood pressure (BP) goal difficult. Patients with potassium levels <
3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) are given potassium supplements. Supplements may be continued long-term
at a lower dose, or a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) may be
added. Addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic or potassium supplements is also recommended for
patients who are also taking digoxin, have a known heart disorder, have an abnormal ECG, have ectopy
or arrhythmias, or develop ectopy or arrhythmias while taking a diuretic.

In most patients with diabetes, thiazide-type diuretics do not affect control of diabetes. Uncommonly,
diuretics precipitate or worsen type 2 diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome.
A hereditary predisposition probably explains the few cases of gout due to diuretic-induced
hyperuricemia. Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia without gout does not require treatment or
discontinuation of the diuretic.
Diuretics may slightly increase mortality in patients with a history of heart failure who do not have
pulmonary congestion, particularly in those who are also taking an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II
receptor blocker and who do not drink at least 1400 mL (48 oz) of fluid daily. The increased mortality is
probably related to diuretic-induced hyponatremia and hypotension.

ACE Inhibitors for Hypertension
ACE inhibitors (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension)
reduce blood pressure by interfering with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and by
inhibiting the degradation of bradykinin, thereby decreasing peripheral vascular resistance without
causing reflex tachycardia. These medications reduce BP in many patients with hypertension, regardless
of plasma renin activity. Because these medications provide renal protection, they (along with
angiotensin II receptor blockers) are the medications of choice for patients with diabetes. They are not
recommended for initial treatment in patients with African ancestry, in whom they appear to increase
the risk of stroke when used for initial treatment (1).
A dry, irritating cough is the most common adverse effect, with estimates of occurrence in up to 20% in
North American and Europe populations and up to 40% in Asian populations (2, 3). Angioedema is the
most serious adverse effect and, if it affects the oropharynx, can be fatal. Angioedema is most common
among patients with African ancestry and those who smoke.
ACE inhibitors may increase serum potassium and creatinine levels, especially in patients with chronic
kidney disease and those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy.
In patients with a renal disorder, serum creatinine and potassium levels are monitored at least every 3
months. Patients who have stage 3 nephropathy (estimated GFR of < 60 mL/minute to > 30 mL/minute)
and are given ACE inhibitors can usually tolerate an increase in serum creatinine up to 30 to 35% above
baseline. ACE inhibitors can cause acute kidney injury in patients who have hypovolemia, severe heart
failure, severe bilateral renal artery stenosis, or severe stenosis in the artery to a solitary kidney.
Thiazide-type diuretics enhance the antihypertensive activity of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II
receptor blockers more than that of other classes of antihypertensives (4, 5). Spironolactone and
eplerenone also appear to enhance the effect of ACE inhibitors.

Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension
Angiotensin II receptor blockers (see table Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for
Hypertension) block angiotensin II receptors and therefore interfere with the renin-angiotensin system.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors are equally effective as antihypertensives.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide added benefits via tissue ACE blockade. The 2 classes have
the same beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular failure or with nephropathy due to type 1
diabetes. An angiotensin II receptor blocker should not be used together with an ACE inhibitor, but
when used with a beta-blocker may reduce the hospitalization rate for patients with heart failure.
Angiotensin II receptor blockers may be safely used in anyone with an estimated GFR > 30 mL/minute to
reduce cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression.
Incidence of adverse events is low; angioedema occurs but much less frequently than with ACE
inhibitors. Precautions for use of angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with renovascular
hypertension, hypovolemia, and severe heart failure are the same as those for ACE inhibitors (see table
Oral ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers for Hypertension). Angiotensin II receptor
blockers are contraindicated during pregnancy.
Calcium Channel Blockers for Hypertension
Dihydropyridines (see table Oral Calcium Channel Blockers for Hypertension) are potent peripheral
vasodilators and reduce blood pressure by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR); they
sometimes cause reflexive tachycardia.
The nondihydropyridines verapamil and diltiazem slow the heart rate, decrease atrioventricular
conduction, and decrease myocardial contractility. These medications should not be prescribed for
patients with second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block or with left ventricular failure.

Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, is used in the management of hypertension.
As with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren causes elevation of serum
potassium and creatinine. Aliskiren should not be combined with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II
receptor blockers in patients with diabetes or renal disease (estimated GFR < 60 mL/minute). It is also
contraindicated during pregnancy.
Beta-Blockers for Hypertension
Beta-blockers are not first-line agents for treatment of hypertension. However, they may be useful in
patients with hypertension who have other disorders that may benefit from a beta-blocker, such as
angina, previous myocardial infarction, or heart failure. Otherwise, beta-blockers are less protective
against stroke and overall mortality than some other antihypertensives (1, 2).
Beta-blockers (see table Oral Beta-Blockers for Hypertension) slow the heart rate and reduce myocardial
contractility, thus reducing blood pressure. All beta-blockers are similar in antihypertensive efficacy.
Cardioselective beta blockers (eg, acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol) are often
preferred over nonselective agents because of potentially less bronchoconstriction and peripheral
vasodilation, which is particularly relevant for patients with diabetes (increasing risk of hypoglycemia),
chronic peripheral artery disease (impairing function), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
by potentiating bronchospasm). However, cardioselectivity is only relative and decreases as dose
increases. Even cardioselective beta-blockers should be used with caution in patients with COPD with a
prominent bronchospastic component.

§ Can also be given for hypertensive emergencies.
Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (eg, acebutolol, pindolol) do not adversely affect
serum lipids; they are less likely to cause severe bradycardia.
Beta-blockers have central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects (sleep disturbances, fatigue, lethargy)
and exacerbate depression. Nadolol affects the CNS the least and may be best when CNS effects must
be avoided. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree atrioventricular
block or sinus node dysfunction. Beta-blockers should generally be avoided in patients with asthma
because, in addition to bronchospasm, they can also cause resistance to the effects of inhaled or oral
beta receptor agonists (3).

central action, they are more likely than other antihypertensives to cause drowsiness, lethargy, and
depression; they are not widely used. Clonidine can be applied transdermally once a week as a patch;
thus, it may be useful for patients who have difficulty adhering to treatment (eg, those with dementia).
Rebound hypertension can occur with abrupt discontinuation of oral clonidine.
Postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers (eg, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin) are not used for primary treatment of
hypertension because of their adverse effects and no reduction in mortality. Doxazosin used alone or
with antihypertensives other than diuretics increases the risk of heart failure. Other adverse effects
include first-dose syncope, orthostatic hypotension, weakness, palpitations, and headache. However,
postsynaptic alpha-1-blockers may be used in patients who have prostatic hypertrophy and need a
fourth antihypertensive or in people with high sympathetic tone (ie, with high heart rate and spiking
blood pressures) already on the maximum dose of a beta-blocker.
Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension
Direct vasodilators, including minoxidil and hydralazine (see table Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension),
work directly on blood vessels, independently of the autonomic nervous system. Minoxidil is more
potent than hydralazine but has more adverse effects, including sodium and water retention and
hypertrichosis, which may be poorly tolerated. Minoxidil should be reserved for severe, refractory
hypertension.
Hydralazine may be used during pregnancy (eg, for preeclampsia) and as an adjunct antihypertensive.
Hydralazine (particularly at doses > 200 mg/day) has been associated with drug-induced lupus, which
resolves when the medication is stopped (1). It is also associated with drug-induced antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (2).
