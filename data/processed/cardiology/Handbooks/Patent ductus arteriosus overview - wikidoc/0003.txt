Patent ductus arteriosus overview

shunting, in turn, depends on the size of the ductus and the difference in resistance between the left and right side of heart. PDA can cause complications such as heart failure, infective endocarditis, rhythm disturbance, pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome. Diagnosis Laboratory Findings Polycythemia may be present if the child has any other congenital heart disease. Hypoxemia or hypercarbia may be present. Chest X Ray The findings on chest x ray depends on the degree of shunting between left and right system. MRI Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. CT Computed tomography can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Echocardiography Echocardiogram is the non-invasive method and can diagnose patent ductus arteriosus. Echo along with doppler can be used to visualize the shunt from the aorta to the left pulmonary artery. Other Imaging Findings Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization serves to establish the presence of a PDA by assessment of the increase of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. It also serves to identify the anatomy of the PDA, the severity of a left-to-right shunt, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment Medical
