Patent ductus arteriosus overview

PDA is a congenital heart defect when a child's ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, producing a heart murmur described in 1898 by Gibson as the classic machinery murmur. Pathophysiology The pathophysiological consequences depend on the size of the defect and the pulmonary vascular resistance. Causes Causes of patent ductus arteriosus is not known. However, increased incidence have been associated with mother's rubella and genetic causes Epidemiology and Demographics The PDA is commonly found in infants and constitutes only 2% of all congenital defects found in adults. The incidence is greater is in children who are born prematurely with history of perinatal asphyxia and infants with congenital rubella. Risk Factors Like many congenital heart disease, the cause of patent ductus arteriosus is not clear. Clinical studies suggest that the genetic and environmental factors both play an important role during the pregnancy. Natural History, Complications and Prognosis The natural history of unoperated patients of patent ductus arteriosus depends on the amount of left to right shunting. The left to right shunting, in turn, depends on the size of the ductus and the difference in resistance between the left and right side of heart. PDA can cause complications such as heart
