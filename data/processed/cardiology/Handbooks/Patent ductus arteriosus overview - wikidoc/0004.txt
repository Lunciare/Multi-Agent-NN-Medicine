of oxygen in the pulmonary artery. It also serves to identify the anatomy of the PDA, the severity of a left-to-right shunt, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Treatment Medical Therapy Preterm Infants Prostaglandin E2 plays a key role in maintaining the patency of ductus arteriosus before birth. Thus, prostaglandin E2 inhibitors are used as a therapeutic options to close the patent ductus arteriosus. Term and Older Children In term infants and older patients, the prostaglandin E2 inhibitors (indomethacin and ibuprofen) have not shown to be effective. This is so because the ductus in premature baby is different histological from in older patients. As a result, pharmacologic therapy is only used routinely in preterm infants. Surgery Infants without overt symptoms may simply be monitored as outpatients, while symptomatic PDA can be treated with both surgical and non-surgical methods. Surgically, the ductus arteriosus may be closed by ligation, wherein the DA is manually tied shut, or with intravascular coils or plugs that lead to the formation of a thrombus in the duct. Surgical ligation of the PDA can be accomplished with excellent results in uncomplicated patients. Recent experience with transcatheter closure has also been favorable, being today the procedure of choice
