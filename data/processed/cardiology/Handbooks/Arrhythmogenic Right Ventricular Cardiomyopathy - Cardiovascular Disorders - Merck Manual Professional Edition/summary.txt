Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), also called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is a genetic cardiac disorder affecting mainly the right ventricle and causing ventricular tachyarrhythmias and increased risk of sudden death. Symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and cardiac arrest, and with worsening disease, manifestations of right ventricular failure. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and consensus criteria. Treatment requires limitation of physical exertion and usually a beta- blocker and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). A number of genetic mutations adversely affect the structure and function of the intercalated disk, the structure that connects cardiac myocytes. Most commonly, the mutations affect the component of the disk known as the desmosome (the adhesive intercellular junction that tethers intermediate filaments to cell membranes).
