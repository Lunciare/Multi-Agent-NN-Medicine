failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Treatment of ARVC focuses on prevention of sudden death and prevention of symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients should avoid endurance athletics because such activities foster both disease progression and occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias. These risks are higher in males and in patients with more advanced disease (as evidenced by more task force criteria) (1). The 5-year risk of a first episode of life-threatening arrhythmia ranges from approximately 2% to 50%, depending on age, sex, cardiac syncope within 1 year of diagnosis, non-sustained VT, ventricular premature beat frequency, the extent of T-wave inversion, and the RV ejection fraction. An online risk calculator for patients who have not yet had a life-threatening arrhythmia is available ( Prevention of sudden death is by an ICD (see also table Indications for an ICD). An ICD is recommended for patients with ARVC and the following (1): Resuscitated cardiac arrest Prior sustained VT with hemodynamic instability Severe right ventricular (or left ventricular) systolic dysfunction Possibly prior sustained VT without hemodynamic instability (class IIa indication]) Possibly syncope suspected to be due to ventricular arrhythmia (class IIa indication) Possibly various combinations of major and minor risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia (class IIa and
