responsible for approximately 10% of sudden deaths in young adults (1). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are particularly likely to occur during emotional or physical stress. Patients may have palpitations or syncope, Atrial fibrillation and signs of right and/or left ventricular systolic failure are usually manifestations of advanced disease. Diagnosis of ARVC ECG Sometimes signal-averaged ECG Cardiac imaging (eg, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, right ventricular angiography) Sometimes right ventricular biopsy Genetic testing Screening of first-degree family members Diagnosis of ARVC is difficult in the absence of advanced right ventricular systolic dysfunction, leading to historic under-recognition of the disorder. ARVC should be suspected in patients, particularly young patients, with palpitations, cardiac syncope, documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias, or resuscitation from unexplained cardiac arrest in the absence of clinically evident structural heart disease. The diagnosis of ARVC is often first suspected when it is recognized that the patient's ventricular arrhythmias are of right ventricular origin, typically indicated by a left bundle branch block–shaped QRS complex with a superior frontal plane axis (the latter helping to differentiate ARVC from the more benign idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia, which usually has an inferior frontal plane QRS axis). 2/5 The initial evaluation of patients with suspected arrhythmogenic
