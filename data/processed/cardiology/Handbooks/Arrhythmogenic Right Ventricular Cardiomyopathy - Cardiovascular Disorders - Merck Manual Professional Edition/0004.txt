Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy

ARVC from the more benign idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia, which usually has an inferior frontal plane QRS axis). 2/5 The initial evaluation of patients with suspected arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy includes history, family history, ECG, 2-dimensional echocardiography, and cardiac MRI. If no spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia has been demonstrated, exercise testing, ambulatory ECG monitoring, and/or electrophysiologic testing may be required. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, other testing may include signal averaged ECG, electrophysiologic testing, and right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (1). Right ventricular angiography is not routine but, if done, may reveal characteristic structural abnormalities and also allow biopsy of the right ventricle; however, biopsy findings are often nonspecific and biopsy is rarely done. Because no single test is diagnostic, major and minor diagnostic criteria have been proposed by an international task force (2). The criteria include Evidence of right ventricular disease on imaging studies Right ventricular biopsy showing replacement of myocytes by fibrous tissue, fatty tissue, or both ECG repolarization changes including right precordial T-wave inversion ECG depolarization changes including right precordial epsilon waves Signal-averaged ECG showing late potentials Documented ventricular arrhythmias originating from the right ventricle Family history of ARVC or sudden death Identification of a gene mutation
