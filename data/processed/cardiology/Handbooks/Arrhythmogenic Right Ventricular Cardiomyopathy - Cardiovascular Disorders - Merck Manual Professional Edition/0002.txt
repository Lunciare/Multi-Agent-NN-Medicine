Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy

replacement of myocytes by fibrofatty tissue, predominantly in the triangle between the right ventricular outflow tract, the right ventricular inflow tract, and the right ventricular apex, but sometimes also involving the posterolateral left ventricle, predominantly or exclusively. Disease manifestations are the result of both electrophysiologic and structural changes, initially manifesting as ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachyarrhythmias but eventually causing right ventricular structural abnormalities (eg, dilation and thinning), resulting in congestive right ventricular cardiomyopathy. A left ventricular cardiomyopathy may also occur with biventricular or predominantly left ventricular disease. Most commonly, the mutations are inherited with an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance; however, autosomal recessive mutations are known. The incidence of ARVC has regional variation from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 (1). It is thought that sustained, heavy exertion (eg, from endurance athletics) hastens onset and progression of disease. Symptoms and signs of ARVC Patients may be asymptomatic, but those who are symptomatic usually present first with ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), or sudden death. ARVC is responsible for approximately 10% of sudden deaths in young adults (1). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are particularly likely to occur during emotional or physical stress. Patients may have palpitations or syncope, Atrial
