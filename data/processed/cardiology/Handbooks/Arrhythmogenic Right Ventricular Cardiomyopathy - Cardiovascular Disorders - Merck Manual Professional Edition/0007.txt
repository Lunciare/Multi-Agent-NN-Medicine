(class IIa indication]) Possibly syncope suspected to be due to ventricular arrhythmia (class IIa indication) Possibly various combinations of major and minor risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia (class IIa and class IIb indications) Significant right or left ventricular dysfunction will require medical therapy. A beta-blocker should be used in most patients. Antiarrhythmic therapy with flecainide or with a class III medication, particularly sotalol or amiodarone, may reduce symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias but is not a substitute for an ICD. However, these medications may benefit patients who have frequent, appropriate ICD discharges despite adequate beta-blocker therapy. Transcatheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate may also be useful in such patients (1). Key Points Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder in which myocytes are replaced by fibrofatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias and later right ventricular failure. The disorder progresses quicker in patients who engage in endurance exercise. Diagnosis is based on consensus criteria involving clinical and electrocardiographic factors, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. First-degree family members have a significant risk of disease and require initial screening and regular testing. Treatment requires moderation of physical activity, beta-blockade, and often an ICD.
