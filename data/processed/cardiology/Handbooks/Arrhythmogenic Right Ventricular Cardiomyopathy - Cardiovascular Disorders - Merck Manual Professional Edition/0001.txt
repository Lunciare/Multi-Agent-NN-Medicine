Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), also called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is a genetic cardiac disorder affecting mainly the right ventricle and causing ventricular tachyarrhythmias and increased risk of sudden death. Symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and cardiac arrest, and with worsening disease, manifestations of right ventricular failure. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and consensus criteria. Treatment requires limitation of physical exertion and usually a beta- blocker and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). A number of genetic mutations adversely affect the structure and function of the intercalated disk, the structure that connects cardiac myocytes. Most commonly, the mutations affect the component of the disk known as the desmosome (the adhesive intercellular junction that tethers intermediate filaments to cell membranes). Desmosomes help connect cells in tissues that undergo mechanical stress, such as cardiac myocytes. The desmosomal proteins that may be affected include plakophilin, desmoplakin, and desmoglein. When abnormal, these proteins are prone to damage by mechanical stress (eg, from increased cardiac workload as from prolonged exertion). Healing of the damage leads to replacement of myocytes by fibrofatty tissue, predominantly in the triangle between the right ventricular outflow tract, the right ventricular inflow tract, and the right ventricular apex, but sometimes also involving
