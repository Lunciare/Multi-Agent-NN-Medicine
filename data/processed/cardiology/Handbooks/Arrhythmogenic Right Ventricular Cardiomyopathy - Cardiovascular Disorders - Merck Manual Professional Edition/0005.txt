Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy

including right precordial epsilon waves Signal-averaged ECG showing late potentials Documented ventricular arrhythmias originating from the right ventricle Family history of ARVC or sudden death Identification of a gene mutation associated with ARVC The key entities to consider in the differential diagnosis are cardiac sarcoidosis, athlete's heart, myocarditis, and idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract VT. Genetic testing is usually done in patients suspected of having ARVC. The yield of testing is about 50% when task force criteria are met (3). First-degree family members of patients have a significant risk of disease. Starting at age 10 to 12 years and every 1 to 3 years thereafter, they should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia), ECG, ambulatory ECG monitoring, and echocardiography. Genetic testing is done if the index case has a mutation identified. Family members without the index mutation are then freed of follow-up investigations. Treatment of ARVC Moderation of physical activity Often an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Usually a beta-blocker Sometimes antiarrhythmic medications (particularly sotalol or amiodarone) Heart failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Treatment of ARVC focuses on prevention of sudden death and prevention of symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Patients should avoid endurance athletics because such activities foster
