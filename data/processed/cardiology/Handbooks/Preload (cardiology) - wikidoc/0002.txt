Preload (cardiology)
KEYWORDS: increased, ventricular, volume, filling, blood, decreased, preload, pressure, atrial, stenosis, venous, aortic, regurgitation, valve, ventricular filling

defects such as aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (pulmonary valve stenosis and regurgitation have similar effects on right ventricular preload). Factors & conditions decreased preload 1.Decreased venous blood pressure, most commonly resulting from reduced blood volume (e.g., hemorrhage) or gravity causing blood to pool in the lower limbs when standing upright. 2.Impaired atrial contraction that can result from atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. 3.Increased heart rate (e.g., atrial tachycardia), which reduces ventricular filling time. 4.Decreased ventricular afterload, which enhances forward flow (i.e., ejection) thereby reducing end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume secondarily. 5.Ventricular diastolic failure (decreased ventricular compliance) caused, for example, by ventricular hypertrophy or impaired relaxation (lusitropy). 6.Inflow (mitral and tricuspid) valve stenosis, which reduces ventricular filling.
