Preload (cardiology)
KEYWORDS: increased, ventricular, volume, filling, blood, decreased, preload, pressure, atrial, stenosis, venous, aortic, regurgitation, valve, ventricular filling

Synonyms and keywords: filling pressure Preload increases with exercise (slightly), increasing blood volume (overtransfusion) and excitement (sympathetics). Factors & conditions increased ventricular filling and therefore preload 1.Increased central venous pressure (CVP) that can result from decreased venous compliance (e.g., caused by sympathetic venoconstriction) or increased thoracic blood volume. The latter can be increased by either increased total blood volume or by venous return augmented by increased respiratory activity, increased skeletal muscle pump activity, or gravity (e.g., head- down tilt). 2.Increased ventricular compliance, which results in a greater expansion of the chamber during filling at a given filling pressure. 3.Increased atrial force of contraction resulting from sympathetic stimulation of the atria or from increased filling of the atria and therefore increased atrial contractile force through the Frank- Starling mechanism. 4.Reduced heart rate, which increases ventricular filling time.
