Lymphedema is edema of a limb due to lymphatic hypoplasia (primary) or to obstruction or disruption (secondary) of lymphatic vessels. Symptoms and signs, when chronic, are brawny, fibrous, nonpitting edema in one or more limbs. Diagnosis is by physical examination. Treatment consists of exercise, pressure gradient dressings, massage, and sometimes surgery. Cure is unusual, but treatment may lessen symptoms, slow progression, and prevent complications. Patients are at risk of cellulitis, lymphangitis, and, rarely, lymphangiosarcoma. (See also Overview of the Lymphatic System.) Etiology of Lymphedema Lymphedema may be Primary: Due to lymphatic hypoplasia Secondary: Due to obstruction or disruption of lymphatic vessels Primary lymphedemas Primary lymphedemas are inherited and account for a small proportion of cases of lymphedema. They vary in phenotype and patient age at presentation but mostly involve the lower extremities (1). Congenital lymphedema appears before age 2 years and is due to lymphatic aplasia or hypoplasia. Milroy disease is an autosomal dominant familial form of congenital lymphedema attributed to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) gene mutations and sometimes associated with cholestatic jaundice and edema or diarrhea due to a protein-losing enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia (2). Lymphedema praecox appears between ages 2 and 35 years, typically in
