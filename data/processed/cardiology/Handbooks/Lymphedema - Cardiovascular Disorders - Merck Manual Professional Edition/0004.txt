Lymphedema

be significant, especially when lymphedema results from medical or surgical treatment. Skin changes are common and include hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, verrucae, papillomas, and fungal infections. Rarely, an affected limb becomes extremely large, and the hyperkeratosis is severe, giving the appearance of elephant skin (elephantiasis). This manifestation is more common with filariasis than with other causes of lymphedema. Complications Lymphangitis may develop, most often when bacteria enter through skin cracks between the toes as a result of fungal infections or through cuts to the hand. Lymphangitis is usually streptococcal, causing erysipelas; sometimes it is staphylococcal. The affected limb becomes erythematous (possibly only dark on patients with dark skin) and feels hot; erythematous streaks may extend proximally from the point of entry, and lymphadenopathy may develop. Infrequently, the skin breaks down, which may lead to local infection or cellulitis. Rarely, long-standing lymphedema leads to lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome), usually in patients who have had a mastectomy (1) and in patients with filariasis (2). Clinical diagnosis CT or MRI if cause is not apparent Primary lymphedema is usually obvious based on characteristic soft-tissue edema throughout the body and other information from the history and physical examination. Diagnosis of secondary lymphedema is usually obvious from physical
