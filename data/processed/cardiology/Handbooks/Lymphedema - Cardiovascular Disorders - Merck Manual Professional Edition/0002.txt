Lymphedema

sometimes associated with cholestatic jaundice and edema or diarrhea due to a protein-losing enteropathy caused by intestinal lymphangiectasia (2). Lymphedema praecox appears between ages 2 and 35 years, typically in females at the onset of menses or pregnancy. Meige disease is an autosomal dominant familial form of lymphedema praecox attributed to mutations in a transcription factor gene (FOXC2) that causes extra eyelashes (distichiasis), cleft palate, and edema of legs, arms, and sometimes the face (3). Lymphedema tarda occurs after age 35 years. Familial and sporadic forms exist; the genetic basis of both is unknown. Clinical findings are similar to those of lymphedema praecox but may be less severe. Lymphedema is prominent in some other genetic syndromes, including Turner syndrome Yellow nail syndrome, characterized by pleural effusions and yellow nails Hennekam syndrome, a rare congenital syndrome of intestinal and other lymphangiectases, facial anomalies, and intellectual disability Secondary lymphedema Secondary lymphedema accounts for > 95% of cases. Most common causes are Surgery (especially lymph node dissection, typically for treatment of breast cancer) Radiation therapy (especially axillary or inguinal) Trauma Lymphatic obstruction by a tumor Lymphatic filariasis (present in some tropical and subtropical areas) Mild lymphedema may also result from leakage of lymph
