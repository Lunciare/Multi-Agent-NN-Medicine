Stress cardiomyopathy overview

and chest pain.[2][10][13][14][3][17] Physical Examination Physical examination findings in patients with stress cardiomyopathy are non-specific and non- diagnostic. The diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is largely based on ECG, echocardiographic findings, as well as cardiac catheterization.[18] Laboratory Findings Elevated levels of catecholamines, cardiac enzymes and BNP may be seen in patients with stress cardiomyopathy. However, none of these laboratory findings are specific to stress cardiomyopathy.[2][10][14][17] ECG ECG findings in stress cardiomyopathy are similar to those seen in anterior MI. The most common findings include ST elevation in the precordial leads, T wave inversion and the formation of a Q wave.[19][2] Findings on ECG include:[2][10][13][16][14][3][17] Chest X-Ray Typical findings on chest x-ray include apical ballooning and narrowing of the neck. CT Scan A CT scan may be done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to asses coronary anatomy, as well as detect the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.[17] MRI Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a useful imaging modality in distinguishing between stress cardiomyopathy and myocarditis or MI. The most common findings on CMR in patients with stress cardiomyopathy include absence of gadolinium hyper-enhancement, as well as myocardial edema.[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][5][28] Echocardiography Echocardiography is done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to document apical ballooning, dyskinesia/akinesia
