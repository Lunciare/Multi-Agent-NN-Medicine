It is not very well understood, but the disease is thought to arise following intense emotional or physical stress. Stress cardiomyopathy mostly affects post-menopausal women. The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies largely mimic that of anterior MI. However, the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy. It is generally a self- limiting disease and the majority of patients have a restored cardiac function within a matter of weeks. Complications and death are relatively rare, but they are mostly related to the development of heart failure and pulmonary edema.

However, cases of death upon going through severe emotional or psychological stress have been described as early as the biblical times.[1][2] Classification Stress cardiomyopathy can be divided into several types, depending on the location of regional wall motion abnormality. The area of motion abnormality (whether hypokinesia, dyskinesia or akinesia) can be detected on echocardiography or left ventriculography. The most common
