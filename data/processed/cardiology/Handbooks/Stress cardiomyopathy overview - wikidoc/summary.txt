Overview Stress cardiomyopathy is a relatively new disease, with the first case documented in literature under the name of Takotsobu Cardiomyopathy in Japan in 1991. It is not very well understood, but the disease is thought to arise following intense emotional or physical stress. Stress cardiomyopathy mostly affects post-menopausal women. The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies largely mimic that of anterior MI. However, the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy. It is generally a self- limiting disease and the majority of patients have a restored cardiac function within a matter of weeks.
