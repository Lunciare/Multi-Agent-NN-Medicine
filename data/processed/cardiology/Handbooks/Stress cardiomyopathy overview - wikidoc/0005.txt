CMR in patients with stress cardiomyopathy include absence of gadolinium hyper-enhancement, as well as myocardial edema.[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][5][28] Echocardiography Echocardiography is done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to document apical ballooning, dyskinesia/akinesia and reduced ejection fraction.[10][13][16][17] Other Imaging Findings In patients with stress cardiomyopathy, coronary angiography usually shows normal anatomy of the coronary arteries no evidence of coronary artery stenosis.[2][14][17] Other Diagnostic Studies Coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization are the diagnostic modalities of choice to distinguish between stress cardiomyopathy and acute anterior MI. Normal anatomy of the coronary arteries, along with a reduced ejection fraction supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy.[10][16][14] Medical Therapy Medical therapy in stress cardiomyopathy is indicated to treat the complications that may arise. The most common complications related to stress cardiomyopathy include heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics and anti-heart failure medications are the treatment of choice in these conditions.[1][10] Surgery Treatment of stress cardiomyopathy is mostly supportive and medications are used to treat complications.[1][10] There is no role for surgery in the treatment of stress cardiomyopathy. Primary Prevention There are no means of prevention of stress cardiomyopathy. Secondary Prevention Stress cardiomyopathy is a self-limiting disease, which usually resolves within a few weeks. However, medical therapy may be
