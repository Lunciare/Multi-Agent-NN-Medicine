depending on the location of regional wall motion abnormality. The area of motion abnormality (whether hypokinesia, dyskinesia or akinesia) can be detected on echocardiography or left ventriculography. The most common type is the apical type, resulting in apical ballooning.[3][4][5][6] Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy is not completely understood. However, the most accepted theory behind it is thought to be due to catecholamine surge, which are thought to contribute to myocardial necrosis and stunning seen in stress cardiomyopathy.[2][7][8] On biopsy, findings include an inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis and formation of contraction bands, which may or may not be associated with myocardial necrosis.[9][10] Stress cardiomyopathy is associated with various neurological and psychological conditions. Causes The cause of stress cardiomyopathy is largely unknown. However, it is usually triggered by emotional and/or physical stress and may be related to certain medical conditions. Differentiating Stress Cardiomyopathy from Other Diseases The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies of stress cardiomyopathy resembles that of anterior MI and must be differentiated from it. Also, stress cardiomyopathy must be differentiated from other medical conditions, such as pheochromocytoma, dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[11][12] Epidemiology and Demographics The true incidence and prevalence of stress cardiomyopathy is unknown. However, this disease
