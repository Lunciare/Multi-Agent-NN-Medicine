Overview Echocardiography • Echocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape. There are several types of echo, including stress echo. • Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease. Another type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE. • TEE provides a view of the back of the heart.
