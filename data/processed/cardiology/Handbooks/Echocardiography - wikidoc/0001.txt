Echocardiography

Overview Echocardiography • Echocardiography (echo) is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. The picture shows how well your heart is working and its size and shape. There are several types of echo, including stress echo. • Stress echo can show whether you have decreased blood flow to your heart, a sign of coronary heart disease. Another type of echo is transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo, or TEE. • TEE provides a view of the back of the heart. For this test, a sound wave wand is put on the end of a special tube. The tube is gently passed down your throat and into your esophagus (the passage leading from your mouth to your stomach). Because this passage is right behind the heart, General Principles of Echocardiography • Basic physical principles of ultrasound • Quantification of pressure gradients • Echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular dyssynchrony • Echocardiography terminology • Guidelines for echocardiography Principal Echocardiographic Modalities • Transthoracic echo (TTE): standard views and measurements • Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): standard views • M-mode echo: principles and classic findings • Doppler echocardiography • Tissue Doppler imaging • Contrast echocardiography • Stress echocardiography • Three-dimensional echocardiography • Myocardial contrast
