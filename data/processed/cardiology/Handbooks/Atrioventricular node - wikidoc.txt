The blood supply of the AV node is from a branch of the right coronary artery in 85% to 90% of
individuals (a branch off of the posterolateral artery, the AV nodal artery, and from a branch of the
left circumflex artery in 10% to 15% of individuals. When the RCA supplies the AV node, the
coronary system is said to be "right dominant," and when the AV node is supplied by the LCX, the
system is "left dominant."
