Overview
The atrioventricular node is an area of specialized tissue between the atria and the ventricles of
the heart, which conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles.
Function
The AV node receives two inputs from the atria: posteriorly via the crista terminalis, and anteriorly
via the interatrial septum.[1]
An important property that is unique to the AV node is decremental conduction, in which the more
frequently the node is stimulated, the slower it conducts. This is the property of the AV node that
prevents rapid conduction to the ventricle in cases of rapid atrial rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation
or atrial flutter.
The atrioventricular node delays impulses for ~0.1 second before allowing impulses through to the
His-Purkinje conduction system, which spreads impulses to the ventricular walls. The reason it is
important to delay the cardiac impulse is to ensure that the atria have ejected their blood into the
ventricles before the ventricles contract.[2]

The blood supply of the AV node is from a branch of the right coronary artery in 85% to 90% of
individuals (a branch off of the posterolateral artery, the AV nodal artery, and from a branch of the
left circumflex artery in 10% to 15% of individuals. When the RCA supplies the AV node, the
coronary system is said to be "right dominant," and when the AV node is supplied by the LCX, the
system is "left dominant."
