coronary angiography include Asymptomatic high-risk patients 7/13 Patients with atypical or typical angina who have inconclusive exercise stress test results, cannot undergo exercise stress testing, or need to undergo major noncardiac surgery Patients in whom invasive coronary angiography was unable to locate a major coronary artery or graft Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is invaluable in evaluating many cardiac and great vessel abnormalities. It may be used to evaluate CAD by several techniques, which enable direct visualization of coronary stenosis, assessment of flow in the coronary arteries, evaluation of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, evaluation of wall motion abnormalities during stress, and assessment of infarcted myocardium vs viable myocardium. Indications for cardiac MRI include evaluation of cardiac structure and function and assessment of myocardial viability. Cardiac MRI, specifically stress perfusion MRI and quantitative myocardial blood flow analysis, may also be indicated for diagnosis and risk assessment in patients with either known or suspected CAD. Treatment of Angina Pectoris Modification of risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, lipids) Antiplatelet agents (aspirin and sometimes clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) Beta-blockers Nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers for symptom control Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins Revascularization if symptoms persist despite medical therapy 8/13 Reversible risk factors
