and extent of myocardium at risk. Stress echocardiography can also detect ischemia- induced mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography Coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease but is not always necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It is indicated primarily to locate and assess severity of coronary artery lesions when revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is being considered. Angiography may also be indicated when knowledge of coronary anatomy is necessary to advise about work or lifestyle needs (eg, discontinuing job or sports activities). Although angiographic findings do not directly show hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions, obstruction is assumed to be physiologically significant when the luminal diameter is reduced > 70%. Angina does not usually develop when the diameter reduction is < 70% unless spasm or thrombosis is present. Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) provides images of coronary artery structure. An ultrasound probe on the tip of a catheter is inserted in the coronary arteries during angiography. This test can provide more information about coronary anatomy than other tests; it is indicated when the nature of 6/13 lesions is unclear or when apparent disease severity does not match symptom severity. Used with PCI, it can help
