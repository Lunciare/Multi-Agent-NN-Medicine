Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction. It is typically precipitated by exertion or psychologic stress and relieved by rest or sublingual nitroglycerin. Diagnosis is by symptoms, electrocardiography, and myocardial imaging. Treatment may include antiplatelet medications, nitrates, beta- blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. (See also Overview of Coronary Artery Disease.) Etiology of Angina Pectoris Angina pectoris occurs when Cardiac workload and resultant myocardial oxygen demand exceed the ability of coronary arteries to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood Such imbalance between supply and demand can occur when the arteries are narrowed. Narrowing usually results from Coronary artery atherosclerosis Narrowing of the coronary arteries can also result from Coronary artery spasm Coronary artery embolism (rare) Acute coronary thrombosis can cause angina if obstruction is partial or transient, but it usually causes acute myocardial infarction (MI).
