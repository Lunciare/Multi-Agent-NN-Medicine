rapidly Walking uphill Climbing stairs rapidly Walking or climbing 2 stairs after meals Cold Wind Emotional stress 3/13 Activities Triggering Class Chest Pain Walking, even 1 or 2 blocks at usual pace and on level ground 3 Climbing stairs, even 1 flight Any physical activity 4 Sometimes occurring at rest Attacks may vary from several a day to symptom-free intervals of weeks, months, or years. Attacks may increase in frequency (called crescendo angina), leading to an MI or death. Conversely, attacks may gradually decrease or disappear if adequate collateral coronary circulation develops, the ischemic area infarcts, or heart failure or intermittent claudication supervenes and limits activity. Nocturnal angina may occur if a dream causes striking changes in respiration, pulse rate, and BP. Nocturnal angina may also be a sign of recurrent LV failure, an equivalent of nocturnal dyspnea. The recumbent position increases venous return, stretching the myocardium and increasing wall stress, which increases oxygen demand. Angina decubitus is angina that occurs spontaneously when a person is lying down but not necessarily at night. It is usually accompanied by a modestly increased heart rate and a sometimes markedly higher BP, which increase oxygen demand. These increases may be the cause of
