Electron beam CT is particularly useful in ruling out significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department with atypical symptoms, normal troponin levels, and a low probability of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. These patients may have noninvasive testing as outpatients. Multidetector row CT (MDRCT) coronary angiography can accurately identify coronary stenosis and has a number of advantages. The test is noninvasive, can exclude coronary stenosis with high accuracy, can establish stent or bypass graft patency, can show cardiac and coronary venous anatomy, and can assess calcified and noncalcified plaque burden. Estimation of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) across significant lesions and estimation of lesion-specific ischemia are also possible (5). However, radiation exposure is significant, and MDRCT must be used judiciously in patients with a heart rate of > 65 beats/minute, those with irregular heart beats, those with impaired kidney function, and pregnant females. Patients must also be able to hold their breath for 15 to 20 seconds, 3 to 4 times during the study. Other indications for MDRCT coronary angiography include Asymptomatic high-risk patients 7/13 Patients with atypical or typical angina who have inconclusive exercise stress test results, cannot undergo exercise stress testing, or need to undergo major
