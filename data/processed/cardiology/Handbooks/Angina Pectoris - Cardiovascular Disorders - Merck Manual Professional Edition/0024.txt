Angina Pectoris - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition

moderate angina (CCS class 1 or 2) or 3-vessel disease and good ventricular function, CABG appears to only marginally improve survival. Several studies show better long-term outcomes following CABG than with PCI for patients with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending disease (8). For patients with 1- vessel disease, outcomes with pharmacologic therapy, PCI, and CABG are similar; exceptions are left 11/13 main disease and proximal left anterior descending disease, for which revascularization appears advantageous. Prognosis for Angina Pectoris The main adverse outcomes of angina pectoris are unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death due to arrhythmias. Annual mortality rate is approximately 1.4% in patients with angina, no history of MI, a normal resting ECG, and normal BP (1). However, females with CAD tend to have a worse prognosis. Mortality rate is higher when systolic hypertension is present, than when the ECG is abnormal, and is even higher when both are present. Type 2 diabetes also increases the mortality rate for each scenario. Prognosis worsens with increasing age, increasingly severe anginal symptoms, presence of anatomic lesions, and poor ventricular function (2). Lesions in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery indicate particularly high risk. Although prognosis
