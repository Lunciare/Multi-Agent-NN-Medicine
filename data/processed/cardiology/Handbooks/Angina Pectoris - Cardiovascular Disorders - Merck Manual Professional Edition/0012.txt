than other tests; it is indicated when the nature of 6/13 lesions is unclear or when apparent disease severity does not match symptom severity. Used with PCI, it can help ensure optimal placement of stents. Guidewires with pressure or flow sensors can be used to estimate blood flow across stenoses. Blood flow is expressed as fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is the ratio of maximal flow through the stenotic area to normal maximal flow. These flow measurements are most useful when evaluating the need for angioplasty or CABG in patients with lesions of questionable severity (40 to 70% stenosis). An FFR of 1.0 is considered normal, while an FFR < 0.75 to 0.8 is associated with myocardial ischemia. Lesions with an FFR > 0.8 are less likely to benefit from stent placement. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is another imaging modality that can be used during coronary angiography that uses near-infrared light to provide high-resolution cross-sectional images of the coronary arteries, which are higher in resolution than with IVUS (2, 3). OCT has been used to help optimize placement and sizing of stents during PCI. However, its role in routine clinical care for patients with CAD who are undergoing angiography has
