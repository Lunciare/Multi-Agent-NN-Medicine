Angina Pectoris - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition

tension, and contractility, narrowing of a coronary artery typically results in angina that occurs during exertion and is relieved by rest. 1/13 In addition to exertion, cardiac workload can be increased by disorders such as hypertension, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In such cases, angina can result whether atherosclerosis is present or not. These disorders can also decrease relative myocardial perfusion because myocardial mass is increased (causing decreased diastolic flow). A decreased oxygen supply, as in severe anemia or hypoxia, can precipitate or aggravate angina. Pathophysiology of Angina Pectoris Angina may be Stable Unstable In stable angina, the relationship between workload or demand and ischemia is usually relatively predictable. Unstable angina is clinically worsening angina (eg, angina at rest or with increasing frequency and/or intensity of episodes). Atherosclerotic arterial narrowing is not entirely fixed; it varies with the normal fluctuations in arterial tone that occur in all people. Thus, more people have angina in the morning, when arterial tone is relatively high. Also, abnormal endothelial function may contribute to variations in arterial tone; eg, in endothelium damaged by atheromas, stress of a catecholamine surge causes vasoconstriction rather than dilation (normal response). As the myocardium becomes ischemic, coronary sinus
