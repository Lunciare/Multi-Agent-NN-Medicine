OCT has been used to help optimize placement and sizing of stents during PCI. However, its role in routine clinical care for patients with CAD who are undergoing angiography has not been fully established. Imaging the coronary arteries Noninvasive imaging studies done at rest can evaluate the coronary arteries. Electron beam CT can detect the amount of calcium present in coronary artery plaque. The calcium score is roughly proportional to the risk of subsequent coronary events. However, because calcium may be present in the absence of significant stenosis, the score does not correlate well with the need for PCI or CABG. Thus, the American Heart Association recommends that screening with electron beam CT should be done only for select groups of patients and is most valuable when combined with historical and clinical data to estimate risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (4). These groups may include asymptomatic patients with an intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimate (10 to 20%) and symptomatic patients with equivocal stress test results. Electron beam CT is particularly useful in ruling out significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department with atypical symptoms, normal troponin levels, and a low probability of hemodynamically
