anginal symptoms, presence of anatomic lesions, and poor ventricular function (2). Lesions in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery indicate particularly high risk. Although prognosis correlates with number and severity of coronary arteries affected, prognosis is surprisingly good for patients with stable angina, even those with 3-vessel disease, if ventricular function is normal. 12/13 Key Points Angina pectoris occurs when cardiac workload exceeds the ability of coronary arteries to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood. Symptoms of stable angina pectoris range from a vague, barely troublesome ache to a severe, intense precordial crushing sensation; they are typically precipitated by exertion, last no more than a few minutes, and subside with rest. Do stress testing with ECG for patients with normal resting ECG or with myocardial imaging (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, PET, MRI) for patients with abnormal resting ECG. Do coronary angiography when revascularization (percutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) is being considered. Give nitroglycerin for immediate relief of angina. Maintain patients on an antiplatelet agent, a beta-blocker, and a statin, and add a calcium channel blocker for further symptom prevention if needed. Consider revascularization if significant angina persists despite pharmacologic therapy or if
