upper abdomen. The discomfort of angina is never above the ears or below the umbilicus. Atypical angina, with bloating, gas, abdominal distress, or burning or tenderness in the back, shoulders, arms or jaw, may occur in some patients and is more common among females. These patients often ascribe symptoms to indigestion; belching may even relieve the symptoms. Other patients have dyspnea due to the sharp, reversible increase in LV filling pressure that often 2/13 accompanies ischemia. Frequently, the patient’s description is imprecise, and whether the problem is angina, dyspnea, or both may be difficult to determine. Because ischemic symptoms require a minute or more to resolve, brief, fleeting sensations rarely represent angina. Between and even during attacks of angina, physical findings may be normal. However, during the attack, heart rate may increase modestly, blood pressure (BP) is often elevated, heart sounds become more distant, and the apical impulse is more diffuse. The second heart sound (S2) may become paradoxical because LV ejection is more prolonged during an ischemic attack. A fourth heart sound (S4) is common, and a third heart sound (S3) may develop. A mid or late systolic apical murmur, shrill or blowing—but not especially loud—may occur if ischemia
