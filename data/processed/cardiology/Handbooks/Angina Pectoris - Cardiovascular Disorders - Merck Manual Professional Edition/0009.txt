likely to show reversible ischemic changes: T wave discordant to the QRS vector ST-segment depression (typically) ST-segment elevation Decreased R-wave height Intraventricular or bundle branch conduction disturbances Arrhythmia (usually ventricular extrasystoles) Between angina attacks, the ECG (and usually LV function) at rest is normal in about 30% of patients with a typical history of angina pectoris, even those with extensive 3-vessel disease. In the remaining 5/13 70%, the ECG shows evidence of previous infarction, hypertrophy, or nonspecific ST-segment and T- wave (ST-T) abnormalities. An abnormal resting ECG alone does not establish or refute the diagnosis. Stress testing Stress testing is needed to Confirm the diagnosis Evaluate disease severity Determine appropriate exercise levels for the patient Help predict prognosis If the clinical or working diagnosis is unstable angina, early stress testing is contraindicated. Exercise stress testing with ECG is done if a patient has a normal resting ECG and can exercise. In males with chest discomfort suggesting angina, stress ECG testing has a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of approximately 80% (1). These estimates are slightly lower in females. However, females are more likely than males to have an abnormal resting ECG when CAD is present (32% versus 23%).
