clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) Beta-blockers Nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers for symptom control Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins Revascularization if symptoms persist despite medical therapy 8/13 Reversible risk factors are modified as much as possible. People who smoke should stop smoking; 2 or more years after stopping smoking, risk of MI is reduced to that of people who never smoked. Hypertension (BP > 130/80 for patients with CAD) is treated diligently because even mild hypertension increases cardiac workload. Weight loss alone often reduces the severity of angina. Sometimes treatment of mild LV failure markedly lessens angina. However, digitalis occasionally intensifies angina, presumably because increased myocardial contractility increases oxygen demand, arterial tone is increased, or both. Aggressive reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (via diet plus statins) slows the progression of CAD, may cause some lesions to regress, and improves endothelial function and thus arterial response to stress. An exercise program emphasizing walking often improves the sense of well-being, reduces risk of acute ischemic events, and improves exercise tolerance. Coronary Artery Disease Myths PODCAST Medications for angina The main goals of angina treatment are to Relieve acute symptoms Prevent or reduce ischemia Prevent future ischemic events (See
