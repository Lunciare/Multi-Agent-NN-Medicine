or aerosol spray to use promptly at the onset of an angina attack. Patients should store tablets in a tightly sealed, light-resistant glass container, so that potency is not lost. Because the drug deteriorates quickly, small amounts should be obtained frequently. To prevent ischemia, several classes of medications are used: 9/13 Antiplatelet agents: All patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease or at high risk of developing CAD Beta-blockers: Most patients, unless contraindicated or not tolerated Long-acting nitrates: If needed Calcium channel blockers: If needed Antiplatelet agents inhibit platelet aggregation. Aspirin binds irreversibly to platelets and inhibits cyclooxygenase and platelet aggregation. Other antiplatelets (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) block adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation. These agents can reduce the risk of ischemic events (MI, sudden death), but they are most effective when given with aspirin. Patients unable to tolerate one agent should receive the other alone. Beta-blockers limit symptoms and prevent infarction and sudden death better than other medications. Beta-blockers other than labetalol and carvedilol should not be used in patients with vasospastic angina because they may cause coronary vasospasm from unopposed alpha-receptor activity. Beta-blockers block sympathetic stimulation of the heart and reduce systolic BP, heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output, thus decreasing
