approximately 80% (1). These estimates are slightly lower in females. However, females are more likely than males to have an abnormal resting ECG when CAD is present (32% versus 23%). Although sensitivity is reasonably high, exercise ECG can miss severe CAD (even left main or 3- vessel disease). In patients with atypical symptoms, a negative stress ECG usually rules out angina pectoris and CAD; a positive result may or may not represent coronary ischemia and indicates the need for further testing. Stress testing with myocardial imaging is done when the resting ECG is abnormal because false- positive ST-segment shifts are common on the stress ECG. Exercise or pharmacologic stress (eg, with dobutamine or dipyridamole infusion) may be used. Imaging options include stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or PET, and stress MRI. The choice of imaging technique depends on institutional availability and expertise. Imaging tests can help assess LV function and response to stress; identify areas of ischemia, infarction, and viable tissue; and determine the site and extent of myocardium at risk. Stress echocardiography can also detect ischemia- induced mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography Coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing coronary artery disease but is
