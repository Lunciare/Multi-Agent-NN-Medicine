necessarily at night. It is usually accompanied by a modestly increased heart rate and a sometimes markedly higher BP, which increase oxygen demand. These increases may be the cause of rest angina or the result of ischemia induced by plaque rupture and thrombus formation. If angina is not relieved, unmet myocardial oxygen demand increases further, making MI more likely. Unstable angina Because angina characteristics are usually predictable for a given patient, any changes (ie, angina at rest, new-onset angina, increasing angina, new nocturnal angina, or new angina decubitus) should be 4/13 considered serious, especially when the angina is severe (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 3 or 4). Such changes are termed unstable angina and require prompt evaluation and treatment. Diagnosis of Angina Pectoris Typical symptoms Electrocardiography (ECG) Stress testing with ECG or imaging (using echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, positron emission tomography [PET], or MRI) CT angiography or CT fractional flow reserve (CT FFR) Coronary angiography for significant symptoms, positive stress test, or significant lesions noted on CT FFR. Diagnosis of angina is suspected if chest discomfort is typical and is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Presence in the history of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) adds
