Angina Pectoris - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition

is suspected if chest discomfort is typical and is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Presence in the history of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) adds weight to reported symptoms. Patients whose chest discomfort lasts > 20 minutes or occurs during rest or who have syncope or heart failure are evaluated for an acute coronary syndrome. Chest discomfort may also be caused by gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal spasm, indigestion, cholelithiasis), costochondritis, anxiety, panic attacks, hyperventilation, and other cardiac disorders (eg, aortic dissection, pericarditis, mitral valve prolapse, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation), even when coronary blood flow is not compromised. ECG is always done. More specific tests include stress testing with ECG or with myocardial imaging (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, PET, MRI) and coronary angiography. Noninvasive tests are considered first. ECG If typical exertional symptoms are present, ECG is indicated. Because angina resolves quickly with rest, ECG rarely can be done during an attack except during stress testing. If done during an angina attack, ECG is likely to show reversible ischemic changes: T wave discordant to the QRS vector ST-segment depression (typically) ST-segment elevation Decreased R-wave height Intraventricular or bundle branch conduction disturbances Arrhythmia (usually ventricular
