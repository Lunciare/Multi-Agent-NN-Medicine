Overview
A ventricular septal defect (or VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum (the wall dividing the
left and right ventricles of the heart). The ventricular septum consists of a muscular (inferior) and
membranous portion (superior). The membranous portion (which is close to the atrioventricular
node) is most commonly affected.[1]
Congential VSDs are collectively the most common congenital heart defect. The incidence of VSD
in adulthood has decreased over past decades due to successful surgical closure of large defects.[2]
Epidemiology and Demographics
The ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac malformation with an
incidence of 300 to 350 per 100,000 live births,[3] corresponding to 30% of all newborns with a
congenital heart defect. There is no predilection based on sex. Incidence rates are similar in
different races and seasons and are unrelated to maternal age, birth order, sex, and socioeconomic
status. Congential VSDs are frequently associated with other congenital conditions, such as Down
syndrome. [4]
Diagnosis
Physical Examination
The physical examination findings of a ventricular septal defect depend upon the size of the defect,
the location of the defect, the magnitude and directionality of the intracardiac shunt, and the age of
the patient (the duration of the VSD).
CT
Computed tomography can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the
echocardiographic findings are inconclusive.
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the
echocardiographic findings are inconclusive.
