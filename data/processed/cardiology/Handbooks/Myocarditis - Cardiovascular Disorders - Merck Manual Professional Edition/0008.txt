Myocarditis

ischemia where late gadolinium enhancement is usually subendocardial with extension to mid-myocardial and epicardial walls). Other diagnostic features of myocarditis on cardiac MRI are the presence of myocardial edema and myocardial hyperemia relative to skeletal muscle. 5/8 MRI of Patient with Myocarditis and Pericardial Effusion Hide Details Patchy mid wall (bottom white arrow) and epicardial (top white arrow) delayed enhancement on MRI is consistent with myocarditis. This patient also has a pericardial effusion (red arrow). Endomyocardial biopsy showing inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium with necrosis of adjacent myocytes is the gold standard for diagnosis of myocarditis. However, this test has low sensitivity for diagnosis for myocarditis due to sampling error. Therefore, a positive biopsy result is diagnostic for myocarditis, but a negative result does not rule it out. In addition, the biopsy carries a risk of complications, including myocardial rupture and death, so is not routinely done. Endomyocardial biopsy should be done in cases of fulminant heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart block or if results would affect management (eg, if there is suspicion for giant cell myocarditis where prompt treatment can decrease mortality rates). Diagnosis of cause After myocarditis is diagnosed, tests to determine etiology are done. In a
