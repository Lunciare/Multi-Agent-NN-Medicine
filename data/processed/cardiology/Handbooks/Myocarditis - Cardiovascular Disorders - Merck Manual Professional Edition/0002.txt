Myocarditis

that lead to myocardial injury include Direct cardiomyocyte injury caused by an infectious or other cardiotoxic agent Myocardial injury caused by an autoimmune reaction to an infectious or other cardiotoxic agent Myocardial inflammation can be diffuse or focal. Inflammation can extend into the pericardium causing myopericarditis. The extent of myocardial involvement and extension into adjacent pericardium can determine the type of symptoms. Diffuse involvement can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias and sometimes sudden cardiac death. Focal involvement is less likely to cause heart failure but can lead to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Involvement of the pericardium leads to chest pain and other symptoms typical of pericarditis. Some patients remain asymptomatic whether myocardial involvement is focal or diffuse. Etiology of Myocarditis Myocarditis may result from infectious or noninfectious causes. Many cases are idiopathic (see table Causes of Myocarditis). Infectious myocarditis is most often viral in the United States and other high income nations (1). The most common viral causes in the United States are parvovirus B19 and human herpes virus 6. In lower income nations, infectious myocarditis is most often associated with rheumatic carditis, Chagas disease, or HIV infection (2).
