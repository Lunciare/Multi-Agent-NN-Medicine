cultures, autoimmune tests, and, when appropriate, tests for HIV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection, histoplasmosis complement fixation or Lyme disease titers (in endemic areas), and antibody tests for coxsackievirus, influenza virus, and streptococcus. Treatment of Myocarditis Treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias Treatment of underlying disorder Treatment of heart failure includes diuretics and nitrates for symptomatic relief. In cases of fulminant heart failure, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or transplantation may be necessary. Long-term pharmacotherapy of heart failure involves angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs). Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are treated with antiarrhythmic therapy. Heart block can be treated with temporary pacing but may require insertion of a permanent pacemaker if conduction abnormalities persist. Infectious myocarditis is generally treated with supportive therapy for associated heart failure and arrhythmias. Antiviral therapy has not been shown to be helpful in the treatment of most viral etiologies, but nirmatrelvir and ritonavir can help treat myocarditis due to SARS-CoV2 infection (1), and oseltamivir can help treat myocarditis due to influenza (2). Corticosteroids may also help treat myocarditis due to SARS-CoV2 infection (3). Bacterial etiologies may be treated with antibiotics, but antibiotics
