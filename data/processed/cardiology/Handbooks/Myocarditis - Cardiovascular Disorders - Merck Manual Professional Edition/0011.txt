and oseltamivir can help treat myocarditis due to influenza (2). Corticosteroids may also help treat myocarditis due to SARS-CoV2 infection (3). Bacterial etiologies may be treated with antibiotics, but antibiotics have not been shown to be effective except possibly in the acute infectious phase. Parasitic infection should be treated with appropriate antiparasitic medications. Corticosteroids are appropriate for patients with eosinophilic or giant cell myocardial infiltrations or myocarditis due to systemic rheumatic disorders (4). Hypersensitivity myocarditis is treated by immediate discontinuation of the causative medication or cardiotoxin and corticosteroid therapy. Patients with giant cell myocarditis have improved survival when treated with immunosuppressants, usually corticosteroids and cyclosporine (5). Myocarditis caused by sarcoidosis can be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants (6). Key Points Clinical presentation of myocarditis is variable, ranging from subclinical symptoms to fulminant heart failure, intractable arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is often based on clinical findings and noninvasive testing, including cardiac MRI; do endomyocardial biopsy if patients present with fulminant heart failure or intractable arrhythmias or if findings would change treatment. Treat patients with heart failure and arrhythmias; immunosuppression is added for sarcoidosis or medication-related myocarditis and giant cell myocarditis.
