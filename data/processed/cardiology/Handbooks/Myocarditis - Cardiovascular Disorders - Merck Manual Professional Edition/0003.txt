Myocarditis

6. In lower income nations, infectious myocarditis is most often associated with rheumatic carditis, Chagas disease, or HIV infection (2). Direct myocardial injury due to infection with SARS-CoV-2, with symptoms ranging from mild chest discomfort to fulminant myocarditis, is uncommon in patients with COVID-19, but the risk of myocarditis is 16 times higher in those with infection than in those not infected (3). Noninfectious causes include cardiotoxins, certain medications, and some systemic disorders. Myocarditis caused by medications is termed hypersensitivity myocarditis. Myocarditis after mRNA- based COVID-19 vaccination is rare and far less common than COVID-associated myocarditis (4). It occurs mostly in adolescent and young adult males, usually within a week of vaccination, and is generally mild. Eosinophilic myocarditis has various causes. It is an inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by eosinophilic infiltration; among the causes is hypersensitivity myocarditis (5).
