stroke (typically attributed to spontaneous carotid dissection) Intra-abdominal arteries: Symptoms of mesenteric ischemia (rare) Intracranial arteries: Symptoms of brain aneurysm Leg arteries: Claudication in the thighs and calves, femoral bruits, and decreased femoral pulses Renal arteries: Renovascular hypertension Ultrasound may suggest the diagnosis, but definitive diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia is made by angiography showing focal or multifocal arterial stenoses, potentially with associated aneurysm or tortuosity. Appearance may be beaded in medial or perimedial dysplasia, or a concentric band or long, smooth narrowing in other forms (2). 1/3 Screening of other vascular beds with duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography is recommended when fibromuscular dysplasia is initially diagnosed (2). Fibromuscular Dysplasia of the Renal Artery Hide Details This image shows the classic "string of beads" sign (arrow) in a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery. Treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia varies by location. It may involve percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone, percutaneous stent angioplasty, bypass surgery, or aneurysm repair. Smoking cessation is important. Control of other risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) helps prevent accelerated development of flow-limiting arterial stenoses.
