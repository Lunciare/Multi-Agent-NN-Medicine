Fibromuscular dysplasia includes a heterogenous group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial changes, causing some degree of vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. Fibromuscular dysplasia usually occurs in women aged 40 to 60 years (1). The cause is unknown. However, there may be a genetic component, and smoking may be a risk factor. Fibromuscular dysplasia overlaps clinically with certain connective tissue disorders (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, cystic medial necrosis, hereditary nephritis), and neurofibromatosis) (2). Medial dysplasia, the most common type, is characterized by alternating regions of thick and thin fibromuscular ridges containing collagen along the media.
