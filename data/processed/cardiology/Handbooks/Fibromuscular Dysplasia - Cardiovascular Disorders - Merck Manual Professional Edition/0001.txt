Fibromuscular dysplasia includes a heterogenous group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial changes, causing some degree of vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. Fibromuscular dysplasia usually occurs in women aged 40 to 60 years (1). The cause is unknown. However, there may be a genetic component, and smoking may be a risk factor. Fibromuscular dysplasia overlaps clinically with certain connective tissue disorders (eg, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, cystic medial necrosis, hereditary nephritis), and neurofibromatosis) (2). Medial dysplasia, the most common type, is characterized by alternating regions of thick and thin fibromuscular ridges containing collagen along the media. In perimedial dysplasia, extensive collagen deposition occurs in the outer half of the media. Fibromuscular dysplasia may affect the renal arteries (in 88% of patients), carotid and intracranial arteries (25% of patients), intra-abdominal arteries (14% of patients), and upper (3% of patients) or lower (10% of patients) extremity arteries (3). Fibromuscular dysplasia is usually asymptomatic regardless of location. Signs and symptoms, when they occur, vary by location: Carotid arteries: Symptoms of a transient ischemic attack or stroke (typically attributed to spontaneous carotid dissection) Intra-abdominal arteries: Symptoms of mesenteric ischemia (rare) Intracranial arteries: Symptoms of brain aneurysm Leg arteries: Claudication in the thighs and calves, femoral bruits,
