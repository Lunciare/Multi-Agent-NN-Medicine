The SA node is richly innervated by parasympathetic nervous system fibers (CN X: Vagus Nerve)
and by sympathetic nervous system fibers (T1-4, Spinal Nerves). This makes the SA node
susceptible to autonomic influences.
• Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic fibers) causes a decrease in the SA node rate
(thereby decreasing the heart rate and force of contraction).
• Stimulation via sympathetic fibers causes an increase in the SA node rate (thereby increasing
the heart rate and force of contraction).
Blood supply
In the majority of patients, the SA node receives blood from the right coronary artery.
