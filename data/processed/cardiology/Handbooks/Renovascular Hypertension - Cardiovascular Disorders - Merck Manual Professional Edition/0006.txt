Renovascular Hypertension

patients with untreated primary hypertension. All patients should have aggressive medical management of their hypertension. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis For patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, data from a large, randomized trial (the cardiovascular outcomes in renal atherosclerotic lesions [CORAL] trial) showed that stent placement did not improve outcomes compared to medical management alone (1). Although stent placement did provide a small (-2 mm Hg), statistically significant decrease in systolic blood pressure, there was no significant clinical benefit for prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, death due to cardiovascular or renal disease, or progression of kidney disease (including the need for renal replacement therapy). Importantly, all patients in the CORAL study received aggressive medical management of their hypertension and diabetes (if present), along with antiplatelet medications and a statin to manage atherosclerosis. Thus, the decision to eschew angioplasty must be accompanied by strict adherence to current medical management guidelines (2). If serum creatinine increases by > 50% with optimal medical treatment for blood pressure, renal artery stenting may help preserve kidney function (3). For patients unable to strictly adhere to medical management guidelines and with a > 70% renal artery stenosis, stent placement may still be considered. Fibromuscular dysplasia
