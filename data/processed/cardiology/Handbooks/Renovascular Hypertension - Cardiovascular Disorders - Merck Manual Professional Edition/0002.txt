by fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerosis is more common among men > 50 years and affects mainly the proximal one-third of the renal artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia is more common among younger patients (usually women) and usually affects the distal two-thirds of the main renal artery and the branches of the renal arteries. Rarer causes include emboli, trauma, inadvertent ligation during surgery, and extrinsic compression of the renal pedicle by tumors. Renovascular hypertension is characterized by high cardiac output and high peripheral resistance. Symptoms and Signs of Renovascular Hypertension Renovascular hypertension is usually asymptomatic. A systolic-diastolic bruit in the epigastrium, usually transmitted to one or both upper quadrants and sometimes to the back, is almost pathognomonic, but it is present in only about 50% of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and is rare in patients with renal atherosclerosis. Renovascular hypertension should be suspected if: Diastolic hypertension develops abruptly New or previously stable hypertension rapidly worsens over a period of 6 months Hypertension is initially severe (eg, systolic BP > 180 mm Hg) There is unexplained worsening renal function Hypertension is resistant to medications A history of trauma to the back or flank or acute pain in this region with or without hematuria suggests renovascular
