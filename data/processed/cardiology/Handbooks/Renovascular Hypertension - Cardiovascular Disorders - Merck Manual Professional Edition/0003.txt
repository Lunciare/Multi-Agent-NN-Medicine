unexplained worsening renal function Hypertension is resistant to medications A history of trauma to the back or flank or acute pain in this region with or without hematuria suggests renovascular hypertension (possibly due to arterial injury), but these findings are rare. Asymmetric renal size (> 1 cm difference) discovered incidentally during imaging tests, and recurrent episodes of unexplained acute pulmonary edema or heart failure also suggest renovascular hypertension. Diagnosis of Renovascular Hypertension Initial identification with ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography Confirmation with renal angiography (also may be therapeutic) If renovascular hypertension is suspected, ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography are reasonable non-invasive initial tests. Noninvasive testing is less reliable for detecting fibromuscular dysplasia because of the location of the stenotic lesion (which typically involves the intrarenal portion of the renal artery). Renal angiography is the definitive test, which may be done when noninvasive testing is inconclusive and the clinical suspicion is high. Duplex Doppler ultrasound can assess renal blood flow and is a reliable, noninvasive method for identifying significant stenosis (eg, > 60%) in the main renal arteries. Sensitivity and specificity are 85 to 90% when experienced technicians do the test (1). It is less accurate in
