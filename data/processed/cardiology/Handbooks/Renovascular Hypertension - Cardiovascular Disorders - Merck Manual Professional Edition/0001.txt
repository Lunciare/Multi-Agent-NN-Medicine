Renovascular Hypertension

Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing. A bruit can be heard over one or both renal arteries in < 50% of patients. Diagnosis is by physical examination and renal imaging with duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment is with medications and sometimes revascularization by percutaneous angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular disease is one of the most common causes of reversible hypertension but accounts for < 1% of all cases of hypertension (1). Stenosis or occlusion of a main renal artery, an accessory renal artery, or any of their branches can cause hypertension by stimulating release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells of the affected kidney. The area of the arterial lumen must be decreased by ≥ 70% and a significant poststenotic gradient must be present before stenosis is likely to contribute to blood pressure (BP) elevation. Overall, about 80% of cases are caused by renal atherosclerosis and 20% by fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerosis is more common among men > 50 years and affects mainly the proximal one-third of the renal artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia is more common among younger patients
