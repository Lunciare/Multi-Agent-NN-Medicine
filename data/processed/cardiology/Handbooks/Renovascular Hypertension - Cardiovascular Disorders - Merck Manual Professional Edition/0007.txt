Renovascular Hypertension

preserve kidney function (3). For patients unable to strictly adhere to medical management guidelines and with a > 70% renal artery stenosis, stent placement may still be considered. Fibromuscular dysplasia For most patients with fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is recommended. Placement of a stent reduces the risk of restenosis; antiplatelet medications (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) are given afterward. Saphenous vein bypass grafting is recommended only when extensive disease in the renal artery branches makes PTA technically unfeasible. Sometimes complete surgical revascularization requires microvascular techniques that can only be done ex vivo with autotransplantation of the kidney. Cure rate is 90% in appropriately selected patients; surgical mortality rate is < 1% (4). Medical treatment is always preferable to nephrectomy in patients whose kidneys cannot be revascularized for technical reasons. Key Points Stenosis (> 70%) or occlusion of a renal artery can cause hypertension by stimulating release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells of the affected kidney. About 80% of cases are caused by atherosclerosis, and 20% by fibromuscular dysplasia. Suspect a renovascular cause if diastolic hypertension develops abruptly; if new or previously stable hypertension rapidly worsens within 6 months; or if hypertension is initially severe (systolic >
