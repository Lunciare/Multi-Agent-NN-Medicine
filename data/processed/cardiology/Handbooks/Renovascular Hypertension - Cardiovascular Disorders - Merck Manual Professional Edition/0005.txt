compare blood flow and filtration between the kidneys. Imaging is performed before and after an oral dose of captopril. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor causes the affected artery to narrow, decreasing perfusion on the scintiscan. Narrowing also causes an increase in serum renin, which is measured before and after captopril administration. This test may be less reliable in patients with decreased renal function. 3/6 Renal Artery Stenosis (Digital Subtraction Angiography) IMAGE IMAGE PROVIDED BY JAN N. BASILE, MD. Measurements of renal vein renin activity are sometimes misleading and, unless surgery is being considered, are not necessary. However, in unilateral disease, a renal vein renin activity ratio of > 1.5 (affected to unaffected side) usually predicts a good outcome with revascularization. The test is done when patients are depleted of sodium, stimulating the release of renin. Treatment of Renovascular Hypertension Aggressive medical management of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and related disorders For fibromuscular dysplasia, sometimes angioplasty with or without stent placement Rarely bypass grafting Without treatment, the prognosis is similar to that for patients with untreated primary hypertension. All patients should have aggressive medical management of their hypertension. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis For patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, data from a large,
