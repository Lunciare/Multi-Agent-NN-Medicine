Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing. A bruit can be heard over one or both renal arteries in < 50% of patients. Diagnosis is by physical examination and renal imaging with duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, or magnetic resonance angiography. Treatment is with medications and sometimes revascularization by percutaneous angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular disease is one of the most common causes of reversible hypertension but accounts for < 1% of all cases of hypertension (1).
