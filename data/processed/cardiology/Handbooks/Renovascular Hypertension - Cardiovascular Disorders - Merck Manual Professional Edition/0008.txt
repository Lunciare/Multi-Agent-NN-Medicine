Renovascular Hypertension

fibromuscular dysplasia. Suspect a renovascular cause if diastolic hypertension develops abruptly; if new or previously stable hypertension rapidly worsens within 6 months; or if hypertension is initially severe (systolic > 180 mm Hg), associated with worsening renal function, or highly refractory to treatment with medication. Do ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography to identify patients who should have renal angiography, the definitive test. Give aggressive medical treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and related disorders. For patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, consider percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stent placement or rarely a vascular bypass graft.
