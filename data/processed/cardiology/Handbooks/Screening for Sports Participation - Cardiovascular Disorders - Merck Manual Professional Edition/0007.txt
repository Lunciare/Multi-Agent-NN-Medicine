of frequent and easily triggered dislocations or multiple concussions should participate in noncollision sports. Males, particularly those with a single testis, should wear a protective cup for most contact sports. People, particularly those at risk of heat intolerance and dehydration (eg, those with diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease or trait, or previous heat-related illness), should hydrate frequently during prolonged activity. People with suboptimal seizure control should avoid swimming, weight lifting, and, to prevent injury to others, sports such as archery and riflery. People who have asthma need to monitor their symptoms closely. Key Points Screen younger participants (children through young adults) with history and physical examination; those with abnormal findings or positive family history should have ECG and/or echocardiography. Screen older participants with risk factors (particularly if they have been sedentary for a number of years) with history, physical examination, and usually an exercise stress test. Recommend against participation in athletes with severe valvular disease and most structural or arrhythmogenic heart disorders (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Recommend against participation in children with acute splenic enlargement or recent infectious mononucleosis, symptomatic or persistent fever, and significant diarrhea or vomiting that predispose them to dehydration until these conditions are resolved.
