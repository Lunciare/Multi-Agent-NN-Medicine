Screening for Sports Participation

and examination are neither sensitive nor specific; false-negative and false-positive findings are common because prevalence of cardiac disorders in an apparently healthy population is very low. Use of screening ECG or echocardiography would improve disease detection but would produce even more false-positive diagnoses and is impractical at a population level. Genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or long QT syndrome is not recommended or even feasible for the screening of athletes. Selected testing Athletes with a family history or symptoms or signs of, for example hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, or Marfan syndrome, require further evaluation. Typically evaluation includes one or both of the following: ECG Echocardiography Confirmation of any of these disorders may preclude sports participation. If ECG reveals Mobitz type II heart block, complete heart block, true right bundle branch block, or left bundle branch block, or there is clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of supraventricular or ventricular rhythm disorders, a search for cardiac disease is required. Athletes with presyncope or syncope in whom noninvasive testing is unrevealing should also be evaluated for anomalous coronary arteries. Evaluation is done using Cardiac catheterization If an enlarged aorta is detected on echocardiography (or incidentally), further assessment
