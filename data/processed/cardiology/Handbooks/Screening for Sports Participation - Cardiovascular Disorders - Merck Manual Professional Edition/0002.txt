long QT syndrome, or Marfan syndrome Use of performance-enhancing or illicit drugs (Visit the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.) and medications that predispose to long QT syndrome In adults, risk factors for coronary artery disease Physical examination should consist of a cardiovascular examination that includes blood pressure in both arms, supine and standing cardiopulmonary auscultation, and assessment for other conditions such as features of Marfan syndrome. These measures aim to identify apparently healthy people at high risk of life-threatening cardiac events (eg, people with arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or other structural heart disorders). European guidelines differ from American guidelines in that a screening electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended for all children, adolescents, and college-age athletes (2). Canadian Guidelines recommend screening in 3 tiers: History/questionnaire Physical examination ECG only when indicated according to clinical findings Testing follows if clinically warranted (3). QT Interval Correction (EKG) Screening for older adults (35 years or older) with risk factors may include incremental symptom- limited exercise testing, especially if athletes have been sedentary for a number of years. History and examination are neither sensitive nor specific; false-negative and false-positive findings are common because prevalence of cardiac disorders in an apparently healthy population is very low.
