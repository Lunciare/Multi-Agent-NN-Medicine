Adults are asked about the following: Previous or current musculoskeletal injuries (including easily triggered dislocations) Arthritic disorders, particularly those involving major weight-bearing joints (eg, hips, knees, ankles) Concussions Asthma Symptoms suggesting systemic infection Heat-related illness Easy bruising or bleeding Seizures Two populations at risk for injuries are commonly overlooked: Boys who physically mature late are assumed to be at greater risk of injury in contact sports if competing against larger and stronger children. People with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of musculoskeletal problems because of excess body weight and associated forces on the joints and tissues. One risk is overuse injury and soft-tissue inflammation, particularly if people increase intensity and duration of exercise too rapidly. A long-term risk is osteoarthritis affecting weight-bearing joints. Another risk may be injury due to sudden stops and starts if they participate in activities that require jumping or high levels of agility. Athletes, particularly adolescents and young adults, should be asked about use of illicit and performance-enhancing drugs. (Visit the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.)
