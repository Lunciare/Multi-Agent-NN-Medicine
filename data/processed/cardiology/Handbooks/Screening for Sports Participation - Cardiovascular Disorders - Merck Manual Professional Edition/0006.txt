illicit and performance-enhancing drugs. (Visit the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.) In girls and young women, screening should detect delayed onset of menarche. Girls and young women should be screened for the presence of the female athlete triad (eating disorders, amenorrhea or other menstrual dysfunction, and diminished bone mineral density). Two questions are validated screening measures for eating disorders: Have you ever had an eating disorder? Are you happy with your weight? Contraindications to Sports Participation Other than certain cardiovascular disorders, there are almost no absolute contraindications to sports participation. Exceptions in children include Acute splenic enlargement or recent infectious mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus infection) because splenic rupture is a risk Symptomatic or persistent fevers, which may decrease exercise tolerance, increase risk of heat-related disorders, and be a sign of serious illness Possibly significant diarrhea and/or recent significant vomiting because dehydration is a risk In adults, relative contraindications are more common and lead to recommendations for precautions or for participation in some sports rather than others, for example: 4/5 People with a history of frequent and easily triggered dislocations or multiple concussions should participate in noncollision sports. Males, particularly those with a single testis, should wear a protective cup for most contact sports.
