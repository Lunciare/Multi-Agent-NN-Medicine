Overview In cardiac physiology, afterload is used to mean the tension produced by a chamber of the heart in order to contract. If the chamber is not mentioned, it is usually assumed to be the left ventricle. However, the strict definition of the term relates to the properties of a single cardiac myocyte. It is therefore only of direct relevance in the laboratory; in the Ventricular systole. Red clinic, the term end-systolic pressure is usually more appropriate, arrow is path from left although not equivalent. ventricle to aorta. Afterload is largely Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chamber of the dependent upon aortic heart has to generate in order to eject blood out of the chamber. pressure. Everything else held equal, as afterload increases, cardiac output decreases. In the case of the left ventricle, the afterload is a consequence of the blood pressure, since the pressure in the ventricle must be greater than the peripheral blood pressure in order to open the aortic valve. Pathology Disease processes that increase the left ventricular afterload include increased blood pressure and aortic valve disease. Hypertension (Increased blood pressure) increases the left ventricular afterload because the left ventricle has to
