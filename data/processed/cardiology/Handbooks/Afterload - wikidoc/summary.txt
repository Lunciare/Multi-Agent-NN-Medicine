Overview In cardiac physiology, afterload is used to mean the tension produced by a chamber of the heart in order to contract. If the chamber is not mentioned, it is usually assumed to be the left ventricle. However, the strict definition of the term relates to the properties of a single cardiac myocyte. It is therefore only of direct relevance in the laboratory; in the Ventricular systole. Red clinic, the term end-systolic pressure is usually more appropriate, arrow is path from left although not equivalent. Afterload is largely Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chamber of the dependent upon aortic heart has to generate in order to eject blood out of the chamber.
