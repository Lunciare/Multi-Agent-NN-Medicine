Ventricular Premature Beats (VPB)

VPBs increase during exercise in a patient with coronary artery disease, evaluation for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery should be considered (1). Prognosis for Ventricular Premature Beats VPBs are not significant in patients without a heart disorder, and no treatment is required beyond avoiding obvious triggers. Therapy is offered only if symptoms are intolerable or if the VPBs are very frequent and, by inducing interventricular dyssynchrony, induce cardiomyopathy with heart failure. Other antiarrhythmics that suppress VPBs increase risk of more serious arrhythmias.
