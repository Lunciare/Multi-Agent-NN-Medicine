Ventricular Premature Beats (VPB)

usual sites of origin, these idiopathic VPBs are termed right ventricular outflow tract VPBs or left-ventricular outflow tract VBPs (2). They typically have a morphology similar to that of left bundle branch block and a vertical downward axis (positive QRS in lead V1, negative QRS in lead AVL, and near-isoelectric QRS in lead I) (see figure Sinus Rhythm With Ventricular Premature Beats Due to Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Ectopy). VPBs may be experienced as missed or skipped beats; the VPB itself is not sensed but rather the following augmented sinus beat. When VPBs are very frequent, particularly when they occur at every second heart beat, mild hemodynamic symptoms are possible because the sinus rate has been effectively halved. Existing ejection murmurs may be accentuated because of increased cardiac filling and augmented contractility after the compensatory pause. Diagnosis of Ventricular Premature Beats ECG Sometimes 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and echocardiography Diagnosis of ventricular premature beats is by electrocardiography (ECG) showing a wide QRS complex without a preceding P wave, typically followed by a fully compensatory pause. Patients whose history (including family history), physical examination, or ECG suggest a possible underlying structural heart disorder should have 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and echocardiography (1).
