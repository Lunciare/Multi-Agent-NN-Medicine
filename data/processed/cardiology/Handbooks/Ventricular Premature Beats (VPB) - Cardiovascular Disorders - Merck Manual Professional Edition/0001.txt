(Premature Ventricular Contraction; PVC) Ventricular premature beats (VPB) are single ventricular impulses caused by reentry within the ventricle or abnormal automaticity of ventricular or Purkinje cells. They are extremely common in both healthy patients and patients with a heart disorder. VPB may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment is usually not required. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) Ventricular premature beats (VPBs), also called premature ventricular contractions (PVC), may occur erratically or at predictable intervals (eg, every third [trigeminy] or second [bigeminy] beat). VPBs may increase with stimulants (eg, anxiety, stress, alcohol, caffeine, sympathomimetic drugs or medications), hypoxia, or electrolyte abnormalities. Although VPBs are typically benign, they may be a manifestation of a structural heart disorder. An increase in premature ventricular beat frequency or complexity with exercise may indicate reversible myocardial ischemia. Patients with very frequent VPBs may develop reversible VPB-induced cardiomyopathy, particularly if there is an underlying cardiomyopathy (1). Some people with a structurally normal heart have VPBs due to cAMP-mediated delayed after depolarizations. Recognizing their usual sites of origin, these idiopathic VPBs are termed right ventricular outflow tract VPBs or left-ventricular outflow tract VBPs (2). They typically have a morphology similar to that of left
