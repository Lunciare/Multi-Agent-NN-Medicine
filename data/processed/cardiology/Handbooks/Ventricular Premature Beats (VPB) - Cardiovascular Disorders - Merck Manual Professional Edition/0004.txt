not commonly used in patients with a structural heart disorder. To help prevent and/or reverse VPB- induced cardiomyopathy, patients with medication-resistant VPBs and progressive ventricular systolic dysfunction are treated with transcatheter ablation (2). Ablation may also be offered if symptoms are intolerable (1). Ablation is particularly effective in patients with right or left ventricular outflow VPBs (1). In patients with a structural heart disorder, frequent VPBs (> 10/minute) correlate with increased mortality. Nevertheless, no studies have shown that pharmacologic suppression reduces mortality. 3/4 Patients in the post-myocardial infarction period have a higher mortality rate when treated with class I antiarrhythmics than with placebo (3). This finding probably reflects adverse effects of the antiarrhythmics. Beta-blockers (class II antiarrhythmics) should be used if indicated as part of guideline- directed therapy for the underlying structural heart disease. They are beneficial in symptomatic heart failure or if required for relief of symptoms resulting from VPBs. Non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) should not be used in patients with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function. If VPBs increase during exercise in a patient with coronary artery disease, evaluation for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery should be considered (1).
