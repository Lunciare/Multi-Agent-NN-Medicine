a fully compensatory pause. Patients whose history (including family history), physical examination, or ECG suggest a possible underlying structural heart disorder should have 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and echocardiography (1). If ischemic heart disease is suspected, an exercise test is done for diagnostic purposes and to determine the need for further testing to evaluate the severity of coronary artery disease and the potential for coronary revascularization (1). Treatment of Ventricular Premature Beats Beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists for patients with bothersome symptoms Rarely, a class I or class III antiarrhythmic medication Rarely, ablation In the absence of a structural heart disorder, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic premature VPBs have a benign prognosis and require no treatment other than reassurance (1). Treatment for VPBs is only required for relief from bothersome symptoms. Treatment begins with beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (verapamil or diltiazem). These medications are particularly effective in patients with right or left ventricular outflow tract VPBs (1). Class I or class III antiarrhythmic medications may increase risk of mortality and are not commonly used in patients with a structural heart disorder. To help prevent and/or reverse VPB- induced cardiomyopathy, patients with medication-resistant VPBs and progressive ventricular systolic dysfunction are treated with
