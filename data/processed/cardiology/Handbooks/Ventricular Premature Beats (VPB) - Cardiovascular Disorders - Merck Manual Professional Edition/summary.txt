(Premature Ventricular Contraction; PVC) Ventricular premature beats (VPB) are single ventricular impulses caused by reentry within the ventricle or abnormal automaticity of ventricular or Purkinje cells. They are extremely common in both healthy patients and patients with a heart disorder. VPB may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment is usually not required. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) Ventricular premature beats (VPBs), also called premature ventricular contractions (PVC), may occur erratically or at predictable intervals (eg, every third [trigeminy] or second [bigeminy] beat).
