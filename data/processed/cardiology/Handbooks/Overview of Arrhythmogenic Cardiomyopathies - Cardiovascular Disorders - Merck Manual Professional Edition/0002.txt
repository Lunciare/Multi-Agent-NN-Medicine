Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies

is suspected, other investigations may be indicated, including signal-averaged ECG, exercise testing, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, chest CT, electrophysiologic study, angiography, and/or endomyocardial biopsy. Genetic testing is usually done when a genetic cause is suspected; first-degree relatives of patients with a confirmed disorder should be screened clinically and with genetic testing when a specific mutation is found. Management depends on the cause of the cardiomyopathy and the specific rhythm disturbance, but typically includes standard measures for heart failure (sometimes including cardiac transplantation), antiarrhythmic medications, and sometimes an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and/or catheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate.
