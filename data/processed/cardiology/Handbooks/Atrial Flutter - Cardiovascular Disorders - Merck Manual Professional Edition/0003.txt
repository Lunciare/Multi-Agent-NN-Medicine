Atrial Flutter

Decreased cardiac output may cause symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, weakness, syncope). Close inspection of the jugular venous pulse reveals flutter a waves. Diagnosis of Atrial Flutter ECG The diagnosis of atrial flutter is by electrocardiography (ECG). In typical flutter, ECG shows continuous and regular atrial activation with a sawtooth pattern, most obvious in leads II, III, and aVF (see figure Atrial Flutter). Atrial Flutter (Note: Conducted with right bundle branch block.) 2/5 Carotid sinus massage can increase AV block and better expose the typical flutter waves. A similar response may follow pharmacologic AV nodal blockade (eg, with adenosine), but such therapy does not usually terminate atrial flutter. Treatment of Atrial Flutter Rate control with medication Rhythm control with cardioversion, medication, or ablation Prevention of thromboembolism Treatment of atrial flutter focuses on ventricular rate control, rhythm control, and prevention of thromboembolism. Pharmacologic rate control is more difficult to achieve in atrial flutter than in atrial fibrillation. Thus, for most patients, electrical conversion (using synchronized cardioversion or overdrive pacing) is the treatment of choice for an initial episode and is mandatory with 1:1 AV conduction or hemodynamic compromise. Typically, low-energy (50 joules) conversion is effective. Anticoagulation, as in
