Atrial Flutter

atria depolarize at a rate of 250 to 350 beats/minute (typically 300 beats/minute). Because the atrioventricular (AV) node cannot usually conduct at this rate, typically half of the impulses get through (2:1 block), resulting in a regular ventricular rate of 150 beats/minute. Sometimes, the block varies from moment to moment, causing an irregular ventricular rhythm. Less commonly, a fixed 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1 block may be present. The probability of a thromboembolic event in isolated atrial flutter is thought to be about half of that in atrial fibrillation (2). However, many patients with atrial flutter also have (or will develop) atrial fibrillation. Accordingly, guidelines for anticoagulation make no distinction between patients with atrial flutter and those with atrial fibrillation (3). Symptoms and Signs of Atrial Flutter Symptoms of atrial flutter depend primarily on ventricular rate and the nature of any underlying heart disorder. If ventricular rate is < 120 beats/minute and regular, there are likely to be few or no symptoms. Faster rates and variable AV conduction usually cause palpitations. Decreased cardiac output may cause symptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, weakness, syncope). Close inspection of the jugular venous pulse reveals flutter a waves.
