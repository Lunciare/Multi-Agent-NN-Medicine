Atrial flutter is a rapid regular atrial rhythm due to an atrial macroreentrant circuit. Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope. Atrial thrombi may form and embolize. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment involves rate control with medication, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulants, and often conversion to sinus rhythm with medication, cardioversion, or atrial flutter substrate ablation. Atrial flutter is much less common than atrial fibrillation, but its causes and hemodynamic consequences are similar.
