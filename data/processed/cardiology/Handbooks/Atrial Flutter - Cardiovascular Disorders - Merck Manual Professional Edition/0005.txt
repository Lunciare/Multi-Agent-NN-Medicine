a bradycardia, who are ineligible or in whom other approaches to rhythm control have failed. Ablation procedures designed to interrupt the atrial reentrant circuit may effectively prevent atrial flutter, particularly typical atrial flutter. Because typical atrial flutter is dependent on conduction through the relatively narrow cavotricuspid isthmus, placement of an ablation line of block across the isthmus will cure typical atrial flutter in > 95% of patients. However, atrial fibrillation may recur in up to 60% of patients in the 10 years that follow successful atrial flutter ablation (2). To prevent thromboembolism, patients with chronic or recurrent atrial flutter require an oral anticoagulant (warfarin titrated to an INR of 2 to 3, a direct thrombin inhibitor, or a factor Xa inhibitor). The choice among the therapies is based on the same considerations as in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (1). Treatment references 1.
