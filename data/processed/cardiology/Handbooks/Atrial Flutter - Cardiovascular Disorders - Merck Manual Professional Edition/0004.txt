Atrial Flutter

pacing) is the treatment of choice for an initial episode and is mandatory with 1:1 AV conduction or hemodynamic compromise. Typically, low-energy (50 joules) conversion is effective. Anticoagulation, as in atrial fibrillation, is necessary before cardioversion (1). If medication is used to restore sinus rhythm, rate must first be controlled with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem). Many of the antiarrhythmic medications that can restore sinus rhythm (especially class Ia and Ic) can slow atrial flutter, shorten AV nodal refractoriness (by their vagolytic effects), or do both enough to allow 1:1 conduction with paradoxical increase in ventricular rate and hemodynamic compromise. These medications may be used for long-term maintenance as required to prevent recurrence in association with medication to prolong AV nodal refractoriness (class II, III, IV, or digoxin) (1). Overview of Atrial Flutter VIDEO 3/5 An antitachycardia pacing system is an alternative to long-term use of antiarrhythmics and is a rare therapy used in patients with atrial flutter and an independent indication for pacing, such as a bradycardia, who are ineligible or in whom other approaches to rhythm control have failed. Ablation procedures designed to interrupt the atrial reentrant circuit may effectively prevent atrial flutter, particularly
