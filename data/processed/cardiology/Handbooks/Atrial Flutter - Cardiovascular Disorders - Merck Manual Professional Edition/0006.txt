Clin Res Cardiol 103(7):543–552, 2014. doi: 10.1007/s00392-014-0682-6 Key Points Atrial flutter is a rapid, regular atrial rhythm that may cause an regular, irregular, tachycardic, or nontachycardic QRS response, depending on the degree and type of block present. After initial rate control with medications such as beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem), most patients should have pharmacologic or direct current cardioversion. Anticoagulation is usually necessary before cardioversion. Long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke is required for patients with chronic or recurrent atrial flutter. Recurrent episodes are prevented with class Ia, Ic, or III antiarrhythmic medications along with AV nodal suppression or, more effectively, by cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.
