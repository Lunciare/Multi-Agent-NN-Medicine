Ventricular Tachycardia

some patients tolerate VT surprisingly well, concluding that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin is a mistake. Using medications appropriate for supraventricular tachycardia (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) in patients with VT may cause hemodynamic collapse and death (2). Still, because of its very brief half-life, IV adenosine may be used as a diagnostic maneuver (and possibly treatment, if the arrhythmia is supraventricular) in a patient who is stable and has a regular, monomorphic wide QRS complex tachycardia (3), albeit with a small risk of converting stable VT to unstable ventricular fibrillation. Modified Brugada Criteria for Ventricular Tachycardia *With RBBB QRS: In V1, monophasic R, or QR, or RS In V6, R/S < 1 or monophasic R or QR *With LBBB QRS: In V1, R > 30 milliseconds wide or RS > 60 milliseconds wide In V6, QR or QS AV = atrioventricular; LBBB = left bundle branch block; msec = millisecond; RBBB = right bundle branch block; VT = ventricular tachycardia. Pearls & Pitfalls Because some patients tolerate ventricular tachycardia surprisingly well, it is a mistake to conclude that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin.
