(usually posterior) hemifascicle of the left bundle branch. It is typically induced by a critical heart rate either spontaneously or by rapid atrial pacing and usually has a morphology similar to that of right bundle branch block with left axis deviation (3). Bundle branch reentry VT is a ventricular tachycardia that occurs in patients with advanced cardiomyopathy or isolated conduction system disease (3). It is due to macro-reentry using the bundle branches, usually the antegrade limb is the right bundle branch and the retrograde limb is the left bundle branch. Accordingly, this ventricular tachycardia usually has a LBBB-like QRS morphology (3). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue. Patients are predisposed to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased adrenergic activity. (See also Arrhythmogenic Cardiac Disorders.) VT frequently deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation and thus cardiac arrest. Symptoms and Signs of Ventricular Tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia of short duration or slow rate may be asymptomatic. Sustained VT is almost always symptomatic, causing palpitations, symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, or sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is by ECG (see figure Broad QRS Ventricular Tachycardia).
