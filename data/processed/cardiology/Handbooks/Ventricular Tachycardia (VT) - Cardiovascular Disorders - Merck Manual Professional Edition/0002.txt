Ventricular Tachycardia

appearing QRS complexes Polymorphic VT: Several different foci or pathways and thus irregular, varying QRS complexes Nonsustained VT: Lasts < 30 seconds Sustained VT: Lasts ≥ 30 seconds or is terminated sooner because of hemodynamic collapse Right and left ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (RVOT-VT and LVOT-VT) are idiopathic ventricular tachycardias that occur in the absence of an evident underlying structural heart disorder (2). They are due to cAMP-mediated delayed after-depolarizations and usually occur with exercise or emotional stress (2). They typically have a morphology that is similar to left bundle branch block (LBBB) and a vertical downward axis (positive QRS in lead V1, negative QRS in lead AVL, and near-isoelectric QRS in lead I) (see Ventricular Premature Beats). Verapamil-sensitive left fascicular VT (Belhassen VT, left septal VT) is an idiopathic ventricular tachycardia that occurs in the absence of an evident underlying structural heart disorder (3). It is due to a slow conduction section of abnormal Purkinje tissue that can support macro-reentry using ventricular myocardium and part of the left (usually posterior) hemifascicle of the left bundle branch. It is typically induced by a critical heart rate either spontaneously or by rapid atrial pacing and usually has a morphology similar
