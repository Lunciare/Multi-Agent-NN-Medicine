Ventricular Tachycardia

is frequently used but does not usually work quickly. Failure of IV procainamide or IV amiodarone is an indication for cardioversion. Right and left ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardias (RVOT-VT and LVOT-VT) respond to IV adenosine. Verapamil-sensitive left fascicular ventricular tachycardia responds to IV verapamil (1). Nonsustained VT does not require immediate treatment unless the runs are frequent or long enough to cause symptoms. In such cases, antiarrhythmics are used as for sustained VT. Long-term The primary goal is preventing sudden death, rather than simply suppressing the arrhythmia. It is best accomplished by use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). However, the decision about whom to treat is complex and depends on the estimated probability of life-threatening VTs and the severity of underlying heart disorders (1) (see table Indications for Implantable Cardioverter- Defibrillators). Long-term treatment is not required when the index episode of ventricular tachycardia resulted from a transient cause (eg, during the 48 hours after onset of myocardial infarction) or a reversible cause (acid- base disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, proarrhythmic medication effect). 6/8 In the absence of a transient or reversible cause, patients who have had an episode of sustained VT typically require an ICD (1). Most patients with sustained VT
