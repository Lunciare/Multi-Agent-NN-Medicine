Ventricular Tachycardia

patients tolerate ventricular tachycardia surprisingly well, it is a mistake to conclude that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin. Broad QRS Ventricular Tachycardia The QRS duration is 160 millisecond. An independent P wave can be seen in II (arrows). There is a leftward mean frontal axis shift. Treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia Acute: Sometimes synchronized direct current cardioversion, sometimes class I or class III antiarrhythmics Long-term: Usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Acute Treatment of acute ventricular tachycardia depends on symptoms and duration of VT. Pulseless VT requires defibrillation beginning with biphasic 120 to 200 joules (or monophasic 360 joules). Stable sustained VT can be treated with synchronized direct current cardioversion with ≥100 joules using conscious sedation or transient general anesthesia. Stable sustained VT can be treated with intravenous class I or class III antiarrhythmics (1) (see table Antiarrhythmic Medications). Lidocaine acts quickly but is frequently ineffective. If lidocaine is ineffective, IV procainamide may be given, but it may take up to 1 hour to work. IV amiodarone is frequently used but does not usually work quickly. Failure of IV procainamide or IV amiodarone is an indication for cardioversion. Right and left ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardias (RVOT-VT
