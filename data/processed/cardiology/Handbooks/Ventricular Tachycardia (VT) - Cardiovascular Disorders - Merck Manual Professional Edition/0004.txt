Ventricular Tachycardia

symptomatic, causing palpitations, symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, or sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is by ECG (see figure Broad QRS Ventricular Tachycardia). Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) should be considered VT until proved otherwise. Pearls & Pitfalls Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) should be considered VT until proved otherwise. Diagnosis is supported by ECG findings of Dissociated P-wave activity Fusion beats (a conducted sinus beat fusing with a ventricular beat creating a QRS complex with morphology, duration, and axis in-between those of normally conducted beats and those of the wide QRS complex ventricular beats) Capture beats (normally conducted sinus beat interrupting a wide-complex tachycardia) Uniformity of QRS vectors in the V leads (concordance) with discordant T-wave vector (opposite QRS vector) A frontal-plane QRS axis in the northwest quadrant Differential diagnosis includes fast supraventricular rhythms conducted with bundle branch block or via an accessory pathway (see figure Modified Brugada Criteria for Ventricular Tachycardia) (1). Because some patients tolerate VT surprisingly well, concluding that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin is a mistake. Using medications appropriate for supraventricular tachycardia (eg, verapamil,
