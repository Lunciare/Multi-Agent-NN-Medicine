Ventricular Tachycardia

particularly successful in patients who have VT with well-defined syndromes (eg, right or left ventricular outflow tract VT, verapamil-sensitive left fascicular VT, or bundle branch reentrant VT (1). Key Points Any wide-complex (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) tachycardia should be considered ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proved otherwise. Patients who do not have a pulse should be cardioverted. Synchronized cardioversion or antiarrhythmic medications may be tried if the patient is stable. Patients who had an episode of sustained VT without a transient or reversible cause typically require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
