Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute. Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Treatment of more than brief episodes is with cardioversion or antiarrhythmics, depending on symptoms. If necessary, long- term treatment is with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Some experts use a cutoff rate of ≥ 100 beats/minute for ventricular tachycardia (VT).
