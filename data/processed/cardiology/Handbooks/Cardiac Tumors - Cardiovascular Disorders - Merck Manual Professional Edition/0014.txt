tumors depends on tumor origin. It may include systemic chemotherapy or palliation. Key Points Most cardiac tumors are metastatic, most commonly from lung and breast carcinoma, melanoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and renal carcinoma. Primary cardiac tumors are much less common; most originate in the myocardium or endocardium, but they can develop in any cardiac tissue and be benign or malignant. Manifestations depend on the location and type of tumor but include constitutional symptoms, valvular or inflow-outflow tract obstruction, thromboembolism, and arrhythmias. Diagnosis is by echocardiography, and frequently other cardiac imaging (eg, MRI, CT, PET). For benign tumors, treatment is excision; for malignant primary and most metastatic tumors, treatment is palliative.
