which can alter hemodynamics and physical forces associated with the tumor. Symptoms and signs by tumor type Myxomas may manifest with the triad of heart failure, embolic disease, and constitutional symptoms. Myxomas may cause a diastolic murmur that mimics the murmur of mitral stenosis but whose loudness and location vary from beat to beat with body position. About 15% of pedunculated left atrial myxomas produce an audible “tumor plop” as they drop into the mitral orifice during diastole (1). Myxomas may also cause arrhythmias. Raynaud syndrome and finger clubbing are less typical but may occur. Fibroelastomas, often discovered incidentally at autopsy, are usually asymptomatic; however, they may be a source of systemic emboli. Rhabdomyomas are usually asymptomatic. Fibromas cause arrhythmias, possibly causing sudden death, and obstructive symptoms. Hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic but may cause any of the extracardiac, intramyocardial, or intracavitary symptoms. Teratomas cause respiratory distress and cyanosis due to compression of the aortic and pulmonary artery, or SVC syndrome due to compression of the superior vena cava. Symptoms and signs of malignant cardiac tumors are more acute in onset and progress more rapidly than those of benign tumors. Cardiac sarcomas most commonly cause symptoms of ventricular inflow tract obstruction
