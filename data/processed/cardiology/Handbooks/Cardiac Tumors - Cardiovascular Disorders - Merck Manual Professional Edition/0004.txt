located intramurally in the septum or free wall of the left ventricle, where they affect the cardiac conduction system. They are firm, white lobules that typically regress with age. A minority of patients develop tachyarrhythmias and heart failure due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Fibromas occur mainly in children and are associated with adenoma sebaceum of the skin and kidney tumors. They occur primarily on the left side of the heart, are often located within the ventricular myocardium, and may develop in response to inflammation. They can compress or invade the cardiac conduction system, causing arrhythmias and sudden death. Some fibromas occur as part of a syndrome with generalized body overgrowth, jaw keratocytes, skeletal abnormalities, and various benign and malignant tumors (Gorlin, or basal cell nevus syndrome). Hemangiomas cause symptoms in a minority of patients. Most often, they are incidentally detected during examinations done for other reasons. 2/10 Teratomas of the pericardium affect mainly infants and children. They are often attached to the base of the great vessels. Most are located in the anterior mediastinum; the rest, mainly in the posterior mediastinum. Lipomas can develop at a wide range of ages. They originate in the endocardium or epicardium and
