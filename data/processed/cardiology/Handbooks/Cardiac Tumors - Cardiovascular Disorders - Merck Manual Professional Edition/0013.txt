Cardiac Tumors

of 96% at 1 year, 83% at 5 years, and 75% at 10 years [2]). Exceptions are rhabdomyomas, most of which regress spontaneously and do not require treatment, and pericardial teratoma, which may require urgent pericardiocentesis. Patients with fibroelastoma may also require valvular repair or replacement. When rhabdomyomas or fibromas are multifocal, surgical excision is usually ineffective, and prognosis is poor after the first year of life; survival at 5 years may be very low. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy are seldom indicated for benign primary cardiac tumors. In carefully selected patients, heart transplantation may be considered if the tumor is considered unresectable (3). Reports have also highlighted the feasibility of autotransplantation (a procedure that involves explantation of the heart, tumor resection, heart reconstruction, and reimplantation of the reconstructed heart) in carefully selected patients with complex tumors (ie, not easily excised in situ) and in experienced centers (4). Treatment of malignant primary tumors is usually palliative (eg, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, management of complications) because prognosis is poor. Treatment of metastatic cardiac tumors depends on tumor origin. It may include systemic chemotherapy or palliation. Key Points Most cardiac tumors are metastatic, most commonly from lung and breast carcinoma, melanoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and
