of recurrent cardiac myxomas with some combination of cutaneous myxomas, myxoid mammary fibroadenomas, pigmented skin lesions (lentigines, ephelides, blue nevi), multiple endocrine neoplasia (primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease causing Cushing syndrome, growth hormone and prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma, testicular tumors, thyroid adenoma or carcinoma, and ovarian cysts), psammomatous melanotic schwannoma, breast ductal adenoma, and osteochondromyxoma. Patients are often young at presentation (median age, 20 years), have multiple myxomas (particularly in the ventricles), and have a higher risk of myxoma recurrence. Papillary fibroelastomas are avascular papillomas that occur on heart valves in approximately 80% of cases (4). The papillomas are more likely to occur on the left side of the heart, predominantly on the aortic and mitral valves. Males and females are affected equally. They have papillary fronds branching from a central core, resembling sea anemones. Most are pedunculated. They do not cause valvular dysfunction but increase the risk of embolism. Rhabdomyomas affect mainly infants and children, up to 90% of whom also have tuberous sclerosis (5). Rhabdomyomas are usually multiple and located intramurally in the septum or free wall of the left ventricle, where they affect the cardiac conduction system. They are firm, white lobules that typically regress with age. A
