Cardiac Tumors

signs of malignant cardiac tumors are more acute in onset and progress more rapidly than those of benign tumors. Cardiac sarcomas most commonly cause symptoms of ventricular inflow tract obstruction and cardiac tamponade. Mesothelioma causes symptoms of pericarditis or tamponade. Primary lymphoma causes refractory progressive heart failure, tamponade, arrhythmias, and SVC syndrome. Metastatic cardiac tumors may manifest as sudden cardiac enlargement, tamponade (due to rapid accumulation of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion), heart block, other arrhythmias, or sudden unexplained heart failure. Fever, malaise, weight loss, night sweats, and loss of appetite may also be present. Diagnosis of Cardiac Tumors Echocardiography Cardiac MRI Cardiac CT 6/10 PET scan Biopsy Diagnosis, which is often delayed because symptoms and signs mimic those of much more common disorders, is confirmed by echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography is better for visualizing atrial tumors, and transthoracic echocardiography is better for ventricular tumors. Due to its superior temporal resolution, echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice in visualizing very mobile cardiac tumors, particularly when they are small. Other imaging modalities are also used to further characterize the tumor (1, 2). Atrial Myxoma (Echocardiogram) Cardiac MRI is the imaging modality of choice for tumor tissue characterization and provides the best clues to
