also used to further characterize the tumor (1, 2). Atrial Myxoma (Echocardiogram) Cardiac MRI is the imaging modality of choice for tumor tissue characterization and provides the best clues to tumor types. 7/10 Atrial Myxoma (Cardiac MRI Scan) Contrast-enhanced cardiac CT with its 3D acquisition and superior spatial resolution can provide more detailed anatomic information compared to other techniques. Positron emission tomography (PET) may provide the first evidence suggesting cardiac metastasis in patients with extracardiac malignant tumors. However, PET may not be able to discriminate between physiologic and pathologic uptake in cardiac tissues and cannot provide tissue characterization of the tumor as well as MRI or CT do. Biopsy is not usually done because imaging studies can often distinguish benign from malignant tumors, and biopsy may inadvertently spread cancerous cells in patients with a malignant primary tumor. In carefully selected patients, an echocardiography-guided percutaneous transcatheter biopsy can be done without the need for open heart surgery and provides information that affects management (3). Extensive testing often precedes echocardiography in patients with myxomas because their symptoms are nonspecific. Anemia; thrombocytopenia; and elevation of white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and gamma-globulins are common. ECG may show left atrial
