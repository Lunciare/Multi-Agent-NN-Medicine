Cardiac Tumors

clinically silent and detected incidentally. When Kaposi sarcoma spreads systemically in patients with immunodeficiency (usually patients with HIV), it may spread to the heart, but clinical cardiac complications are uncommon. TABLE Types of Cardiac Tumors 3/10 Type Examples* Myxomas Papillary fibroelastomas Rhabdomyomas Fibromas Benign primary tumors Hemangiomas Teratomas Lipomas Paraganglionomas† Pericardial cysts Sarcomas Malignant primary tumors Pericardial mesothelioma Primary lymphomas Lung carcinoma Breast carcinoma Soft-tissue sarcoma Metastatic tumors Renal carcinoma Melanoma Leukemia Lymphoma * Listed from most common to least common. † Paragangliomas can also be malignant. Symptoms and Signs of Cardiac Tumors Cardiac tumors cause symptoms and signs typical of much more common disorders (eg, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease). Symptoms and signs of benign primary cardiac tumors depend on tumor type, location, size, and friability. Types of symptoms and signs Symptoms can be classified as Extracardiac Intramyocardial Intracavitary Extracardiac symptoms and signs may be constitutional or mechanical. Constitutional symptoms of fever, chills, lethargy, arthralgias, and weight loss may be caused by myxomas, perhaps as a result of cytokine (eg, interleukin-6) release; however, constitutional symptoms are often absent with myxomas (1). Petechiae and Raynaud syndrome may also occur. These and other findings may erroneously suggest bacterial endocarditis, systemic
