Cardiac Tumors

right ventricular inflow tract obstruction, cardiac tamponade , and lung metastasis (6). Other types include undifferentiated sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and osteosarcoma; these types are more likely to originate in the left atrium, causing mitral valve obstruction and heart failure. Pericardial mesothelioma is rare. It affects all ages, males more than females (7). It causes cardiac tamponade and constriction, and can metastasize to the spine, adjacent soft tissues, and brain. Primary lymphoma is extremely rare. It usually occurs in patients with HIV or other people with immunodeficiency. These tumors grow rapidly and cause heart failure, arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Metastatic tumors Metastatic tumor from other organs can involve the heart through hematogenous spread or direct invasion. Melanoma is a tumor with a high propensity for cardiac involvement. Lung and breast carcinoma, soft- tissue sarcoma, and renal cancer are also common sources of metastases to the heart (8, 9). Leukemia and lymphoma often metastasize to the heart, but cardiac involvement may be clinically silent and detected incidentally. When Kaposi sarcoma spreads systemically in patients with immunodeficiency (usually patients with HIV), it may spread to the heart, but clinical cardiac complications are uncommon.
