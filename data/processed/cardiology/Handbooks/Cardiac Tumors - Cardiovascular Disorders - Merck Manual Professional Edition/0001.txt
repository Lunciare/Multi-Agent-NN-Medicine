Cardiac tumors may be primary (benign or malignant) or metastatic (malignant). Myxoma, a benign tumor, is the most common type of primary cardiac tumor. Cardiac tumors may occur in any cardiac tissue. They can cause valvular or inflow-outflow tract obstruction, thromboembolism, arrhythmias, or pericardial disorders. Diagnosis is by echocardiography and frequently cardiac MRI. Treatment of benign tumors is usually surgical resection; tumors may recur. Treatment of metastatic cancer depends on tumor type and origin; prognosis is generally poor. Primary cardiac tumors are found in < 1/5000 people at autopsy (1). Metastatic tumors are much more common, occurring in one series in > 8% of patients with cancer (2). Usually, primary cardiac tumors originate in the myocardium or endocardium; they may also originate in valve tissue, cardiac connective tissue, or the pericardium. Metastatic cardiac tumors typically originate from the lung. Other common sources of cardiac metastases include breast and kidney carcinoma, melanoma, and lymphoma (2, 3). Classification of Cardiac Tumors Some of the more common primary and secondary cardiac tumors are listed in table Types of Cardiac Tumors. Primary cardiac tumors may be Benign (approximately 80% of cases [1]) 1/10 Malignant (the remaining approximately 20%) Benign primary cardiac tumors Examples are
