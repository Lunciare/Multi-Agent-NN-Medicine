listed in table Types of Cardiac Tumors. Primary cardiac tumors may be Benign (approximately 80% of cases [1]) 1/10 Malignant (the remaining approximately 20%) Benign primary cardiac tumors Examples are myxomas, papillary fibroelastomas, rhabdomyomas, fibromas, hemangiomas, teratomas, lipomas, paragangliomas, and pericardial cysts. Myxoma is most common, accounting for 40 to 60% of all primary cardiac tumors (2). Incidence in females is 2 to 3 times that in males (3). In uncommon familial forms (Carney complex), males are affected more often. Most myxomas occur in the left atrium (2), and the rest occur in the other chambers as a solitary tumor or, less commonly, at several sites. Myxomas may be up to 15 cm in diameter. Most are pedunculated and may prolapse through the mitral valve and obstruct ventricular filling during diastole. The remainder of the tumors are broad-based and sessile. Myxomas may be myxoid and gelatinous; smooth, firm, and lobular; or friable and irregular. Friable, irregular myxomas increase risk of systemic embolism. Carney complex is a familial, autosomal dominant syndrome of recurrent cardiac myxomas with some combination of cutaneous myxomas, myxoid mammary fibroadenomas, pigmented skin lesions (lentigines, ephelides, blue nevi), multiple endocrine neoplasia (primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease causing Cushing
