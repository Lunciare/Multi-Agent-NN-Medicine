Cardiac Tumors

with myxomas because their symptoms are nonspecific. Anemia; thrombocytopenia; and elevation of white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and gamma-globulins are common. ECG may show left atrial enlargement. Routine chest radiographs may show calcium deposits in right atrial myxomas or in teratomas seen as anterior mediastinal masses. Myxomas are sometimes diagnosed when tumor cells are found in a surgically removed embolus. Arrhythmias and heart failure in patients with features of tuberous sclerosis suggest rhabdomyomas or fibromas. New cardiac symptoms and signs in a patient with a known extracardiac cancer suggest cardiac metastases. Chest radiographs may show bizarre changes in the cardiac silhouette. Treatment of Cardiac Tumors Benign primary: Excision Malignant primary: Palliation Metastatic: Depends on tumor origin Treatment can involve excision, palliation, and/or other measures (1). Treatment of benign primary tumors is surgical excision followed by serial echocardiography over 5 to 6 years to monitor for recurrence. Tumors are excised unless another disorder (eg, dementia) contraindicates surgery. Surgery is usually curative (eg, in one series, survival rates of 96% at 1 year, 83% at 5 years, and 75% at 10 years [2]). Exceptions are rhabdomyomas, most of which regress spontaneously and do not require treatment, and pericardial
