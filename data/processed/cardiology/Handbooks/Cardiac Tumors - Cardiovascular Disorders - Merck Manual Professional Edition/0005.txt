Cardiac Tumors

are located in the anterior mediastinum; the rest, mainly in the posterior mediastinum. Lipomas can develop at a wide range of ages. They originate in the endocardium or epicardium and have a large pedunculated base. Many are asymptomatic, but some obstruct flow or cause arrhythmias. Paragangliomas, including pheochromocytomas, rarely occur in the heart; when they do, they are usually localized to the base of the heart near vagus nerve endings. They may manifest with symptoms due to catecholamine secretion (eg, increased heart rate and blood pressure, excessive sweating, tremor). Paragangliomas may be benign or malignant. Pericardial cysts may resemble a cardiac tumor or pericardial effusion on chest radiograph. They are usually asymptomatic, although some cause compressive symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, cough). Malignant primary cardiac tumors Malignant primary tumors include sarcomas, pericardial mesothelioma, and primary lymphomas. Sarcoma is the most common malignant cardiac tumor (1). Sarcomas affect mainly middle-aged adults (mean, 44 years). Almost 40% are angiosarcomas, most of which originate in the right atrium and involve the pericardium, causing right ventricular inflow tract obstruction, cardiac tamponade , and lung metastasis (6). Other types include undifferentiated sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and osteosarcoma; these types are more
