in sites of active inflammation (eg, in acute inflammatory cardiomyopathy); and I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine, a neurotransmitter analog taken up and stored in neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and used in research to evaluate heart failure, diabetes, pheochromocytoma, certain arrhythmias, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. TABLE Technetium-99m (Tc-99) Myocardial Perfusion Markers Marker Characteristics Tc-99m sestamibi Myocardial uptake is slower than that with thallium, but there is little myocardial washout, allowing timing flexibility; patients with acute symptoms can be injected with sestamibi immediately and imaged several hours later. Uptake depends more on blood flow than on viable myocardium; viable regions with low blood flow may be misclassified as scar. Studies may be done on a single or on separate days, with a low initial dose during stress followed by a much higher dose at rest. With electrocardiography (ECG)-gated imaging, ventricular wall motion, wall 4/7 Marker Characteristics thickening, and ejection fraction can be estimated. Characteristics are similar to those of Tc-99m tetrofosmin sestamibi. First-pass extraction from the myocardium is high, with rapid washout; half of peak myocardial activity is gone by 10 minutes. Because of its rapid dynamics, use with treadmill exercise is difficult. Tc-99m teboroxime Studies suggest that stress-redistribution testing may be
