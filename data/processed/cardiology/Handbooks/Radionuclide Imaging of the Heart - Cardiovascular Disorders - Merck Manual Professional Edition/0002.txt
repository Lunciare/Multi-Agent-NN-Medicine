Radionuclide Imaging of the Heart

viable myocardium can be quantified, helping determine prognosis. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging In myocardial perfusion imaging, IV radionuclides are taken up by cardiac tissues in rough proportion to perfusion; thus, areas of decreased uptake represent areas of relative or absolute ischemia. Attenuation of myocardial activity by overlying soft tissue may cause false-positive results. Attenuation by breast tissue in women is especially common. Attenuation by the diaphragm and abdominal contents may produce spurious inferior wall defects in both sexes but is more common among men. 99m Attenuation is more likely with technetium-99m ( Tc) than with radioactive thallium 201 (Tl-201). Indications Myocardial perfusion imaging is used with stress testing to Evaluate patients with chest pain of uncertain origin Determine the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis seen on angiography Determine the functional significance of collateral vessels seen on angiography Evaluate the success of reperfusion interventions (eg, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], percutaneous intervention, thrombolysis) Estimate prognosis after myocardial infarction Nuclear Medicine Stress Test IMAGE LIVING ART ENTERPRISES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY After acute myocardial infarction, myocardial perfusion imaging can help estimate prognosis because it can show extent of the perfusion abnormality due to acute myocardial infarction, extent of scarring due to previous infarcts, and
