Radionuclide Imaging of the Heart

Radionuclide imaging uses a special detector (gamma camera) to create an image following injection of radioactive material. This test is done to evaluate Cardiac valvular disorders Cardiomyopathy Congenital cardiac disorders Coronary artery disease (CAD) Other cardiac disorders Radionuclide imaging can expose patients to similar amounts of radiation than do comparable computed tomography (CT) studies. However, because the radioactive material is retained in the patient briefly, sophisticated radiation alarms (eg, in airports) may be triggered by the patient for several days after such testing Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Planar techniques, which produce a 2-dimensional image, are rarely used; SPECT, which uses a rotating camera system and tomographic reconstruction to produce a 3-dimensional image, is more common in the United States. With multihead SPECT systems, imaging can often be completed in ≤ 10 minutes. Visual comparison of stress and delayed images can be supplemented by quantitative displays. With SPECT, the following can be identified: Inferior and posterior abnormalities Small areas of infarction Vessels responsible for infarction The mass of infarcted and viable myocardium can be quantified, helping determine prognosis. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging In myocardial perfusion imaging, IV radionuclides are taken up by cardiac tissues in rough proportion to perfusion; thus, areas
