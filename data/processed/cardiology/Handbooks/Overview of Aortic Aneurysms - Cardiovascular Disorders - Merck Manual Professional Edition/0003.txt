layer containing the nutrients for the media Aneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries defined as a ≥ 50% increase in arterial diameter compared with normal segments. They are caused by weakening of the arterial wall, specifically, the media. True aneurysms involve all 3 layers of the artery (intima, media, and adventitia). Aneurysmal disease can extend along the aorta with time. A pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) is a communication between the arterial lumen and overlying connective tissue resulting from arterial rupture; a blood-filled cavity forms outside the vessel wall and seals the leak as it thromboses. Aneurysms are classified as Fusiform: Circumferential widening of the artery Saccular: Localized, typically asymmetric, outpouchings of the artery wall Layered (laminated) thrombus may line the walls of either type as the result of alterations in blood flow within the aneurysmal segment. Aneurysms may occur in any artery. The most common and significant are those involving the aorta (1). Abdominal aortic aneurysms Thoracic aortic aneurysms Aneurysms of the major aortic branches (subclavian and splanchnic arteries) are much less common. Aneurysms of peripheral arteries and the cerebrovascular system (causing stroke) are discussed elsewhere.
