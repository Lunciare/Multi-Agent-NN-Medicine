(thoracic aorta) and abdomen (abdominal aorta). The abdominal aorta ends by dividing into the right and left common iliac arteries. Radiographic Images of Aneurysms CTA (Coronal View) of Thorax Showing Ascending Thoracic Aorta This image shows the ascending thoracic aorta (red arrow) arising from the left ventricle (blue arrow). CTA (Coronal View) of Abdomen Showing Abdominal Aorta This image shows the abdominal aorta (red arrow) dividing into the right (blue arrow) and left (green arrow) common iliac arteries. CT of Thorax Showing Anatomy of Aorta and Pulmonary Artery This image shows the ascending thoracic aorta (red arrow) with descending thoracic aorta (blue arrow). The main pulmonary artery (green arrow) divides into the right (purple arrow) and left (yellow arrow) pulmonary artery. Endovascular Stent Graft The white arrow shows an endovascular stent graft within an abdominal aneurysm (red arrow). The wall of the aorta is composed of 3 layers: Intima: A thin layer lined with endothelium Media: A thick layer of elastic fibers arranged in spiral formation Adventitia: A thin fibrous layer containing the nutrients for the media Aneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries defined as a ≥ 50% increase in arterial diameter compared with normal segments. They are caused by
