Overview of Aortic Aneurysms

Aneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries caused by weakening of the arterial wall. Common causes include hypertension, atherosclerosis, infection, trauma, systemic rheumatic diseases, and connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Aneurysms are usually asymptomatic but can cause pain and lead to ischemia, thromboembolism, spontaneous dissection, and rupture, which may be fatal. Diagnosis is by imaging tests (eg, ultrasound, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, aortography). Unruptured aneurysms may be treated with medical management or repaired, depending on symptoms and the size and location of the aneurysm. Medical management includes risk factor modification (eg, strict blood pressure control) plus scheduled surveillance imaging. Repair can be done with either an open surgical or endovascular approach. Treatment of ruptured aneurysms is immediate repair. The aorta originates at the left ventricle above the aortic valve, travels upward (ascending thoracic aorta) to the first branch of the aorta (brachiocephalic or innominate artery), arches up and behind the heart (aortic arch), then turns downward distal to the left subclavian artery (descending aorta) through the thorax (thoracic aorta) and abdomen (abdominal aorta). The abdominal aorta ends by dividing into the right and left common iliac arteries. Radiographic Images of Aneurysms CTA (Coronal View) of Thorax Showing
