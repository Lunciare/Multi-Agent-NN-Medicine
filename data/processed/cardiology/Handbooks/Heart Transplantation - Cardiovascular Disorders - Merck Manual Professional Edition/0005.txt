TABLE Manifestations of Heart Transplant Rejection by Category* Rejection Category Manifestations Hyperacute Cardiogenic shock Accelerated Atrial arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock Acute Heart failure, atrial arrhythmia Dyspnea during exertion, low stress Chronic tolerance * Most patients with heart transplant rejection are asymptomatic. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy The main long-term complication of heart transplantation is cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a form of atherosclerosis that diffusely narrows or obliterates vessel lumina. Approximately 30% of adult heart transplant patients develop some degree of cardiac allograft vasculopathy within 5 years of transplantation (2). Its cause is probably multifactorial and relates to donor age, cold and reperfusion 3/5 ischemia, dyslipidemia, immunosuppressants, chronic rejection, and viral infection (adenovirus in children, cytomegalovirus in adults). For early detection, surveillance stress testing or coronary angiography with or without intravascular ultrasound is often done at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. Treatment is aggressive lipid lowering with statins and control of hypertension with calcium channel blockers or other agents (2). Prognosis for Heart Transplantation Survival rates at 1 year after heart transplantation are estimated at approximately 90%; they are approximately 80% at 5 years (1). Within 1 year, death most often results from acute rejection or infection; after 1 year, death most often results
