Heart Transplantation

after these devices were implanted. Procedure for Heart Transplantation Donor hearts are preserved by hypothermic storage. They must be transplanted within 4 to 6 hours. Ex situ heart perfusion, an in vitro pump system that perfuses the explanted donor heart with the goal of improving graft survival, and potentially prolonging transplant viability > 4 to 6 hours is in early use and development (1). These systems have also allowed the use of cardiac grafts retrieved from donors after cardiac arrest. The recipient is placed on a bypass pump, and the recipient's heart is removed, preserving the posterior right atrial wall in situ. The donor heart is then transplanted orthotopically (in its normal position) with aortic, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein anastomoses; a single anastomosis joins the retained posterior atrial wall to that of the donor organ. Immunosuppressive regimens vary but usually include anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies, a calcineurin inhibitor, and glucocorticoids (see table Immunosuppressants Used to Treat Transplant Rejection). Rejection Incidence of acute rejection peaks at 1 month, decreases over the next 5 months, and levels off by 1 year. Approximately 15% of adult heart transplant recipients have an episode of rejection within the first year after transplant (1). Many
