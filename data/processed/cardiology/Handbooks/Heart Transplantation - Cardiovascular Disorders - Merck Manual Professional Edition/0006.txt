at approximately 90%; they are approximately 80% at 5 years (1). Within 1 year, death most often results from acute rejection or infection; after 1 year, death most often results from cardiac allograft vasculopathy or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Functional status of heart transplant recipients alive at > 1 year is excellent; exercise capacity remains below normal but is sufficient for daily activities and may increase over time with sympathetic reinnervation. More than 90% of patients reach New York Heart Association class I cardiac status, and the majority return to employment by 1 year after transplant (2, 3).
