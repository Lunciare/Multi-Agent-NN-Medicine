the next 5 months, and levels off by 1 year. Approximately 15% of adult heart transplant recipients have an episode of rejection within the first year after transplant (1). Many patients are asymptomatic, but some develop left ventricle dysfunction or atrial arrhythmias. Because graft damage can be irreversible and catastrophic, surveillance endomyocardial biopsy is usually done once per year; degree and distribution of mononuclear cell infiltrate and presence of myocyte injury in specimens are determined. Differential diagnosis includes perioperative ischemia, cytomegalovirus infection, and idiopathic B-cell infiltration (Quilty lesions). Clinical manifestations of rejection can be classified according to onset, duration (see table Manifestations of Heart Transplant Rejection by Category). Histologic classification of rejection is graded from 1 to 4. Mild rejection (grade 1) without detectable clinical sequelae requires no treatment; moderate or severe rejection (grades 2 to 4) or mild rejection with clinical sequelae is treated with glucocorticoid pulses (eg, methylprednisolone) and antithymocyte globulin as needed. The grading scale for rejection reflects progressive degrees of abnormality on histologic examination of biopsy specimens.
