All donated hearts come from brain-dead donors, who are usually required to be < 70 years and have normal cardiac and pulmonary function and no history of coronary artery disease or other heart disorders. Donor and recipient must have compatible ABO blood type and heart size. Pretransplant waitlist mortality was 8.5 deaths per 100 person-years in the United States in 2023 (2). (See also Overview of Transplantation.) Bridge and destination ventricular assist devices (VADs) Left ventricular assist devices and artificial hearts provide interim hemodynamic support for patients waiting for a transplant (bridge-to-transplantation). In addition, ventricular assist devices are used to treat some patients who are not candidates for transplantation (destination therapy). Infection, which may originate at the skin insertion site of the drive lines, is a concern. Other risks include right heart failure (acute or chronic), sepsis, device failure, and thromboembolism. Despite the risks, there are patients who have survived and have been well for several years after these devices were implanted. Procedure for Heart Transplantation Donor hearts are preserved by hypothermic storage. They must be transplanted within 4 to 6 hours. Ex situ heart perfusion, an
