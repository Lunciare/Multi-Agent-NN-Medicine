electrical impulses that kill cardiac myocytes in a non-thermal method. The electrical current causes pores to develop in the cell membrane, destroying the cell. Myocytes are more sensitive to this stimulus than many other cells so collateral structures may experience less damage. This ablation technique is sufficiently painful that general anesthesia is required. Before energy can be applied, the target site or sites must be identified during an electrophysiologic study. Success rate is > 90% for reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (via the atrioventricular [AV] node or an accessory pathway), focal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter, and focal idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT—right ventricular outflow tract, left septal, or bundle branch reentrant VT) (2, 3). 1/2 Because atrial fibrillation (AF) often originates in or is maintained by an arrhythmogenic site in the pulmonary veins, this source can be electrically isolated by ablations at the pulmonary vein–left atrial junction or in the left atrium. Alternatively, in patients with refractory AF and rapid ventricular rates, the AV node may be ablated after permanent pacemaker implantation. Ablation is sometimes successful in patients with VT refractory to medications, particularly when ischemic heart disease is present. Transcatheter ablation is safe. Major complications include vascular damage, valvular damage, pulmonary
