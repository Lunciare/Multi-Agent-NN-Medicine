The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used. If a tachyarrhythmia depends on a specific pathway or ectopic site of automaticity, the site can be purposefully destroyed (ablated) to effect a cure (1). Methods of ablation include Radiofrequency ablation Cryoablation Laser ablation Pulsed electric field ablation Radiofrequency ablation is usually accomplished using transvenous catheter supplied low-voltage, high-frequency (300 to 750 MHz) electrical radiofrequency (RF) energy. This energy heats and necroses an area < 1 cm in diameter and up to 1 cm deep. Cryoablation uses tissue freezing (to -70° C) to effect tissue destruction. Other delivery systems have been developed for intraoperative use. Laser energy can be delivered using a transvenous catheter to ablate a target area. Pulsed electrical field ablation uses a train of high voltage, short duration electrical impulses that kill cardiac myocytes in a non-thermal method. The electrical current causes pores to develop in the cell membrane, destroying the cell. Myocytes are more sensitive to this
