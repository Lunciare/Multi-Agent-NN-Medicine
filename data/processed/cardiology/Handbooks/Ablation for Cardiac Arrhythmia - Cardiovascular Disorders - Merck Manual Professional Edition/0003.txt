Ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition
KEYWORDS: ablation, electrical, atrial, ablations, damage, cell, pulmonary, energy, site, cardiac, myocytes, ventricular, tachycardia, radiofrequency, refractory

Ablation is sometimes successful in patients with VT refractory to medications, particularly when ischemic heart disease is present. Transcatheter ablation is safe. Major complications include vascular damage, valvular damage, pulmonary vein stenosis or occlusion (if used to treat atrial fibrillation), stroke or other embolism, cardiac perforation, tamponade, and unintended AV node ablation. Major complication rates range from 0.5 to 1% in straightforward supraventricular ablations to approximately 5% in complex VT ablations (4, 5). Mortality rates range from 0.02 to 0.04% in straightforward supraventricular ablations to 0.5% in complex ventricular tachycardia ablations (4, 5).
