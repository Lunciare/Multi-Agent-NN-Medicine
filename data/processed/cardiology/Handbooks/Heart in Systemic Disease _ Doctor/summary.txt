A wide variety of systemic diseases may affect the heart by a number of different mechanisms, including increasing demands on the heart, causing arrhythmias, af- fecting the structure of the heart or promoting cardiovascular disease and therefore coronary heart disease. Common cardiac associations with systemic disease include: Endocrine and metabolic: Diabetes mellitus: coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure. Hyperthyroidism: supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension. Hypothyroidism: bradycardia, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pericar- dial effusion.
