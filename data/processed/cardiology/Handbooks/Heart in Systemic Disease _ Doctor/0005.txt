Heart in systemic disease
KEYWORDS: heart, disease, failure, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, aortic, cause, syndrome, effusion, cardiac, coronary, including, systemic, pericardial, acute

effusion can further constrict the heart and cause cardiac tamponade. Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is discussed much more fully in the separate Cardiomyopathies article. They may be primary or due to other disease. Many systemic diseases may cause cardiomyopathy, including: Sarcoidosis. Metabolic: diabetes, amyloidosis, Wilson's disease, haemochromatosis, glyco- gen storage diseases. Drugs and poisons: Around 7 or 8 units of alcohol (>80g) a day for at least five years are required to develop cardiomyopathy.[5] However, it is probably an underdiagnosed cause and may represent 30% of dilated cardiomyopathy. Women are sus- ceptible at a lower dose than men. High consumption of alcohol also leads to hypertension. Many other substances have been implicated. Examples include cocaine, amphetamines, chemotherapy for malignancy.[6] 5/9 Cardiomyopathy may occur in patients on long-term dialysis. Endocrine disease: acromegaly, phaeochromocytoma, diabetes mellitus (ma- ternal diabetes can also have an adverse effect on the developing fetal heart), [7] hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism. Connective tissue disorders: systemic sclerosis (may cause myocarditis or peri- cardial effusion), rheumatoid arthritis (can cause pericardial effusion, valvulitis and myocardial fibrosis), SLE (is associated with pericarditis, hypertension, an in- creased risk of coronary heart disease and Libman-Sacks endocarditis). Infections: acute viral infection (especially Coxsackie B), South American try- panosomiasis (Chagas'
