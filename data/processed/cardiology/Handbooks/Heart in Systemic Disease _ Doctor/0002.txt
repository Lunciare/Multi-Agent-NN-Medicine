KEYWORDS: heart, disease, failure, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, aortic, cause, syndrome, effusion, cardiac, coronary, including, systemic, pericardial, acute

pericardial effusion. Sarcoidosis: heart failure, dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, heart block. Marfan's syndrome: aortic aneurysm and dissection, aortic insufficiency, mi- tral valve prolapse. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: aortic and coronary aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse. HIV infection: myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion. Heart failure Heart failure may be caused or precipitated by any condition that puts a greater de- mand on the heart - eg, fever, severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis and pregnancy. Atherosclerosis Coronary arteries may be involved in Kawasaki disease and, very rarely, in late syphilis. The association between coronary heart disease and diabetes is as well known. It is also well known to be associated with abnormalities of lipid metabolism, in- cluding the metabolic syndrome.[1] There is also a strong relationship between coronary heart disease and rheuma- toid arthritis.[2] Hypertension Any cause of secondary hypertension, such as renal disease (eg, glomerulonephri- tis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic sclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, or polycystic kid- neys), or endocrine disease (eg, Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, phaeochro- 3/9 mocytoma, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism), may cause hypertensive heart dis- ease, which may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy. Lung disease Disease of the lungs can also lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including that
