Heart in systemic disease

A wide variety of systemic diseases may affect the heart by a number of different mechanisms, including increasing demands on the heart, causing arrhythmias, af- fecting the structure of the heart or promoting cardiovascular disease and therefore coronary heart disease. Common cardiac associations with systemic disease include: Endocrine and metabolic: Diabetes mellitus: coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure. Hyperthyroidism: supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension. Hypothyroidism: bradycardia, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pericar- dial effusion. Malignant carcinoid: tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease, right heart failure. Phaeochromocytoma: hypertension, tachycardia, congestive heart failure. Acromegaly: heart failure. Haemochromatosis: heart failure, arrhythmias, heart block. Anderson-Fabry disease: arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, heart failure. Nutrition: Malnutrition: dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure. Thiamine deficiency: high-output heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy. Hyperhomocysteinaemia: premature atherosclerosis. Obesity: cardiomyopathy, heart failure. Multisystem diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, coronary arteritis, my- ocarditis, valvulitis. 2/9 Seronegative arthropathies: aortitis, aortic and mitral insufficiency, conduc- tion abnormalities. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): pericarditis, Libman-Sacks endocardi- tis, myocarditis, thrombosis (arterial and venous). Amyloidosis: heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular regurgitation, pericardial effusion. Sarcoidosis: heart failure, dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, heart block. Marfan's syndrome: aortic aneurysm and dissection, aortic insufficiency, mi- tral valve prolapse. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: aortic and coronary
