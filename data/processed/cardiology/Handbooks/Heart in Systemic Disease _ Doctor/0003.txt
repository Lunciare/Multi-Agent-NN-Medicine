ease, which may lead to left ventricular hypertrophy. Lung disease Disease of the lungs can also lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and strain. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including that due to the gen- eral disease of cystic fibrosis. Recurrent pulmonary embolism. Primary pulmonary hypertension. Rheumatic fever Rheumatic fever is now very uncommon in Western Europe, although it is still seen in other parts of the world, especially Africa.[3] Rheumatic fever may cause disease of the mitral valve and/or the aortic valve. This is usually mitral stenosis or aortic stenosis but mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation may occur alone or in combination. Acute rheumatic fever is also associated with myocarditis, which can be severe. A soft, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur, called the Carey Coombs' murmur, may be heard during active disease. Severe disease is associated with a greater risk of recurrence. Other causes of valvular heart disease As rheumatic fever appears to be confined to history, at least in the UK, other causes of disease of heart valves take importance. Many are congenital heart disease. Ankylosing spondylitis may be associated with aortic regurgitation. Incompetent valves, including mitral valve prolapse may occur with a number of the hypermobility syndromes, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
