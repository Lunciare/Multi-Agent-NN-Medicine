Heart in systemic disease

are congenital heart disease. Ankylosing spondylitis may be associated with aortic regurgitation. Incompetent valves, including mitral valve prolapse may occur with a number of the hypermobility syndromes, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan's syn- drome, Down's syndrome and joint hypermobility syndrome. Marfan's syndrome may cause aortic regurgitation and even aortic aneurysm at the root. 4/9 Another cause of aneurysm of the proximal aorta with aortic regurgitation is ter- tiary syphilis. Heart valves may be affected in many systemic autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, the systemic vasculitides and scleroderma.[4] Any damage or abnormality of the heart or valves makes them susceptible to suba- cute bacterial endocarditis. Acute bacterial endocarditis can occur when drug ad- dicts inject themselves with heavily infected material. Pericardial disease See the separate Acute Pericarditis, Chronic Pericarditis and Pericardial Effusion articles. These are often associated with systemic disease and they are often in- flammatory diseases or infections. Constrictive pericarditis may impair adequate filling of the heart. Tuberculosis is one possible cause. Pericardial effusion can further constrict the heart and cause cardiac tamponade. Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy is discussed much more fully in the separate Cardiomyopathies article. They may be primary or due to other
