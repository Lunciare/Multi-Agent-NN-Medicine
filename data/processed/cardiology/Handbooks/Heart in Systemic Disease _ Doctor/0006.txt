Heart in systemic disease
KEYWORDS: heart, disease, failure, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, aortic, cause, syndrome, effusion, cardiac, coronary, including, systemic, pericardial, acute

fibrosis), SLE (is associated with pericarditis, hypertension, an in- creased risk of coronary heart disease and Libman-Sacks endocarditis). Infections: acute viral infection (especially Coxsackie B), South American try- panosomiasis (Chagas' disease), hepatitis B, HIV infection. Nutritional: malnutrition, vitamin B1 deficiency, obesity. Myopathies: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker's muscular dystrophy. Malignant disease Metastatic spread of malignancy to the heart is far more common than primary cardiac tumours.[8] The most common clinical presentation is from pericardial effusion, tachyarrhythmias, atrioventricular block and congestive heart failure. Tumours most likely to metastasise to the heart are malignant melanoma, leukaemia, malignant germ cell tumours and malignant thymoma. Although carcinoma of the lung and breast do not often metastasise to the heart, because of the very high numbers, they account for the greatest numbers of cardiac metastases. Carcinoma of the lung can also cause atrial fibrillation in the absence of metastatic spread to the heart. Central nervous system ECG abnormalities and rhythm disorders often occur in patients with subarach- noid haemorrhage and in cases of ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, head trauma, neurosurgical procedures, acute meningitis, intracranial space- occupying tumours and epilepsy. New-onset atrial fibrillation has been reported in up to one third of patients with acute stroke. 6/9
