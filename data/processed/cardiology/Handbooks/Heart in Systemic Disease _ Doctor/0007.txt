Heart in systemic disease

haemorrhage, head trauma, neurosurgical procedures, acute meningitis, intracranial space- occupying tumours and epilepsy. New-onset atrial fibrillation has been reported in up to one third of patients with acute stroke. 6/9 Renal disease Abnormalities of renal function may affect the heart in a number of ways: Renal impairment may impair the clearance of drugs that are potentially car- diotoxic, such as digoxin. Electrolyte disturbances associated with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease may cause cardiac abnormalities, particularly hypokalaemia, hyper- kalaemia, hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia. Other electrolytes, including magnesium, may also be important. Chronic kidney disease may result in pericardial effusion. Long-term dialysis may cause cardiomyopathy.[9] Kidney disease may lead to hypertensive cardiac disease. Assessment If there is any suspicion that the heart may be involved in systemic disease, this needs to be investigated or it may become apparent on other investigations. In ad- dition to any other investigation for the suspected underlying disease: Cardiovascular history and examination and clinical assessment of other sys- tems as applicable. Blood tests for myocardial infarction (cardiac enzymes - particularly troponins) and/or heart failure (including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)). CXR may show an enlarged heart, although it may not be clear if this is due to
