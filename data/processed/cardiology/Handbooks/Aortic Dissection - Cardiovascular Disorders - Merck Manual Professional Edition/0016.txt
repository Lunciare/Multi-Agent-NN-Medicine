Aortic Dissection

left subclavian artery. Dissection can present in patients with preexisting degeneration of the aortic media (eg, caused by connective tissue disorders, injury) but hypertension is commonly also involved. Patients typically have excruciating, tearing precordial or interscapular pain. Other manifestations depend on whether the aortic root and/or branches of the aorta are affected, and the presence and location of any rupture; heart failure, organ ischemia, and hemorrhagic shock may occur. Diagnose using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Immediately give beta-blockers and other medications as needed to control blood pressure and heart rate. Medical therapy alone is appropriate for uncomplicated, stable dissection confined to the descending aorta; other cases require surgery.
