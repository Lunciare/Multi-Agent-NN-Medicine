is common. Patients presenting with acute chest pain, electrocardiography (ECG) changes of acute inferior myocardial infarction, and a previously undocumented murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR) are of particular concern for a type I aortic dissection into the right coronary artery (causing inferior myocardial infarction), and the aortic valve (causing AR). 7/12 If the chest radiograph suggests dissection, TEE, CTA, or MRA is done immediately after the patient is stabilized. Findings of an intimal flap and double lumina confirm dissection. Multiplanar TEE is 97 to 99% sensitive and, with M-mode echocardiography, is nearly 100% specific. It can be done at the bedside in < 20 minutes and does not require contrast agents. However, CTA is typically the first-line imaging modality because it is often available more rapidly and widely than TEE. CTA sensitivity has been reported in the range of 90 to 100%, and specificity of CTA is 87 to 100% (1). 8/12 MRA has nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity for aortic dissection. But it is time-consuming and ill- suited for emergencies. MRA is best used when dissection is suspected in patients who are stable and have subacute or chronic chest pain. Contrast aortography is an option if surgery is being
