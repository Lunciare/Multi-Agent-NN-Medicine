Heart failure Fatal rupture of the aorta through the adventitia into the pericardium, right atrium, or left pleural space Acute dissections and those present < 2 weeks are most likely to cause these complications. Risk decreases at ≥ 2 weeks if evidence indicates thrombosis of the false lumen and loss of communication between the true and false lumina. Variants of dissection are thought to be precursors of classic aortic dissection. Variants of aortic dissection include Separation of the intima and media by intramural hematoma without a clear intimal tear or flap Intimal tear and bulge without a hematoma or false lumen Dissection or hematoma caused by ulceration of atherosclerotic plaque 5/12 Overview of Aortic Dissection Hide Details Aortic Dissection ( by Osmosis ( is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 ( Symptoms and Signs of Aortic Dissection Typically in aortic dissection, excruciating precordial or interscapular pain, often described as tearing or ripping, occurs abruptly (1). The pain frequently migrates from the original location as the dissection extends along the aorta. Up to 20% of patients present with syncope due to severe pain, aortic baroreceptor activation, extracranial cerebral artery obstruction, or cardiac tamponade. Hypotension and tachycardia could indicate active bleeding. Occasionally, patients present
