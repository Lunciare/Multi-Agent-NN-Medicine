Aortic Dissection

surgery or endovascular methods, are given long-term antihypertensive therapy, usually including beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Almost any combination of antihypertensives is acceptable; exceptions are those that act mainly by vasodilation (eg, hydralazine, minoxidil) and beta- blockers that have intrinsic sympathomimetic action (eg, acebutolol, pindolol). Avoidance of strenuous physical activity is often recommended. CT may be done before discharge and repeated at 6 months and 1 year, and then every 1 to 2 years. After repair of a dissection, the aorta should be monitored for the rest of the patient's life. The weakened aorta may develop aneurysmal degeneration above or below the surgical repair or re-dissect. For these reasons, continued surveillance is indicated. Treatment reference 1.

Without treatment, mortality rate is approximately 1 to 2% per hour after symptom onset. Without surgery, mortality is > 11/12 50% at 1 month (1). Hospital mortality rate for treated patients
