Aortic Dissection

20% of patients present with syncope due to severe pain, aortic baroreceptor activation, extracranial cerebral artery obstruction, or cardiac tamponade. Hypotension and tachycardia could indicate active bleeding. Occasionally, patients present with symptoms of malperfusion (ischemia due to the obstruction resulting from dissection), such as stroke, myocardial infarction, intestinal infarction, renal insufficiency, paraparesis, or paraplegia, due to interruption of the blood supply to a particular vascular bed, including the spinal cord, brain, heart, kidneys, intestine, or extremities. The interruption in blood supply is most often due to acute distal arterial obstruction by the false lumen. Approximately 20 to 30% of patients have partial or complete deficits of major arterial pulses, which may wax and wane (1). Limb blood pressures may differ, sometimes by > 30 mm Hg; this finding suggests a poor prognosis. A murmur of aortic regurgitation is often heard in patients with proximal dissection. Peripheral signs of aortic regurgitation may be present. Rarely, heart failure results from severe acute aortic regurgitation. Cardiac tamponade may cause pulsus paradoxus and jugular venous distention. Leakage of blood or inflammatory serous fluid into the left pleural space may lead to signs of pleural effusion. Occlusion of a limb artery may cause signs of
