therapy alone is appropriate for an uncomplicated, stable dissection confined to the descending aorta (type B). Endovascular repair is warranted in patients with complications (malperfusion, meaning ischemia due to obstruction secondary to the dissection; persistent hypertension and pain; rapidly enlarging aortic diameter; extension of the dissection; and rupture). Surgery is also best for acute distal dissections in patients with Marfan syndrome. For ascending aorta dissections, surgery is virtually always indicated due to the risk of life-threatening complications. Surgery usually involves open repair and replacement, although endovascular therapy can be used in certain circumstances when patients are not candidates for open repair. The extent of repair depends upon the reason for repair and the anatomic nature of the dissection. The goal of surgery is to obliterate entry into the false channel and reconstitute the aorta with a synthetic graft. If present, severe aortic regurgitation must be treated by resuspending the aortic leaflets or replacing the valve. Surgical outcomes are best with early, aggressive intervention. Mortality rates are approximately 20% (1). Predictors of poor outcome include Hypotension 10/12 Renal failure Age > 70 years Abrupt onset of chest pain Pulse deficit ST-segment elevation on ECG Stent grafts that seal entry to the
