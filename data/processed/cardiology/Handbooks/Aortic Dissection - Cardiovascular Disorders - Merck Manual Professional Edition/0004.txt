medial necrosis Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Connective tissue disorders, congenital or hereditary Loeys-Dietz syndrome Marfan syndrome Turner syndrome Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm Aortic catheterization Iatrogenic Aortic valve surgery Behçet disease Systemic rheumatic diseases Giant cell arteritis Takayasu arteritis Trauma Deceleration injuries Atherosclerotic risk factors, notably hypertension, contribute in more than two-thirds of patients. After rupture of the intima, which is a primary event in some patients and secondary to hemorrhage within the media in others, blood flows into the media, creating a false channel that extends distally or, less commonly, proximally along the artery. Pathophysiology of Aortic Dissection The pathophysiologic sequence of aortic dissections involves Aortic wall inflammation 4/12 Apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells Degeneration of aortic media Elastin disruption Vessel dissection Dissections may communicate back with the true aortic lumen through intimal rupture at a distal site, maintaining systemic blood flow. Serious consequences of aortic dissection are common and include Compromise of the blood supply of arteries that branch off the aorta (including coronary arteries) Aortic valvular dilation and regurgitation Heart failure Fatal rupture of the aorta through the adventitia into the pericardium, right atrium, or left pleural space Acute dissections and those present < 2 weeks are most likely
