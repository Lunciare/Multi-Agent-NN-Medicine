venous distention. Leakage of blood or inflammatory serous fluid into the left pleural space may lead to signs of pleural effusion. Occlusion of a limb artery may cause signs of peripheral ischemia or neuropathy. 6/12 Renal artery occlusion may cause oliguria or anuria. Pearls & Pitfalls Approximately 20 to 30% of patients with aortic dissection have pulse deficits. Symptoms and signs reference 1. Pape LA, Awais M, Woznicki EM, et al. Presentation, Diagnosis, and Outcomes of Acute Aortic Dissection: 17-Year Trends From the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. J Am Coll Cardiol 2015;66(4):350-358. doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2015.05.029 Diagnosis of Aortic Dissection Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), CT angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) Aortic dissection must be considered in any patient with chest pain, thoracic back pain, unexplained syncope, unexplained abdominal pain, stroke, or acute-onset heart failure, especially when pulses or blood pressures in the limbs are unequal. Such patients require a chest radiograph; the mediastinal shadow is often widened, usually with a localized bulge signifying the site of origin. Left pleural effusion is common. Patients presenting with acute chest pain, electrocardiography (ECG) changes of acute inferior myocardial infarction, and a previously undocumented murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR) are of particular concern for
