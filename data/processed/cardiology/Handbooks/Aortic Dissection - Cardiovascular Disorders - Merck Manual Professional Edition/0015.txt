treatment, mortality rate is approximately 1 to 2% per hour after symptom onset. Without surgery, mortality is > 11/12 50% at 1 month (1). Hospital mortality rate for treated patients is about 20% for type A dissection and 10% for type B dissection (2). One of the largest international registry databases reported survival rates of > 90 percent for type A dissections treated surgically at 1 and 3 years postdischarge. However, the 3-year survival rate of patients with type B dissection was 78% for those treated with medical management alone. Prognosis references 1. Tsai TT, Nienaber CA, Eagle KA.

Dissection can present in patients with preexisting degeneration of the aortic media (eg, caused by connective tissue disorders, injury) but hypertension is commonly also involved. Patients typically
