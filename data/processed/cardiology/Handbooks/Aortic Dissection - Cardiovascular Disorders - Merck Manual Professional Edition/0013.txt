of poor outcome include Hypotension 10/12 Renal failure Age > 70 years Abrupt onset of chest pain Pulse deficit ST-segment elevation on ECG Stent grafts that seal entry to the false lumen and improve patency of the true lumen, balloon fenestration (in which an opening is made in the dissection flap that separates the true and false lumina), or both may be less invasive alternatives for patients with type B dissection if peripheral ischemic complications develop. Some endovascular devices (Gore Ascending Stent Graft) are available for compassionate use in patients with type A dissections who have contraindications to open surgical repair. Complications of surgery include death, stroke (due to emboli), paraplegia (due to spinal cord ischemia), acute renal failure (especially if dissection includes renal arteries) and endoleak (leakage of blood back into the aneurysmal sac). The most important late sequellae include redissection, formation of localized aneurysms in the weakened aorta, and progressive aortic regurgitation. These complications may require surgical or endovascular repair. Long-term management All patients, including those treated by surgery or endovascular methods, are given long-term antihypertensive therapy, usually including beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Almost any combination of antihypertensives is acceptable; exceptions are
