A cardiothoracic surgeon should be consulted early during the diagnostic evaluation. Diagnosis reference 1. Expert Panel on Cardiac Imaging, Kicska GA, Hurwitz Koweek LM, et al.

J Am Coll Radiol 2021;18(11S):S474-S481. doi:10.1016/j.jacr.2021.09.004 Treatment of Aortic Dissection Beta-blockers and other medications to control blood pressure Usually endovascular repair or open surgical repair Patients who do not immediately die of aortic dissection should be admitted to an intensive care unit with intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring and an indwelling urethral catheter to monitor urine output. Blood should be typed and cross-matched for 4 to 6 units of packed red blood cells when surgery is likely. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should be intubated. Medical management Medications to decrease arterial pressure, arterial shear stress, ventricular contractility, and pain are started immediately to maintain systolic blood pressure at ≤ 120 mm Hg (or the lowest level compatible 9/12 with adequate cerebral, coronary, and renal perfusion) and to maintain a target heart rate of 60 to 80 beats per minute. A beta-blocker is usually the first-line medication for heart rate and blood pressure control. Options include Metoprolol tartrate IV Esmolol IV Labetalol (an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker) IV Alternatively,
