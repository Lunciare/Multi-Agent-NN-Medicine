Aortic Dissection

Type A: These dissections involve the ascending aorta. Type B: These dissections are confined to the descending thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery). 2/12 Thoracic Aortic Dissection (Stanford Type B) IMAGE © 2017 ELLIOT K. FISHMAN, MD. Although dissection may originate anywhere along the aorta, it occurs most commonly at areas of greatest hydraulic stress, which are the Right lateral wall of the ascending aorta (within 5 cm of the aortic valve) Proximal segment of the descending aorta (just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery) Rarely, dissection is confined to individual arteries (eg, coronary or carotid arteries), typically in pregnant or postpartum women. Etiology of Aortic Dissection Aortic dissections often occur in patients with preexisting degeneration of the aortic media. Causes and risk factors include connective tissue disorders, atherosclerotic disease, systemic rheumatic diseases, 3/12 and injury (see table Conditions Contributing to Aortic Dissection).
