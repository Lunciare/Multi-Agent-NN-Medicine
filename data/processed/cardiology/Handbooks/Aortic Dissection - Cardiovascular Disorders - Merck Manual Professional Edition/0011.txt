Aortic Dissection

minute. A beta-blocker is usually the first-line medication for heart rate and blood pressure control. Options include Metoprolol tartrate IV Esmolol IV Labetalol (an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker) IV Alternatively, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) can be used to control blood pressure and heart rate in patients who do not tolerate beta-blockers. If systolic blood pressure remains > 110 mm Hg despite use of beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, nitroprusside can be given in a constant IV infusion, titrated as necessary to control blood pressure. Nitroprusside should not be given without a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker because reflex sympathetic activation in response to vasodilation can increase ventricular inotropy and aortic shear stress, worsening the dissection. Pearls & Pitfalls To manage blood pressure in aortic dissection, do not use a vasodilator (eg, nitroprusside) without a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker because the vasodilator causes reflex sympathetic activation, which increases aortic shear stress. Surgical repair For a dissection of the descending aorta, a trial of medical therapy alone is appropriate for an uncomplicated, stable dissection confined to the descending aorta (type B). Endovascular repair is warranted in patients with complications (malperfusion, meaning ischemia due to obstruction
