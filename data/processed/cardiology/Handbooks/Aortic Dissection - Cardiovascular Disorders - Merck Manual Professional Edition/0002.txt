Aortic Dissection

are especially at risk for aortic dissection (1, 2). Peak incidence occurs at age 50 to 65 years in the general population and at age 20 to 40 years for patients with congenital connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). 1/12 Aortic Dissection 3D MODEL Classification of aortic dissection Aortic dissections are classified anatomically. The DeBakey classification system is most widely used (3): Type I (Majority of dissections): These dissections start in the ascending aorta and extend at least to the aortic arch and sometimes beyond. Type II: These dissections start in and are confined to the ascending aorta (proximal to the brachiocephalic or innominate artery). Type III: These dissections start in the descending thoracic aorta just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery and extend distally or, less commonly, proximally. Type IIIa dissections originate distal to the left subclavian artery and are confined to the thoracic aorta. Type IIIb dissections originate distal to the left subclavian artery and extend below the diaphragm. The Stanford system is simpler: Type A: These dissections involve the ascending aorta. Type B: These dissections are confined to the descending thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery). 2/12 Thoracic Aortic Dissection (Stanford
