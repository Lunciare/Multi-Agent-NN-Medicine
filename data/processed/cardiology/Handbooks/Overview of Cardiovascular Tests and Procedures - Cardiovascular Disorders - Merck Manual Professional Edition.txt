Many noninvasive and invasive tests can delineate cardiac structure and function (see table Tests for
Assessing Cardiac Anatomy and Function). Also, treatments can be administered during certain invasive
diagnostic tests (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention during cardiac catheterization, radiofrequency
ablation during electrophysiologic testing).
