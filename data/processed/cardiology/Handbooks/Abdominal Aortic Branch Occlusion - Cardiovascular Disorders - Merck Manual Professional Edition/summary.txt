KEYWORDS: occlusion, chronic, acute, mesenteric, symptoms, aortic, artery, abdominal, chronic occlusion, embolectomy, angioplasty, bypass, surgical, branch, branch occlusion

Various branches of the aorta can be occluded by atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or other conditions, causing symptoms and signs of ischemia or infarction. Diagnosis is by imaging tests. Treatment is with embolectomy, angioplasty, or sometimes surgical bypass grafting. Occlusion of branches of the abdominal aorta may be Acute: Resulting from embolism, atherothrombosis, or dissection Chronic: Resulting from atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or external compression by mass lesions Common sites of occlusion include Superior mesenteric arteries Celiac axis Renal arteries Aortic bifurcation Chronic occlusion of the celiac axis is more common among females for unclear reasons. Symptoms and Signs of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Clinical manifestations (eg, pain, organ failure, necrosis) result from ischemia or infarction and vary depending on the artery involved and acuity. Acute mesenteric occlusion causes intestinal ischemia and infarction, resulting in severe, diffuse abdominal pain typically out of proportion to the minimal physical findings.
