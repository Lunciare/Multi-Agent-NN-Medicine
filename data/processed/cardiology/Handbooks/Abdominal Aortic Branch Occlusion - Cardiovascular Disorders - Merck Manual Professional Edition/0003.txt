can cause intermittent claudication in the legs and buttocks and erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome). Femoral pulses are absent, and the ankle-brachial index is abnormal. A limb may be jeopardized. Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Imaging tests Diagnosis is based primarily on history and physical examination and is confirmed by duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or conventional angiography. Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Embolectomy or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for acute occlusion Surgery or angioplasty for chronic, severe occlusion Acute occlusion is a surgical emergency requiring embolectomy or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without stent placement. A laparotomy with bypass graft and bowel resection may be necessary if embolectomy or PTA is unsuccessful. Chronic occlusion, if symptomatic, may require surgery or angioplasty. Risk factor modification and antiplatelet medications may help. Acute mesenteric occlusion (eg, in the superior mesenteric artery), which causes significant morbidity and mortality, requires prompt revascularization. Prognosis is poor if the intestine is not revascularized within 4 to 6 hours. For chronic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis, dietary modifications may temporarily relieve symptoms. If symptoms are severe, surgical bypass from the aorta to the splanchnic arteries distal to the occlusion usually
