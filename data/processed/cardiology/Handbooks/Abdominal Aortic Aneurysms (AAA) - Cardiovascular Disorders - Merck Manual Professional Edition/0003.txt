and tachycardia. They may have a history of recent upper abdominal trauma, often minimal, or isometric straining (eg, lifting a heavy object). Even patients who reach the hospital alive have about a 50% mortality (2). Distal embolization of thrombus or atheromatous material may dislodge and block arteries of the kidneys, bowel, and lower extremities. When a lower extremity artery is blocked, patients typically present with sudden unilateral extremity pain and often pallor and loss of pulses (see also Acute Peripheral Arterial Occlusion). Uncommonly, large AAAs cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, perhaps because large areas of abnormal endothelial surface trigger rapid thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors. Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Often an incidental finding on physical examination or a radiologic study Confirmation by ultrasound or abdominal CT scanning Sometimes CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are diagnosed incidentally when they are detected during physical examination or when abdominal ultrasound, CT, or MRI is done for other reasons. An AAA should be considered in older patients who present with acute abdominal pain or back pain whether a palpable pulsatile mass is present or not.
