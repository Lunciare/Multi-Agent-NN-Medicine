Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms require immediate open surgery or endovascular stent grafting. Without treatment, mortality rate approaches 100%. There is no clear difference in mortality for open surgical treatment compared with endovascular stent grafting (2). Mortality remains high because many patients have coexisting coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral atherosclerosis. Patients who present in hemorrhagic shock require fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, but mean arterial pressure should not be elevated to > 70 to 80 mm Hg (permissive hypotension) because bleeding may increase. Preoperative blood pressure control and avoidance of hypertension are important. 6/9 CLINICAL CALCULATORS Mean Vascular Pressure (systemic or pulmonary) Pearls & Pitfalls In a patient with hypotension and a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, do not raise mean arterial pressure to > 70 to 80 mm Hg because bleeding may increase. Elective surgical repair is recommended for Aneurysms > 5 cm in females and > 5.5 cm in males (when risk of rupture increases to > 5 to 10%/year), unless coexisting medical conditions contraindicate surgery (1)
