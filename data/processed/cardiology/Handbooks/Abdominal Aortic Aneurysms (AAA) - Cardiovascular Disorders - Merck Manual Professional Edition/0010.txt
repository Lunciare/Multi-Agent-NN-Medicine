Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition

flow of blood into the aneurysm sac after endovascular stent graft 7/9 placement). Thus, follow-up visits must be more frequent after endovascular stent graft placement than after a surgical repair. If no complications occur, imaging tests are recommended at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and every year thereafter. Complex anatomy (eg, short aneurysm neck below renal arteries, severe arterial tortuosity) makes routine endovascular stent grafting difficult in these patients; however, devices have been developed to overcome these issues. In general, for a successful endovascular repair, surgeons should choose a specific device that is appropriate for the patient's anatomic characteristics. In most cases, repair of aneurysms < 5 cm does not appear to increase survival. Aneurysms should be monitored with ultrasound or abdominal CT scans every 6 to 12 months for expansion that warrants treatment. Treatment of a mycotic aneurysm consists of vigorous antimicrobial therapy directed at the pathogen, followed by excision of the aneurysm. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcome. Surgical complications Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of early postoperative death. Complications following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair include Major vein injury due to proximal cross clamping Erectile dysfunction (as a result of nerve damage or decreased blood flow)
