Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) - Cardiovascular Disorders - Merck Manual Professional Edition

of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Medical management, particularly smoking cessation and blood pressure control Surgery or endovascular stent grafting Some abdominal aortic aneurysms enlarge at a rate of 10%/year. Enlargement often occurs in a stepwise pattern with periods of no growth observed. Other aneurysms enlarge exponentially. Control of atherosclerotic risk factors, especially smoking cessation and use of antihypertensive medications as appropriate, is important. If a small (< 4 cm) or moderate-sized (between 4 and 5 cm) aneurysm. When the aneurysm becomes > 5 cm in a female or > 5.5 cm in a male and if risk of 5/9 perioperative complications is lower than estimated risk of rupture, AAA repair is indicated (1). Risk of rupture versus that of perioperative complications should be discussed frankly with the patient. The need for surgical treatment is related to aneurysm size, which is linked to the risk of rupture (see table Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Size and Rupture Risk).
