for Aneurysms > 5 cm in females and > 5.5 cm in males (when risk of rupture increases to > 5 to 10%/year), unless coexisting medical conditions contraindicate surgery (1) Additional indications for elective surgery include Increase in aneurysm size by > 0.5 cm within 6 months, regardless of size Chronic abdominal pain Thromboembolic complications Iliac or femoral artery aneurysm that causes lower-limb ischemia Aneurysms > 4.5 cm in patients with Marfan syndrome Before elective repair, clinical consideration of coronary artery disease (CAD) is often needed and may or may not require further evaluation (see table Tests for Assessing Cardiac Anatomy and Function) because some patients with an AAA have significant risk of cardiovascular events. Aggressive medical treatment and risk factor control are essential. Routine preoperative coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery has not been shown to be necessary in most patients who can be prepared with good medical management before aneurysm repair; coronary revascularization should be considered only in patients with unstable coronary artery disease (eg, acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina) or multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. Surgical repair consists of replacing the aneurysmal portion of the abdominal aorta with a synthetic graft. If the iliac arteries
