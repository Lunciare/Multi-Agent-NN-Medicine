blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and blood type and cross-match, are done in preparation for possible surgery. If rupture is not suspected, CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can more precisely characterize aneurysm size and anatomy. If thrombi line the aneurysm wall, conventional angiography may underestimate true size; CT may provide a more accurate estimate. Aortography is sometimes necessary if renal artery or aortoiliac disease is suspected or if correction with endovascular stent grafts (endografts) is being considered. Plain abdominal radiographs are neither sensitive nor specific; however, if obtained for other purposes, radiographs may show aortic calcification outlining the aneurysm wall. If a mycotic aneurysm is suspected, bacterial and fungal blood cultures should be done. Screening males age > 65 years who have ever smoked with abdominal ultrasound decreases mortality, but the absolute reduction is small for males who are otherwise at low risk. Screening also can also provoke anxiety, particularly for aneurysms managed expectantly. Some authorities recommend shared decision-making.
