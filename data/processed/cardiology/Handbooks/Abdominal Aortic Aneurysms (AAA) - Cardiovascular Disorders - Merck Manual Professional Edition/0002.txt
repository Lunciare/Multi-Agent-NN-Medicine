most aneurysms grow slowly, rapidly enlarging aneurysms that are about to rupture can be tender. The aneurysm may or may not be palpable as a pulsatile mass, depending on its size and patient habitus. The probability that a patient with a pulsatile palpable mass has a small aneurysm (ie, < 4 cm) is about 55% (positive predictive value); the probability exceeds 80% only when the mass is > 5 cm in diameter (1). A systolic bruit may be audible over the aneurysm. Patients with an occult AAA sometimes present with symptoms of complications or of the cause (eg, fever, malaise, or weight loss due to infection or vasculitis). Complications The main complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include Rupture Distal embolization 2/9 Disseminated intravascular coagulation (uncommon) Rupture is most likely to occur on the left posterolateral wall 2 to 4 cm below the renal arteries. If an AAA ruptures, most patients die before reaching a medical facility. Patients who do not die immediately typically present with abdominal or back pain, hypotension, and tachycardia. They may have a history of recent upper abdominal trauma, often minimal, or isometric straining (eg, lifting a heavy object). Even patients who reach the hospital alive have
