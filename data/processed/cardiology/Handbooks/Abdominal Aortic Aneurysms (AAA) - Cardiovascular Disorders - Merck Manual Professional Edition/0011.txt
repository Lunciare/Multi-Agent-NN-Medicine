early postoperative death. Complications following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair include Major vein injury due to proximal cross clamping Erectile dysfunction (as a result of nerve damage or decreased blood flow) Graft infection Pseudoaneurysm Atherosclerotic occlusion of graft Key Points Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAAs typically enlarge at a rate of 10%/year, but some enlarge exponentially; about 20% remain the same size indefinitely. 8/9 Risk of rupture is proportional to the size of the aneurysm. Diagnose using ultrasound or abdominal CT; for unruptured aneurysms, CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography can more precisely characterize aneurysm size and anatomy. Ruptured AAAs require immediate open surgery or endovascular stent grafting; even then, mortality is high. Elective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms > 5 cm in females, for those > 5.5 cm in males, and for those that are rapidly enlarging or causing ischemic or embolic complications.
