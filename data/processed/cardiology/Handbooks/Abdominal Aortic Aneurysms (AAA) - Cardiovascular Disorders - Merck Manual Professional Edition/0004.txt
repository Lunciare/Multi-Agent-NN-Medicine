present with acute abdominal pain or back pain whether a palpable pulsatile mass is present or not. Radiographic Images of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms 3/9 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (Ultrasound) This patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.4 cm (between the white crosses) as well as atherosclerotic plaque or mural thrombus (red arrow). Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (CT Scan) The white arrow shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 5 cm with heterogenous flow and mural plaque. Abdominal Aortic Pseudoaneurysm (CT Scan) The white arrow shows a suprarenal abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm. There is also extensive plaque in the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. 4/9 When symptoms or physical examination findings suggest AAA, ultrasound, CT, or MRI of the abdomen are usually the tests of choice (1). Patients with symptoms should have immediate testing to make the diagnosis before catastrophic rupture. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable with presumed rupture, ultrasound provides bedside results more rapidly, but intestinal gas and distention may limit its accuracy. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and blood type and cross-match, are done in preparation for possible surgery. If rupture is not suspected, CT
