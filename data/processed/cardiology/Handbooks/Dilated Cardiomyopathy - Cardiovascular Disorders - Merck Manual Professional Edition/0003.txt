(RV) rarely. Mural thrombi may form due to stasis of blood once chamber dilation and dysfunction are significant. Cardiac tachyarrhythmias often complicate the acute myocarditis and late chronic dilated phases as may atrioventricular block. Atrial fibrillation commonly occurs as the left atrium dilates. Etiology of Dilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy has many known and probably many unidentified causes (see table Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy). More than 20 viruses can cause dilated cardiomyopathy; in temperate zones, coxsackievirus B is most common. In Central and South America, Chagas disease due to Trypanosoma cruzi is the most common infectious cause. Other causes include prolonged (chronic) tachycardia, HIV infection, toxoplasmosis, thyrotoxicosis, and thiamin deficiency (causing beriberi). Many toxic substances, particularly alcohol, various organic solvents, iron or heavy metal ions, and certain chemotherapeutic agents (eg, doxorubicin, trastuzumab), damage the heart. Frequent ventricular ectopy (> 10,000 ventricular premature beats/day) has been associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 2/10 Sudden emotional stress and other hyperadrenergic states can trigger acute dilated cardiomyopathy that is typically reversible (as is that caused by prolonged tachycardia). An example is acute apical ballooning cardiomyopathy (also called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome). In this disorder, usually the apex and occasionally other
