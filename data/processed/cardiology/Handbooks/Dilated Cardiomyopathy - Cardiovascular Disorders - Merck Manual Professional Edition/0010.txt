Dilated Cardiomyopathy

during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. In addition, these medications are not recommended for women who are breastfeeding. Prophylactic oral anticoagulation has been used in the past to prevent mural thrombus in other forms of cardiomyopathy. The use of anticoagulants for patients with reduced left ventricular function and in sinus rhythm remains controversial, and anticoagulant use in this situation is not routine. Warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is recommended when a specific indication is present (eg, previous cerebrovascular embolism, identified cardiac thrombus, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter). Both the American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology Guidelines recommend considering anticoagulation therapy in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy who have very low ejection fractions given the risk of a hypercoagulable state during pregnancy (2, 3). Low molecular weight heparin has been used. Warfarin and direct-acting oral anticoagulants, however, should not be used during certain stages of pregnancy due to fetal risk. Medical treatment of heart failure reduces risk of arrhythmia, but an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator may be used to prevent death due to sudden arrhythmia in patients who continue to have a reduced ejection fraction despite optimal medical therapy. Because atrioventricular (AV) block during acute myocarditis often
