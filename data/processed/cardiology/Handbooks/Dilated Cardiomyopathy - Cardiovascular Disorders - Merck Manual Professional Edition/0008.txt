Dilated Cardiomyopathy

The pattern of LGE can be diagnostic in active myocarditis, sarcoidosis, muscular dystrophy, or Chagas disease). MRI Findings of Cardiac Sarcoidosis Positron-emission tomography (PET) has been shown to be sensitive for diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. Coronary angiography may be required to exclude coronary artery disease as the cause of LV dysfunction when the diagnosis is in doubt after noninvasive tests. Patients with chest pain or several cardiovascular risk factors and older patients are more likely to have coronary artery disease. Biopsy of either ventricle can be done during catheterization in select cases where the results will change management. Endomyocardial biopsy is indicated if giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, or sarcoidosis is suspected, as the results will affect management. Treatment of Dilated Cardiomyopathy Cause (if any) treated Standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Anticoagulants when atrial fibrillation or other indication is present Sometimes implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), left ventricular assist device, or transplantation Immunosupression in patients with giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, sarcoidosis, or other autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) 7/10 Treatable causes (eg, toxoplasmosis, acute Chagas disease, hemochromatosis, thyrotoxicosis, thiamin deficiency) are corrected. Patients with HIV infection should have antiretroviral therapy (ART) optimized. Treatment
