used to prevent death due to sudden arrhythmia in patients who continue to have a reduced ejection fraction despite optimal medical therapy. Because atrioventricular (AV) block during acute myocarditis often resolves, a permanent pacemaker is usually not needed acutely. However, a permanent pacemaker may be required if AV block persists or develops during the chronic dilated phase. If patients have a widened QRS interval with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and severe symptoms despite optimal medical treatment, cardiac resynchronization therapy should be considered. Patients with refractory heart failure despite treatment may become candidates for heart transplantation. Selection criteria include absence of associated systemic disorders and psychologic disorders and high, irreversible pulmonary vascular resistance; because donor hearts are scarce, younger patients (usually < 70 years) are given higher priority. Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) may also be considered as a bridge to heart transplantation or as destination therapy in some patients (eg, patients who are not eligible for heart transplantation). Prognosis for Dilated Cardiomyopathy Prognosis for dilated cardiomyopathy generally has been poor, although prognosis has improved with current management regimens (eg, use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARB], angiotensin II receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor
