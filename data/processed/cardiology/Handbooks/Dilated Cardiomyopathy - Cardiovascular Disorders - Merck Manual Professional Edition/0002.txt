females and in twice as many people of African ancestry compared with White people (1). About 5 to 6 of every 100,000 people develop the disorder each year. Pathophysiology of Dilated Cardiomyopathy As a primary myocardial disorder, the myocardial dysfunction of dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in the absence of other disorders that can cause dilated myocardium, such as severe occlusive coronary artery disease or conditions that involve pressure or volume overload of the ventricle (eg, hypertension, valvular heart disease). In some patients, dilated cardiomyopathy is believed to start with acute myocarditis (probably viral in most cases), followed by a variable latent phase, a phase with diffuse necrosis of myocardial myocytes (due to an autoimmune reaction to virus-altered myocytes), and chronic fibrosis. Regardless of the cause, the myocardium dilates, thins, and hypertrophies in compensation (see figure Forms of Cardiomyopathy), often leading to functional mitral regurgitation and/or tricuspid regurgitation and atrial dilation. The disorder affects both ventricles in most patients, only the left ventricle (LV) in a few, and only the right ventricle (RV) rarely. Mural thrombi may form due to stasis of blood once chamber dilation and dysfunction are significant. Cardiac tachyarrhythmias often complicate the acute myocarditis and late chronic dilated phases
