Dilated cardiomyopathy is myocardial dysfunction causing heart failure in which ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction predominate. Symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. Diagnosis is clinical and by elevated natriuretic peptides, chest x-ray, echocardiography, and MRI. Treatment is directed at the cause. Standard heart failure treatment measures are used (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ARNI [angiotensin II receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor], sodium glucose cotransporter 2 protein [SGLT2] inhibitors, hydralazine/nitrates, diuretics, digoxin). If heart failure is progressive and severe, cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, repair of moderate to severe valvular regurgitation, left ventricular assist device, or heart transplantation may be needed.
