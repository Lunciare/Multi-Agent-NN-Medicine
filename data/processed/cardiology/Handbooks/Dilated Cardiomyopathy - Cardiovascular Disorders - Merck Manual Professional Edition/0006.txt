MRI Endomyocardial biopsy (selected cases) Testing for cause as indicated Diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy is by history, physical examination, and exclusion of other common causes of ventricular failure (eg, systemic hypertension, primary valvular disorders, myocardial infarction—see table Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies). Particularly in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy without a clear cause, a careful family history should be taken to identify family members with possible early-onset heart disease, heart failure, or sudden death. In many centers, first- degree family members are screened for cardiac dysfunction (such as with echocardiography). Because 5/10 other common causes of ventricular failure must be excluded, chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI are required. Endomyocardial biopsy is done in selected cases. Serum cardiac biomarkers are measured if acute symptoms or chest pain is present. Although typically indicative of coronary ischemia, troponin elevation often occurs in heart failure, especially if renal function is decreased. Serum natriuretic peptide levels are typically elevated when heart failure is present. Specific causes suspected clinically are diagnosed (see elsewhere in THE MANUAL). If no specific cause is clinically apparent, serum ferritin and iron-binding capacity and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are measured. Serologic tests for Toxoplasma, T. cruzi, coxsackievirus, HIV, and echovirus may
