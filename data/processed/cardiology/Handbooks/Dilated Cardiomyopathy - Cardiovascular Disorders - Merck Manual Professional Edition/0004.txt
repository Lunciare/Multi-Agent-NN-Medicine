Dilated Cardiomyopathy

caused by prolonged tachycardia). An example is acute apical ballooning cardiomyopathy (also called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome). In this disorder, usually the apex and occasionally other segments of the left ventricle are affected, causing regional wall dysfunction and sometimes focal dilation (ballooning). Genetic factors play a role in 20 to 35% of cases; > 60 genes and loci have been implicated. TABLE Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy Cause Examples Frequent ventricular ectopy Chronic tachycardia Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or other persistent tachyarrhythmias Eosinophilic myocarditis Hypereosinophilic syndrome Familial disease in 20–30% of patients: autosomal dominant, X-linked, Genetic abnormality autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial inheritance Granulomatosis with polyangiitis Granulomatous disorders Granulomatous or giant cell myocarditis Sarcoidosis Duchenne muscular dystrophy Emery-Dreifuss dystrophy Hereditary neuromuscular and Fascioscapulohumeral muscular neurologic disorders dystrophy Friedreich ataxia Bacterial Fungal Helminthic Infections (acute or chronic) Protozoan Rickettsial Spirochetal Viral (including HIV infection) 3/10 Cause Examples Anthracyclines Catecholamines Cobalt Cocaine Cyclophosphamide Doxorubicin Ethanol Medications, illicit drugs, and toxins Heavy metals Organic solvents Psychotherapeutic medications (tricyclic and quadricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazine) Radiation Trastuzumab Metabolic disorders Acromegaly Diabetes mellitus Familial storage disorders (eg, Gaucher disease) Hereditary hemochromatosis Hyperthyroidism Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Hypophosphatemia Hypothyroidism Nutritional disorders (eg, thiamin deficiency, selenium deficiency, carnitine deficiency, kwashiorkor)
