About 25% of all patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have atypical chest pain. Other symptoms depend on which ventricle is affected. Left ventricular dysfunction causes exertional dyspnea and fatigue due to elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure and low cardiac output. Right ventricular failure causes peripheral edema and neck vein distention. Infrequently the right ventricle is predominantly affected in younger patients, and atrial arrhythmias and sudden death due to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias are typical. Diagnosis of Dilated Cardiomyopathy Chest x-ray ECG Echocardiography Cardiac MRI Endomyocardial biopsy (selected cases) Testing for cause as indicated Diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy is by history, physical examination, and exclusion of other common causes of ventricular failure (eg, systemic
