diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) 7/10 Treatable causes (eg, toxoplasmosis, acute Chagas disease, hemochromatosis, thyrotoxicosis, thiamin deficiency) are corrected. Patients with HIV infection should have antiretroviral therapy (ART) optimized. Treatment with immunosuppression should be limited to patients with biopsy-proven giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, sarcoidosis, or other autoimmune causes (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus). Otherwise, treatment is the same as for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ARNI (angiotensin II receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 protein (SGLT2) inhibitors, hydralazine/nitrates, diuretics, and digoxin. Older studies have suggested that patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy respond particularly well to standard heart failure treatments and generally do better than patients with ischemic heart disease, but more recent data do not support this difference, especially in view of changes in drug regiments over the years (1). Special precautions are needed in the treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Many medications (eg, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. In addition, these medications are not recommended for women who are breastfeeding. Prophylactic oral anticoagulation has been used in the past
