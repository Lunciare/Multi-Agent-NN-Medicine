Stress cardiomyopathy overview
Overview
Stress cardiomyopathy is a relatively new disease, with the first case documented in literature
under the name of Takotsobu Cardiomyopathy in Japan in 1991. It is not very well understood, but
the disease is thought to arise following intense emotional or physical stress. Stress
cardiomyopathy mostly affects post-menopausal women. The clinical presentation, laboratory
findings and imaging studies largely mimic that of anterior MI. However, the absence of significant
coronary artery stenosis supports the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy. It is generally a self-
limiting disease and the majority of patients have a restored cardiac function within a matter of
weeks. Complications and death are relatively rare, but they are mostly related to the development
of heart failure and pulmonary edema.
Historical Perspective
Stress cardiomyopathy is a relatively new disease, with the first case documented in literature in
Japan in 1991. However, cases of death upon going through severe emotional or psychological
stress have been described as early as the biblical times.[1][2]
Classification
Stress cardiomyopathy can be divided into several types, depending on the location of regional wall
motion abnormality. The area of motion abnormality (whether hypokinesia, dyskinesia or
akinesia) can be detected on echocardiography or left ventriculography. The most common type is
the apical type, resulting in apical ballooning.[3][4][5][6]
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy is not completely understood. However, the most
accepted theory behind it is thought to be due to catecholamine surge, which are thought to
contribute to myocardial necrosis and stunning seen in stress cardiomyopathy.[2][7][8] On biopsy,
findings include an inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis and formation of contraction bands, which
may or may not be associated with myocardial necrosis.[9][10] Stress cardiomyopathy is associated
with various neurological and psychological conditions.
Causes
The cause of stress cardiomyopathy is largely unknown. However, it is usually triggered by
emotional and/or physical stress and may be related to certain medical conditions.
Differentiating Stress Cardiomyopathy from Other Diseases
The clinical presentation, laboratory findings and imaging studies of stress cardiomyopathy
resembles that of anterior MI and must be differentiated from it. Also, stress cardiomyopathy must
be differentiated from other medical conditions, such as pheochromocytoma, dilated
cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[11][12]
Epidemiology and Demographics
The true incidence and prevalence of stress cardiomyopathy is unknown. However, this disease
most commonly affects post-menopausal women, with the mean age of diagnosis ranging between
58-75 years.[2][3][1][13][14]
Risk Factors
Stress cardiomyopathy seems to be triggered by intense emotional or physical stress, mostly the
unexpected death of a loved one.[2]
Screening
There are no screening recommendations for stress cardiomyopathy.[15]
Natural History, Complications and Prognosis
The prognosis of stress cardiomyopathy is generally excellent, with most patients making a
complete recovery within a matter of weeks. However, death from complications of heart failure
and heart rupture may occur.[2][13][16]
Diagnostic Criteria
In 2004, researchers at the Mayo Clinic proposed a criteria for the diagnosis of stress
cardiomyopathy. All 4 points of the criteria must be fulfilled, which include ruling out other
medical conditions, such as obstructive coronary disease, myocarditis and
pheochromocytoma.[13][2]
History and Symptoms
The most common presenting symptoms of stress cardiomyopathy are shortness of breath and
chest pain.[2][10][13][14][3][17]
Physical Examination
Physical examination findings in patients with stress cardiomyopathy are non-specific and non-
diagnostic. The diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy is largely based on ECG, echocardiographic
findings, as well as cardiac catheterization.[18]
Laboratory Findings
Elevated levels of catecholamines, cardiac enzymes and BNP may be seen in patients with stress
cardiomyopathy. However, none of these laboratory findings are specific to stress
cardiomyopathy.[2][10][14][17]
ECG
ECG findings in stress cardiomyopathy are similar to those seen in anterior MI. The most common
findings include ST elevation in the precordial leads, T wave inversion and the formation of a Q
wave.[19][2] Findings on ECG include:[2][10][13][16][14][3][17]
Chest X-Ray
Typical findings on chest x-ray include apical ballooning and narrowing of the neck.
CT Scan
A CT scan may be done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to asses coronary anatomy, as well
as detect the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.[17]
MRI
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a useful imaging modality in distinguishing between stress
cardiomyopathy and myocarditis or MI. The most common findings on CMR in patients with
stress cardiomyopathy include absence of gadolinium hyper-enhancement, as well as myocardial
edema.[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][5][28]
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is done in patients with stress cardiomyopathy to document apical ballooning,
dyskinesia/akinesia and reduced ejection fraction.[10][13][16][17]
Other Imaging Findings
In patients with stress cardiomyopathy, coronary angiography usually shows normal anatomy of
the coronary arteries no evidence of coronary artery stenosis.[2][14][17]
Other Diagnostic Studies
Coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization are the diagnostic modalities of choice to
distinguish between stress cardiomyopathy and acute anterior MI. Normal anatomy of the
coronary arteries, along with a reduced ejection fraction supports the diagnosis of stress
cardiomyopathy.[10][16][14]
Medical Therapy
Medical therapy in stress cardiomyopathy is indicated to treat the complications that may arise.
The most common complications related to stress cardiomyopathy include heart failure and
pulmonary edema. Diuretics and anti-heart failure medications are the treatment of choice in these
conditions.[1][10]
Surgery
Treatment of stress cardiomyopathy is mostly supportive and medications are used to treat
complications.[1][10] There is no role for surgery in the treatment of stress cardiomyopathy.
Primary Prevention
There are no means of prevention of stress cardiomyopathy.
Secondary Prevention
Stress cardiomyopathy is a self-limiting disease, which usually resolves within a few weeks.
However, medical therapy may be necessary during the acute phase of the illness or when
complications arise.
