degrees Centigrade. There is variability in the morphology of Osborn waves as all J wave deflections do not look alike. Some Osborn waves are merely elevations of ST segments in leads V and V , whereas others are of 1 2 the "spike-and-dome" variety. Given the variability in morphology, a variety of mechanisms may be responsible for the size and shape of J wave deflections. Shown below is an example of the "spike and dome" variant of the Osborn wave: Shown below is an Osborn wave in an 81-year-old male with a core temperature 89.5 degrees F (31.94 C): Electrocardiographic Examples Examples of Osborn Waves in the Setting of Hypothermia Shown below is the 12 lead ECG of a patient with a body temperature of 32 degrees Celsius. Note the sinus bradycardia, the prolonged QT interval (QTc is not prolonged) and the Osborn J wave, most prominently in leads V2-V5: Example of Osborn Waves in the Setting of Vasospastic Angina Shown below is the time course of twelve-lead ECG in a 52-year-old man with vasospastic angina. ECGs were obtained prior to the ischemic attack (A), at the onset of chest pressure (B), immediately before ventricular fibrillation (C), after defibrillation and
