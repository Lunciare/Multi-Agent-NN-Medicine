[1] [2] [3] [4] Historical Perspective The prominent J deflection attributed to hypothermia was first reported in 1938 by Tomaszewski. The wave was observed by others, including Kossmann, Grosse-Brockhoff and Schoedel, Bigelow et al, Juvenelle et al, and Osborn. [5] [6] [7] [8] Over the years, the unusual wave has increasingly been called an Osborn wave, probably because of Osborn's excellent descriptive article written in 1953. Clinicians labeled the deflection an Osborn wave in honor of Osborn, one of the first American Heart Association research fellows.
