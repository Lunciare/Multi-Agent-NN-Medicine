KEYWORDS: osborn, wave, waves, osborn waves, osborn wave, ventricular, causes, degrees, hypothermia, ventricular fibrillation, fibrillation, angina, vasospastic angina, vasospastic, neck

a 52-year-old man with vasospastic angina. ECGs were obtained prior to the ischemic attack (A), at the onset of chest pressure (B), immediately before ventricular fibrillation (C), after defibrillation and administration of intravenous lidocaine and magnesium (D), and 2 days after the episode (E). Osborn waves (arrowheads) were best seen in the inferior and lateral leads around the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. In contrast to hypothermic patients, the tracing shows sinus tachycardia and short QT intervals.[15]
