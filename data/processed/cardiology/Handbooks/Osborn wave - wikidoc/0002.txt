Causes Common Causes • Hypothermia Causes of Osborn Waves in Alphabetical Order • Cerebrovascular accident[11] [12] • Coronary vasospasm • Damage to sympathetic nerve chain in the neck after radical neck dissection [13] • Hypercalcemia • Hypothermia • Subarachnoid hemorrhage[14] • Ventricular fibrillation, immediately before and after, often in the setting of vasospastic angina Diagnosis Electrocardiogram The most typical finding is the appearance of the Osborne J wave, an extra deflection between the QRS complex and the T wave. Osborn waves are positive deflections occurring at the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment, where the S point, also known as the J joint, has a myocardial infarction-like elevation. Osborn waves are more prominent in the left precordial leads. They increases in size with decreasing temperature. They are caused by a current of injury, delayed ventricular depolarization, or early repolarization. Osborn waves may first appear on the ECG for temperatures less tahn 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius), and consistently appear when when the temperature falls below 25 degrees Centigrade. There is variability in the morphology of Osborn waves as all J wave deflections do not look alike. Some Osborn waves are merely elevations of ST segments in
