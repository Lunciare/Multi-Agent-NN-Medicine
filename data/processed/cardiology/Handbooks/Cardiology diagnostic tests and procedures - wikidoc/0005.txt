rate, based on extensive clinical research, can be estimated by the formula 220 beats per minute minus patient's age. This linear relation is accurate up to about age 30, after which it mildly underestimates typical maximum attainable heart rates achievable by healthy individuals. Other formulas exist, such as that by Miller (217 - (0.85 × Age)) Cookies help us deliver our services.

Medical imaging Coronary catheterization Coronary catheterization uses pressure monitoring and blood sampling through a catheter inserted into the heart through blood vessels in the leg to determine the functioning of the heart, and, following injections of radiocontrast dye, uses X-ray fluoroscopy, typically at 30 frames per second, to visualize the position and size of blood within the heart chambers and arteries. Coronary angiography is used to determine the patency and configuration of the coronary artery lumens. Echocardiogram Echocardiography uses ultrasonic waves for continuous heart chamber and blood movement visualization. In recent times, it has become one
