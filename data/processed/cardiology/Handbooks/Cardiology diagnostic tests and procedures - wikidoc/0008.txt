Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures

powerful superconducting magnets and radio frequency signals and detectors. Cardiology uses are growing, especially since MRI differentiates soft tissues better than CT. The principle difficulty with current implementations, for Cardiology uses, is the difficulty of imaging the ever moving heart structures, more so than with CT because MRI is much slower. However, there is a promising future in cardiac MRI.
