Hypertension

renal dysfunction, peripheral arterial disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, gout) Use of medications that predispose to hypertension (eg, NSAIDs, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives) Sleep duration Social history includes exercise levels and use of tobacco, alcohol, and stimulants (including medications and illicit drugs). A dietary history focuses on intake of salt and stimulants (eg, tea, coffee, caffeine-containing sodas, energy drinks). Physical examination The physical examination includes measurement of height, weight, and waist circumference; fundoscopic examination for retinopathy; auscultation for bruits in the neck and abdomen; and a full cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic examination. The abdomen is palpated for kidney enlargement and 9/20 abdominal masses. Peripheral arterial pulses are evaluated; diminished or delayed femoral pulses suggest aortic coarctation, particularly in patients < 30 years. A unilateral renal artery bruit may be heard in thin patients with renovascular hypertension. Testing After hypertension is diagnosed based on blood pressure measurements, testing is needed to: Detect target-organ damage Identify cardiovascular risk factors The more severe the hypertension and the younger the patient, the more extensive is the evaluation. For adults newly diagnosed with hypertension, tests should include (1): Urinalysis and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio; if abnormal, consider renal ultrasound Lipid panel, complete metabolic panel (including creatinine or cystatin C,
