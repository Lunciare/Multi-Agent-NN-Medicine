Hypertension

antagonist can be beneficial in attaining goal blood pressure (15). Secondary causes of hypertension must be excluded as part of the evaluation for resistant hypertension. Hyperaldosteronism or subclinical hypercortisolism has been identified in 15 to 20% of cases of resistant hypertension. Prognosis for Hypertension The higher the blood pressure, and the more severe the retinal changes and other evidence of target- organ involvement, the worse the prognosis. Systolic BP predicts fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events better than diastolic BP (1, 2). Effective control of hypertension prevents most complications and prolongs life. Without treatment, 1-year survival is < 10% in patients with retinal sclerosis, cotton-wool exudates, arteriolar narrowing, and hemorrhage (grade 3 retinopathy) and is < 5% in patients with the same changes plus papilledema (grade 4 retinopathy [3]). 18/20 Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of death among treated patients. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is a common consequence of inadequately treated hypertension.

Med Sci Monit. 2022;28:e935135. doi:10.12659/MSM.935135 Key Points Only about 50% of patients in the United States with hypertension receive treatment, and about one-quarter of those patients have adequate blood pressure
