ACE inhibitors* Youth Left ventricular failure due to systolic dysfunction† Diabetes with nephropathy Albumin:creatinine ratio > 30 mg/gram (> 33.9 mg/mmol) in patients with chronic renal disorders or diabetic glomerulosclerosis 14/20 Medication Class Indications Erectile dysfunction due to other medications Youth Conditions for which ACE inhibitors are indicated but not tolerated because of cough or angioedema Angiotensin II receptor blockers* Diabetes with nephropathy Left ventricular failure with systolic dysfunction Secondary stroke Older age Angina pectoris Arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular Long-acting calcium channel blockers tachycardia) Isolated systolic hypertension in older patients (dihydropyridines)† High CAD risk (nondihydropyridines)† Older age Thiazide-type diuretics† (chlorthalidone or indapamide) Heart failure * Contraindicated in pregnancy. † Reduced morbidity and mortality rates in randomized studies. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; CAD = coronary artery disease. Achieving adequate blood pressure control often requires several evaluations and changes in pharmacotherapy. Reluctance to titrate or add medications to control BP must be overcome. Nonadherence to therapy, particularly because lifelong treatment is required, can interfere with adequate BP control. Education, with empathy and support, is essential for success.
