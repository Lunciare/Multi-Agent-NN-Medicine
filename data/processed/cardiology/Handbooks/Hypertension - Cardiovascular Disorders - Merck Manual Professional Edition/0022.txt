Short sleep duration (typically defined as < 5 or 6 hours per night in adults, has been associated with hypertension (5). For example, studies suggest that optimizing sleep quality and duration (> 6 hours/night) improves blood pressure control in patients with chronic kidney disease (6). Dietary modifications can also help control diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Patients with uncomplicated hypertension do not need to restrict their activities as long as blood pressure is controlled. Medications (See also Medications for Hypertension.) The decision to treat with medication is based on the BP level and the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or its risk factors as determined by the PREVENT calculator (1). Patients with a 10-year predicted risk for CVD events ≥ 7.5% using PREVENT are considered to be at increased risk. Antihypertensive medication should be initiated for patients with hypertension who meet any of the following criteria (2): Average BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg Existing cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure) and average BP ≥ 130 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 80 mm Hg diastolic Diabetes, chronic
