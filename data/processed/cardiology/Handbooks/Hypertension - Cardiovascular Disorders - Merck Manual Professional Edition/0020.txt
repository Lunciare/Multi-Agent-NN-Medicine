Hypertension

Diet: Increased fruits and vegetables, decreased salt, limited alcohol Medications: Depending on BP and presence of cardiovascular disease or risk factors Primary hypertension has no cure, but some causes of secondary hypertension can be corrected. In all cases, control of blood pressure can significantly limit adverse consequences. Goal blood pressure for most patients is BP < 130/80 mm Hg Goal pressure in part depends on cardiovascular risk, which is best determined by the PREVENT calculator (1). Patients with a 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ≥ 7.5% should be encouraged to achieve a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg (2). BP below 130/80 mm Hg appears to continue to reduce the risk of vascular complications. Even older patients, including frail older patients, can tolerate a diastolic BP as low as 60 to 65 mm Hg without an increase in cardiovascular events (3, 4). However, decreasing systolic pressure increases the risk of adverse medication effects (eg, dizziness, light-headedness, possible worsened renal function), and the benefits of lowering BP to levels < 120 mm Hg systolic should be weighed against risks and patient tolerance. Ideally, patients or family members measure BP at home, provided they have been trained to do so and the
