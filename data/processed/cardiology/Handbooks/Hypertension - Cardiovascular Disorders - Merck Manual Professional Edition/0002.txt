the United States have hypertension. Many of these people are not aware that they have hypertension. Approximately 80% of adults with hypertension have been advised to begin treatment with medication and lifestyle modification, but only approximately 50% with hypertension actually receive treatment (1). Even with medication and lifestyle modification, BP is at goal (under control) in only 26% of patients, and, among treated adults whose BP is not at goal, almost 60% have a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (1). High blood pressure is more common in non-Hispanic Black adults (58%) than in non-Hispanic White adults (49%), non-Hispanic Asian adults (45%), or Hispanic adults (39%) (1). Among those for whom blood pressure medication and lifestyle modification have been recommended, control of blood pressure is higher among non-Hispanic White adults (31%) than in non-Hispanic Black adults (20%), non- Hispanic Asian adults (24%), or Hispanic adults (23%) (1). Blood pressure increases with age. About two-thirds of people > 65 years have hypertension, and people with a normal BP at age 55 have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension (2). Although 1/20 hypertension is common with increased age, treatment remains important because higher BP increases morbidity and mortality risk. Special considerations are
