Hypertension

For adults newly diagnosed with hypertension, tests should include (1): Urinalysis and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio; if abnormal, consider renal ultrasound Lipid panel, complete metabolic panel (including creatinine or cystatin C, potassium, and calcium), fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c, thyroid-stimulating hormone ECG Sometimes measurement of plasma free metanephrines (to detect pheochromocytoma) Sometimes a sleep study Depending on results of the examination and initial tests, other tests may be needed. Basic laboratory testing should be repeated at least annually. Renal ultrasound to evaluate kidney size may provide useful information if urinalysis detects albuminuria (proteinuria), casts, or microhematuria, or if serum creatinine or cystatin C is elevated. Patients with hypokalemia unrelated to diuretic use are evaluated for high salt intake and for primary aldosteronism by measuring plasma aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity. Screening for primary aldosteronism is also recommended for patients with resistant hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, or early stroke (< 40 years) (1).The prevalence of primary aldosteronism is higher than previously recognized, occurring in approximately 10 to 20% of patients with resistant hypertension (6, 7). On ECG, a broad, notched P-wave indicates atrial hypertrophy and, although nonspecific, may be one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease. Elevated QRS
