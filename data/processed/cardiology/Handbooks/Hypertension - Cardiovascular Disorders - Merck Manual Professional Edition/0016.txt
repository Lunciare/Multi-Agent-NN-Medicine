Hypertension

4-fold increased risk of developing sustained hypertension after 7 to 10 years compared to normotensive people (3). White coat effect does not appear to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Masked hypertension is defined as blood pressure that is consistently elevated outside the office, but in which office readings do not meet the criteria for hypertension in untreated people. This group of patients may represent 10 to 30% of the adult population and is more common in men, non-Hispanic Black people, and people with diabetes (4). Masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension (in those being treated) are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, with mortality similar to the risk in patients with sustained hypertension (5). Home or ambulatory BP monitoring is indicated when white coat hypertension or masked hypertension is suspected. History The history includes the: Duration of hypertension and previously recorded BP levels History or symptoms of coronary artery disease, heart failure, or obstructive sleep apnea Symptoms of, or personal or family history of, other relevant coexisting disorders (eg, stroke, renal dysfunction, peripheral arterial disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, gout) Use of medications that predispose to hypertension (eg, NSAIDs, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives) Sleep duration Social history includes exercise levels and use of
