Hypertension

(preferably a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone or indapamide) Adults with stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP 130 to 139/diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg) may be treated initially with a single first-line medication, with dose titration and sequential addition of other medications as needed to achieve blood pressure control (2). Adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140/diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) should be treated initially with 2 first line medications: an ACE inhibitor or ARB combined with either a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. When combination therapy is indicated, starting treatment with single pill combinations improves adherence (7, 8). Signs of hypertensive emergencies require immediate blood pressure reduction with parenteral antihypertensives. Such signs may include seizures or focal neurologic symptoms, retinal hemorrhage, chest pain, dyspnea,or nausea and vomiting. Some antihypertensives are avoided in certain disorders (eg, ACE inhibitors in severe aortic stenosis) whereas others are preferred for certain disorders (eg, calcium channel blockers for patients with angina pectoris, ACE inhibitors or ARBs for patients with diabetes and proteinuria—see tables Initial Choice of Antihypertensive Medication Class and Antihypertensives for Patients With Comorbidities). If the goal BP is not achieved within 1 month, assess adherence and tolerability
