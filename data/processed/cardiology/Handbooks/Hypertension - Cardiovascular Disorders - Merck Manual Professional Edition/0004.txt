Hypertension

should be designated to the higher blood pressure category. Data from Writing Committee Members*, Jones DW, Ferdinand KC, et al. 2025 AHA/ACC/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines. Hypertension. Etiology of Hypertension Hypertension Myths Hypertension may be: Primary (no specific cause—85% of cases) Secondary (an identified cause) Primary hypertension Hemodynamics and physiologic components (eg, plasma volume, activity of the renin-angiotensin system) vary, indicating that primary hypertension is unlikely to have a single cause. Even if one factor is recognized, multiple factors are probably involved in sustaining elevated blood pressure (the mosaic theory). Heredity is a predisposing factor, but the exact mechanism by which genetics plays a role is unclear. At younger ages, environmental factors (eg, dietary sodium, stress) seem to affect only people who are genetically susceptible; however, in patients > 65 years, high sodium intake becomes more likely to precipitate hypertension. Secondary hypertension Common causes include (1): 3/20 Obstructive sleep apnea Renal parenchymal disease: Chronic glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis, polycystic renal disease, lupus nephritis, obstructive uropathy Renovascular disease Primary aldosteronism (2) Other endocrine disorders (less common):
