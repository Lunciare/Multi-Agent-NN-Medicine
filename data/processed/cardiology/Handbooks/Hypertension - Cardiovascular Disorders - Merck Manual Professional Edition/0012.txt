≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg) can be asymptomatic (hypertensive urgency). When severe hypertension causes cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, and retinal symptoms (eg, symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, renal failure), it is referred to as a hypertensive emergency. Retinal changes may include arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhages, exudates and, in patients with encephalopathy, papilledema (hypertensive retinopathy). Changes are classified (according to the Keith- Wagener-Barker classification) into 4 groups with increasingly worse prognosis (1): Grade 1: Constriction of arterioles only Grade 2: Constriction and sclerosis of arterioles Grade 3: Hemorrhages and exudates in addition to vascular changes Grade 4: Papilledema Diagnosis of Hypertension Multiple measurements of BP Testing to diagnose causes and complications Hypertension is diagnosed by sphygmomanometry. History, physical examination, and other tests help identify etiology and determine whether target organs are damaged. 7/20 Multiple measurements of BP are needed to confirm hypertension because of the inherent variability of blood pressure. Blood pressure typically fluctuates with time of day; in classic diurnal variation, BP is higher by day (especially in the morning) and lower by night. Home blood pressure measurement, using a cuffed device, can help confirm a diagnosis of hypertension (1). Blood pressure measurement
