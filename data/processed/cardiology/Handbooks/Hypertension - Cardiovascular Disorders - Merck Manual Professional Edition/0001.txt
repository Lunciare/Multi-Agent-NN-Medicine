Hypertension

Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary hypertension) is most common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually due to primary aldosteronism. Sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, or renal artery stenosis are other causes of secondary hypertension. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-standing, which results in target organ damage to the brain, heart, or kidneys. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess organ damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or taking medication for hypertension. This definition is based on the relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events in large populations. Nearly half of adults in the United States have hypertension. Many of these people are not aware that they have hypertension. Approximately 80% of adults with hypertension have been advised to begin treatment with medication
