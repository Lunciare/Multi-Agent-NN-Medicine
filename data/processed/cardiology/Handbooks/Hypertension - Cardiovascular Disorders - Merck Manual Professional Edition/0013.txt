higher by day (especially in the morning) and lower by night. Home blood pressure measurement, using a cuffed device, can help confirm a diagnosis of hypertension (1). Blood pressure measurement The blood pressure used for formal diagnosis should be an average of 2 or 3 measurements taken in the office at different times under these conditions: Patient seated in a chair (not examination table) for > 5 minutes, feet on floor, back supported Upper limb supported at heart level with no clothing covering the area of cuff placement No exercise, caffeine, or tobacco use for at least 30 minutes At the first visit, measure BP in both arms; subsequent measurements should use the arm that gave the higher reading. A properly sized BP cuff is applied to the upper arm. An appropriately sized cuff covers two-thirds of the biceps; the bladder is long enough to encircle > 80% of the arm, and bladder width equals at least 40% of the arm’s circumference. Thus, patients with obesity usually require large cuffs. Blood pressure may be measured by either auscultatory or oscillometric devices. Fully automated validated oscillometric devices may be preferred over the auscultatory method as they provide accurate BP measurements and
