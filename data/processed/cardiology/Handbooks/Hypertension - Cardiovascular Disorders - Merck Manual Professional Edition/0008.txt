and brain, to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates autonomic centers in the brain to increase sympathetic discharge and stimulates release of aldosterone and vasopressin. Aldosterone causes sodium retention and vasopressin causes water retention, elevating BP. Aldosterone also enhances potassium excretion; low plasma potassium (< 3.5 mEq/L [< 3.5 mmol/L]) increases vasoconstriction through closure of potassium channels. Renin secretion is controlled by at least 4 mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive: A renal vascular receptor responds to changes in tension in the afferent arteriolar wall A macula densa receptor detects changes in the delivery rate or concentration of sodium chloride in the distal tubule Circulating angiotensin II has a negative feedback effect on renin secretion Sympathetic nervous system stimulates renin secretion mediated by beta-receptors (via the renal nerve) 5/20 Elevated angiotensin II levels are generally acknowledged to be responsible for renovascular hypertension, at least in the early phase, but the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in primary hypertension is not established. However, in patients with African ancestry and older patients with hypertension, renin levels tend to be low (1). Older patients also tend to have low angiotensin II levels, which may be related to a more volume-dependent salt-sensitive
