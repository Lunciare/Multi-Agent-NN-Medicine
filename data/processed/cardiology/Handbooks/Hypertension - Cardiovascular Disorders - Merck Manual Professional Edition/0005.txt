Hypertension

include (1): 3/20 Obstructive sleep apnea Renal parenchymal disease: Chronic glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis, polycystic renal disease, lupus nephritis, obstructive uropathy Renovascular disease Primary aldosteronism (2) Other endocrine disorders (less common): Pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism (myxedema), primary hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, and mineralocorticoid excess syndromes other than primary aldosteronism Prescription or over-the-counter medications: Sympathomimetics (decongestants), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antipsychotics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, stimulants, corticosteroids, cocaine Vascular anomalies: Coarctation of the aorta Licorice may contribute to worsening of blood pressure control. Diabetes is not considered a cause of secondary hypertension, although patients with diabetes commonly also are hypertensive. Pathophysiology of Hypertension Because blood pressure equals cardiac output (CO) multiplied by total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), pathogenic mechanisms involve: Increased CO Increased TPR Both In most patients with hypertension, CO is normal or slightly increased, and TPR is increased. This pattern is typical of primary hypertension and hypertension due to primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, renovascular disease, and renal parenchymal disease. In other patients, CO is increased (possibly because of venoconstriction in large veins), and TPR is inappropriately normal for the level of CO. Later in the disorder, TPR increases and CO returns to normal, probably because of autoregulation. Some
