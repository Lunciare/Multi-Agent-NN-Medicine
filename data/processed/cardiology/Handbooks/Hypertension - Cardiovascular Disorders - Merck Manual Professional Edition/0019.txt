Hypertension

with resistant hypertension (6, 7). On ECG, a broad, notched P-wave indicates atrial hypertrophy and, although nonspecific, may be one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease. Elevated QRS voltage, with or without evidence of ischemia, may occur later and indicates left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). When LVH is seen on ECG, echocardiography is often done. If coarctation of the aorta is suspected, echocardiography, chest CT, or MRI can confirm the diagnosis. Patients with labile, significantly elevated BP and symptoms such as headache, palpitations, tachycardia, excessive perspiration, tremor, and pallor are screened for pheochromocytoma by measuring plasma free metanephrines and for hyperthyroidism, first by measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A sleep study should be strongly considered in patients whose history suggests sleep apnea. 10/20 Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG Patients with symptoms suggesting Cushing syndrome, systemic rheumatic diseases, eclampsia, acute porphyria, hyperthyroidism, myxedema, acromegaly, or central nervous system (CNS) disorders also require further evaluation. Treatment of Hypertension Weight loss and exercise Smoking cessation Adequate sleep duration (a minimum of 6 hours/night) Diet: Increased fruits and vegetables, decreased salt, limited alcohol Medications: Depending on BP and presence of cardiovascular disease or risk factors Primary hypertension has no cure, but some causes of
