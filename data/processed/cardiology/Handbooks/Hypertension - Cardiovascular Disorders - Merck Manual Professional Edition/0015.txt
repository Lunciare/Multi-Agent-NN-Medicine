Hypertension

upper vasculature. BP is measured in a thigh (with a much larger cuff) to exclude coarctation of the aorta, particularly in patients with diminished or delayed femoral pulses; with coarctation, BP is significantly lower in the legs than in the arms. Variable measurements and hypertension White coat hypertension is defined as BP that is elevated in the office but does not meet the criteria for hypertension based on out-of-office readings in untreated patients. The prevalence is approximately 8/20 10 to 20% of the population and is more common in children, older adults, and women, as well as those with office-based BP close to the diagnostic threshold. White coat effect refers to BP that is elevated in the office but is normal during out-of-office readings, among patients who are on treatment for hypertension. The data about treatment outcomes of patients with white coat hypertension are conflicting. Untreated white coat hypertension seems to be associated with more adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared to normotension. Patients with white coat hypertension have a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of developing sustained hypertension after 7 to 10 years compared to normotensive people (3). White coat effect does not appear to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
