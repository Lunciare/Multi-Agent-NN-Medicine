systolic blood pressure. However, whether these devices reduce major cardiovascular events remains uncertain, with studies ongoing related to efficacy, patient selection, safety, and long-term impact on quality of life (13). Baroreflex activation therapy has been proposed for management of resistant hypertension, but studies have not provided sufficient evidence to recommend the use of these devices (2). The therapy employs a battery-powered device surgically implanted around the carotid body to stimulate the baroreceptor and, in a dose-dependent manner, lower blood pressure. In one long-term follow-up study of patients with resistant hypertension who were included in earlier pivotal trials, baroreflex activation therapy maintained its efficacy for persistent reduction of office BP without major safety issues (14). Resistant hypertension Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that is not controlled to goal despite adherence to 3 suitably dosed antihypertensive medications of different classes (including a diuretic) and after white coat effect is excluded. Blood pressure that requires 4 drugs to achieve control is also considered controlled resistant hypertension. Use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist can be beneficial in attaining goal blood pressure (15). Secondary causes of hypertension must be excluded as part of the evaluation for resistant hypertension. Hyperaldosteronism or subclinical hypercortisolism has
