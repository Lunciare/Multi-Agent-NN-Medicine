older patients with hypertension, renin levels tend to be low (1). Older patients also tend to have low angiotensin II levels, which may be related to a more volume-dependent salt-sensitive form of hypertension. Hypertension due to chronic renal parenchymal disease (renoprival hypertension) results from the combination of a renin-dependent mechanism and a volume-dependent mechanism. In most cases, increased plasma renin activity is not evident. Hypertension is typically moderate and sensitive to sodium and water balance. Vasodilator deficiency Deficiency of a vasodilator (eg, bradykinin, nitric oxide), rather than excess of a vasoconstrictor (eg, angiotensin, norepinephrine), may cause hypertension. Reduction in nitric oxide, due to stiff arteries, occurs with aging, and this reduction contributes to salt sensitivity (ie, lesser amounts of salt ingestion will raise BP) (2). With reduced nitric oxide, a large sodium load (eg, a salty meal) may increase systolic BP by > 10 to 20 mm Hg. If the kidneys do not produce adequate amounts of vasodilators (because of renal parenchymal disease), blood pressure can increase. Vasodilators and vasoconstrictors (mainly endothelin) are also produced in endothelial cells. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction greatly affects blood pressure. Pathology and complications No pathologic changes occur early in hypertension. Severe or prolonged hypertension damages
