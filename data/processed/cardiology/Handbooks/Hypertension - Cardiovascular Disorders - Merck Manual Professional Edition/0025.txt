If the goal BP is not achieved within 1 month, assess adherence and tolerability and reinforce the importance of following treatment. If patients are adherent with the regimen, the dose of the initial medication can be increased or a second medication added (selected from among medications recommended for initial treatment). Note that an ACE inhibitor and an ARB should not be used together. Therapy is titrated frequently. If target BP cannot be achieved with 2 medications, a third medication from choices of initial medications is added. If such a third medication is not tolerated or is contraindicated, a medication from another class (eg, aldosterone antagonist) can be used. Patients with such difficult to control BP may benefit from consultation with a hypertension specialist. For resistant hypertension (BP remains above goal despite use of 3 different antihypertensive medications), 4 or more medications are commonly needed.
