(mainly endothelin) are also produced in endothelial cells. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction greatly affects blood pressure. Pathology and complications No pathologic changes occur early in hypertension. Severe or prolonged hypertension damages target organs (primarily the cardiovascular system, brain, and kidneys), increasing risk of: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) Heart failure Stroke (particularly hemorrhagic) Renal failure Death Elevated BP levels lead to the development of generalized arteriolosclerosis and acceleration of atherogenesis. Arteriolosclerosis is characterized by medial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and hyalinization of small arteries (arterioles), notably in the eyes and the kidneys. In the kidneys, the changes narrow the arteriolar lumen, increasing TPR; thus, hypertension leads to more hypertension. Furthermore, once arteries are narrowed, any slight additional shortening of already hypertrophied smooth muscle reduces the lumen to a greater extent than in normal-diameter arteries. These effects may explain why the longer hypertension has existed, the less likely specific treatment (eg, renovascular surgery) for secondary causes is to restore blood pressure to normal. Thus, earlier diagnosis and treatment of even modestly elevated BP (ie, systolic BP of 120 to 129 mm Hg, even if the diastolic BP is in normal range) may provide benefit, especially in younger patients with a family
