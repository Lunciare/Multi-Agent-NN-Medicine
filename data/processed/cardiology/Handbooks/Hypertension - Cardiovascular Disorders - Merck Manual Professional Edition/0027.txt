ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme. Devices and physical interventions Renal artery sympathetic nerve ablation is a potential option for uncontrolled hypertension, using percutaneous catheter-based radiofrequency devices, ultrasound, or the injection of neurolytic agents 16/20 into tissues surrounding the renal vasculature (9). Several industry-funded sham-controlled studies with different patient populations (eg, untreated hypertension [10], treated hypertension [11], or resistant hypertension [12]) have demonstrated statistically and/or clinically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure. However, whether these devices reduce major cardiovascular events remains uncertain, with studies ongoing related to efficacy, patient selection, safety, and long-term impact on quality of life (13).
