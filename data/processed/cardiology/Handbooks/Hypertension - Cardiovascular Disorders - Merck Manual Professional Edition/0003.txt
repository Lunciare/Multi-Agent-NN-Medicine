Hypertension

a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension (2). Although 1/20 hypertension is common with increased age, treatment remains important because higher BP increases morbidity and mortality risk. Special considerations are indicated for hypertension during pregnancy because complications are different. Hypertension that develops during pregnancy may resolve after pregnancy (see Hypertension in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia and Eclampsia). Categories of BP in adults, defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), include normal, elevated BP, stage 1 (mild) or stage 2 hypertension (3) (see table Classification of Blood Pressure in Adults). Normal values for blood pressure in infants, children, and adolescents are much lower than those in adults (4). TABLE Classification of Blood Pressure in Adults* Classification Blood Pressure Normal blood pressure < 120/80 mm Hg Elevated blood pressure 120–129/< 80 mm Hg 130–139 mm Hg (systolic) Stage 1 hypertension OR 80–89 mm Hg (diastolic) ≥ 140 mm Hg (systolic) Stage 2 hypertension OR ≥ 90 mm Hg (diastolic) * Patients with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in different categories should be designated to the higher blood pressure category.
