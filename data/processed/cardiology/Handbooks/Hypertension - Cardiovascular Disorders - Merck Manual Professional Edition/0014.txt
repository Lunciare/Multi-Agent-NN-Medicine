Hypertension

Blood pressure may be measured by either auscultatory or oscillometric devices. Fully automated validated oscillometric devices may be preferred over the auscultatory method as they provide accurate BP measurements and reduce human error (1, 2). For the auscultatory measurement, the clinician inflates the cuff above the expected systolic pressure and gradually releases the air while listening with a stethoscope placed over the brachial artery. As the pressure falls, the pressure at which the first heartbeat is heard is systolic BP. Total disappearance of the sound marks diastolic BP. The same principles are followed to measure BP in a forearm (radial artery) and thigh (popliteal artery). Mechanical devices should be calibrated periodically. Home blood pressure monitoring, combined with periodic clinician in-office measurements, can improve blood pressure control. However, cuffless home devices (such as smart watches) are not adequately precise, and should not be relied upon (1). BP is measured in both arms because BP that is > 15 mm Hg higher in one arm than the other requires evaluation of the upper vasculature. BP is measured in a thigh (with a much larger cuff) to exclude coarctation of the aorta, particularly in patients with diminished or delayed femoral pulses; with coarctation,
