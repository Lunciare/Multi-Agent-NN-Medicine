elevated BP (ie, systolic BP of 120 to 129 mm Hg, even if the diastolic BP is in normal range) may provide benefit, especially in younger patients with a family history of hypertension. 6/20 Because afterload is increased in patients with elevated BP, the left ventricle gradually hypertrophies, causing diastolic dysfunction. The ventricle eventually dilates, causing dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, often worsened by arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease. Thoracic aortic dissection is typically a consequence of hypertension; almost all patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms have hypertension. Pathophysiology references 1.

Even severe hypertension (typically defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm Hg) can be asymptomatic (hypertensive urgency). When severe hypertension causes cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, and retinal symptoms (eg, symptomatic coronary
