months postoperatively. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) can 8/10 be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic valve (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease). When the etiology is annular calcification, there is no benefit from percutaneous balloon commissurotomy because there is no commissural fusion. Furthermore, surgical valve replacement is technically demanding because of the annular calcification and often high risk because many patients are older and have comorbidities. Therefore, intervention is delayed until symptoms become severe despite use of diuretic and rate control medications. Patients who are not candidates for surgery may benefit from implantation of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) bioprosthesis in the mitral position. Prognosis for Mitral Stenosis The natural history of mitral stenosis varies, but the interval between onset of symptoms and severe disability is, on average, approximately 9 years (1). Outcome is affected by the patient’s preprocedural age and functional status, presence of pulmonary hypertension, and degree of mitral regurgitation. Symptomatic results of balloon or surgical commissurotomy are equivalent in patients with valves that are not calcified. However, after a variable period of time, function deteriorates in most patients due to restenosis, and valve replacement may
