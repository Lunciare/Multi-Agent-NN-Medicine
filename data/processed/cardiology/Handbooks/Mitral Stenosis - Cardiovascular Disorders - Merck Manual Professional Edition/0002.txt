Mitral Stenosis

regions with low prevalence, patients typically present between ages 50 and 70 years and with calcified fibrotic leaflets with subvalvular involvement in addition to commissural fusion. An prevalent cause in older patients is mitral annular calcification with extension of calcification into the leaflets, causing them to stiffen and not open fully. Women comprise 80% of rheumatic fever and mitral annular calcification cases (1). Occasionally, mitral stenosis is congenital or occurs after radiation therapy. If the valve cannot close completely, mitral regurgitation (MR) may coexist with mitral stenosis. Patients with mitral stenosis due to rheumatic fever may also have lesions of the aortic valve or tricuspid valve or both. Left atrial (LA) size and pressure increase progressively to compensate for mitral stenosis; pulmonary venous and capillary pressures also increase and may cause secondary pulmonary hypertension, leading to right ventricular (RV) heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary regurgitation. Rate of progression varies. LA enlargement predisposes to atrial fibrillation, a risk factor for thromboembolism. The faster heart rate and loss of atrial contraction with onset of atrial fibrillation often lead to sudden worsening of symptoms.
