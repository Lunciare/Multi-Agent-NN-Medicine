Mitral Stenosis

Mitral stenosis is narrowing of the mitral valve orifice that obstructs normal blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The usual cause is rheumatic fever. Common complications are pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism. Symptoms are those of heart failure; signs include an opening snap and a diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Medical treatment includes diuretics, beta- blockers or rate-limiting calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants. Effective treatment for more severe disease consists of balloon commissurotomy, surgical commissurotomy, or valve replacement. Prognosis is good. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) In mitral stenosis, mitral valve leaflets become thickened and immobile and the mitral orifice becomes narrowed due to fusion of the commissures and the presence of shortened, thickened, and matted chordae tendineae. The most common cause is: Rheumatic fever However, many patients do not recall having had rheumatic fever. In regions with high prevalence of rheumatic fever, patients often present by age 30 years, usually with commissural fusion of pliable, noncalcified leaflets. In regions with low prevalence, patients typically present between ages 50 and 70 years and with calcified fibrotic leaflets with subvalvular involvement in addition to commissural fusion.
