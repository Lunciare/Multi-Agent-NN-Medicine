the valve is suitable for percutaneous balloon commissurotomy (may be considered in asymptomatic patients if pulmonary pressure is > 50 mm Hg or there is new-onset atrial fibrillation). Cardiac surgery is pursued only when symptoms are severe and for patients who are not candidates for percutaneous balloon commissurotomy, require other cardiac operations, or do not have access to the percutaneous procedure (1). Choice of intervention Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy is the procedure of choice for younger patients and for patients without heavily calcified valve commissures, subvalvular distortion, LA thrombi, or moderate or severe MR (see Table Grading of Mitral Regurgitation —1). In this fluoroscopic- and echocardiographic-guided procedure, a transvenous catheter with an inflatable distal balloon is passed transseptally from the right atrium to the LA and inflated to separate fused mitral valve commissures. Outcomes are equivalent to those of more invasive procedures. Complications are uncommon but include MR, embolism, and tamponade. More than three-quarters of the atrial septal defects from the procedure close spontaneously; most of the remaining atrial septal defects cause only clinically trivial left to right shunts, but percutaneous closure is occasionally necessary (2). Surgical commissurotomy may be used in patients with severe subvalvular disease, valvular calcification, or
