Mitral Stenosis

defects cause only clinically trivial left to right shunts, but percutaneous closure is occasionally necessary (2). Surgical commissurotomy may be used in patients with severe subvalvular disease, valvular calcification, or LA thrombi. In this procedure, fused mitral valve leaflets are separated using a dilator passed through the left ventricle (closed commissurotomy) via a thoracotomy, or by direct vision (open commissurotomy) via a sternotomy. Choice of procedure is based on the surgeon’s experience and the morphology of the valve, although closed commissurotomy is performed less frequently. Because of its greater risks, surgery is usually deferred until symptoms reach New York Heart Association class III (see table Classification of Heart Failure). During surgery, some clinicians ligate the left atrial appendage to reduce risk of thromboembolism. Valve replacement is confined to patients with severe morphologic changes that make the valve unsuitable for balloon or surgical commissurotomy. Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin is required in patients with a mechanical valve to prevent thromboembolism. A mitral bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 to 6 months postoperatively. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) can 8/10 be considered in patients with atrial fibrillation and a bioprosthetic valve (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or
