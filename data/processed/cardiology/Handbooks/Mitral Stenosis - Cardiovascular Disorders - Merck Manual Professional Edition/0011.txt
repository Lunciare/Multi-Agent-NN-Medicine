the presence of dense spontaneous contrast or an enlarged left atrium (M-mode diameter > 50 mm) because these findings are associated with thromboembolism, although anticoagulation for these patients has not been studied. All patients should be encouraged to continue at least low levels of physical exercise despite exertional dyspnea. Note that non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are not indicated for anticoagulation in 7/10 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. (See also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease.) Antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is not recommended except for patients who have had valve replacement (see table Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures). Timing of intervention Patients with moderate mitral stenosis who are symptomatic and have exercise-induced mean transmitral gradient > 15 mm Hg or pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure > 25 mm Hg may be considered for percutaneous balloon commissurotomy. Surgical intervention may be indicated when cardiac surgery is required for other indications. Intervention is indicated for severe mitral stenosis when any symptoms are present if the valve is suitable for percutaneous balloon commissurotomy (may be considered in asymptomatic patients if pulmonary pressure is > 50 mm Hg or there is new-onset atrial fibrillation).
