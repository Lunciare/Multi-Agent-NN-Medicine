Mitral Stenosis

MS murmur are: Early diastolic murmur of coexisting aortic regurgitation (AR), which may be conducted to the apex Diastolic flow murmur in the presence of severe MR Mid-diastolic murmur of obstructing left atrial myxoma or ball thrombus (rare) Graham Steell murmur (a soft decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best along the left sternal border and caused by pulmonary regurgitation secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension) TABLE Distinguishing the Murmurs of Tricuspid Stenosis and Mitral Stenosis Feature Tricuspid Stenosis Mitral Stenosis Character Scratchy Rumbling, low-pitched Duration Short Long Starts in early diastole and Timing Increases through diastole does not increase up to S1 Augmenting factor Inspiration Exercise Cardiac apex with patient Lower right and left Site in left lateral decubitus parasternal borders position S1 = first heart sound. Diagnosis of Mitral Stenosis Echocardiography Diagnosis of mitral stenosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by echocardiography. Typically, 2- dimensional echocardiography shows abnormal valve and subvalvular structures. It also provides information about the degree of valvular calcification and stenosis and LA size. Doppler echocardiography provides information about the transvalvular gradient and pulmonary artery 2 pressure. The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4 to 5 cm . Severity of mitral stenosis is characterized echocardiographically
