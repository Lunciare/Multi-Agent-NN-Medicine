with onset of atrial fibrillation often lead to sudden worsening of symptoms. Symptoms and Signs of Mitral Stenosis Symptoms of mitral stenosis correlate poorly with disease severity because the disease often progresses slowly, and patients unconsciously reduce their activity. Many patients are asymptomatic until they become pregnant or atrial fibrillation develops. Initial symptoms are usually those of heart failure (eg, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue). Symptoms typically may not appear until 15 or more years after an episode of rheumatic fever (1). In medically underserved regions, young children may become symptomatic because streptococcal infections are not treated with antibiotics, and recurrent infections are common. Paroxysmal or chronic atrial fibrillation further reduces blood flow into the left ventricle (LV), precipitating pulmonary edema and acute dyspnea when ventricular rate is poorly controlled. Atrial fibrillation may also cause palpitations. In patients with atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis who are not taking anticoagulants, there is up to an approximately 5% annual risk of stroke; occasionally the initial symptoms and signs of mitral stenosis are those of an embolic event such as stroke (2). Less common symptoms include hemoptysis due to rupture of small pulmonary vessels and pulmonary edema, particularly during pregnancy when
