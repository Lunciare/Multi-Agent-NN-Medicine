Mitral Stenosis
KEYWORDS: mitral, valve, patients, stenosis, pulmonary, mitral stenosis, atrial, left, atrial fibrillation, fibrillation, symptoms, commissurotomy, murmur, pulmonary hypertension, hypertension

Mitral stenosis is narrowing of the mitral valve orifice that obstructs normal blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The usual cause is rheumatic fever. Common complications are pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism. Symptoms are those of heart failure; signs include an opening snap and a diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Medical treatment includes diuretics, beta- blockers or rate-limiting calcium channel blockers, and anticoagulants.
