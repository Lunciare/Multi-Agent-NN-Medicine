Mitral Stenosis

beat) at end-expiration when the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position. The opening snap may be soft or absent if the mitral valve is calcified; the snap moves closer to S2 (increasing duration of the murmur) as mitral stenosis becomes more severe and LA pressure increases. The diastolic murmur increases after a Valsalva maneuver (when blood pours into the LA), after exercise, and in response to maneuvers that increase afterload (eg, squatting, isometric handgrip). The murmur may be softer or absent when an enlarged RV displaces the LV posteriorly and when other disorders (pulmonary hypertension, right-sided valve abnormalities, atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular rate) decrease blood flow across the mitral valve. The presystolic crescendo is caused by increased flow with atrial contraction. However, the closing mitral valve leaflets during LV contraction may also contribute to this finding but only at the end of short diastoles when LA pressure is still high. Mitral Stenosis in Atrial Fibrillation Phonocardiographic Characteristics of Heart Murmurs Diastolic murmurs that may coexist with the MS murmur are: Early diastolic murmur of coexisting aortic regurgitation (AR), which may be conducted to the apex Diastolic flow murmur in the presence of severe MR Mid-diastolic murmur of
