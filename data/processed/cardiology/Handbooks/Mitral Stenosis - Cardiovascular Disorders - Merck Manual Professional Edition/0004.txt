stenosis are those of an embolic event such as stroke (2). Less common symptoms include hemoptysis due to rupture of small pulmonary vessels and pulmonary edema, particularly during pregnancy when blood volume increases. Hoarseness due to compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a dilated LA or pulmonary artery is called Ortner syndrome. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and secondary RV failure (cor pulmonale) may also occur; the classic facial appearance in mitral stenosis, a plum-colored malar flush with a background of peripheral cyanosis, occurs only when cardiac output is low and pulmonary hypertension is severe; the cause is localized cutaneous vasodilation overlaid on more extensive peripheral vasoconstriction and chronic hypoxemia. In patients with dark skin, the malar flush may produce a darker shade of the patient's skin. Endocarditis is rare in mitral stenosis unless mitral regurgitation is also present. Palpation Palpable first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) may be detected. S1 is best palpated at the apex, and S2 is best felt at the upper left sternal border. The pulmonic component of S2 (P2) is responsible for the impulse and results from pulmonary hypertension. An RV impulse (heave) palpable at the left sternal border may accompany jugular
