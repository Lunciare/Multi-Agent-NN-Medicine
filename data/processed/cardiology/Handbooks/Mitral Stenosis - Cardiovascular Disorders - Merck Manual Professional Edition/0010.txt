Mitral Stenosis

surgical repair, can confirm elevated LA and pulmonary artery pressures, ventricular filling pressures, transmitral gradient, and valve area. Treatment of Mitral Stenosis Diuretics and sometimes beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers Sometimes anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation Commissurotomy or valve replacement Asymptomatic patients with mitral stenosis require no treatment other than, if appropriate, prophylaxis against rheumatic fever recurrence. Surveillance with serial TTE is important, because RV enlargement and rise in RV systolic pressure can occur without patients noticing a change in functional state and without a decrease in mitral valve area. Early intervention may relieve pulmonary hypertension before it becomes permanent. Mildly symptomatic patients usually respond to diuretics and, if sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation is present, to beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, which can control ventricular rate and reduce transmitral gradient. Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) is indicated to prevent thromboembolism if patients have or have had atrial fibrillation, embolism, or a left atrial thrombus. Extended restoration of sinus rhythm is rarely possible. Anticoagulation may also be considered in the presence of dense spontaneous contrast or an enlarged left atrium (M-mode diameter > 50 mm) because these findings are associated with thromboembolism, although anticoagulation for these patients has not
