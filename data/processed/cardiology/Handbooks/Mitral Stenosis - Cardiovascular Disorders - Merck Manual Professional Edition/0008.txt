about the transvalvular gradient and pulmonary artery 2 pressure. The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4 to 5 cm . Severity of mitral stenosis is characterized echocardiographically as (1): 2 Moderate: Valve area > 1.5 to 2.5 cm or diastolic pressure half-time < 150 msec 2 Severe: Valve area ≤ 1.5 cm or diastolic pressure half-time ≥ 150 msec; symptoms are often present However, the relationship between the area of the valve orifice and symptoms is not always consistent. Color Doppler echocardiography detects associated mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to detect or exclude small LA thrombi, especially those in the LA appendage, which usually cannot be seen transthoracically. TEE also can better assess mitral regurgitation when mitral calcification causes acoustic shadowing of the left atrium from the transthoracic window. Mitral Stenosis VIDEO An ECG and chest radiograph are usually obtained. The ECG may show LA enlargement, manifest as a P wave lasting > 0.12 msec with prominent negative deflection of its terminal component (duration: > 0.04 msec; amplitude: > 0.10 mV) in V1; broad, notched P waves in lead II; or both. Right axis QRS deviation and tall R waves in V1 suggest RV
