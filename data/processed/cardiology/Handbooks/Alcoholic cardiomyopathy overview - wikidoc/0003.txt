Alcoholic cardiomyopathy overview

is majorly a clinical and echocardiographic diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic laboratory findings diagnostic of this disorder. Electrocardiogram Although many EKG changes are seen in patients with alcoholic cardiomyopathy, none of them are pathognomonic for this condition. However, acute alcoholic intoxication is also associated with pathological EKG changes. Common EKG abnormalities in alcoholic cardiomyopathy include non- specific ST-T changes and QT abnormalities. Imaging Chest X-ray Chest X-ray findings are essentially the same as those seen in congestive heart failure. Echocardiography Echocardiography is the most useful initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with heart failure. Because of its noninvasive nature and the ease of the test, it is the test of choice in the initial and follow-up evaluation of most forms of cardiomyopathy. It provides information not only on overall heart size and function, but also on valvular structure and function, wall motion and thickness, and pericardial disease. Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization or angiogram may be done to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) as the etiology of heart failure in alcoholic cardiomyopathy. In addition to ruling out CAD, cardiac catheteriation may also be helpful to assess cardiac output, cardiac hemodynamics and filling pressures. Treatment Medical Therapy 2/3 Treatment
