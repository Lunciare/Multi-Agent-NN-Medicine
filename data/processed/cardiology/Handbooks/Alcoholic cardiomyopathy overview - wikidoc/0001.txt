It accounts for 21-36% of all cases of non- ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [1]. The maximum recommended dose of alcohol consumption in US men and women is 14 drinks and 7 drinks respectively. Consumption above these levels has been shown to be associated with the increased risk of alcoholic cardiomyopathy [2]. Pathogenesis of this condition is multi-factorial.
