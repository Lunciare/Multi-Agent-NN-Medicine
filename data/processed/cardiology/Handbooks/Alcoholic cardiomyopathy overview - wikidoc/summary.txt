Overview Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the excessive use of alcohol use damages the heart muscle causing heart failure. It is characterized by constellation of findings which includes a history of excessive alcohol intake, physical signs of alcohol abuse, heart failure, and supportive findings consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Pathophysiology Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. Both acute and chronic alcohol consumption, in excessive amounts, has been associated with adverse effects on the myocardium leading to non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It accounts for 21-36% of all cases of non- ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [1]. The maximum recommended dose of alcohol consumption in US men and women is 14 drinks and 7 drinks respectively.
