healthy emotional episode people) Ventricular arrhythmia from exercise- induced ischemia (particularly in people 4/9 Finding Possible Cause with congenital arrhythmic disorders or CAD) Palpitations following episodic* drug use Drug-induced cause Suggests (but does not confirm) a Sense of doom, anxiety, or panic psychological factor Sinus tachycardia (eg, due to infection, Recent surgery (postoperative period) bleeding, pulmonary embolism, pain), atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter Supraventricular arrhythmia (eg, atrioventricular nodal reentrant bypass tract, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) Recurrent episodes since childhood Congenital long QT syndrome (usually manifests during adolescence) Brugada syndrome, congenital long QT syndrome, inherited dilated Family history of syncope or sudden cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right death ventricular cardiomyopathy, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy * The role of regular use of drugs (particularly medications) or substances (eg, daily caffeine) can be hard to determine; sometimes a trial of withdrawal is diagnostic. All drugs with cardiovascular effects, most psychoactive drugs, and drugs capable of causing hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be suspected. CAD = coronary artery disease; PACs = premature atrial contractions; PSVT = paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; PVCs = premature ventricular contractions; VT = ventricular tachycardia. Testing Testing typically is done: ECG, sometimes with ambulatory monitoring Laboratory testing Sometimes imaging studies, stress testing, or both ECG is done, but
