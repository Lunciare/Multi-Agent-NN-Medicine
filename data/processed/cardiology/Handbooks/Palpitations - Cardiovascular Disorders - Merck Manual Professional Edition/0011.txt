Palpitations

MRI. Patients with symptoms on exertion require stress testing sometimes with stress echocardiography, nuclear scanning, or PET. Treatment of Palpitations Precipitating medications and substances that can cause syncope are stopped. If dangerous or debilitating arrhythmias are caused by a necessary medication, a different medication should be tried. For isolated PACs and PVCs in patients without structural heart disease, simple reassurance is appropriate. For otherwise healthy patients in whom these phenomena are disabling, a beta-blocker can be given provided efforts are made to avoid reinforcing the perception by anxious patients that they have a serious disorder. Identified rhythm disturbances and underlying disorders are investigated and treated (see table Some Treatments for Arrhythmias). However, for rapid tachyarrhythmias in a patient in hemodynamic distress, cardioversion should precede further diagnostic assessment. 6/9 TABLE Some Treatments for Arrhythmias Disorder Treatment* Narrow complex tachycardias Reassurance, a non-dihydropyridine Multifocal atrial extrasystoles calcium channel blockers, or a beta- blocker Anticoagulation For rate control: Beta-blockers Verapamil Diltiazem Digoxin Atrial fibrillation For rhythm control: Antiarrhythmic medications (eg, ibutilide, amiodarone, propafenone, dronedarone, sotalol, dofetilide) Cardioversion Radioablation Sometimes a Maze procedure Anticoagulation Radioablation (often the best treatment) Atrial flutter Sometimes DC cardioversion, digoxin, beta blocker, and/or verapamil Sometimes, DC cardioversion, rate Ectopic
