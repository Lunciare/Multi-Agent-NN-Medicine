Palpitations

are aware of virtually every premature ventricular beat, but others are unaware of even complex atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Awareness is heightened in patients who are sedentary, anxious, or depressed and reduced in those who are active and happy. In some cases, palpitations are perceived in the absence of any abnormal cardiac activity. Etiology of Palpitations Some patients simply have heightened awareness of normal cardiac activity, particularly when exercise, febrile illness, or anxiety increases heart rate. However, diligent evaluation for arrhythmia as the cause of palpitations is warranted. Arrhythmias range from benign to life threatening. The most common arrhythmias include Premature atrial contractions (PACs) Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) Both of these arrhythmias usually are harmless. Other common arrhythmias include Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter Ventricular tachycardia Bradyarrhythmias rarely cause patients to sense palpitations, although some patients are aware of the slow rate. Causes of arrhythmias Some arrhythmias (eg, PACs, PVCs, PSVT) often occur spontaneously in patients without serious underlying disorders, but others are often caused by a serious cardiac disorder. Serious cardiac causes include myocardial ischemia or other myocardial disorders, congenital heart disease (eg, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, congenital long
