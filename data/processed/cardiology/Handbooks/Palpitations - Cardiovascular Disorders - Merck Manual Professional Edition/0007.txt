Palpitations

it identifies the unique irregular irregularity of some cases of rapid atrial fibrillation, the regular irregularity of coupled atrial or ventricular extrasystoles, the regular tachycardia at 150 beats/minute of PSVT, and the regular bradycardia of < 35 beats/minute of complete atrioventricular block. Careful examination of the jugular venous pulse waves simultaneously with cardiac auscultation and palpation of the carotid artery allows evaluation of atrial rhythm through jugular waves while the auscultated sounds or the pulse in the carotids are the product of ventricular contraction. Thyroid enlargement or tenderness with exophthalmos suggests thyrotoxicosis. Marked hypertension and regular tachycardia are consistent with pheochromocytoma. TABLE Suggestive Historical Findings in Patients With Palpitations Finding Possible Cause Occasional skipped beats PACs, PVCs Rapid, regular palpitations with sudden PSVT, atrial flutter with 2:1 onset and termination atrioventricular block, VT Often history of recurrence Sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular bypass tract (such as in Wolff-Parkinson- Syncope following palpitations White syndrome), congenital long QT syndrome, VT, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter Palpitations during exercise or an Sinus tachycardia (particularly in healthy emotional episode people) Ventricular arrhythmia from exercise- induced ischemia (particularly in people 4/9 Finding Possible Cause with congenital arrhythmic disorders or CAD) Palpitations following episodic* drug use Drug-induced cause
