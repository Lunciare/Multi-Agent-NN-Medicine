Palpitations

adults are at particular risk of adverse effects of antiarrhythmics; reasons include lower glomerular filtration rate and concomitant use of other medications. When pharmacotherapy is needed, lower doses should be used to start. Subclinical conduction abnormalities may be present (recognized on ECG or other studies), which might worsen with use of antiarrhythmics; such patients may require a pacemaker to allow the use of antiarrhythmics. 8/9 Key Points Palpitations are a frequent but relatively nonspecific symptom. Palpitations are not a reliable indicator of a significant arrhythmia, but palpitations in a patient with structural heart disease or an abnormal ECG may be a sign of a serious problem and warrant investigation. An ECG or other recording done during symptoms is invaluable; a normal ECG in a symptom-free interval does not rule out significant disease. Most antiarrhythmics themselves can cause arrhythmias. If in doubt about a rapid tachyarrhythmia in a patient in hemodynamic distress, cardiovert first and ask questions later. Drugs Mentioned In This Article
