premature ventricular contractions; VT = ventricular tachycardia. Testing Testing typically is done: ECG, sometimes with ambulatory monitoring Laboratory testing Sometimes imaging studies, stress testing, or both ECG is done, but unless the recording is done while symptoms are occurring, it may not provide a diagnosis. Many cardiac arrhythmias are intermittent and show no fixed ECG abnormalities; exceptions include 5/9 Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Long QT syndrome Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Brugada syndrome and its variants If no diagnosis is apparent and symptoms are frequent, Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours is useful; for intermittent symptoms, an event recorder worn for longer periods and activated by the patient when symptoms are felt is better. These tests are used mainly when a sustained arrhythmia is suspected, rather than when symptoms suggest only occasional skipped beats. Patients with very infrequent symptoms that clinicians suspect represent a serious arrhythmia may have a device implanted beneath the skin of the upper chest. This device, often called a loop recorder, continuously records the rhythm and can be interrogated by an external machine that allows the cardiac rhythm to be printed. Finally, a variety of commercially available products that patients may be using may provide additional useful information.
