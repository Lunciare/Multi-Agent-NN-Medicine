the rhythm as well as any murmurs or extra heart sounds that might indicate underlying valvular or structural heart disease. Neurologic examination should note whether resting tremors or brisk reflexes are present (suggesting excess sympathetic stimulation). An abnormal neurologic finding suggests that seizures rather than a cardiac disorder may be the cause if syncope is one of the symptoms. Red flags Certain findings suggest a more serious etiology: Light-headedness or syncope (particularly if injury occurs as a result of syncope) Chest pain Dyspnea New onset of irregularly irregular heart rhythm Heart rate >120 beats/minute or < 45 beats/minute while at rest Significant underlying heart disease Family history of recurrent syncope or sudden death Exercise-induced palpitations or, particularly, exercise-induced syncope Interpretation of findings History (see table Suggestive Historical Findings in Patients With Palpitations) and, to a lesser extent, physical examination provide clues to the diagnosis. Palpation of the arterial pulse and cardiac auscultation may reveal a rhythm disturbance. However, the examination is not always diagnostic of a specific rhythm, except when it identifies the unique irregular irregularity of some cases of rapid atrial fibrillation, the regular irregularity of coupled atrial or ventricular extrasystoles, the regular tachycardia at 150 beats/minute of PSVT,
