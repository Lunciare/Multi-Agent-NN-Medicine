Bundle Branch Block and Fascicular Block

the QRS duration is ≤ 0.11 second. When the ventricles are activated sequentially, the QRS duration is > 0.12 seconds. A wide QRS can result from activation of one ventricle early as in a rhythm originating in a ventricle (a ventricular rhythm or a ventricular paced rhythm) or as in ventricular pre-excitation (see figure Wolff-Parkinson- White Pattern) or from activating one ventricle late as in right or left bundle branch block. Right bundle branch block (RBBB—see figure Right Bundle Branch Block) criteria on the ECG in adults (1) are as follows: 2/6 A QRS duration ≥ 0.12 second rsr', rsR' or rSR' QRS pattern in leads V1 or V2 Delayed right ventricular activation time shown by a QRS onset to peak of last R wave time of > 0.05 second in lead V1 Normal left ventricular activation time shown by a QRS onset to peak of last R wave time of < 0.045 second in leads V5 and V6 S duration greater than R duration or S duration > 0.04 second in leads I and V6 RBBB produces secondary repolarization changes consisting of ST depression and T wave inversion particularly in V1.
