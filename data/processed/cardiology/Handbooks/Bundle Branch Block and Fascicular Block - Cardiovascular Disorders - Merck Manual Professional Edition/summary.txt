Bundle Branch Block and Fascicular Block
KEYWORDS: left, block, qrs, rbbb, bundle, second, bundle branch, branch, lbbb, right, branch block, ventricular, anterior, heart, conduction

Bundle branch block is partial or complete interruption of impulse conduction in a bundle branch; fascicular block is similar interruption in a hemifascicle of the left bundle. The disorders often coexist. There are usually no symptoms, but presence of either suggests a heart disorder. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. No specific treatment is indicated. Conduction blocks (see figure Electrical Pathway Through the Heart) can be caused by many heart disorders, including intrinsic degeneration without another associated heart disorder.
