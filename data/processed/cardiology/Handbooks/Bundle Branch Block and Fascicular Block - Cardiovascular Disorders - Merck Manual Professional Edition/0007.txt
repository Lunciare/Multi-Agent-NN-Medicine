Bundle Branch Block and Fascicular Block

and RBBB, left anterior or posterior hemiblock, and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (sometimes incorrectly called trifascicular block; incorrectly because first- degree block is usually AV nodal in origin). Trifascicular block refers to RBBB with alternating left anterior and left posterior hemiblock or alternating LBBB and RBBB. Presence of bifascicular or trifascicular block after myocardial infarction implies extensive cardiac damage. Bifascicular blocks require no direct treatment unless intermittent second- or third-degree AV block is present. True trifascicular blocks require immediate, then permanent pacing (3). Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defects are diagnosed when the QRS complex is prolonged (> 0.12 second), but the QRS pattern is not typical of LBBB or RBBB (1). The conduction delay may occur 5/6 beyond the Purkinje fibers and result from slow cell-to-cell myocyte conduction. Risk of subsequent cardiac events and mortality with nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect is similar to that of a LBBB. Accordingly, evaluation for an underlying structural heart disorder is indicated. Isolated intraventricular conduction delay produces no symptoms. No specific treatment is indicated (3).
