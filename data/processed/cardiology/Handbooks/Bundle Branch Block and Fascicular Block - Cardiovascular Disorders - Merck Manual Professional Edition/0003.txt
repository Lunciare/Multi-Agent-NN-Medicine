second in leads I and V6 RBBB produces secondary repolarization changes consisting of ST depression and T wave inversion particularly in V1. Incomplete right bundle branch block (also called right ventricular conduction delay) has the same ECG criteria as RBBB with a QRS duration > 0.11 second but < 0.12 second. When lead V1 shows a qR pattern while the other criteria for RBBB are met, RBBB and septal myocardial infarction (or other septal damage) are diagnosed. RBBB can occur in people with no evidence of heart disease (2). It may also occur with anterior myocardial infarction, indicating substantial myocardial injury. Transient RBBB may occur after pulmonary embolism and indicates significant right ventricular dysfunction. The presence of RBBB should prompt a search for underlying cardiac pathology (2), but often none is found. Although RBBB distorts the QRS complex, it does not significantly interfere with ECG criteria of past myocardial infarction. In the absence of evidence of a heart disorder or more advanced interventricular conduction disturbance, RBBB does not appear to indicate a higher risk of future cardiovascular events. Also, isolated RBBB produces no symptoms. Thus, isolated RBBB requires no specific therapy (3). Right Bundle Branch Block Left bundle branch block
