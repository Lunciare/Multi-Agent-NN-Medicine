shows a significant q wave while the other criteria for LBBB are met, LBBB and septal myocardial infarction (or other septal damage) are diagnosed. Otherwise, LBBB precludes use of the usual ECG criteria of past myocardial infarction. LBBB is associated with a structural heart disorder more often than is RBBB and, in contrast to RBBB, LBBB is associated with a higher risk of future cardiac events and mortality. It may also occur with anterior myocardial infarction, indicating substantial myocardial injury. The presence of LBBB should prompt a search for underlying cardiac pathology, which is present more often than in patients with RBBB (3). Isolated LBBB rarely produces symptoms but may produce interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony that reduces the efficiency of left ventricular systolic function and may contribute to heart failure, particularly in association with other heart disorders that reduce left ventricular systolic function. Resynchronization pacing therapy is then of benefit (4). Left Bundle Branch Block Fascicular block involves the anterior or posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch. Interruption of the left anterior fascicle causes left anterior hemiblock characterized by (1) Modest QRS prolongation (< 0.12 second) A frontal plane QRS axis more negative than −45° (left axis deviation) 4/6 Overview
