indicate a higher risk of future cardiovascular events. Also, isolated RBBB produces no symptoms. Thus, isolated RBBB requires no specific therapy (3). Right Bundle Branch Block Left bundle branch block (LBBB—see figure Left Bundle Branch Block) criteria on the ECG in adults are (1) 3/6 A QRS duration ≥ 0.12 second Broad notched or slurred R wave and absent Q waves in leads I, aVL, V5 and V6 Delayed left ventricular activation time shown by a QRS onset to peak of last R wave time of > 0.06 second in lead V5 and V6 Normal right ventricular activation time shown by a QRS onset to peak of last R wave time of < 0.035 second in lead V1 LBBB produces secondary repolarization changes consisting of ST and T wave deviation in the opposite direction of the QRS complex. Incomplete left bundle branch block (also called left ventricular conduction delay) has the same ECG criteria as LBBB with a QRS duration > 0.11 second but < 0.12 second. When lead aVL shows a significant q wave while the other criteria for LBBB are met, LBBB and septal myocardial infarction (or other septal damage) are diagnosed. Otherwise, LBBB precludes use of the
