Bundle Branch Block and Fascicular Block

Bundle branch block is partial or complete interruption of impulse conduction in a bundle branch; fascicular block is similar interruption in a hemifascicle of the left bundle. The disorders often coexist. There are usually no symptoms, but presence of either suggests a heart disorder. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. No specific treatment is indicated. Conduction blocks (see figure Electrical Pathway Through the Heart) can be caused by many heart disorders, including intrinsic degeneration without another associated heart disorder. 1/6 Electrical Pathway Through the Heart The sinoatrial (sinus) node (1) initiates an electrical impulse that flows through the right and left atria (2), making them contract. When the electrical impulse reaches the atrioventricular node (3), it is delayed slightly. The impulse then travels down the bundle of His (4), which divides into the right bundle branch for the right ventricle (5) and the left bundle branch for the left ventricle (5). The impulse then spreads through the ventricles, making them contract. In adults, the 2 ventricles are normally activated simultaneously such that the QRS duration is ≤ 0.11 second. When the ventricles are activated sequentially, the QRS duration is > 0.12 seconds. A wide QRS can result from activation of one ventricle
