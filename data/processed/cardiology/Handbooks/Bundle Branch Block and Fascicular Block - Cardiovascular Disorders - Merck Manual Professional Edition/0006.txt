Bundle Branch Block and Fascicular Block

left anterior fascicle causes left anterior hemiblock characterized by (1) Modest QRS prolongation (< 0.12 second) A frontal plane QRS axis more negative than −45° (left axis deviation) 4/6 Overview of Bundle Branch Bloc... VIDEO A qR pattern in lead aVL Delayed left anterolateral ventricular activation time shown by a QRS onset to peak of last R wave time of > 0.045 second in lead aVL Interruption of the left posterior fascicle causes left posterior hemiblock characterized by (1) Modest QRS prolongation (< 0.12 second) A frontal plane QRS axis more positive than +120° An rS pattern in lead aVL A qR pattern in leads II and aVF The associations between hemiblocks and a structural heart disorder are the same as for LBBB. Isolated left posterior hemiblock is rare. Isolated left anterior hemiblock is more common and does not appear to be independently associated with an increased risk of future cardiac events or mortality. Hemiblocks may coexist with other conduction disturbances: RBBB and left anterior or posterior hemiblock (bifascicular block); and RBBB, left anterior or posterior hemiblock, and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (sometimes incorrectly called trifascicular block; incorrectly because first- degree block is usually AV nodal in origin).
