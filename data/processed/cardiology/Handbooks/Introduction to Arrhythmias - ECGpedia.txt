Introduction to Arrhythmias - ECGpedia Introduction to Arrhythmias From ECGpedia (Redirected from Arrhythmias) Jump to navigation Jump to search Author(s) J.S.S.G. de Jong Moderator J.S.S.G. de jong Supervisor some notes about authorship Arrhythmias can be subdivided into supraventricular, nodal and ventricular arrhythmias Arrhythmias (non-normal heart rhythms) can be a challenge to understand, but with a systematic approach, diagnosis is often less difficult than it may appear at first. A good stepwise approach to interpret the heart rhythm is to follow these steps: Is this my patient's ECG or is this an artifact? (applies especially in stressfull situations) What is the ventricular heart rate? >100 bpm = tachycardia Ectopic Beats Cherchez le P, French for find the P waves. Do you see P waves? Leads II and V1 are often most suitable to find P waves. What is the rate of the P waves? What is the P wave morphology? What is the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes? Is there a 1:1 relation between P waves and QRS complexes? If not there may be AV dissociation due to a Ventricular Arrhythmias or AV block Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex? And every QRS preceded by a P wave? What is the PR interval and does it change? What is the QRS width? If the QRS 120ms it is either a ventricular tachycardia or a supraventricular rhythm with additional bundle branch block. This is a challenging diagnosis. Therefore a flowchart which incoporates the Brugada criteria for VT should be used.Brugada Another method to discriminate VT from SVT has been proposed by Vereckei et al.vereckeiIn that paper an excellent review is given on the subject by Dendi and Josephson.dendi What is the Heart Axis and did it change? If the heart axis turns significantly when compared to the heart axis during sinus rhythm a ventricular origin of the rhythm is more likely. What is the clinical setting? A wide complex tachycardia in a hemodynamically unstable 70-year-old man with previous myocardial infarction should be considered a ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise A wide complex tachycardia in a 24-year-old woman with recurrent spells of tachycardia that respond to vagal maneuvers is most likely an AVNRT with aberrant conduction. {{{1}}} Retrieved from "https://en.ecgpedia.org/index.php?title=Introduction_to_Arrhythmias&oldid=16526" Navigation menu Personal tools Log in Namespaces PageDiscussion English Views ReadView sourceView history More Search Navigation Main PageFrequently Asked QuestionsDisclaimersContactBenefactorsHow to improve this website The ECG course IntroductionBasicsRhythmRateConduction (PQ,QRS,QT)Heart axisP wave morphologyQRS morphologyST morphology The ECG textbook Normal tracingTechnical ProblemsSinus rhythmsArrhythmias:- supraventricular- junctional- ventricular- genetic- ectopic beatsAV ConductionIntraventricular ConductionMyocardial InfarctionQRS axis and voltageChamber HypertrophyRepolarizationClinical DisordersElectrolyte DisordersPacemaker Cases and Examples Cases and ExamplesGuess the CulpritRhythm Puzzles Tools What links hereRelated changesSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page This page was last edited on 3 November 2012, at 13:35.
