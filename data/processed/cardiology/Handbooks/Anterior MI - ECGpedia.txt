This is part of: Myocardial Infarction
ECG-characteristics:Wung
ST-elevation in leads V1-V6, I and aVL. Maximum elevation in V3, maximal depression in III
later: pathological Q-wave in the precordial leads V2 to V4-V5.
Anterolateral infarct caused by occlusion of the LAD.
The Left Anterior Descending (LAD) coronary artery is the most important coronary artery. On this mercatorprojection of the heart, the grey area is supplied by blood by the LAD and is at risk if this artery occludes.
Anterior MI can involve the anterior part of the heart and a part of the ventricular septum. Is supplied by blood by the LAD. Can lead to a cardiac aneurysm if not treated timely.
Proximal or distal occlusion of the LAD can be differentiated when looking at the ST elevation V1-V3 Zimetbaum
Characteristics of proximal LAD occlusion
ST-segment elevation in V1 (>2.5 mm) or RBBB with a pathologic Q wave or both (sens 12%, spec 100%)
ST-segment depression (>1 mm) in II, III and aVF (sens 34%, spec 98%)
Characteristics of distal LAD occlusion
Little ST-segment depression (<= 1 mm) or elevation in II, III, and aVF (sens 66%, spec 73%)
Another way to look at this is by assessing the axis of the ST vector. If it points upwards (with ST depression in II, III, and AVF) the proximal LAD is occluded. If it points downwards (with little ST depression or even elevation in II, III, and AVF) the distal LAD is occluded. An ECG that does not show any ST depression sugggests an occlusion after the origin of the first diagonal branch.
A more precise determination of the location of the occlusion can be made with below table.

Examples
A typical example of an acute anterior wall infarction.
Acute MI with proximal LAD occlusion
Large acute MI with LAD occlusion
Acute MI with LAD occlusion
A 2 weeks old anterior infarction with Q waves in V2-V4 and persisting ST elevation, a sign of formation of a cardiac aneurysm.
cute MI with LAD occlusion
A 2 days old anterior infarction with Q waves in V1-V4 with persisting ST elevation, a sign of formation of a cardiac aneurysm.
