activities foster life-threatening arrhythmias and may hasten disease progression. However, current guidelines recommend that patients may continue to pursue recreational athletic activity after a comprehensive evaluation and shared discussion with an expert specialist in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of potential risk (and the understanding that individual exercise risk cannot be precisely predicted [1]). Standard measures for treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy include beta-blockers and heart rate- limiting calcium channel blockers. On occasion, right ventricular pacing is used to treat outflow tract obstruction by purposefully inducing interventricular dyssynchrony. Cardiac resynchronization pacing therapy may be required in patients who have progressed to a dilated cardiomyopathy. For atrial tachyarrhythmias, standard treatment is used: rate-control with negative dromotropic medications (usually a beta-blocker), rhythm control (usually with amiodarone), and thromboembolic risk reduction (usually with warfarin or a direct acting oral anticoagulant). For ventricular arrhythmias, prevention of sudden death is with an ICD, which is recommended for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 35% and for patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or resuscitated cardiac arrest. Because of the higher risk of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, guidelines also that an ICD can be useful for patients with one or more of
