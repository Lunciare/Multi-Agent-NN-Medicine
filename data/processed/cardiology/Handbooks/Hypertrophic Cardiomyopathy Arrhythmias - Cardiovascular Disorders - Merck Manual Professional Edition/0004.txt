Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias

and exercise testing. Patients also should have regular (eg, annual) clinical follow-ups, including ECG, echocardiography, ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and exercise testing. Although genetic testing has a low sensitivity, it is still recommended to allow cascade screening of family members. Nevertheless, whether genetic findings predict future life-threatening arrhythmias 2/4 remains unclear. Family members also should have clinical evaluation (ie, to detect symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia and/or heart failure), ECG, and echocardiography. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy includes considering, and ruling out, other disorders that produce similar cardiac findings (phenocopies), including hypertensive heart disease, athlete's heart, cardiac amyloid, and Anderson-Fabry disease (1). Treatment of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias Moderation of physical activity For atrial fibrillation, antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy and anticoagulation for stroke prevention For ventricular arrhythmias, often an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Heart failure therapy (including transplantation) as required Outflow tract obstruction therapy as required (usually a beta-blocker but sometimes septal myomectomy, septal alcohol ablation, or cardiac myosin inhibitor therapy) Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have typically been advised to avoid athletic exertion because such activities foster life-threatening arrhythmias and may hasten disease progression. However, current guidelines recommend that patients may continue to pursue recreational athletic activity after a comprehensive evaluation and shared discussion with
