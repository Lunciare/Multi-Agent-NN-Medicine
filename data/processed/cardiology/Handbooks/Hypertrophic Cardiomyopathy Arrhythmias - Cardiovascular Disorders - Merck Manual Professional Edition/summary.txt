Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of a valvular, systemic, or metabolic cause. In addition to its hemodynamic consequences, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy predisposes to arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden death, and eventually end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope, and/or cardiac arrest. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. Treatment is usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy, and measures for heart failure. (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias.) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in general is reviewed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.
