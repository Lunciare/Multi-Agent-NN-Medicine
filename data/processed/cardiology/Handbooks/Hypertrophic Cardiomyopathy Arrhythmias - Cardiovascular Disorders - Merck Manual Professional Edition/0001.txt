Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of a valvular, systemic, or metabolic cause. In addition to its hemodynamic consequences, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy predisposes to arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden death, and eventually end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmias may cause palpitations, syncope, and/or cardiac arrest. Diagnosis includes ECG, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing. Treatment is usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy, and measures for heart failure. (See also Overview of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies and Overview of Arrhythmias.) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in general is reviewed elsewhere in THE MANUAL. This topic focuses on its arrhythmogenic features. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a congenital or acquired disorder characterized by marked ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction in the absence of increased afterload (eg, not due to valvular aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, systemic hypertension). Inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common (1/500) cardiac disorder (1), usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. The underlying etiology is one of more than 1500 reported mutations in genes encoding myofilament proteins of the sarcomere. Genetic testing is positive in 40 to 60% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2). The phenotype is very diverse but typically is characterized by left
