Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias

myofilament proteins of the sarcomere. Genetic testing is positive in 40 to 60% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (2). The phenotype is very diverse but typically is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) often accompanied by left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, atrial tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, sudden death, and end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (3). The LVH is typically asymmetrical, in which the anterior septum and anterior free wall are hypertrophied much more than is the posterior wall. Nevertheless, subtypes with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy or isolated left ventricular apical hypertrophy are recognized. Cardiac function is compromised because hypertrophy results in a stiff, noncompliant left ventricle that resists diastolic filling, elevating end-diastolic pressure and thus increasing pulmonary venous pressure. As resistance to filling increases, cardiac output decreases, an effect worsened by any outflow tract gradient present. Because tachycardia allows less time for filling, symptoms tend to appear (or worsen) mainly during exercise or tachyarrhythmias. (See also Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.) In regards to arrhythmias, the hypertrophy is associated with myofibril disarray, microvasculopathy, microvascular insufficiency, ischemia, and myocardial scarring, all of which predispose to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Atrial fibrillation is also very frequent and may be particularly poorly tolerated secondary
