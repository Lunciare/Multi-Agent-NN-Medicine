Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias

microvasculopathy, microvascular insufficiency, ischemia, and myocardial scarring, all of which predispose to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Atrial fibrillation is also very frequent and may be particularly poorly tolerated secondary to aggravation of ventricular diastolic dysfunction by rapid ventricular rates. Symptoms and signs often are exertional and include dyspnea, chest pain (usually resembling typical angina), palpitations, and syncope. The syncope may be caused by arrhythmia or outflow tract obstruction. Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias ECG, echocardiography, and often cardiac MRI Often ambulatory cardiac monitoring Genetic testing Screening of first-degree family members The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is suggested by an ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy and by characteristic clinical findings on physical examination. Diagnosis is confirmed by cardiac imaging, usually transthoracic echocardiography showing left ventricular hypertrophy, particularly asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy. A cardiac magnetic resonance examination using gadolinium is done if required to establish the diagnosis or to quantify left ventricular scarring when needed to further assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Arrhythmia evaluation usually includes ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring and exercise testing. Patients also should have regular (eg, annual) clinical follow-ups, including ECG, echocardiography, ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and exercise testing. Although genetic testing has a low sensitivity, it
