Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Arrhythmias

is arrhythmogenic, predisposing to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Cases may be inherited or acquired. Diagnosis is by ECG, echocardiography, and often cardiac MRI. Atrial tachyarrhythmias are treated with medications and ventricular dysrhythmias with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Exercise is not strictly prohibited provided appropriate evaluation and shared decision- making are done.
