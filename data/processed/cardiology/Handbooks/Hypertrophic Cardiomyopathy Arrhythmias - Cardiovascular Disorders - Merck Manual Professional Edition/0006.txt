cardiac arrest. Because of the higher risk of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, guidelines also that an ICD can be useful for patients with one or more of the following: sudden cardiac death in a close relative at age ≤ 50 years, left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 30 mm, syncope considered to be due to an arrhythmia, left ventricular apical aneurysm, or left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (class IIa recommendation) and may be considered for patients with extensive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI (a marker of ventricular scarring) or documented nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. (Class IIb recommendation) (1) (see table Indications for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators). Antiarrhythmic medications, usually amiodarone, are used to control frequently recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to frequent ICD interventions, particularly ICD shocks. Transcatheter ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate may also be used (1). Outflow tract obstruction also may be helped by beta-blockers and sometimes septal reduction therapy (surgical or by alcohol ablation) or cardiac myosin adenosine triphosphatase inhibition with mavacamten. Key Points Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is arrhythmogenic, predisposing to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Cases may be inherited or acquired. Diagnosis is by ECG, echocardiography, and often cardiac MRI. Atrial tachyarrhythmias are treated
