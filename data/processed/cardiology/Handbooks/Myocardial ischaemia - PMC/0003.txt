Myocardial ischaemia

wave <2/3 size of the R wave Height <10 mm As there are other causes of abnormally tall T waves and no commonly used criteria for the size of T waves, these changes are not always readily appreciated without comparison with a previous electrocardiogram. Flattened T waves are often seen in patients with myocardial ischaemia, but they are very non-specific. T wave inversion T wave inversion can be normal It occurs in leads III, aVR, and V1 (and in V2, but only in association with T wave inversion in lead V1) Myocardial ischaemia may also give rise to T wave inversion, but it must be remembered that inverted T waves are normal in leads III, aVR, and V1 in association with a predominantly negative QRS complex. T waves that are deep and symmetrically inverted (arrowhead) strongly suggest myocardial ischaemia. In some patients with partial thickness ischaemia the T waves show a biphasic pattern. This occurs particularly in the anterior chest leads and is an acute phenomenon. Biphasic T wave changes usually evolve and are often followed by symmetrical T wave inversion. These changes occur in patients with unstable or crescendo angina and strongly suggest myocardial ischaemia. ST segment depression Typically,
