A proportion of these patients, however, will have substantial proximal coronary artery stenosis. When ST segment elevation has occurred and 3/18 resolved it may be followed by deep T wave inversion even in the absence of enzyme evidence of myocardial damage. In patients with previous Q wave myocardial infarction the hallmark of new ischaemia is often ST segment elevation. This is thought to be associated with a wall motion abnormality, or bulging of the infarcted segment. It rarely indicates reinfarction in the same territory. When an electrocardiogram shows persistent T wave inversion accompanying the changes of a previous acute myocardial infarction, ischaemia in the same territory may cause “normalisation” of the T waves (return to an upright position). Alternatively, further ischaemia may make the T wave inversion more pronounced. Arrhythmias associated with acute myocardial ischaemia or infarction Ventricular myocardial ischaemia may be arrhythmogenic, and extrasystoles are common. It used to be thought that frequent extrasystoles of multifocal origin, bigeminy, couplets, or extrasystoles that fell on the T wave (R on T) conferred a bad prognosis in the early hours of myocardial infarction and predicted the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Clinical trials have clearly shown, however, that their suppression by antiarrhythmic
