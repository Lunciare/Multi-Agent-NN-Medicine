Myocardial ischaemia

12 lead electrocardiogram. Moreover, because the height of the R wave varies with respiration, the degree of ST depression in any one lead may vary from beat to beat. ST segment depression is usually not as marked in the inferior leads because here the R waves tend to be smaller. Substantial (⩾2 mm) and widespread (⩾2 leads) ST depression is a grave prognostic finding as it implies widespread myocardial ischaemia from extensive coronary artery disease. ST segment depression may be transient, and its resolution with treatment is reassuring. Modern equipment allows continuous ST segment monitoring. Serial changes in the electrocardiogram over a few hours or days, especially when the changes are associated with recurrent chest pain, are extremely helpful in confirming the presence of ischaemic heart disease; serial changes confer a worse prognosis, indicating the need for increased drug treatment or revascularisation interventions. ST segment elevation Transient ST segment elevation in patients with chest pain is a feature of ischaemia and is usually seen in vasospastic (variant or Prinzmetal's) angina. A proportion of these patients, however, will have substantial proximal coronary artery stenosis. When ST segment elevation has occurred and 3/18 resolved it may be followed by deep T wave
