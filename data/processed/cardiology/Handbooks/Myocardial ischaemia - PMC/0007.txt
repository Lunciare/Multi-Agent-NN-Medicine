Myocardial ischaemia

T) conferred a bad prognosis in the early hours of myocardial infarction and predicted the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Clinical trials have clearly shown, however, that their suppression by antiarrhythmic drugs had no effect on the frequency of subsequent ventricular fibrillation. Short runs of ventricular tachycardia are a bad prognostic sign and should probably be treated Ventricular fibrillation is the commonest unheralded fatal arrhythmia in the first 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction. The prognosis depends almost entirely on the patient's proximity to skilled medical help when the arrhythmia occurs. Cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation outside hospital is associated with a long term survival of about 10%, compared with an initial survival of 90% when cardiac arrest occurs after admission to a coronary care unit. Studies have shown that the key factor in prognosis is the speed with which electrical defibrillation is delivered. Tachycardias of supraventricular origin, with the exception of atrial fibrillation, are uncommon after myocardial infarction. Atrial fibrillation occurs in about 10% of patients and is more common in those with heart failure, diabetes, and valvular heart disease. It may be transient or persistent and is often a marker of haemodynamic instability 4/18 Heart block The artery supplying
