Myocardial ischaemia

pain but in the absence of frank infarction, they confer prognostic significance. About 20% of patients with ST segment depression and 15% with T wave inversion will experience severe angina, myocardial infarction, or death within 12 months of their initial presentation, compared with 10% of patients with a normal trace. Changes in the ST segment and T waves are not specific for ischaemia; they also occur in association with several other disease processes, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalaemia, and digoxin therapy. T wave changes Myocardial ischaemia can affect T wave morphology in a variety of ways: T waves may become tall, flattened, inverted, or biphasic. Tall T waves are one of the earliest changes seen in acute myocardial infarction, most often seen in the anterior chest leads. Isolated tall T waves in leads V1 to V3 may also be due to ischaemia of the posterior wall of the left ventricle (the mirror image of T wave inversion). Suggested criteria for size of T wave 1/8 size of the R wave <2/3 size of the R wave Height <10 mm As there are other causes of abnormally tall T waves and no commonly used criteria for the size of T
