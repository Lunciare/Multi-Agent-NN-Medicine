usually evolve and are often followed by symmetrical T wave inversion. These changes occur in patients with unstable or crescendo angina and strongly suggest myocardial ischaemia. ST segment depression Typically, myocardial ischaemia gives rise to ST segment depression. The normal ST segment usually blends with the T wave smoothly, making it difficult to determine where the ST segment ends and the T wave starts. One of the first and most subtle changes in the ST segment is flattening of the segment, resulting in a more obvious angle between the ST segment and T wave. More obvious changes comprise ST segment depression that is usually planar (horizontal) or downsloping. Whereas horizontal ST depression strongly suggests ischaemia, downsloping changes are less specific as they are also found in association with left ventricular hypertrophy and in patients taking digoxin. The degree of ST segment depression in any given lead is related to the size of the R wave. Thus, ST segment depression is usually most obvious in leads V4 to V6 of the 12 lead electrocardiogram. Moreover, because the height of the R wave varies with respiration, the degree of ST depression in any one lead may vary from beat to beat. ST
