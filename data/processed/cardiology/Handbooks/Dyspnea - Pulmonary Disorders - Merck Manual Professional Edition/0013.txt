Dyspnea

done as well unless symptoms are clearly caused by a mild or moderate exacerbation of a known condition. For example, patients with asthma or heart failure do not require a radiograph for each flare-up, unless clinical findings suggest another cause or an unusually severe attack. Most adults should have an ECG to detect myocardial ischemia (and serum cardiac biomarker testing if suspicion is high) unless myocardial ischemia can be excluded clinically. In patients with severe or deteriorating respiratory status, arterial blood gases (ABGs) should be measured to more precisely quantify PaO2 and PaCO2, diagnose acid-base disorders stimulating hyperventilation, and calculate the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Also, obtaining a basic metabolic panel to measure the bicarbonate level can be useful to assess the chronicity of a respiratory acidosis. Patients who have no clear diagnosis after chest radiograph and ECG and are at moderate or high risk of having pulmonary embolism (based on a clinical prediction rule) should undergo CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion scanning. Patients who are at low risk may have D-dimer testing (a normal D- dimer level effectively excludes pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient). See diagnostic criteria to determine the likelihood of a patient having a pulmonary embolism. Chronic dyspnea
