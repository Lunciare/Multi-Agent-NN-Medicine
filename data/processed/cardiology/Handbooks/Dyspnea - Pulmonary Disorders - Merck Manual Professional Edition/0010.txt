use, calf pain, leg swelling, and known deep venous thrombosis: For pulmonary embolism Environmental and occupational exposures (eg, gases, smoke, asbestos) should be investigated. Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever, tachycardia, hypoxia, and tachypnea. Examination focuses on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. A full lung examination should be performed, particularly including adequacy of air entry and exit, symmetry of breath sounds, and presence of crackles, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing. Signs of consolidation (eg, egophony, dullness to percussion) should be sought. The cervical, supraclavicular, and inguinal areas should be inspected and palpated for lymphadenopathy. Neck veins should be inspected for distention, and the legs and presacral area should be palpated for pitting edema (both suggesting heart failure). Heart sounds should be auscultated with notation of any extra heart sounds, muffled heart sounds, or murmurs. Testing for pulsus paradoxus (a > 12-mm Hg drop of systolic blood pressure during inspiration) can be done by inflating a blood pressure cuff to 20 mm Hg above the systolic pressure and then slowly deflating until the first Korotkoff sound is heard only during expiration. As the cuff is further deflated, the point at which the first Korotkoff sound is audible during both inspiration
