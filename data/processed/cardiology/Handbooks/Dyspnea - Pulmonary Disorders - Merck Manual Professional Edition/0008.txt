Dyspnea

pulmonary disease; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; EMG = electromyography; S2 = second heart sound; S3 = third heart sound. Pathophysiology of Dyspnea Although dyspnea is a relatively common problem, the pathophysiology of the uncomfortable sensation of breathing is poorly understood. Unlike those for other types of noxious stimuli, there are no specialized dyspnea receptors (although MRI studies have identified a few specific areas in the midbrain that may mediate perception of dyspnea). The experience of dyspnea likely results from a complex interaction between chemoreceptor stimulation, mechanical abnormalities in breathing, abnormalities in cardiac function or venous return, and the perception of those abnormalities by the central nervous system. Some authors have described the imbalance between neurologic stimulation and mechanical changes in the lungs and chest wall as neuromechanical uncoupling (1, 2). Evaluation of Dyspnea History History of present illness should cover the temporal onset (eg, abrupt, insidious) and duration. Severity can be determined by assessing the activity level required to cause dyspnea (eg, dyspnea at rest is typically more severe than dyspnea only when climbing stairs). Healthcare professionals should note how much dyspnea has changed from the patient’s usual state. Precipitating or exacerbating factors (eg, allergen exposure, cold,
