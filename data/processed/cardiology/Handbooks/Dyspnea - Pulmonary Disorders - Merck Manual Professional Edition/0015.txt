acute myocardial infarction unless the patient has hypoxia (1). Morphine (eg, 0.5 to 5 mg IV) helps reduce anxiety and the discomfort of dyspnea in various conditions, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and the dyspnea that commonly accompanies terminal illness. However, opioids should be used with caution in patients with acute airflow limitation (eg, asthma, COPD) because they suppress the ventilatory drive and can worsen respiratory acidemia. Key Points Pulse oximetry is a key component of the examination. Low oxygen saturation (< 90%) indicates a serious condition, but normal saturation does not exclude one. Accessory muscle use, a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation, or a decreased level of consciousness requires emergent evaluation and hospitalization. Myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism are relatively common, but their symptoms and signs can be nonspecific. Exacerbation of known conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure) is common, but patients may also develop new conditions.
