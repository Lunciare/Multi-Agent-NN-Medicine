(eg, elevated Chest radiograph Heart failure neck veins, peripheral Echocardiography edema) Orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Loud S2, parasternal Echocardiography heave, elevated jugular Pulmonary hypertension venous pressure, murmur Right heart catheterization of tricuspid regurgitation Substernal chest pressure with or without radiation ECG to the arm or jaw, often Cardiac stress testing Stable angina or CAD provoked by physical exertion, particularly in Sometimes cardiac patients with risk factors catheterization for CAD Other causes Normal lung examination and pulse oximetry measurement Anemia Complete blood count Sometimes systolic heart murmur due to increased flow 7/12 Cause Suggestive Findings Diagnostic Approach† Dyspnea only on exertion History and physical Physical deconditioning in patients with sedentary examination lifestyle * Chronic dyspnea that has lasted for weeks to years. In many of these disorders, dyspnea is initially present on exertion before progressing to dyspnea at rest. † Most patients should have pulse oximetry and, unless symptoms are clearly a mild exacerbation of a known chronic disease, chest radiograph. CAD = coronary artery disease; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; EMG = electromyography; S2 = second heart sound; S3 = third heart sound. Pathophysiology of Dyspnea Although dyspnea is a relatively
