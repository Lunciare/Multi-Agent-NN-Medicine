Dyspnea

testing (a normal D- dimer level effectively excludes pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient). See diagnostic criteria to determine the likelihood of a patient having a pulmonary embolism. Chronic dyspnea may warrant additional tests, such as CT, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and bronchoscopy. If initial workup is inconclusive, cardiopulmonary exercise testing can be considered. CLINICAL CALCULATORS A-a Gradient Treatment of Dyspnea Treatment is correction of the underlying disorder. Hypoxemia (in the absence of compensatory hyperventilation) is treated with supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation > 88% or PaO2 > 55 mm Hg (> 7.3 kPa) because levels above these thresholds provide adequate oxygen delivery to tissues. Levels below these thresholds are on the steep portion of the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve, where even a small decline in arterial oxygen tension can result in a large decline in hemoglobin saturation. Oxygen saturation should be maintained at > 93% if myocardial or cerebral ischemia is a concern, although data suggest that 11/12 supplemental oxygen is not beneficial in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction unless the patient has hypoxia (1). Morphine (eg, 0.5 to 5 mg IV) helps reduce anxiety and the discomfort of dyspnea in various conditions, including myocardial infarction,
