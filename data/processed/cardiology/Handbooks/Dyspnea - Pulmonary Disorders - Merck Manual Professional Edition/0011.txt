deflating until the first Korotkoff sound is heard only during expiration. As the cuff is further deflated, the point at which the first Korotkoff sound is audible during both inspiration and expiration is 9/12 recorded. If the difference between the first and second measurement is > 12 mm Hg, then pulsus paradoxus is present. Conjunctiva should be examined for pallor. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Dyspnea at rest during examination Decreased level of consciousness or agitation or confusion Accessory muscle use and poor air excursion Chest pain Crackles Weight loss Night sweats Palpitations Interpretation of findings The history and physical examination often suggest a cause and guide further testing (see tables Some Causes of Acute Dyspnea, Some Causes of Subacute Dyspnea, and Some Causes of Chronic Dyspnea) (1). Several findings are of note: Wheezing suggests asthma or COPD, although it can occur with other disease processes such as heart failure, paradoxical vocal fold motion, tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, relapsing polychondritis, and bronchiolitis. Stridor suggests extrathoracic airway obstruction (eg, foreign body, epiglottitis, vocal fold dysfunction). Crackles suggest left heart failure, interstitial lung disease, or, if accompanied by signs of consolidation, pneumonia. However, the symptoms and signs of life-threatening
