more severe than dyspnea only when climbing stairs). Healthcare professionals should note how much dyspnea has changed from the patient’s usual state. Precipitating or exacerbating factors (eg, allergen exposure, cold, exertion, supine position) and relieving factors should be identified. Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including chest pain or pressure (pulmonary embolism, myocardial ischemia, pneumonia); dependent edema, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (heart failure); fever, chills, cough, and sputum production (pneumonia); black, tarry stools or heavy menses (occult bleeding, possibly causing anemia); and weight loss or night sweats (cancer or chronic lung infection). Past medical history should cover disorders known to cause dyspnea, including asthma, COPD, and heart disease, as well as risk factors for the different etiologies: Smoking history: For cancer, COPD, some interstitial lung diseases, and heart disease Family history, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels: For coronary artery disease Recent immobilization or surgery, recent long-distance travel, cancer or risk factors for or signs of occult cancer, prior or family history of clotting, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, calf pain, leg swelling, and known deep venous thrombosis: For pulmonary embolism Environmental and occupational exposures (eg, gases, smoke, asbestos) should be investigated. Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed
