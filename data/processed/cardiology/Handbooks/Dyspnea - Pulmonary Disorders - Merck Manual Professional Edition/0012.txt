Dyspnea

(eg, foreign body, epiglottitis, vocal fold dysfunction). Crackles suggest left heart failure, interstitial lung disease, or, if accompanied by signs of consolidation, pneumonia. However, the symptoms and signs of life-threatening conditions such as myocardial ischemia and pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific. Furthermore, the severity of symptoms is not always proportional to the severity of the cause (eg, pulmonary embolism in a fit, healthy person may cause only mild dyspnea). Thus, a high degree of suspicion for these common conditions is prudent. It is often appropriate to exclude these conditions before attributing dyspnea to a less serious etiology. Consideration of pre-test probability and sometimes clinical prediction rules can help estimate the likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Note that normal oxygen saturation does not exclude pulmonary embolism. Hyperventilation syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Because hypoxia may also cause tachypnea and agitation, it should not be assumed that every rapidly breathing, anxious young person merely has hyperventilation syndrome. 10/12 Testing Pulse oximetry should be performed in all patients, and chest radiography should be done as well unless symptoms are clearly caused by a mild or moderate exacerbation of a known condition. For example, patients with asthma or heart failure do not require a
