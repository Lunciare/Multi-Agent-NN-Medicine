volume Chest radiograph overload (eg, elevated Heart failure BNP measurement neck veins, peripheral edema) Echocardiography Orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea Muffled heart sounds or enlarged cardiac silhouette in patients with risk factors for pericardial Pericardial effusion or effusion (eg, cancer, Echocardiography tamponade pericarditis, SLE) Possibly pulsus paradoxus Orthopnea Other causes Basic metabolic panel Metabolic acidosis Tachypnea ABG measurement Tachycardia, warm skin, lid lag and exophthalmos TSH and free T4 Hyperthyroidism (thyroid eye disease), measurement tremor * Subacute dyspnea occurs within hours or days. † Most patients should have pulse oximetry and, unless symptoms are clearly a mild exacerbation of a known chronic disease, chest radiograph. ABG = arterial blood gas; BNP = brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide; CAD = coronary artery disease; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECG = electrocardiogram; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; S3 = third heart sound; T4 = thyroxine; TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. 5/12 TABLE Some Causes of Chronic* Dyspnea Cause Suggestive Findings Diagnostic Approach† Pulmonary causes Progressive dyspnea and cough Occupational and environmental exposure (occupational lung disease such as silicosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis) may be High-resolution chest CT Interstitial lung disease present Pulmonary function Smoking history, family testing history, medication history, or radiation history may
