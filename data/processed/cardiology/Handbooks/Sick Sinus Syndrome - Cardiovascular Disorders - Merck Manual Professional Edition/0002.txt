KEYWORDS: sinus, syndrome, sick, sick sinus, sinus syndrome, node, atrial, symptoms, sinus node, ecg, pacemaker, heart, block, dysfunction, node dysfunction

In first-degree SA block, the SA node impulse exit conduction is merely slowed, and, in the absence of another disorder, the ECG is normal and there are no symptoms. In type I second-degree SA (SA Wenckebach) block, impulse exit conduction slows before blocking, seen on the ECG as a P-P interval that decreases progressively until the P wave drops altogether, creating a pause and the appearance of grouped beats; the duration of the pause is less than 2 P-P cycles. In type II second-degree SA block, impulse exit conduction is blocked without slowing beforehand, producing a pause that is a multiple (usually twice) of the P-P interval and the appearance of grouped beats. In third-degree SA block, impulse exit conduction is blocked; normal P waves are absent, giving the appearance of sinus arrest. Chronotropic incompetence refers to the inability to increase sinus heart rate with exercise most commonly defined as achievement of less than 80% of the maximum age-predicted heart rate (220 beats/minute minus the person's age) on an exercise tolerance test (1). Etiology of Sick Sinus Syndrome The most common cause of intrinsic sinus node dysfunction in the sick sinus syndrome is Idiopathic SA node fibrosis, which may be
