(Sinus Node Dysfunction) Sick sinus syndrome refers to sinus node dysfunction causing slow, physiologically inappropriate, heart rates. Symptoms may be minimal or include weakness, effort intolerance, palpitations, and syncope. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Patients who have symptoms require a pacemaker. Sick sinus syndrome includes Inappropriate sinus bradycardia Alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias (bradycardia-tachycardia, or brady- tachy syndrome) Sinus pause or sinus arrest Sinoatrial (SA) exit block Chronotropic incompetence Sick sinus syndrome affects mainly older patients, especially those with another cardiac disorder or diabetes. In the brady-tachy variant of the sick sinus syndrome, sinus node dysfunction is associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation. Sinus pause is temporary cessation of sinus node activity, seen on electrocardiography (ECG) as disappearance of P waves for seconds to minutes. The pause usually triggers escape activity in lower pacemakers (eg, atrial or junctional), preserving heart rate and function, but long pauses cause dizziness and syncope. In SA exit block, the SA node depolarizes, but conduction of impulses to atrial tissue (exit conduction) is impaired. In first-degree SA block, the SA node impulse exit conduction is merely slowed, and, in the absence of another disorder, the ECG is normal and there are no symptoms. In
