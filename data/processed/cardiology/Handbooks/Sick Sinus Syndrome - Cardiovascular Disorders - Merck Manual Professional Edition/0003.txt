Sick Sinus Syndrome

tolerance test (1). Etiology of Sick Sinus Syndrome The most common cause of intrinsic sinus node dysfunction in the sick sinus syndrome is Idiopathic SA node fibrosis, which may be accompanied by degeneration of lower elements of the conducting system, manifested as concomitant atrioventricular (AV block and/or bundle branch block) Other causes of sick sinus syndrome include sleep apnea, medications, excessive vagal tone, and many ischemic, inflammatory, and infiltrative disorders (1). Symptoms and Signs of Sick Sinus Syndrome Many patients with sick sinus syndrome are asymptomatic. Depending on the heart rate, all the symptoms of bradycardias and, in the case of the brady-tachy variant of the sick sinus syndrome, all the symptoms of tachycardias can occur. Syncope may occur when the sinus node does not immediately resume function after spontaneous termination of an atrial tachyarrhythmia. Diagnosis of Sick Sinus Syndrome ECG Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to rule out hypothyroidism Ambulatory ECG monitor Exercise tolerance testing for chronotropic incompetence Rarely, implantable cardiac monitoring or a catheter electrophysiologic study A slow, irregular pulse suggests the diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction, which is confirmed by ECG, rhythm strip, or continuous 24-hour ECG recording. Some patients present with atrial fibrillation, and the
