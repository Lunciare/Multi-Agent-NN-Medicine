Sick Sinus Syndrome

pacemaker implantation (1). Risk of atrial fibrillation is reduced when a physiologic (atrial or atrioventricular) pacemaker rather than a ventricular pacemaker is used (2). Dual-chamber pacemakers that minimize ventricular pacing may further reduce risk of atrial fibrillation (2). Dual-chamber pacemakers also further protect patients in the group who experience a 1 to 2% expected annual occurrence of AV block (3). Antiarrhythmic medications may prevent paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias after pacemaker insertion. Theophylline and hydralazine are options to increase heart rate in healthy, younger patients who have symptomatic bradycardia without syncope, but these medications are rarely used for this purpose. Prognosis for Sick Sinus Syndrome Sinus node dysfunction in the sick sinus syndrome tends worsen over time. The prognosis is otherwise mixed; mortality is about 4%/year, primarily resulting from an underlying structural heart disorder (1). Each year, about 5% of patients develop atrial fibrillation with its risks of heart failure and stroke (2). Key Points Sick sinus syndrome results in inappropriately slow heart rates. Symptoms may be absent or result from bradycardia. In the brady-tachy variant of the sick sinus syndrome, symptoms may also result from tachycardia or asystole when tachycardia terminates. Diagnosis is mainly by electrocardiographic monitoring. Symptomatic sick sinus syndrome is
