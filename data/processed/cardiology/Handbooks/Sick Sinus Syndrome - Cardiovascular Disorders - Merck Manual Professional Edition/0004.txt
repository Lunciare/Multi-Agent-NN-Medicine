slow, irregular pulse suggests the diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction, which is confirmed by ECG, rhythm strip, or continuous 24-hour ECG recording. Some patients present with atrial fibrillation, and the underlying sinus node dysfunction manifests only after conversion to sinus rhythm with post- conversion sinus pause. The goal of ECG monitoring is to establish a correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmia. If suggested by a history and physical examination, targeted evaluation is performed, including measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for suspected hypothyroidism, polysomnography for suspected sleep apnea, exercise tolerance testing for suspected chronotropic incompetence, and echocardiography for suspected structural heart disease (1). When symptoms compatible with the sick sinus syndrome are very infrequent, implantable cardiac monitoring may be required to enable correlation between symptoms and rhythm. Infrequently, the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome is made during a catheter electrophysiologic study done for the evaluation of syncope of unknown etiology. Treatment of Sick Sinus Syndrome Pacemaker Treatment of symptomatic sick sinus syndrome in the absence of an extrinsic reversible cause is pacemaker implantation (1). Risk of atrial fibrillation is reduced when a physiologic (atrial or atrioventricular) pacemaker rather than a ventricular pacemaker is used (2). Dual-chamber pacemakers that minimize ventricular pacing
