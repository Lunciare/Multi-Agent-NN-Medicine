(Sinus Node Dysfunction) Sick sinus syndrome refers to sinus node dysfunction causing slow, physiologically inappropriate, heart rates. Symptoms may be minimal or include weakness, effort intolerance, palpitations, and syncope. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Patients who have symptoms require a pacemaker. Sick sinus syndrome includes Inappropriate sinus bradycardia Alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias (bradycardia-tachycardia, or brady- tachy syndrome) Sinus pause or sinus arrest Sinoatrial (SA) exit block Chronotropic incompetence Sick sinus syndrome affects mainly older patients, especially those with another cardiac disorder or diabetes. In the brady-tachy variant of the sick sinus syndrome, sinus node dysfunction is associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation.
