with an increased risk of bleeding (5). For elective neurosurgery, spinal cord injury, or multiple trauma, low-dose LMWH, as the first option, or low-dose UFH is recommended. For patients undergoing neurosurgery, physical measures (IPC, elastic stockings) have been used because intracranial bleeding is a concern; however, LMWH appears to be an acceptable alternative. Limited data support the combination of IPC, elastic stockings, and LMWH in patients with spinal cord injury or multiple trauma. 6/8 Preventive treatment is also indicated for patients who have a major medical illnesses that require bed rest (eg, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure). Low-dose UFH or LMWH is effective in patients who are not already receiving IV heparin or thrombolytics; IPC, elastic stockings, or both may be used when anticoagulants are contraindicated. For select patients with cancer who are at high risk (eg, those with advanced pancreatic cancer) who are receiving chemotherapy, primary prophylaxis with LMWH or certain direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban or rivaroxaban) may be considered (6, 7, 8, 9). Prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome In patients with symptomatic DVT who develop symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome (eg, leg swelling, pain, aching), the use of knee-high compression stockings providing 30 to 40 mm Hg pressure is
