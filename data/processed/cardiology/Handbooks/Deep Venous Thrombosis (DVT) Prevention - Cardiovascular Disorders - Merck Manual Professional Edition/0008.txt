In patients with symptomatic DVT who develop symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome (eg, leg swelling, pain, aching), the use of knee-high compression stockings providing 30 to 40 mm Hg pressure is recommended, although stockings with lower tension (20 to 30 mm Hg) can be considered if patients are unable to tolerate the higher tension stockings. However, the routine use of stockings in all patients who have had a DVT has been questioned by data from a meta-analysis of randomized trials, in which the use of compression stockings compared with placebo (none or sham-compression stockings) did not show a significant decrease in post-thrombotic syndrome) (10). Key Points Treatment to prevent deep venous thrombosis is required for patients who are bedbound with major illness and/or those undergoing certain surgical procedures. Early mobilization, leg elevation, and an anticoagulant are the recommended preventive measures; patients who should not receive anticoagulants may benefit from intermittent pneumatic compression devices or elastic stockings.
