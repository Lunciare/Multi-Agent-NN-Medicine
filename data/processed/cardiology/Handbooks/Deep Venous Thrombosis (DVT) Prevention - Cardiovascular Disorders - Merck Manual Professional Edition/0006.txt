Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Prevention

because alternative anticoagulants such as LMWHs and direct oral anticoagulants are easier to administer. Direct oral anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are at least as effective and safe as LMWH for preventing DVT and PE after hip or knee replacement surgery but are more expensive than warfarin, and their cost-effectiveness requires further study (3). With DVT prophylaxis, there is always a risk of bleeding during use of anticoagulants. DVT prophylaxis in selected populations For hip and other lower extremity orthopedic surgery, selected direct oral anticoagulants (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban), LMWH, fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose warfarin is recommended. For patients undergoing total knee replacement and some other patients at high risk in whom anticoagulants cannot be given because of a high risk of bleeding, IPC is also beneficial. For orthopedic surgery, preventive treatment may be started before or after surgery and continued for at least 14 days. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once a day appears to be more effective to prevent DVT than LMWH for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery but may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding (5). For elective neurosurgery, spinal cord injury, or multiple trauma, low-dose LMWH, as the first option, or low-dose UFH is recommended. For patients undergoing
