KEYWORDS: patients, dvt, risk, surgery, anticoagulants, stockings, undergoing, lmwh, ipc, compression, low-dose, use, direct, direct oral, prophylaxis

It is preferable and safer to prevent deep venous thrombosis (DVT) than to treat it, particularly in patients who are at high risk (see table Risk of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism). DVT prophylaxis begins with risk assessment. Risk, along with other factors, allows the proper preventive modality to be selected. Preventive measures include Prevention of immobility Prophylactic anticoagulation (eg, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, adjusted- dose warfarin, direct oral anticoagulant) Intermittent pneumatic compression Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters do not prevent DVT but are sometimes placed in an attempt to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE). An IVC filter may be used to help prevent PE in patients with lower extremity DVT who have contraindications to anticoagulant therapy or in patients with recurrent DVT (or emboli) despite adequate anticoagulation. Despite widespread use of IVC filters, efficacy in preventing PE is unstudied and unproven. (See also Deep Venous Thrombosis.) Risk Assessment in DVT Prevention Patients at low risk of DVT (eg, those who are undergoing minor surgery but have no clinical risk factors for DVT, those who must be temporarily inactive for long periods, as during a prolonged [> 6 hour] airplane flight) should be encouraged to walk or otherwise move
