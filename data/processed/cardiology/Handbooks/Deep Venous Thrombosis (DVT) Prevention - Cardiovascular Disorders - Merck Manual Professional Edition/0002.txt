Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Prevention

risk factors for DVT, those who must be temporarily inactive for long periods, as during a prolonged [> 6 hour] airplane flight) should be encouraged to walk or otherwise move their legs periodically; no medical treatment is needed. Dorsiflexion 10 times/hour is probably sufficient. Patients at higher risk of DVT include those undergoing minor surgery if they have clinical risk factors for DVT; those undergoing major surgery, especially orthopedic surgery, even without risk factors; and bedbound patients with major medical illnesses (eg, most patients being treated in a critical care unit, other patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic liver disease, stroke). These patients require additional preventive treatment (see table Risk of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism). Most of these patients can be identified and should receive DVT prophylaxis. Hospitalization itself is not considered a risk factor, and patients who are hospitalized but not in one of these categories do not require routine DVT prophylaxis. Nonmajor surgery is defined here as an operation that does not involve general anesthesia or respiratory assistance. DOAC = direct oral anticoagulant; DVT = deep venous thrombosis; PE = pulmonary embolism; LDUH = low-dose unfractionated heparin; LMWH = low molecular weight
