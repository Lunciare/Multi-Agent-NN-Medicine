Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) Prevention

limited to patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery (1). Low-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) 5000 units subcutaneously is given 2 hours before surgery and every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 to 10 days or until patients are fully ambulatory. Patients who bedbound but are not undergoing surgery are given 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours until risk factors are reversed. LMWHs are more effective than low-dose UFH for preventing DVT and PE (2, 3, 4), but widespread use is limited by cost. Enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours, dalteparin 5000 units subcutaneously once a day, and tinzaparin 4500 units subcutaneously once a day appear to be equally effective. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously once a day is at least as effective as LMWH in patients who are undergoing nonorthopedic surgery and is possibly more effective than LMWHs after orthopedic surgery (5). Warfarin, using a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0, is proven to be effective in orthopedic surgery but is being used less frequently because alternative anticoagulants such as LMWHs and direct oral anticoagulants are easier to administer. Direct oral anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) are at least as effective and safe as LMWH
