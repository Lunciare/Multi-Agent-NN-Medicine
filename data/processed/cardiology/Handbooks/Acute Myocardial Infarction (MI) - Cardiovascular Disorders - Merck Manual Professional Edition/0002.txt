Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia (1). These conditions can be satisfied by a rise of cardiac biomarkers (preferably cardiac troponin [cTn]) above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) plus at least one of the following: Symptoms of ischemia ECG changes indicative of new ischemia (significant ST/T changes or left bundle branch block) Development of pathologic Q waves Imaging evidence of new loss of myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality Angiography or autopsy evidence of intracoronary thrombus Slightly different criteria are used to diagnose MI during and after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, and as the cause of sudden death. MI can be classified into 5 types based on etiology and circumstances (1): Type 1: Spontaneous MI caused by ischemia due to a primary coronary event (eg, plaque rupture, erosion, or fissuring; coronary dissection) Type 2: Ischemia due to increased oxygen demand (eg, hypertension), or decreased supply (eg, coronary artery spasm or embolism, arrhythmia, hypotension) Type 3: Related to sudden unexpected cardiac death Type 4a: Associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction with cTn values > 5 × 99th percentile URL) Type 4b: Associated with
