Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

with STEMI. Mortality rates tend to be higher in females and in patients with diabetes. 17/22 Most fatalities among patients who survive initial hospitalization occur in the first 3 to 4 months. Persistent ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure, poor ventricular function, and recurrent ischemia indicate high risk. Many authorities recommend stress ECG before hospital discharge or within 6 weeks of MI. Good exercise performance without ECG abnormalities is associated with a favorable prognosis; further evaluation is usually not required. Poor exercise performance is associated with a poor prognosis. Cardiac performance after recovery depends largely on how much functioning myocardium survives the acute attack. Acute damage adds to scars from previous infarcts. When left ventricular dysfunction is significant, long term survival is lower.
