Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

elevation in leads I, aVL, V , and V and reciprocal 4 6 depression in other leads. Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction (after the first 24 hours) ST segments are less elevated; significant Q waves develop and R waves are lost in leads I, aVL, V , and V . 4 6 6/22 Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction (several days later) Significant Q waves and loss of R-wave voltage persist. ST segments are now essentially isoelectric. The ECG will probably change only slowly over the next several months. Acute Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction (tracing obtained within a few hours of onset of illness) There is hyperacute ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF and reciprocal depression in other leads. Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction (after the first 24 hours) Significant Q waves develop with decreasing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction (several days later) ST segments are now isoelectric. Abnormal Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF indicate that myocardial scars persist. Pathologic Q waves are not necessary for the diagnosis. The ECG must be read carefully because ST- segment elevation may be subtle, particularly in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF);
