or near bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI. CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; GP = glycoprotein; NSTEMI = Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; PCI = percutaneous intervention; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Pharmacologic treatment of acute myocardial infarction All patients should be given antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and if chest pain is present, antianginal drugs. The specific medications used depend on the reperfusion strategy and other factors; their selection and use is discussed in Medications for Acute Coronary Syndrome. Other medications, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins, should also be given (see table Medications for Coronary Artery Disease). Patients with acute myocardial infarction should be given the following (unless contraindicated): Antiplatelet agents: Aspirin, clopidogrel, or both (prasugrel or ticagrelor are alternatives to clopidogrel) Anticoagulants: A heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) or bivalirudin Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor when PCI is done Antianginal therapy usually nitroglycerin Beta-blocker ACE inhibitor Statin All patients are given aspirin 160 to 325 mg (not enteric-coated), if not contraindicated, at presentation and 81 mg once a day indefinitely thereafter. Chewing the first dose before swallowing quickens absorption. Aspirin reduces short-term and long-term mortality risk. In patients undergoing PCI, a loading dose
