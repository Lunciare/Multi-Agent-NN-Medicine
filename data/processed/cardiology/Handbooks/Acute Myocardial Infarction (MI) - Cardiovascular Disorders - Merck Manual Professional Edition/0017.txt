Acute MI Prehospital care: Oxygen, aspirin, nitrates, and triage to an appropriate medical center Pharmacologic therapy: Antiplatelet agents, antianginal drugs, anticoagulants, and in some cases other medications Reperfusion therapy: Fibrinolytics or angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery Post-discharge rehabilitation and chronic medical management of coronary artery disease Choice of pharmacologic therapy and choice of reperfusion strategy are discussed elsewhere. Prehospital care Oxygen Aspirin Nitrates Triage to appropriate medical center A reliable IV route must be established, oxygen given (typically 2 L by nasal cannula), and continuous single-lead ECG monitoring started. Prehospital interventions by emergency medical personnel (including ECG, chewed aspirin [160 to 325 mg], and pain management with nitrates) can reduce risk of mortality and complications. Early diagnostic data and response to treatment can help determine the need for and timing of revascularization. Hospital admission Risk-stratify patient and choose reperfusion strategy Pharmacologic therapy with antiplatelets, anticoagulants and other medications based on reperfusion strategy On arrival to the emergency department, the patient's diagnosis is confirmed. Pharmacologic therapy and timing of revascularization depend on the clinical picture and diagnosis. 11/22 For STEMI, reperfusion strategy can include fibrinolytic therapy or immediate PCI. For patients with NSTEMI, angiography may be
