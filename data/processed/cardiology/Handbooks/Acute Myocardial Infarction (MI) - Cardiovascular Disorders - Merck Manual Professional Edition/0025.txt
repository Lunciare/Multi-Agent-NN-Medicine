Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

ECG before or nuclear scanning or after discharge Pharmacologic stress Pharmacologic stress Unable to exercise testing (echocardiography testing (echocardiography or nuclear scanning) or nuclear scanning) The acute illness and treatment of myocardial infarction should be used to strongly motivate the patient to modify risk factors. Evaluating the patient’s physical and emotional status and discussing them with the patient, advising about lifestyle (eg, smoking, diet, work and play habits, exercise), and aggressively managing risk factors may improve prognosis. On discharge, all patients should be on appropriate antiplatelet agents, statins, antianginals, and other medications based on comorbidities. Prognosis for Acute MI Risk should be estimated via formal clinical risk scores (eg, Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI]— see tables Mortality Risk at 30 Days in STEMI and Risk of Adverse Events at 14 Days in Unstable Angina or NSTEMI) or a combination of the following high-risk features: Recurrent angina/ischemia at rest or during low-level activity Heart failure Worsening mitral regurgitation High-risk stress test result (test stopped in ≤ 5 minutes due to symptoms, marked ECG abnormalities, hypotension, or complex ventricular arrhythmias) Hemodynamic instability Sustained ventricular tachycardia Diabetes mellitus PCI within past 6 months Prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) LV ejection fraction <
