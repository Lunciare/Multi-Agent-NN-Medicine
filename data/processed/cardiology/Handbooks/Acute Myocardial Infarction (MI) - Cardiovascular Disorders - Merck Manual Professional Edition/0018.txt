Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

and timing of revascularization depend on the clinical picture and diagnosis. 11/22 For STEMI, reperfusion strategy can include fibrinolytic therapy or immediate PCI. For patients with NSTEMI, angiography may be done within 24 to 48 hours of admission if the patient is clinically stable. If the patient is unstable (eg, ongoing symptoms, hypotension, or sustained arrhythmias), then angiography must be done immediately (see figure Approach to Myocardial Infarction). 12/22 Approach to Myocardial Infarction * Morphine should be used judiciously (eg, if nitroglycerin is contraindicated or if the patient has symptoms despite nitroglycerin therapy). Data suggest that morphine attenuates activity of some P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and may contribute to worse patient outcomes. † Complicated means that the hospital course was complicated by recurrent angina or infarction, heart failure, or sustained recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Absence of any of these events is termed uncomplicated. ‡ CABG is generally preferred to PCI for patients with the following: Left main or left main equivalent disease Left ventricular dysfunction Diabetes 13/22 Also, lesions that are long or near bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI. CABG = coronary artery bypass grafting; GP = glycoprotein; NSTEMI = Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; PCI = percutaneous intervention; STEMI
