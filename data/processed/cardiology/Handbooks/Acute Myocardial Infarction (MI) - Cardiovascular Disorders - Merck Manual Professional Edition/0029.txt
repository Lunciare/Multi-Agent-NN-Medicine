TABLE Risk of Adverse Events* at 14 Days in Unstable Angina or NSTEMI Scoring Risk Factor Points Age > 65 years 1 CAD risk factors (must have ≥ 3 for 1 point): Family history Hypertension 1 Current smoking High cholesterol Diabetes mellitus Known CAD (stenosis ≥ 50%) 1 Previous chronic use of aspirin 1 Two episodes of rest angina in past 24 1 hours Elevated cardiac biomarkers 1 ST elevation ≥ 0.5 mm 1 1–2 = low Risk level is based on total points: 3–4 = intermediate 5–7 = high Absolute risk Total Points Risk of Events at 14 Days (%)* 0 or 1 4.7 20/22 Scoring Risk Factor Points 2 8.3 3 13.2 4 19.9 5 26.2 6 or 7 40.9 * Events include all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. CAD = coronary artery disease; MI = myocardial infarction; NSTEMI = non–ST-segment elevation MI; TIMI = thrombolysis in MI. Based on data from Antman EM et al:
