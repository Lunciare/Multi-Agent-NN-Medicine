Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

a fourth heart sound is almost universally present. A soft systolic blowing apical murmur (reflecting papillary muscle dysfunction) may occur. During initial examination, a friction rub or more striking murmurs suggest a preexisting heart disorder or another diagnosis. Detection of a friction rub within a few hours after onset of MI symptoms suggests acute pericarditis rather than MI. However, friction rubs, usually evanescent, are common on days 2 and 3 post-STEMI. The chest wall is tender when palpated in some patients. In right ventricular (RV) infarction, signs include elevated RV filling pressure, distended jugular veins (often with Kussmaul sign), clear lung fields, and hypotension. Diagnosis of Acute MI Serial ECGs Serial cardiac biomarkers Immediate coronary angiography (unless fibrinolytics are given) for patients with STEMI or complications (eg, persistent chest pain, hypotension, markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, unstable arrhythmias) Delayed coronary angiography (within 24 to 48 hours) for patients with NSTEMI without complications (See also algorithm Approach to Acute Myocardial Infarction.) Evaluation begins with initial and serial ECG and serial measurements of cardiac biomarkers to help distinguish between unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non–ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This distinction is the center of the decision pathway because
