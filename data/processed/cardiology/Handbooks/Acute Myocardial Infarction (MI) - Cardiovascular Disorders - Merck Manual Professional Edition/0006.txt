mechanism for MINOCA in each patient. 3/22 Symptoms and Signs of Acute MI Symptoms of NSTEMI and STEMI are the same. Days to weeks before the event, about two thirds of patients experience prodromal symptoms, including unstable or crescendo angina, dyspnea, and fatigue. Usually, the first symptom of infarction is deep, substernal, visceral pain, described as aching or pressure, often radiating to the back, jaw, left arm, right arm, shoulders, or all of these areas. The pain is similar to angina pectoris but is usually more severe and long-lasting; more often accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, and/or vomiting; and relieved little or only temporarily by rest or nitroglycerin. However, discomfort may be mild; approximately 20% of acute MIs are silent (1). Silent MIs are those that are asymptomatic or are causing vague symptoms that are not recognized as illness by the patient. Silent MIs more commonly occur in patients with diabetes or a history of known coronary artery disease. Patients often interpret their discomfort as indigestion, particularly because spontaneous relief may be falsely attributed to belching or antacid consumption. Silent ischemia sometimes manifests as transient asymptomatic ST-T abnormalities seen during stress testing or 24-hour Holter monitoring. Radionuclide studies can sometimes
