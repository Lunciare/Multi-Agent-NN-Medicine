may be falsely attributed to belching or antacid consumption. Silent ischemia sometimes manifests as transient asymptomatic ST-T abnormalities seen during stress testing or 24-hour Holter monitoring. Radionuclide studies can sometimes document asymptomatic myocardial ischemia during physical or mental stress. Silent ischemia and angina pectoris may coexist, occurring at different times. Some patients present with syncope. Females are more likely to present with atypical chest discomfort; however, even when presenting with typical symptoms, MI is more often unrecognized in them (2). Older patients may report dyspnea more than ischemic-type chest pain. In severe ischemic episodes, the patient often has significant pain and feels restless and apprehensive. Nausea and vomiting may occur, especially with inferior MI. Dyspnea and weakness due to LV failure, pulmonary edema, shock, or significant arrhythmia may dominate. Skin may be pale, cool, and diaphoretic. Peripheral or central cyanosis may be present. Pulse may be thready, and blood pressure is variable, although many patients initially have some degree of 4/22 hypertension during pain. Heart sounds are usually somewhat distant; a fourth heart sound is almost universally present. A soft systolic blowing apical murmur (reflecting papillary muscle dysfunction) may occur. During initial examination, a friction rub or more striking murmurs
