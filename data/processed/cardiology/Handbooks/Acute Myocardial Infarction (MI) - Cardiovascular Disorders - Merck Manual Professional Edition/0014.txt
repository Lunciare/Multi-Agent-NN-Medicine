Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

syndrome event even when the etiology is ischemic. However, by detecting lower levels of troponin, hs-cTn assays enable earlier identification of MI than other assays, and have replaced other cardiac biomarker tests in many centers. Patients suspected of having a myocardial infarction should have a hs-cTn assay done on presentation and 2 to 3 hours later. Troponin should be measured at 0 and 6 hours if a standard cTn assay is used. All laboratory tests should be interpreted in the context of the pre-test disease probability (see also Understanding Medical Tests and Test Results). This is especially relevant for the hs-cTn assay, given the very high sensitivity of this test, but applies to all assays of cTn. An hs-cTn assay must be interpreted based on the patient's pre-test probability of disease, which is estimated clinically based on: Risk factors for ACS Symptoms ECG 9/22 A high pre-test probability plus an elevated troponin level detected with an hs-cTn assay is highly suggestive of myocardial infarction, whereas a low pre-test probability plus a normal hs-cTn assay result is unlikely to represent myocardial infarction (1). Diagnosis is more challenging when test results are discordant with pre-test probability, in which case serial hs-cTn assays
