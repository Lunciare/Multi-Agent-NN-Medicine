of more commonly measured cardiac troponins. Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, subendocardial MI) is myocardial necrosis (evidenced by cardiac biomarkers in blood; troponin I or troponin T and CK-MB will be elevated) without acute ST-segment elevation. ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or both may be present. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, transmural MI) is myocardial necrosis with ECG changes showing ST-segment elevation that is not quickly reversed by nitroglycerin. Troponin I or troponin T and CK-MB are elevated. Myocardial infarction in the absence of coronary artery disease (MINOCA) Myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) is found in about 5 to 6% of patients with acute MI who undergo coronary angiography (3). Patients with MINOCA tend to be younger, female, and without dyslipidemia. They tend to have myocardial necrosis without significant coronary atherosclerosis. Plaque disruption and coronary vasospasm are common in MINOCA. Coronary thrombosis or embolism and spontaneous coronary artery dissection are causes of MINOCA. Medical management should be based on the underlying mechanism for MINOCA in each patient. 3/22 Symptoms and Signs of Acute MI Symptoms of NSTEMI and STEMI are the same.
