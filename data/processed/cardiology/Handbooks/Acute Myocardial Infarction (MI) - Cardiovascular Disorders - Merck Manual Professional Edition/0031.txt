Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

MIs are silent (asymptomatic). Diagnose with serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers (troponin preferred). Treat immediately with oxygen, antiplatelets, nitrates, and anticoagulants. For patients with ST segment elevation MI (STEMI), treat with immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); if immediate PCI is not available, give intravenous fibrinolytics. For patients with non-ST segment elevation, perform angiography and PCI within 24 to 48 hours if stable; do immediate PCI for unstable patients (persistent chest pain, hypotension, unstable arrhythmias, or markedly elevated biomarkers). Initiate or continue antiplatelets, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers), and statins following initial treatment. After hospital discharge, arrange functional evaluation, manage risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, smoking), and promote healthy diet and exercise.
