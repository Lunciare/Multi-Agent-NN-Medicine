Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

PCI is the preferred treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction when available in a timely fashion (door to balloon-inflation time < 90 minutes) by an experienced operator (4). If there is likely to be a significant delay in availability of PCI, thrombolysis should be done for STEMI patients meeting criteria (see Infarct extent). Reperfusion using fibrinolytics is most effective if given in the first few minutes to hours after onset of myocardial infarction. The earlier a fibrinolytic is begun, the better. The goal is a door-to-needle time of 30 to 60 minutes. Greatest benefit occurs within 3 hours, but the drugs may be effective up to 12 hours. Characteristics and selection of fibrinolytic drugs are discussed elsewhere. Patients with unstable NSTEMI (ie, those with ongoing symptoms, hypotension, or sustained arrhythmias) should be taken directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 15/22 For patients with uncomplicated NSTEMI, reperfusion is not as urgent because a completely occluded infarct-related artery at presentation is uncommon. Such patients typically undergo angiography within the first 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG. Fibrinolytics are not indicated for any
