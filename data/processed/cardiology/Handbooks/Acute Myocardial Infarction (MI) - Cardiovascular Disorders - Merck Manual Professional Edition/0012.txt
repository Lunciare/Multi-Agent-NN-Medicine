QRS complex strongly suggests MI as does > 5-mm ST-segment elevation in at least 2 precordial leads. But generally, any patient with suggestive symptoms and new-onset (or not known to be old) left bundle branch block is treated as for STEMI. CLINICAL CALCULATORS M.I. Prediction Decision TreeCalc Cardiac biomarkers 8/22 CLINICAL CALCULATORS M.I. Criteria for Likelihood in Chest Pain with LBBB Cardiac biomarkers (serum biomarkers of myocardial cell injury) are Cardiac enzymes (eg, CK-MB [creatine kinase MB isoenzyme]) Cell contents (eg, troponin I, troponin T, myoglobin) These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream after myocardial cell necrosis. The biomarkers appear at different times after injury, and levels decrease at different rates. Sensitivity and specificity for myocardial cell injury vary significantly among these biomarkers. Assays that measure cardiac troponins (cTn), which have been in use for many years, are sensitive and specific. Newer, highly sensitive assays of cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) that are also very precise are preferred. These assays can reliably measure cTn levels (T or I) as low as 0.003 to 0.006 ng/mL (3 to 6 pg/mL); some research assays go as low as 0.001 ng/mL (1 pg/mL). The less sensitive cTn tests were unlikely to detect cardiac troponins except
