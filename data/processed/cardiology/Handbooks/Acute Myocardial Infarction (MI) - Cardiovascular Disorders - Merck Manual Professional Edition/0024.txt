Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

is uncommon. Such patients typically undergo angiography within the first 24 to 48 hours of hospitalization to identify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG. Fibrinolytics are not indicated for any patients with NSTEMI. Risk outweighs potential benefit. Choice of reperfusion strategy is further discussed in Revascularization for Acute Coronary Syndromes. Rehabilitation and post-discharge treatment Functional evaluation Changes in lifestyle: Regular exercise, diet modification, weight loss, smoking cessation Medications: Continuation of antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins Patients who did not have coronary angiography during admission, have no high-risk features (eg, heart failure, recurrent angina, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation after 24 hours, mechanical complications such as new murmurs, shock), and have an ejection fraction > 40% whether or not they received fibrinolytics usually should have stress testing of some sort before or shortly after discharge (see table Functional Evaluation After Myocardial Infarction).
