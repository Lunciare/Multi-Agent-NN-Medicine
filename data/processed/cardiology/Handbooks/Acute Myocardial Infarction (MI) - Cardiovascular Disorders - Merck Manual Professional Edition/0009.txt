cardiac biomarkers to help distinguish between unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non–ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This distinction is the center of the decision pathway because fibrinolytics benefit patients with STEMI but may increase risk for those with NSTEMI. Also, urgent cardiac catheterization is indicated for patients with acute STEMI but not generally for those with NSTEMI. ECG ECG is the most important test and should be done as soon as possible (eg, within 10 minutes of presentation). 5/22 For STEMI, initial ECG is usually diagnostic, showing ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm in 2 or more contiguous leads subtending the damaged area (see figures Acute Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction, Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction, Lateral Left Ventricular Infarction (several days later), Acute Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction, Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction, and Inferior (Diaphragmatic) Left Ventricular Infarction (several days later)).
