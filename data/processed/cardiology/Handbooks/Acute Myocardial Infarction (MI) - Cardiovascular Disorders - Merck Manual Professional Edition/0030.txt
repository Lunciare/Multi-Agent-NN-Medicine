Based on data from Antman EM et al: The TIMI risk score for unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI: A method of prognostication and therapeutic decision making. JAMA 284:835– 42, 2000.

Coronary atherosclerosis is present in 95% of patients with acute MI. Infarction location (right ventricle, inferoposterior, or anterior) and extent (transmural or nontransmural) affect symptoms, treatment, and prognosis. Symptoms typically include substernal aching or pressure (with or without radiation to the neck, back, or arms) dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, and/or vomiting. Women, older adults, and patients with diabetes are more likely to have atypical symptoms, and 20% of acute MIs are silent (asymptomatic). Diagnose with serial ECGs and cardiac biomarkers (troponin preferred). Treat immediately with oxygen, antiplatelets, nitrates, and anticoagulants. For patients with ST segment elevation MI (STEMI), treat
