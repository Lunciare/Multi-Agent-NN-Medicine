Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

in patients with acute myocardial infarction (1, 2). Hypotension and bradycardia secondary to morphine can usually be overcome by prompt elevation of the lower extremities. Standard therapy for all patients with unstable angina includes beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins. Beta-blockers are recommended unless contraindicated (eg, by bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, or asthma), especially for high-risk patients. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate, arterial pressure, and contractility, thereby reducing cardiac workload and oxygen demand. ACE inhibitors may provide long-term cardioprotection by improving endothelial function. If an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated because of cough or rash (but not angioedema or renal dysfunction), an angiotensin II receptor blocker may be substituted. Statins are also standard therapy regardless of lipid levels (3) and whether MI is caused by ASCVD and should be continued indefinitely. Reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction For patients with STEMI: Immediate percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolytics For patients with NSTEMI: Immediate percutaneous coronary intervention for unstable patients or within 24 to 48 hours for stable patients For patients with STEMI, emergency PCI is the preferred treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction when available in a timely fashion (door to balloon-inflation time < 90 minutes) by an experienced operator (4).
