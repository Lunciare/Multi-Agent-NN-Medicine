Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI)

marked ECG abnormalities, hypotension, or complex ventricular arrhythmias) Hemodynamic instability Sustained ventricular tachycardia Diabetes mellitus PCI within past 6 months Prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) LV ejection fraction < 0.40 Overall mortality rate prior to the modern era of treatment with fibrinolytics and PCI was about 30%, with 25 to 30% of patients who did not receive fibrinolytics or PCI dying before reaching the hospital (typically due to ventricular fibrillation). In-hospital mortality is typically due to cardiogenic shock, which correlates with severity of left ventricular failure. The Killip classification categorizes patients with an acute MI based on physical examination findings suggestive of left ventricular failure, and higher scores predicting higher mortality risk (1) (see table Killip Classification and Mortality Rate of Acute MI). Most patients who die of cardiogenic shock have an infarct or a combination of scar and new infarct affecting ≥ 50% of LV mass. For patients receiving reperfusion (fibrinolysis or PCI), in-hospital mortality is approximately 5% (2). In- hospital mortality is generally lower for NSTEMI than with STEMI. Mortality rates tend to be higher in females and in patients with diabetes. 17/22 Most fatalities among patients who survive initial hospitalization occur in the first 3 to
