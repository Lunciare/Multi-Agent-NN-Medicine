Fatigue
By Michael R. Wasserman, MD, California Association of Long Term Care Medicine (CALTCM)
Reviewed By Glenn D. Braunstein, MD, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025 | Modified Apr 2025
Fatigue is difficulty initiating and sustaining activity due to a lack of energy and
accompanied by a desire to rest. Fatigue is normal after physical exertion,
prolonged stress, and sleep deprivation.
Fatigue occurs most often as part of a symptom complex, but even when it is the sole or main
presenting symptom, fatigue is one of the most common symptoms.
Fatigue can be classified in temporal categories:
Recent fatigue: < 1 month duration
Prolonged fatigue: 1 to 6 months duration
Chronic fatigue: > 6 months duration
Myalgic encephalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is one manifestation of chronic fatigue. Systemic
exertion intolerance disease is another term used to describe this condition (1). Patients with COVID-19
may also have symptoms, including fatigue, that last for weeks or even months (known as post-COVID-
19 syndrome, long COVID, or long-haul COVID) and has significant overlap with postviral fatigue (also
called postviral fatigue syndrome) and chronic fatigue syndrome (2).
Patients may refer to certain other symptoms as fatigue; a careful history can help differentiate fatigue
from other symptoms, including:
Weakness, a symptom of nervous system or muscle disorders, is the insufficient force of
muscular contraction at maximum effort. Disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Eaton-
Lambert syndrome can cause weakness simulating fatigue.
Dyspnea on exertion, an early symptom of cardiac and pulmonary disorders, can decrease
exercise tolerance, simulating fatigue. Respiratory symptoms can usually be elicited by
taking a careful history.
Somnolence, a symptom of disorders causing sleep deprivation (eg, allergic rhinitis,
esophageal reflux, painful musculoskeletal disorders, sleep apnea, severe chronic
disorders), is an unusually strong desire to sleep. Yawning and lapsing into sleep during
daytime hours are common. Patients can usually tell the difference between somnolence

and fatigue. However, deprivation of deep nonrapid eye movement sleep can cause muscle
aches and fatigue, and many patients with fatigue have disturbed sleep, so differentiating
between fatigue and somnolence may be difficult.

Etiology of Fatigue
Most serious (and many minor) acute and chronic illnesses produce fatigue. However, many of these
have other more prominent manifestations (eg, pain, cough, fever, jaundice) as the presenting
complaint. This discussion focuses on disorders that can manifest primarily as fatigue (1).
The most common disorders manifesting predominantly as recent fatigue (lasting < 1 month) are
Medication adverse effects
Anemia
Stress and/or depression
The most common causes manifesting predominantly as prolonged fatigue (lasting 1 to 6 months) are
Diabetes
Hypothyroidism
Sleep disturbances (eg, sleep apnea)
Cancer
The most common causes manifesting predominantly as chronic fatigue (lasting > 6 months) are
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome/systemic exertion intolerance disease
Postviral fatigue syndrome
Mental health conditions (eg, depression) (2)
Medications
Several factors commonly cause or contribute to a chief complaint of fatigue, usually prolonged or
chronic fatigue (see table Some Factors Commonly Contributing To Prolonged Or Chronic Fatigue ).

Evaluation of Fatigue
Fatigue can be highly subjective. Patients vary in what they consider to be fatigue and how they describe
it, and there are few ways to objectively confirm fatigue or tell how severe it is. History and physical
examination focus on identifying subtle manifestations of underlying illness (particularly infections,
endocrine and rheumatologic disorders, anemia, and depression) that can be used to guide testing.
History
History of present illness includes open-ended questions about what "fatigue" is and listening for
descriptions that could suggest dyspnea on exertion, somnolence, or muscle weakness. The
relationships between fatigue, activity, rest, and sleep should be elicited, as should the onset, time
course and pattern, and factors that increase or decrease fatigue.
Review of systems should be thorough because potential causes of fatigue are so numerous and
diverse. Among important nonspecific symptoms are fever, weight loss, and night sweats (possibly
suggesting cancer, a rheumatologic disorder, or an infection). Menstrual history is obtained in women of
child-bearing age. If a cause is not evident, patients should complete screening questionnaires for
mental health conditions (eg, depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, somatoform disorders) as
well as for domestic violence.
Past medical history should address known disorders. Complete medication history should include
prescription, over-the-counter, and recreational drugs.
Social history should elicit descriptions of diet, drug and alcohol use, and the effect of fatigue on
quality of life, employment, and social and family relationships.
Physical examination
Vital signs are checked for fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension (especially orthostatic).
General examination should be particularly comprehensive, including general appearance and
examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, head and neck, breasts, rectum (including prostate exam
and testing for occult blood), genitals, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, joints, and skin.
Neurologic examination should include testing of, at a minimum, mental status, cranial nerves, mood,
affect, strength, muscle bulk and tone, reflexes, and gait.
If fatigue is of recent onset, a focused examination will usually reveal the cause. If fatigue is chronic,
examination is less likely to reveal a cause; however, a thorough physical examination may be
diagnostically helpful, and is an important way to build rapport with the patient.
Red flags
Chronic weight loss
Chronic fever or night sweats

Generalized lymphadenopathy
Muscle weakness or pain
Serious nonfatigue symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, hematemesis, severe dyspnea, ascites,
confusion, suicidal ideation)
Involvement of > 1 organ system (eg, rash plus arthritis)
New or different headache or loss of vision, particularly with muscle pains, in an older adult
suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica and/or giant cell arteritis.
Interpretation of findings
In general, a cause is more likely to be found when fatigue is one of many symptoms than when fatigue
is the sole symptom. Fatigue that worsens with activity and lessens with rest suggests a general medical
condition. Fatigue that is present constantly and does not lessen with rest, particularly with occasional
bursts of energy, may indicate a mental health condition.
In the absence of red flag findings, a thorough history, physical examination, and routine laboratory
testing (plus tests directed at specific findings—see table Interpretation of Selected Findings in
Evaluating Fatigue) should suffice for an initial evaluation. If test results are negative, watchful waiting is
usually appropriate; if fatigue worsens or other symptoms and signs develop, the patient is reevaluated.
Several causes can be considered for patients with prolonged or chronic fatigue and selected other
common or specific clinical findings.

* Choice of specific tests is dictated by which causes are clinically suspected.
ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; ANA = antinuclear antibodies; ANCA = antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies; anti-CCP = anticyclic citrullinated peptide; CBC = complete blood
count; CK = creatine kinase; CMV = cytomegalovirus; EBV = Epstein-Barr virus; ESR =
erythrocyte sedimentation rate; MRCP = magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography;
PET = positron emission tomography; PPD = purified protein derivative; TSH = thyroid-
stimulating hormone.
Testing
Testing is directed at causes suspected based on clinical findings. If no cause is evident or suspected
based on clinical findings, laboratory testing is unlikely to reveal a cause. Still, many clinicians
recommend testing with the following:
Complete blood count (CBC)
Ferritin
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
Chemistries, including electrolytes, glucose, calcium, and renal and liver tests
Creatine kinase (CK) is recommended if muscle pain or weakness is present. HIV testing and testing for
tuberculosis with purified protein derivative (PPD) placement or interferon-gamma release assays are
recommended if the patient has risk factors. Chest radiograph is recommended if cough or dyspnea is
present. Other testing, such as for infections or immunologic deficiencies, is not recommended unless
there are suggestive clinical findings.
Diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome/systemic exertion intolerance disease
requires specific diagnostic criteria.

Treatment of Fatigue
Treatment to lessen fatigue is directed at the cause.
Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome/systemic exertion intolerance
disease and idiopathic chronic fatigue are treated similarly. They should be told clearly that the etiology
is presently unknown. Treatment is more often successful if the health care professional is patient and
nonjudgmental and acknowledges the real effects of fatigue.
There are no approved pharmacologic treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
syndrome/systemic exertion intolerance disease; however, this should not diminish the future potential
of treatments (1). Nonpharmacologic treatments include physical therapy (eg, graded exercise therapy)
and psychological support (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy). Focusing on improving sleep and relieving
pain may also help. Goals include returning to work and maintaining normal activity levels.

Geriatrics Essentials: Fatigue
Fatigue is often the first symptom of a disorder in older adults, and should not be disregarded as part of
normal aging. For example, the first symptom of pneumonia in an older adult may be fatigue rather
than pulmonary symptoms. The first symptom of other disorders, such as giant cell arteritis, may also
be fatigue in an older adult. Because serious illness may become apparent soon after sudden fatigue in
older adults, the cause should be determined as quickly as possible.
Key Points
Fatigue is a common symptom.
Fatigue caused primarily by a general medical condition usually increases with activity
and lessens with rest.
Laboratory testing is low yield in the absence of suggestive clinical findings.
Successful treatment of chronic fatigue is more likely if the health care professional is
patient and understanding.
