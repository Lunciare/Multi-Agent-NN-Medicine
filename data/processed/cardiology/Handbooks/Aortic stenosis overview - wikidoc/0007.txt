Aortic stenosis overview

replacement surgery. The pressure gradient across a narrowed aortic valve cannot be used to gauge the need for valve replacement as the gradient may be low in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Aortic Valve Area Calculation 3/6 The calculation of the aortic valve area is an indirect method used to determine the area of the aortic valve. The calculated aortic valve orifice area is currently one of the measures for evaluating the severity of aortic stenosis. An aortic valve having an area less than 0.8 cm² is considered to be severe aortic stenosis.[11][12] There are many ways to calculate the aortic valve area. The most commonly used methods involve measurements taken during echocardiography. For interpretation of these values, the aortic valve area is generally divided by the body surface area. Treatment General Approach Once a patient becomes symptomatic with aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement should be performed as long as the patient can tolerate surgery and has no co-morbidities. If severe left ventricular dysfunction is present in the setting of aortic stenosis, it is of utmost importance to differentiate between true severe aortic stenosis and pseudo-severe aortic stenosis as these two entities have different pathophysiologies and different outcomes after
