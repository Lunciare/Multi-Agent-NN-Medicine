Aortic stenosis overview

the valve percutaneously. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Until recently, aortic valve replacement (AVR) was the only effective treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, over the past decade percutaneous treatment of aortic valve disease with the implantation of a stent-based valve prosthesis has been introduced as a new treatment in patients considered inoperable because of severe co-morbidities.[13] In Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) also known as Percutaneous Aortic Valve Replacement (PAVR), a synthetic valve is advanced to the heart through a small hole made in the groin. This procedure is similar in its mechanism to the insertion of a stent, or performing balloon angioplasty albeit with much larger equipment. Traditional aortic valve replacement is an invasive surgical procedure, with considerable mortality and morbidity, especially in more fragile patients. In the newly developed TAVI procedure, the dysfunctional aortic valve is replaced percutaneously, which obviates the need for open heart surgery. Follow Up Follow up is recommended for all patients with operated and unoperated aortic stenosis. Asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis should undergo follow up since aortic stenosis is an ongoing disease that progresses with time. In fact, asymptomatic patients should undergo follow up every 1 year, 3 years and 5 years
