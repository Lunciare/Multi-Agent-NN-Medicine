Aortic stenosis overview

atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, and sudden cardiac death. Surgical treatment of aortic stenosis also carries risks and potential complications that include vascular complications and mitral valve injury. Diagnosis History and Symptoms The main symptoms of aortic stenosis include angina, syncope and congestive heart failure. Left untreated, the average survival is 5 years after the onset of angina, 3 years after the onset of syncope, and 1 year after the onset of congestive heart failure. [8][9][10] Other symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Physical Examination Aortic stenosis is most often diagnosed when it is asymptomatic and can sometimes be detected during routine examination of the heart and circulatory system. The major signs include pulsus parvus et tardus (a slow-rising, small volume carotid pulse), a lag time between apical and carotid impulses, and a distinct systolic ejection murmur. Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram in the patient with moderate to severe aortic stenosis may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy and heart block. Cardiac Stress Test 2/6 Exercise testing should not be performed in symptomatic patients with AS but can be used to elicit exercise-induced symptoms and abnormal blood pressure responses in asymptomatic patients.[3] Chest X-ray Chest X-ray may be used as a diagnostic
