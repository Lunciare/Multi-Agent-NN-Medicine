from other Disorders Aortic stenosis must be differentiated from other cardiac or pulmonary causes of dyspnea, weakness, and dizziness. Furthermore, if there is left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, it is critical to identify whether the obstruction is subvalvular, valvular or supravalvular or due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Epidemiology and Demographics Aortic stenosis primarily affects older adults and the majority of cases are due to calcific degeneration. Aortic stenosis tends to affect approximately 2% of patients over the age of 65, 3% of patients over the age of 75, and 4% of patients over the age 85.[7] Risk Factors The most common risk factor for the subsequent development of aortic stenosis is congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Rheumatic fever is another risk factor for the subsequent development of aortic stenosis (rheumatic heart disease). Risk factors that may speed up the progression of degenerative calcific aortic stenosis include: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia, uremia and smoking. Natural History, Complications and Prognosis Left untreated, aortic valve stenosis can lead to angina, syncope, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, and sudden cardiac death. Surgical treatment of aortic stenosis also carries risks and potential complications that include vascular complications and mitral valve injury. Diagnosis History and Symptoms
