Aortic stenosis overview

at all costs. Surgery Surgical intervention may be a necessary component of treatment for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement is the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic aortic stenosis, as it improves both the symptoms and life expectancy in aortic stenosis patients, in contrast to medical therapy alone which may improve the symptoms without prolonging life expectancy.[6] Percutaneous Aortic Balloon Valvotomy (PABV) or Aortic Valvuloplasty Surgical aortic valve replacement is the mainstay of the treatment of aortic stenosis as it improves both symptoms and life expectancy. However, some patients may not be surgical candidates due to coexisting comorbidities. Hence, minimally invasive treatment such as percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy (PABV) maybe an alternative to surgery as a palliative strategy. PABV is a procedure during which one or more balloons are placed across a stenotic valve and then inflated in order to 4/6 cause a decrease the severity of aortic stenosis. This is to be distinguished from transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) which is a different method that involves replacement of the valve percutaneously. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Until recently, aortic valve replacement (AVR) was the only effective treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, over the past decade percutaneous treatment
