symptomatic patients with AS but can be used to elicit exercise-induced symptoms and abnormal blood pressure responses in asymptomatic patients.[3] Chest X-ray Chest X-ray may be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of aortic stenosis. Findings associated with aortic stenosis include left ventricular hypertrophy and calcification of the aortic valve. CT Scan Computed tomography can be helpful as a diagnostic tool in conditions where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. MRI Magnetic resonance imaging is rarely used in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, except in rare cases where the echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. There is a signal void where the high velocity jet exits the aortic valve. Echocardiography Echocardiography is the best non-invasive test to evaluate the aortic valve anatomy and function. It is indicated in the case of presence of symptoms suggestive of valvular problems or in the case of detection of a systolic murmur with a grade greater than 3/6. Doppler echocardiography allows the measurement of the maximum jet velocity and can be used to estimate the effective orifice area of the aortic valve as well as the gradient across the aortic valve using the modified Bernoulli equation (gradient = 4 x velocity2). The flow must be
