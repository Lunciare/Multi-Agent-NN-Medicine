Aortic stenosis overview

of aortic stenosis, it is of utmost importance to differentiate between true severe aortic stenosis and pseudo-severe aortic stenosis as these two entities have different pathophysiologies and different outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Medical therapy reduces symptoms but does not prolong life. If a patient has extensive co- morbidities, transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be considered. Aortic valvuloplasty can be considered in those patients who are too sick for surgery or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Medical Therapy While medical therapy may improve the symptoms of patients with aortic stenosis, medical therapy does not prolong life expectancy. Aortic valve replacement remains the definitive treatment for symptomatic aortic stenosis and it improves both the symptoms and life expectancy of the patients. When pharmacological therapies are used, extreme caution must be taken in the administration of vasodilators as an excess in vasodilation may lead to hypotension, a reduction in perfusion pressure to the heart, a further decline in cardiac output and further hypotension. This vicious circle can be fatal and must be avoided at all costs. Surgery Surgical intervention may be a necessary component of treatment for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement is the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic aortic stenosis,
