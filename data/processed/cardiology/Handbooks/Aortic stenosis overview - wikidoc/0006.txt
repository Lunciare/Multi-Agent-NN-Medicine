Aortic stenosis overview

effective orifice area of the aortic valve as well as the gradient across the aortic valve using the modified Bernoulli equation (gradient = 4 x velocity2). The flow must be constant, so as the velocity increases, the valve area decreases proportionally. Attention to technical details is important as they may lead to underestimation of the severity of the aortic stenosis.[3] Echocardiography can also be used to assess the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac Catheterization Left and right heart catheterization as well as angiography may be useful in the assessment of the patient prior to aortic valve replacement surgery. In addition, asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis should undergo cardiac catherization when echocardiographic findings are inconsistent with the clinical findings[3]. Aortic Valve Area The aortic valve area is the size of the orifice for blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. The aortic valve area is reduced in aortic stenosis, and the aortic valve area is the metric that is used to gauge the need for aortic valve replacement surgery. The pressure gradient across a narrowed aortic valve cannot be used to gauge the need for valve replacement as the gradient may be low in patients with impaired
