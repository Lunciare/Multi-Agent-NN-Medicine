undergo follow up since aortic stenosis is an ongoing disease that progresses with time. In fact, asymptomatic patients should undergo follow up every 1 year, 3 years and 5 years in case of severe, moderate and mild aortic stenosis respectively.[14] Prevention Aortic stenosis associated with rheumatic heart disease can be minimized with antibiotic therapy in patients with documented streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat).[1] Bicuspid aortic valve disease is a congenital variant and cannot be prevented. Calcific degeneration of the valve can potentially be minimized by rosouvistatin and other measures targeting prevention of atherosclerosis.[2] Precautions and Prophylaxis People with aortic stenosis of any etiology are at risk for the development of infection of their stenosed valve, i.e. infective endocarditis and antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered. Patients with severe aortic stenosis should avoid strenuous exercise and any exercise that greatly increases afterload such as weight lifting.
