Aortic stenosis overview

stenosis is due to fusion of the commissures with valvular scarring and calcification.[3] Aortic stenosis causes an impedance to the antegrade blood flow not only at the level of the aortic valve itself, but also at the subvalvular (below the aortic valve) or supravalvular (above the aortic valve) levels. As a result, chronic pressure overload develops in the left ventricle. The left ventricle undergoes hypertrophy as an initial adaptive mechanism to overcome the increased afterload. This compensatory mechanism ends up being maladpative by causing apoptosis of the hypertrophied myocytes and subsequent heart failure. [4] Hence, aortic stenosis is a progressive valvular disease which progression depends mainly on the degree of the narrowing of the aortic valve as well as on the maladaptive ventricular wall response.[5] Causes The frequency of causes of aortic stenosis varies with the age of the patient. Bicuspid valve is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in people below 50 years of age whereas calcified aortic valve is more common in older patients.[6] Differentiating Aortic Stenosis from other Disorders Aortic stenosis must be differentiated from other cardiac or pulmonary causes of dyspnea, weakness, and dizziness. Furthermore, if there is left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, it is
