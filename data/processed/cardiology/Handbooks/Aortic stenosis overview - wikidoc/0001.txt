Aortic stenosis overview

Overview The aortic valve ensures that the blood moves forward from the left ventricle into the aorta and that it does not leak backwards during diastole. When functioning appropriately, the aortic valve does not impede the flow of blood between the left ventricle and the aorta and it does not leak. Under some circumstances, the aortic valve becomes narrower than normal impeding the flow of blood. This is known as aortic valve stenosis, or aortic stenosis, often abbreviated as AS. Classification Aortic stenosis can be classified broadly into two main categories: acquired and congenital. Further classification can be applied based on the origin of the stenosis such as acquired rheumatic, congenital bicuspid, congenital subaortic, congenital subvalvular, and congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis.[1][2] Pathophysiology Aortic stenosis is the progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. Calcific aortic stenosis, in particular, is an active atherosclerotic pathology where inflammation, fibrosis and calcification are involved in the progressive narrowing of the effective aortic valve area in the absence of any commissural fusion. In contrast, rheumatic aortic stenosis is due to fusion of the commissures with valvular scarring and calcification.[3] Aortic stenosis causes an impedance to the antegrade blood flow not only at the level of the
