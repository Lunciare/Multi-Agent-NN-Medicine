Conditions affecting the left side of the heart

seen, though less commonly than in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Abnormal Q waves are most often seen in leads V1 to V4 and may mimic the appearance of a myocardial infarction. Restrictive cardiomyopathy 6/16 Restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least common form of cardiomyopathy and is the end result of several different diseases associated with myocardial infiltration—for example, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and haemochromatosis. The most common electrocardiographic abnormality is the presence of low voltage QRS complexes, probably due to myocardial infiltration. Both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are common. Electrocardiographic findings in restrictive cardiomyopathy Low voltage QRS complexes Conduction disturbance Arrhythmias—supraventricular, ventricular Patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy due to amyloidosis (note the low voltage QRS complexes and the right bundle branch block)
