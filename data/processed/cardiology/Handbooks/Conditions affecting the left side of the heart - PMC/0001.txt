Conditions affecting the left side of the heart

Many cardiac and systemic illnesses can affect the left side of the heart. After a careful history and examination, electrocardiography and chest radiography are first line investigations. Electrocardiography can provide supportive evidence for conditions such as aortic stenosis, hypertension, and mitral stenosis. Recognition of the associated electrocardiographic abnormalities is important as misinterpretation may lead to diagnostic error. This article describes the electrocardiographic changes associated with left atrial hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular disease, and cardiomyopathies. Conditions affecting left side of heart covered in this article Left atrial hypertrophy Left ventricular hypertrophy Valvular disease Cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive) 1/16 Left ventricular hypertrophy Voltage criteria Limb leads R wave in lead 1 plus S wave in lead III >25 mm R wave in lead aVL >11 mm R wave in lead aVF >20 mm S wave in lead aVR >14 mm Precordial leads R wave in leads V4, V5, or V6 >26 mm R wave in leads V5 or 6 plus S wave in lead V1 >35 mm Largest R wave plus largest S wave in precordial leads >45 mm Non-voltage criteria ⩾ ⩾ Delayed ventricular activation time 0.05 s in leads V5 or V6 0.05 s ST segment depression and T
