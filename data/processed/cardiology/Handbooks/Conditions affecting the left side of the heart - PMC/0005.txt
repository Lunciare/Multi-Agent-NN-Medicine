advantage to have old electrocadiograms for comparison. Other non-voltage criteria are common in left ventricular hypertrophy. Left atrial hypertrophy or prolonged atrial depolarisation and left axis deviation are often present; and poor R wave progression is commonly seen. 3/16 The electrocardiogram is abnormal in almost 50% of patients with hypertension, with minimal changes in 20% and obvious features of left ventricular hypertrophy in 30%. There is a linear correlation between the electrocardiographic changes and the severity and duration of the hypertension. High amplitude QRS complexes are seen first, followed by the development of non- voltage criteria. The specificity of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy is improved if a scoring system is used. Scoring system for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) —suggested if points total ⩾5 Electrocardiographic feature No of points Amplitude (any of the following) 3 ⩾ Largest R or S wave in limb leads 20 mm ⩾ S wave in leads V1 or V2 30 mm ⩾ R wave in leads V5 or V6 30 mm ST-T wave segment changes typical for LVHin the absence of digitalis 3 Left atrial involvement 3 Left axis deviation 2 ⩾ QRS duration of 0.09 s 1 ⩾ Delayed ventricular activation time
