Conditions affecting the left side of the heart

segment changes typical for LVHin the absence of digitalis 3 Left atrial involvement 3 Left axis deviation 2 ⩾ QRS duration of 0.09 s 1 ⩾ Delayed ventricular activation time in leadsV5 and V6 of 0.05 s 1 Valvular problems A normal electrocardiogram virtually rules out the presence of severe aortic stenosis, except in congenital valve disease, where the trace may remain normal despite a substantial degree of stenosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy is seen in about 75% of patients with severe aortic stenosis. Left atrial enlargement may also be seen in the electrocardiogram. Left axis deviation and left bundle branch block may occur. 4/16 Electrocardiographic features of valvular disease The electrocardiographic features of aortic regurgitation include the features of left ventricular hypertrophy, often with the strain pattern Mitral stenosis is associated with left atrial abnormality or atrial fibrillation and right ventricular hypertrophy Mitral regurgitation is associated with atrial fibrillation, though again the features of left atrial hypertrophy may be seen if the patient is in sinus rhythm. Evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy may be seen The cardiomyopathies Diseases of the myocardium are classified into three types on the basis of their functional effects: hypertrophic (obstructed), dilated (congestive), or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
