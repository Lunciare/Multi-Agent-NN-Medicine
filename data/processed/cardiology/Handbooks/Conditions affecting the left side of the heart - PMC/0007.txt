ventricular hypertrophy may be seen The cardiomyopathies Diseases of the myocardium are classified into three types on the basis of their functional effects: hypertrophic (obstructed), dilated (congestive), or restrictive cardiomyopathy. In cardiomyopathy the myocardium is diffusely affected, and therefore the resulting electrocardiographic abnormalities may be diverse. Common features of cardiomyopathy include electrical holes (Q waves), conduction defects (bundle branch block and axis deviation), and arrhythmias Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy This is characterised by marked myocardial thickening predominantly affecting the interventricular septum and/or the apex of the left ventricle. Electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy is found in 50% of patients. A characteristic abnormality is the presence of abnormal Q waves in the anterolateral or inferior chest leads, which may mimic the appearance of myocardial infarction. As the left ventricle becomes increasingly less compliant, there is increasing resistance to atrial contraction, and signs of left atrial abnormality are commonly seen. Atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardias are common arrhythmias in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Ventricular tachycardias may also occur and are a cause of sudden death in these patients. 5/16 Main electrocardiographic changes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Left ventricular hypertrophy Left atrial enlargement Abnormal inferior and anterior and/or lateral Q waves Bizarre QRS complexes
