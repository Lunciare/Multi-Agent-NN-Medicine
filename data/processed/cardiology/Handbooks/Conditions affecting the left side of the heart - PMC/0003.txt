Conditions affecting the left side of the heart

wave duration to greater than 0.12 s is often found in association with 2/16 a left atrial abnormality. Normal P waves may be bifid, the minor notch probably resulting from slight asynchrony between right and left atrial depolarisation. However, a pronounced notch with a peak- to-peak interval of >0.04 s suggests left atrial enlargement. Any condition causing left ventricular hypertrophy may produce left atrial enlargement as a secondary phenomenon. Left atrial enlargement can occur in association with systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral incompetence, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular hypertrophy Systemic hypertension is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy, but others include aortic stenosis and co-arctation of the aorta. Many electrocardiographic criteria have been suggested for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, but none is universally accepted. Scoring systems based on these criteria have been developed, and although they are highly specific diagnostic tools, poor sensitivity limits their use. Electrocardiographic findings The electrocardiographic features of left ventricular hypertrophy are classified as either voltage criteria or non-voltage criteria. The electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy is difficult in individuals aged under 40. Voltage criteria lack specificity in this group because young people often have high amplitude QRS complexes in the
