largest S wave in precordial leads >45 mm Non-voltage criteria ⩾ ⩾ Delayed ventricular activation time 0.05 s in leads V5 or V6 0.05 s ST segment depression and T wave inversion in the left precordial leads The specificity of these criteria is age and sex dependent Left atrial abnormality The term left atrial abnormality is used to imply the presence of atrial hypertrophy or dilatation, or both. Left atrial depolarisation contributes to the middle and terminal portions of the P wave. The changes of left atrial hypertrophy are therefore seen in the late portion of the P wave. In addition, left atrial depolarisation may be delayed, which may prolong the duration of the P wave. The P wave in lead V1 is often biphasic. Early right atrial forces are directed anteriorly giving rise to an initial positive deflection; these are followed by left atrial forces travelling posteriorly, producing a later negative deflection. A large negative deflection (>1 small square in area) suggests a left atrial abnormality. Prolongation of P wave duration to greater than 0.12 s is often found in association with 2/16 a left atrial abnormality. Normal P waves may be bifid, the minor notch probably resulting from
