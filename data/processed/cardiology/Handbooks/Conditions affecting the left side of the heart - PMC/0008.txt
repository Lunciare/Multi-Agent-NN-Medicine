Conditions affecting the left side of the heart

sudden death in these patients. 5/16 Main electrocardiographic changes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Left ventricular hypertrophy Left atrial enlargement Abnormal inferior and anterior and/or lateral Q waves Bizarre QRS complexes masquerading, for example, as pre-excitation and bundle branch block Dilated cardiomyopathy Many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy have anatomical left ventricular hypertrophy, though the electrocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy are seen in only a third of patients. In some patients the signs of left ventricular hypertrophy may be masked as diffuse myocardial fibrosis can reduce the voltage of the QRS complexes. If right ventricular hypertrophy is also present the increased rightward forces of depolarisation may cancel out some of the leftward forces, again masking the signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. ECG changes in dilated cardiomyopathy Left bundle branch block Left atrial enlargement Abnormal Q waves in leads V1 to V4 Left ventricular hypertrophy Arrhythmias—ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation Signs of left atrial enlargement are common, and often there is evidence of biatrial enlargement. Abnormal Q waves may be seen, though less commonly than in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Abnormal Q waves are most often seen in leads V1 to V4 and may mimic the appearance of a myocardial infarction.
