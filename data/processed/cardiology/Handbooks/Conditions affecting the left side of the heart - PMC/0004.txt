diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy is difficult in individuals aged under 40. Voltage criteria lack specificity in this group because young people often have high amplitude QRS complexes in the absence of left ventricular disease. Even when high amplitude QRS complexes are seen in association with non-voltage criteria—such as ST segment and T wave changes —a diagnosis cannot be made with confidence. Typical repolarisation changes seen in left ventricular hypertrophy are ST segment depression and T wave inversion. This “strain” pattern is seen in the left precordial leads and is associated with reciprocal ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads. The presence of these ST segment changes can cause diagnostic difficulty in patients complaining of ischaemic-type chest pain; failure to recognise the features of left ventricular hypertrophy can lead to the inappropriate administration of thrombolytic therapy. Furthermore, in patients known to have left ventricular hypertrophy it can be difficult to diagnose confidently acute ischaemia on the basis of ST segment changes in the left precordial leads. It is an advantage to have old electrocadiograms for comparison. Other non-voltage criteria are common in left ventricular hypertrophy. Left atrial hypertrophy or prolonged atrial depolarisation and left axis deviation are often present;
