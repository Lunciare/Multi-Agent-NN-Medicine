receptor antagonists do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. Commonly administered agents in the management of heart failure include Candesartan, Valsartan, Telmisartan, Losartan, Irbesartan, and Olmesartan. The effectiveness of switching to an ARB from and ACE inhibitor was demonstrated for candesartan in the CHARM Alternative trial [8]. In general, ARBs are as effective or slightly less effective than ACE inhibitors in the treatment of congestive heart failure.[9][10] It is a class 2a recommendation to substitute an ARB as an alternative to ACE inhibitors if the patient is already taking an ARB for another indication.[11] The efficacy of adding an ARB to an ACE inhibitor was assessed in the CHARM Added trial[12]. While there was a reduction in the composite primary endpoint in the study, there was no reduction in mortality. Furthermore, the VALIANT trial demonstrated that an ARB should not be added to an ACE inhibitor in the post MI setting. These results for ARBs are in contrast to the results of the EMPHASIS HF trial showed that the addition of eplerenone (an aldosterone antagonist) to ACE inhibition improved
