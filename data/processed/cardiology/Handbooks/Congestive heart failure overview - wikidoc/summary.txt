Overview Heart failure is a complex syndrome whereby there is inadequate output of the heart to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Abnormal function of different anatomic parts of the heart cause heart failure including the pericardium, the myocardium, the endocardium, the heart valves and the great vessels. Symptoms of heart failure are due to a lack of both forward blood flow to the body, and backward flow into the lungs. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms of dyspnea, edema and fatigue and signs such as rales on physical examination. Heart failure may be classified based on ejection fraction into heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). LV remodeling is the basic concept for HFpEF pathophysiolgy.
