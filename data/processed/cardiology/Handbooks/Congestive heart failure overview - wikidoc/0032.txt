and then guided over a floppy wire to the section of the diseased artery. The balloon is then inflated to prop open the artery. The balloon is deflated and withdrawn once the artery has been fully opened. A stent may be placed during the procedure to keep the blood vessel open. Clinical trials have demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a very effective and safe procedure to dilate blocked vessels and can improve a patient's symptoms if ischemia or lack of blood flow is the problem. Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD): A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical pump-type device that can help maintain the pumping ability of a failing heart. One type of LVAD has tubing that pulls blood from the left ventricle into a pump. The pump then ejects blood into the aorta. LVADs are typically used for weeks to months as a "bridge" to more definitive therapy such as a heart transplant rather than as a final or "destination" therapy. Intracardiac defibrillator Fifty percent of patients with heart failure die of sudden cardiac death. ICDs are indicated for patients with previous myocardial infarction and an LVEF <30%, sustained ventricular tachycardia, inducible ventricular tachycardia. The
