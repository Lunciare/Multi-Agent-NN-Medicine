Causes The causes of heart failure can be broadly divided into cardiac and non-cardiac. Cardiac causes include aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, arrhythmias, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, arteriovenous fistula, atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac aneurysm, congenital heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, Eisenmenger syndrome, endocarditis, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interferon gamma, ischemic heart disease, malignant hypertension, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, myocardial infarction, oxaprozin, patent ductus arteriosus, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, pericarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, pertuzumab, restrictive cardiomyopathy, rheumatic carditis, rupture of the papillary muscles, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, tricuspid insufficiency, valvular heart disease, ventricular aneurysm, ventricular septal defect. Differentiating Heart Failure From Other Diseases Congestive heart failure should be distinguished from other conditions that cause dyspnea, fatigue and edema. Epidemiology and Demographics Heart failure affects close to 5 million people in the the United States of America and each year close to 500,000 new cases are diagnosed. Congestive
