Diuresis: First Step in the Management of Heart Failure The treatment of chronic heart failure often begins with the administration of diuretics, particularly if the patient has signs or symptoms of volume overload. While increased left ventricular volume increases contractility to a point, if the heart is filled beyond that point, its contractility diminishes (the patient "falls of the Staring curve"). Diuretics can reduce volume overload and reduce shortness of breath and edema. There are three kinds of diuretics, loop diuretics, thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics. Diuretics rapidly improve the symptoms of heart failure (within hours to days). Diuretics reduce excess volume that accumulates with heart failure and decrease pulmonary edema that causes symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea[6]. Lasix 20 to 40 mg PO daily is a conventional starting dose, but in some patients, torsemide may be a better choice due to its more predictable absorption. Once a day dosing of a given diuretic is preferred to twice a day dosing at a lower dose. A rise in BUN and Cr may reflect a reduction in renal perfusion, and further diuresis should only be undertaken with careful monitoring of renal 9/14 function. The patient should weigh themselves each morning at the
