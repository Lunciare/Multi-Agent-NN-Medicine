Congestive heart failure overview

of coronary perfusion. Beta blockers can also decrease the toxicity of catecholamines on the myocardium. Once you have achieved a stable dose of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor, then one of the three beta blockers that have been associated with improved survival (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol) can be added and the dose titrated based upon the patient's tolerance. You should avoid beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (pindolol or acebutolol). It should be noted that the 35% reduction in one year mortality observed in meta-analyses of beta-blockers in heart failure was when these drugs were added to ACE inhibitors[14]. There are no direct comparisons of the various beta-blockers, but some data does suggest that carvedilol may improve LVEF more than the others, but it may not be as well tolerated due to its vasodilatory properties. If the patient has been over diuresed, they may not tolerate the addition of a beta blocker. Relative contraindications to beta-blocker administration include the following: • Asthma or bronchospasm • Hypotension resulting in poor end organ perfusion or symptoms • Bradycardia or heart block (first degree heart block with a PR interval > 0.24, second degree heart block, third degree heart block • Peripheral
