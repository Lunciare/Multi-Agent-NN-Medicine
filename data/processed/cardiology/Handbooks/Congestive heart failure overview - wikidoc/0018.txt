Congestive heart failure overview

of the heart when evaluating individuals with heart failure. Echocardiography Echocardiography is commonly used to diagnose and monitor the progression of heart failure. This modality uses ultrasound to determine the stroke volume (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the end-diastolic volume (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV divided by the EDV, a value known as the ejection fraction (EF). In pediatrics, the shortening fraction is the preferred measure of systolic function. Exercise stress test Exercise stress testing with an assessment of oxygen consumption is useful in assessing the functional capacity of the heart failure patient. Angiography can exclude the presence of an ischemic basis for the disease, and cardiac catheterization can evaluate the hemodynamic basis of heart failure and the response to drug. Myocardial viability studies can determine whether hypocontractile myocardium is viable but just hibernating, and could therefore benefit from revascularization.
