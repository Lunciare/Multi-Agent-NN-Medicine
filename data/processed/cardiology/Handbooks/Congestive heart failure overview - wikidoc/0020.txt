and organ perfusion manifested by worsening renal function, altered mentation and cold clammy extremities. ADHF associated with a poor prognosis if not treated aggressively. Like chronic heart failure therapy, the goal is to improve symptoms but unlike chronic therapy the other goals are to improve oxygenation and hemodynamic stability. The mainstays of the acute medical treatment in acute decompensated congestive heart failure include oxygen to improve hypoxia, diuresis to reduce both preload and intravascular volume and vasodilators to reduce afterload. Some of the mainstays of chronic heart failure therapy are not initiated acutely (ACE inhibtors,beta blockers and digoxin). General Measures in the Management of Heart Failure • Treat the underlying cause of heart failure such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and valvular heart disease. • Treat other non cardiac diseases that might contribute to the symptoms of heart failure such as diabetes and hyperthyroidism[2]. • Treat with a low salt diet[3] • Follow the patient's weight to check for fluid overload • Treat with vaccines for influenza and pneumococcus [4][5] Diuresis: First Step in the Management of Heart Failure The treatment of chronic heart failure often begins with the administration of diuretics, particularly if the patient has signs or symptoms
