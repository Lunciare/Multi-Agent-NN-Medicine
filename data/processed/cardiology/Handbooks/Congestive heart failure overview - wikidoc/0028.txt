Congestive heart failure overview

to 10 mg daily Weight gain or peripheral edema that is not responsive to diuresis may require a reduction in the dose of beta-blockers. Aldosterone Antagonism: Fourth Step in the Management of Heart Failure An aldosterone antagonist can be added to the regimen of 'select' patients. These selected patients include: 11/14 • Class II heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% • Class III/IV heart failure and a LVEF <35% • Post ST segment elevation MI and a LVEF < 40% who have either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. • The serum potassium must be under 5.0 meq/li and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be > 30 cc per minute A requirement for aldosterone antagonist is that the patient's renal function and potassium can be carefully monitored. Eplerenone has fewer endocrine side effects (1%) than spironolactone (10%), but is more costly. A reasonable strategy is to initiate therapy with spironolactone at a dose of 25 to 50 mg daily, and then switch to eplerenone at a dose of 25 to 50 mg daily if endocrine side effects develop.
