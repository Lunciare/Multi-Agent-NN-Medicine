Congestive heart failure overview

administration of digoxin is reasonable in patients with NYHA class II-IV heart failure symptoms who have an LVEF of < 40% despite treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and an aldosterone antagonist. Small doses of 0.125 mg per day of digoxin are often effective in maintaining a serum digoxin level between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/ml. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is recommended in congestive heart failure patients with: • Symptoms: NYHA Class II-IV • QRS: A prolonged QRS interval > 0.12 • LVEF: A LVEF < 30% to 35% Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI): Coronary artery disease (CAD) and impaired blood flow to the heart is one of the main causes of heart failure. Relieving the blockages in the coronary arteries can improve overall heart function, which may improve or resolve heart failure symptoms. The procedure is usually performed in a cardiac catherization laboratory. A catheter, a very small tube with a tiny deflated balloon on the end, is inserted through an incision in the groin area and then guided over a floppy wire to the section of the diseased artery. The balloon is then inflated to prop open the artery. The balloon is deflated and withdrawn
