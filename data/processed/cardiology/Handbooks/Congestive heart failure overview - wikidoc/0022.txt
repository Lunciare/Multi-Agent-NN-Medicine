may reflect a reduction in renal perfusion, and further diuresis should only be undertaken with careful monitoring of renal 9/14 function. The patient should weigh themselves each morning at the same time on the same scale, and the diuretic dosing should be adjusted to maintain a constant weight. Given the risk of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, the blood level of electrolyes should be checked regularly. ACE Inhibition and Angiotensin Receptor Blockade: Second Step in the Management of Heart Failure After diuretics are started or at the same time they are started, an ACE inhibitor can be initiated [7]. This includes a large group of drugs, such as Enalapril (Vasotec/Renitec), Ramipril (Altace/Tritace/Ramace/Ramiwin), Quinapril (Accupril), Perindopril (Coversyl/Aceon), Lisinopril (Lisodur/Lopril/Novatec/Prinivil/Zestril) and Benazepril (Lotensin). They can improve symptoms and prognosis of heart failure in several ways including afterload reduction and favorable ventricular remodeling. Usual side effects include dry cough and angioedema. Patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or severe renal impairment are not appropriate for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). During or after the initiation of diuresis, one could start, for example, lisinopril 5 mg Q day. Every 1 - 2 weeks, the dose would be escalated to achieve a target dose of 15 to
