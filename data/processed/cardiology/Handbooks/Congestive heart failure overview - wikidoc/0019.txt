is viable but just hibernating, and could therefore benefit from revascularization. Cardiac catheterization Coronary angiography is perfomred in patients with heart failure in whom there is a suspicion of underlying atherosclerosis as the basis for the heart failure. Patients who are troponin or CK-MB positive, who have dynamic EKG changes or other signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome who are revascularization candidates should undergo coronary angiography. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring 8/14 Based upon the results of the ESCAPE trial, there is no benefit in clinical outcomes associated with the routine use of a pulmonary artery line in patients with decompensated CHF. Treatment Acute Treatment Acute heart failure can occur in the setting of a new onset heart failure or worsening of an existing chronic heart failure (also known as acute decompensated heart failure, flash pulmonary edema, ADHF). ADHF presents with acute shortness of breath due to the development of pulmonary edema (the rapid accumulation of fluid in the lung). Other signs and symptoms of ADHF include hypotension with impaired and organ perfusion manifested by worsening renal function, altered mentation and cold clammy extremities. ADHF associated with a poor prognosis if not treated aggressively. Like chronic heart failure therapy, the
