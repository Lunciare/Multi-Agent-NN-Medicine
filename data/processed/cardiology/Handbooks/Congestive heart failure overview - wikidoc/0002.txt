Congestive heart failure overview

due to existing comorbidities such as, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking and ischemia in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. The pathogenesis of HFrEF is related largely to cellular proliferation and metabolism. Pathological processes that result in progression of HF and are common to both HFrEF and HFpEF are altered excitation-contraction coupling, epigenetic modifications, changes in sarcomeric coupling proteins, increased adrenergic drive, increased activity of renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis, nitric oxide insensitivity, adensoine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, reactive oxygen species production and an elevated cell death rate. The causes of heart failure can be broadly divided into cardiac and non-cardiac. Cardiac causes include aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, arrhythmias, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, arteriovenous fistula, atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac aneurysm, congenital heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, Eisenmenger syndrome, endocarditis, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interferon gamma, ischemic heart disease, malignant hypertension, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, myocardial infarction, oxaprozin, patent ductus arteriosus, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade, pericarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, pertuzumab, restrictive cardiomyopathy, rheumatic carditis, rupture of the papillary muscles, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, tricuspid insufficiency, valvular heart disease, ventricular aneurysm, ventricular septal defect. Congestive heart failure should be distinguished from other conditions that cause dyspnea, fatigue and edema. Heart failure affects close
