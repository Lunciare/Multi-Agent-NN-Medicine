the great vessels. Heart failure is characterized by decreased cardiac output but not necessarily decreased ejection fraction. Symptoms of heart failure are due to a lack of both forward blood flow to the body, and backward flow into the lungs. The body tries to compensate for the low cardiac output by mechanisms that increase the preload and afterload. These mechanisms lead to exacerbation of the cardiac malfunction and symptoms associated with heart failure. LV remodeling is the basic concept for HFpEF pathophysiolgy. Two models are emerging in HFpEF pathophysiology, the traditional model discussed about ventricular diastolic dysfunction , LV hypertrophy, impaired relaxation, endothelial dysfunction, arterial and ventricular stiffness and their effect on cardiac function. The emerged model discussed role of systemic microvascular endothelial inflammation due to existing comorbidities such as, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking and ischemia in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. The pathogenesis of HFrEF is related largely to cellular proliferation and metabolism.
