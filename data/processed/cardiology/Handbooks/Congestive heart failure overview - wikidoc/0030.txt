a day. The dose(s) can be increased every 2 to 4 weeks to a target dose of isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg three times a day and hydralazine 75 mg three times a day. Digoxin: Sixth step in the Management of Heart Failure Digitalis can strengthen the contractility of the heart and can also be useful to achieve rate control in patients with heart failure who also have atrial fibrillation. In the DIG trial, digoxin reduced the rate of re-hospitalization but did not improve mortality among all patients enrolled in the trial.[15] However, in a retrospective analysis, mortality was reduced in male patients who had digoxin levels between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/mL and was increased in male patients with digoxin levels > 1.2 ng/ml.[16] A similar trend was observed among women patients: there was a trend towards lower mortality at digoxin concentrations between 0.5 to 0.9 ng/ml, but significantly higher mortality at digoxin concentrations > 1.2 ng/ml.[17] 12/14 Digoxin should not be used as primary therapy for congestive heart failure. The administration of digoxin is reasonable in patients with NYHA class II-IV heart failure symptoms who have an LVEF of < 40% despite treatment with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers,
