disease with a major impact on the patient's quality of life. With the exception of heart failure caused by reversible conditions, the condition usually worsens with time. Although some people survive many years, progressive disease is associated with an overall annual mortality rate of 10%. In the Framingham experience, 80% of men and 70% of women with heart failure who were under 65 years of age had died within 8 years of the diagnosis. There are several diagnostic criteria / algorithms that are used to diagnose heart failure including an algorithm from the ESC, Framingham study, and Boston. The classic symptoms of heart failure include dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention. Patients with heart failure present in different ways. Some patients present with exercise intolerance but show little evidence of congestion or edema. Other patients present with mild symptoms of edema and pulmonary congestion. The ejection fraction is usually below 35% in patients who are symptomatic with systolic heart failure. BNP levels may be useful in the initial establishment of the diagnosis of heart failure in the patient with dyspnea of unclear etiology. Chest x-ray in a patient with heart failure shows cardiomegaly (cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion (Kerley B lines,
