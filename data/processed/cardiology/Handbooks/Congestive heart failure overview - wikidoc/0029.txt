a dose of 25 to 50 mg daily if endocrine side effects develop. Risk Factors for the Development of Hyperkalemia on an Aldosterone Antagonist • Triple therapy with an ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker makes this combination a contraindication • Higher doses of either an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) • Hyperkalemia prior to initiation of spironolactone • Comorbidities such as diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency • Higher NYHA heart failure class • Concomitant administration of beta blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or potassium supplements • A daily dose of Spironolactone greater than 50 mg The Combination of Hydralazine and a Nitrate: Fifth step in the Management of Heart Failure The combination of hydralazine and a nitrate (particularly among black patients) can be added if the patient continues to have symptoms on a diuretic, ACE inhibitor (or ARB in the intolerant patient) and a beta blocker. The initial dose is isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times a day along with hydralazine 25 mg three times a day. The dose(s) can be increased every 2 to 4 weeks to a target dose of isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg three times a day and hydralazine 75 mg three
