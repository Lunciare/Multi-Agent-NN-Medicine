Röntgen discovered x-rays in 1895 and allowed a more thorough understanding of maladaptive changes occurring in HF patients.In the 1940s and 1960s the advent of cardiac catheterization and cardiac surgery furthered our understanding of HF. The 1960s was also the decade that saw the emergence of LV assist devices (LVADs), beginning in 1961 when Dennis and co-workers uses a roller pump to assist the left ventricle. From the mid-1970s, the availability of vasodilators provided a means to reduce afterload in order to increase
