MI setting. These results for ARBs are in contrast to the results of the EMPHASIS HF trial showed that the addition of eplerenone (an aldosterone antagonist) to ACE inhibition improved clinical outcomes including mortality among patients with class II or III heart failure with a reduced LVEF.[13] Thus, based upon the mortality benefit observed in the EMPHASIS HF trial, an aldosterone antagonist rather than and ARB should be 10/14 added to an ACE inhibitor in patients with NYHA class II heart failure and an LVEF < 30%, in the post-MI patient who has an LVEF < 40% who has heart failure symptoms or diabetes, and the patient with class III or IV heart failure who has an LVEF < 35%. "Triple therapy", the combined use of an ACE inhibitor, an ARB and an aldosterone antagonist is a relative contraindication. Beta blockers: Third Step in the Management of Heart Failure Beta blockers reduce the heart rate which lowers the myocardial energy expenditure. They also prolong diastolic filling and lengthen the period of coronary perfusion. Beta blockers can also decrease the toxicity of catecholamines on the myocardium. Once you have achieved a stable dose of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor, then
