of diuresis, one could start, for example, lisinopril 5 mg Q day. Every 1 - 2 weeks, the dose would be escalated to achieve a target dose of 15 to 20 mg Q day. An ACE inhibitor is initiated before a beta blocker because an ACE inhibitor achieves its hemodynamic effect more rapidly, and is less likely to cause a decline in hemodynamics. Although there is some data to suggest that aspirin blunts the hemodynamic effect of ACE inhibitors, there is no data to suggest that aspirin reduces the clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors in heart failure patients. Aspirin should be administered to patients with ischemic heart disease, but not to patients without it. If a patient cannot tolerate a an ACE inhibitor (develops a cough), then an Angiotensin II receptor blocker can be administered in its place. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the activation of angiotensin II AT1 receptors. Blockade of AT1 receptors directly causes vasodilation, reduces secretion of vasopressin, reduces production and secretion of aldosterone. Because angiotensin II receptor antagonists do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ACE inhibitor therapy.
