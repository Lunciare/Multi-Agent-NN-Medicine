Congestive heart failure overview

of patients with heart failure die of sudden cardiac death. ICDs are indicated for patients with previous myocardial infarction and an LVEF <30%, sustained ventricular tachycardia, inducible ventricular tachycardia. The morbidity and mortality benefit of ICD placement compared with anti-arrhythmic drug therapy is controversial. Ultrafiltration 13/14 In the setting of congestive heart failure, ultrafiltration has been associated with a reduced incidence of hospitalization compared with diuretics in the UNLOAD trial, but no difference in mortality. Heart Transplantation A Heart transplant may be the only effective treatment option for patients with severe, progressive heart failure that can not be helped by medications, dietary and lifestyle changes. During a heart transplant procedure, the surgeons connect the patient to a heart-lung machine, which takes over the functions of the heart and lungs. Then the surgeons remove the diseased heart and replace it with the donor heart. Finally, the major blood vessels are reconnected and the new heart is ready to work. The outlook for people with heart transplants is good during the first few years after the transplant. Over 85 percent of patients are alive more than a year after their heart transplant.
