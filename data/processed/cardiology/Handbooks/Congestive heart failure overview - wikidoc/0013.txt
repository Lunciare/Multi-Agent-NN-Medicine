Congestive heart failure overview

condition. Heart failure resulting from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease has been shown to be associated with higher incidence of fatal events compared to heart failure that results from other cardiac diseases. Heart failure is a progressive disease with a major impact on the patient's quality of life. With the exception of heart failure caused by reversible conditions, the condition usually worsens with time. Although some people survive many years, progressive disease is associated 4/14 with an overall annual mortality rate of 10%. In the Framingham experience, 80% of men and 70% of women with heart failure who were under 65 years of age had died within 8 years of the diagnosis.
