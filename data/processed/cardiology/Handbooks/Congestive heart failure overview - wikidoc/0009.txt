Congestive heart failure overview

when Dennis and co-workers uses a roller pump to assist the left ventricle. From the mid-1970s, the availability of vasodilators provided a means to reduce afterload in order to increase cardiac efficiency and cardiac output in HF Classification Several classification schemes are used to characterize heart failure based on: • The pathophysiology of heart failure (systolic vs diastolic; left vs right; low output vs high output) • The chronicity of heart failure (acute vs chronic) • The severity of heart failure (the NY Heart Association Class) • The stage of congestive heart failure (AHA Class A,B,C,D) • The most recent classification according to the left ventricular ejection fraction; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction(HFrEF) vs heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)[1] Pathophysiology Heart failure is a complex syndrome whereby there is inadequate output of the heart to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Heart failure is caused by abnormal function of different anatomic parts of the heart including the pericardium, the myocardium, the endocardium, the heart valves and the great vessels. Heart failure is characterized by decreased cardiac output but not necessarily decreased ejection fraction. Symptoms of heart failure are due to a lack of both forward blood
