Congestive heart failure overview

the correction of electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia is critical in those patients treated with diuretics. Hyponatremia (due to poor stimulation of the baroreceptors and appropriate ADH release and free water retention) is associated with a poor prognosis. Electrocardiogram Although there is no diagnostic criteria of congestive heart failure on the EKG, there may be signs of the underlying cardiac cause(s) of congestive heart failure. The EKG often shows low QRS voltage. Other changes associated with HF include ventricular hypertrophy, atrial enlargement, 7/14 poor R wave progression, left bundle branch block. Chest X-ray Chest x-ray in a patient with heart failure shows cardiomegaly (cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion (Kerley B lines, and in some cases pleural effusion) MRI CMR may be used for assessment of LV and RV size and morphology, systolic and diastolic function, and for characterizing myocardial tissue for the purpose of understanding the etiology of LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction. The writing committee recognizes the potential capabilities of spectroscopic techniques for acquiring metabolic information of the heart when evaluating individuals with heart failure. Echocardiography Echocardiography is commonly used to diagnose and monitor the progression of heart failure. This modality uses ultrasound to determine the
