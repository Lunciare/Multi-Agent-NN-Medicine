Ventricular action potential

Overview The ventricular action potential is composed of four phases: phase 0 is depolarization, phase 1 is early repolarization, phase 2 is a plateau, phase 3 is rapid repolarization and phase 4 is the resting potential. The different phases depend on the opening and/or closure of specific ion channels. Ventricular Action Potential At rest, the ventricular myocyte membrane potential is about -90 mV, which is close to the potassium reversal potential. When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises above this level in four distinct phases. The beginning of the action potential, phase 1, specialized membrane proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s. As the membrane voltage rises (to about 40 mV) sodium channels close due to a process called inactivation. The sodium channel opening is followed by inactivation. Sodium inactivation comes with slowly inactivating Ca2+ channels at the same time as a few fast K+ channels open. There is a balance between the centrifugal flow of K+ and the centripetal flow of Ca2+ causing a plateau of length in variables. The delayed opening of
