Overview The ventricular action potential is composed of four phases: phase 0 is depolarization, phase 1 is early repolarization, phase 2 is a plateau, phase 3 is rapid repolarization and phase 4 is the resting potential. The different phases depend on the opening and/or closure of specific ion channels. Ventricular Action Potential At rest, the ventricular myocyte membrane potential is about -90 mV, which is close to the potassium reversal potential. When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises above this level in four distinct phases. The beginning of the action potential, phase 1, specialized membrane proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s.
