Overview
Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy is a decline in left ventricular function and left ventricular
dilation as a result of chronic or frequently recurring paroxysmal tachycardia. The tachycardia can
either be an atrial tachycardia or a ventricular tachycarrhythmia. Depending upon the duration of
the tachycardia, the condition is either completely or partially reversible.
Historical Perspective
The relationship between tachycardia and a reversible decline in left ventricular dysfunction was
first described by Phillips and Levine in 1949 [1].
Pathophysiology
Animal models demonstrate that sustained atrial or ventricular pacing results in dilation of all four
cardiac chambers with thinning of the left and right ventricular walls. Both diastolic and systolic
dysfunction develops in all four chambers as well [2]. The left ventricular wall thins, the cardiac
output drops and the systemic vascular resistance (SVR)rises. Chronic tachcardia is associated
with a prolongation of myocytelength [3]. Later in the course of the disease, mitral regurgiation
may develop due to dilation of the mitral valve anulus.

As a result of the reduced cardiac output, there is activation of the neurohormonal axis with
elevations of the following hormones:
• Plasma cathecholamines
• Atrial natriuretic peptide
• Renin
• Aldosterone
Although the precise mechanism is not known, it has been speculated that the underlying
mechanism of disease involves a depletion of myocardial energetics[4][5]. There also appear to be
abnormalities in calcium handling and calcium channel activity that may explain the reduction in
cardiac contractility[6] These abnormalities can persist up to 4 weeks after discontinuation of the
tachycardia.
Causes
The following tachyarrhythmias have all been associated with the development of tachycardia
induced cardiomyopathy:
• Atrial fibrillation
• Atrial flutter
• AV nodal reentry tachycardia
• Ventricular tachycardia
Disorders that Tachycardia Induced Cardiomyopathy Must be
distinguished From
Patients with atrial fibrillation and a very low left ventricular ejection fraction can be
presumptively diagnosed as having an primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with secondary
atrial fibrillation. Following aggressive rate control (pharmacologic and conversion of rhythm) in
10 patients initially diagnosed as having an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, there was an
improvement in left ventricular function at 30 months [7].
Epidemiology and Demographics
Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy occurs in patients of all ages [8][9][10][11]
Estimates of the incidence of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy among patients with atrial
fibrillation vary widely from 25% to 75% in small series [12][13][14][15][16].
Risk Factors
The rate and duration of the elevation in heart rate necessary to cause a cardiomyopathy is unclear
and is likely dependent on a number of other factors. It has been speculated that the rate, type,
duration of the rhythm as well as the patient's age, and co-morbidities all play a role[17].
Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis
Depending upon the duration of the tachycardia, the condition is either completely or partially
reversible after some time.[18] The pace of recovery of left ventricual dysfunctionis similar to that of
hibernating myocardium [19]. It may take one year for instance for left ventricular function to

recover [20][21]
Diagnosis
Resumption of normal or near normal left ventricular function following resolution of the
tachycardia establishes the diagnosis. The diagnosis should be suspected if a patient was known to
have normal LV function who sustains a decline in the setting of recurrent, paroxysmal or a
chronic tachyarrhythmia. Holter monitoring can be useful to gauge the patients heart rate
throughout 24 hours as the heart rate may vary tremendously with exercise and rest.
Treatment
The primary treatment for a tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy is correct the underlying
tachycardia. This may include the use of:
• Negative chronotropic agents such as beta blockers
• Cardioversion
• AV node ablation
• Treatment of the underlying condition such as hyperthyroidism or atrial fibriallation
Supportive agents such as ACE inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers are of benefit to try to
prevent remodeling of the left ventricle.
