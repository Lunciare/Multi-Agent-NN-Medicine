Restenosis

BMS has only the scaffold, which can all contribute towards this hypersensitivity reaction. • • • Stent Platform: The stent platforms of the BMS and first generation DES (paclitaxel and sirolimus) is made up of 316L stainless steel, which contains more nickel and molybdenum than the second generation DES, where the scaffold is made up of cobalt chromium. This nickel and molybdenum are known to trigger these hypersensitivity reactions.[24] Interestingly, to date, no prospective studies have confirmed this association. • • • Polymer: The durable polymer which remains covering the stent after releasing the anti- stenotic drug has known to cause hypersensitivity and is suspected as the culprit for stent thrombosis and progressive or late re-stenosis. • • • Matrix Metalloproteinases: Circulating matrix metalloproteinase(MMP) have been associated with ISR as they play significant roles in migration of vascular smooth cells and matrix remodelling during healing post-stenting. Elevated levels of MMP-9 at baseline and MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels 24 hours post-percutaneous coronary intervention have proven to be strongly associated with the development of ISR following DES implantation. On the contrary, low and near normal levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were associated with a lack of a significant re-stenotic response. • •
