Restenosis

DES have the added advantage of releasing anti-stenotic drug which can retard the neo-intima 2/10 formation. Rapamycin, an immunosuppresant agent approved by the FDA, inhibits both rat and human vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration in vitro. A study investigated (1) whether rapamycin administration could reduce neointimal thickening in a porcine model of restenosis post-PTCA and (2) the mechanism by which rapamycin inhibits VSMCs in vivo. It was found that rapamycin administration significantly reduced the arterial proliferative response after PTCA in the pig by increasing the level of the CDKI p27(kip1) and inhibition of the pRb phosphorylation within the vessel wall. Therefore, pharmacological interventions that elevate CDKI in the vessel wall and target cyclin-dependent kinase activity may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of restenosis after angioplasty in humans[6]. These common pathways finally act on the cell cycle and result in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Given that the anti-stenotic drug of DES act at the level of the cell cycle, they are thus the most effective strategy available to prevent coronary restenosis after a percutaneous coronary intervention. Once again, there are several other factors involved in re-stenosis of BMS and DES (as discussed below). Coronary re-stenosis can be
