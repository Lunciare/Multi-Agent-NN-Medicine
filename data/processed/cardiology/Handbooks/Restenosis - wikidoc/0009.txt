Restenosis

immunohistochemical identification, it has been shown that there is a steady accumulation of macrophages within stented segments (with clustering of macrophages around stent struts), where as there virtually no accumulation within balloon-injured segments of pure balloon angioplasty.[9] [10] The porcine model of in-stent restenosis (ISR) has demonstrated the formation of a thick neointima in 28 days-which may be the reason as to why the earlier DES released their antistenotic drug by the end of 30 days. However, it is well known that the peak period of ISR development in humans is approximately 3 to 6 months-hence the newer DES are aiming to release the drug for an extended period. Interestingly, in these porcine models they found a positive correlation between the inflammatory infiltrate, degree of arterial injury and extent of stent strut penetration into the vessel wall with the neointimal thickness. Interestingly, in a rat model of carotid artery dilatation the gate-keeper step in initiating vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation from tunica media to intima is the rupture of internal elastic lamina.[11] [8] The above mentioned responses and time periods were in porcine models with near normal coronaries and this may not be the case in humans who have had
