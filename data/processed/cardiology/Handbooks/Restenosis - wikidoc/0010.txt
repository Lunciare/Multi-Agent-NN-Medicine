Restenosis

elastic lamina.[11] [8] The above mentioned responses and time periods were in porcine models with near normal coronaries and this may not be the case in humans who have had balloon angioplasty, BMS and DES for atherosclerotic lesions. The inflammatory response in DES is very different in terms of cell composition and timing, when compared to balloon angioplasty and BMS and also among the different DES. These differences could be explained by the presence of various forms of polymer among DES. For example, the inflammatory response (predominantly giant cell infiltrates) to Sirolimus DES has been shown to persist beyond 180 days and up to 2 years. In contrast, the inflammatory response to BMS and the second generation Everolimus DES (which has a more 3/10 biocompatible polymer) has been limited to 90 days and 12 months, respectively. Evidence of such persistence of inflammatory response has been found in autopsy cases and from thrombus aspirates taken from patients during percutaneous coronary intervention for late stent thrombosis. As mentioned earlier, the neointima consists of the hyperplastic vascular smooth muscle cells and the extracellular protein rich matrix. The current evidence points to the fact that these smooth muscle cells are of luminal origin, however,
