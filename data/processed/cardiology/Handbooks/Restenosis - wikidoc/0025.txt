Restenosis

a BMS. The positive predictive value of symptoms indicating a significant stenosis is as low as 60%. ISR is often thought to be a benign phenomenon since the process of neointimal formation and proliferation is of gradual onset and progressive in nature. Given the pathophysiology of coronary re-stenosis, it is thought that re- stenosis is a rare cause of acute myocardial infarction or death. However, there are several reports which have shown that ISR can present as an acute coronary syndrome. 26% to 53% and 3.5% to 20% of BMS ISR can present as unstable angina and myocardial infarction, respectively. Similarly, 16% to 66% and 1% to 20% of DES ISR can present as unstable angina and myocardial infarction, respectively. A highly stenotic ISR lesion can lead to an non-occlusive thrombus, which can result in an acute coronary syndrome. Also, patients with clinically silent re-stenosis can be identified on coronary cineangiograms when neighbouring plaques undergo rupture or intimal tear and present as an acute coronary syndrome. Sometimes, local plaque rupture or intimal tear can initiate an inflammatory process which can promote thrombosis of neighbouring stenotic lesions. Thus, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the patient as coronary re-stenosis can present
