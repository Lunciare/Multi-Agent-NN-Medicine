the intensity of the inflammatory proliferative response. • • On- and Off-Label Use: The STENT group is the largest, multicenter, prospective registry involving >15,000 patients, evaluating the late outcomes associated with DES implantation in the United States showed an almost 2 fold increase in target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 9 months for off-label use (ostial, left main stem, chronic total occlusions, saphenous venous graft, small or large vessels, multivessel, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, ISR lesions) when compared to on-label use (short de novo lesions measuring >2.5mm and <3.5mm for Sirolimus DES or <3.75mm for Paclitaxel DES). Also, when looking at the SYNTAX study, there were higher TVR rates in patients with highly complex 3-vessel or left main disease who underwent DES (which was an off-label use of DES). When analyzing the list of off-label uses, it seems that these patients have complex coronary lesions (with a higher SYNTAX score), more sicker and have more comorbidities which could easily influence TVR. • • Polymer Disruption, Peeling and Crackling: This can result in exposure of bare-metal areas, which has been demonstrated in bench studies involving both first and second generation DES using light or scanning electron microscopy. It is plausible that this bare
