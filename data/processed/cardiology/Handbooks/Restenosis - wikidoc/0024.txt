Restenosis

anti-stenotic drug distribution (if it is in between 2 DES) will clearly increase the risk for re-stenosis • • • DES Deployment in a Clot-Laden Segment: Logically, it seems that there is significant reduction in penetrance of anti-stenotic drug in regions, where the DES is deployed in clot-laden arterial segment. However, with the widespread use of glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa inhibitors, potent P2Y12 receptor antagonists and aspiration thrombectomy, these concerns do not translate into clinical events. This is demonstrated in a recent meta- analysis of 13 trials (n=7244) has shown significant benefits of DES over BMS in reducing TVR and recurrent MI (at the end of one year) in STEMI patients. Clinical Presentation In-stent restenosis (ISR) can be clinically silent, but majority of them present with recurrent symptoms of angina. The incidence of recurrent angina pectoris after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was reported in the past to be around 50% with a wide range. This number may 8/10 have reduced as most the PCIs end up in a DES as opposed to a BMS. The positive predictive value of symptoms indicating a significant stenosis is as low as 60%. ISR is often thought to be a benign phenomenon since the process of
