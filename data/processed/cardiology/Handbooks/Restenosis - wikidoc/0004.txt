wall injury) and fibrin. Basically, this phenomenon can be considered synonymous to hemostasis. Activated platelets express adhesion molecules, to which circulating leukocytes attach and begin the process of leukocyte migration. Also during this process, several chemotactic factors are released and multiple adhesion molecules are expressed by various activated inflammatory cells in the vicinity of the inflammation, which cause chemotaxis of leukocytes to the core of the inflammation. Growth factors, cytokines and adhesion molecules released and expressed by platelets, leukocytes and other inflammatory cells, result in the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the media and proliferation with resultant neo-intima formation [3] [4] [5]. Hence, neo-intima consists of vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and extracellular matrix, which has formed over several weeks. When reading through the above process, we realize that plaque rupture and stent thrombosis uses the same tools of inflammation mentioned above. The phenomenon of stent thrombosis and acute coronary syndrome can be thought of as an acute phenomenon, evolving in minutes to a couple of hours. Thus, depending on several factors (which favor acute thrombosis) the above mentioned process can evolve very quickly resulting in thrombosis of the coronary vessel. This process can then follow any of
