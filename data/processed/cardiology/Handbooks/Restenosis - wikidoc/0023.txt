fracture. • • Technical Factors: • Barotrauma/Geographical Miss (GM): When a stent is deployed and if its fails to cover the sites of balloon injury or the atherosclerotic in its entirety, then these missed sites can become a nidus for re-stenosis. GM can be classified as longitudinal or axial. Longitudinal GM was defined as injured or diseased stenotic segment, which was not fully covered by the DES. Whereas, axial GM was defined as inadequate or overzealous sizing of the balloon, which results in effects similar to stent underexpansion/malapposition and uncontrolled vessel wall injury (increasing the stimulus for inflammation and proliferative response, respectively. Hence, the presence of injured or diseased segment not covered by the stent or balloon-artery ratio <0.9 or >1.3 was noted to have an increased association with target vessel revascularization and myocardial infarction at 1 year. • • • Stent Gap: It is simply defined as a discontinuous coverage between 2 stents. A gap between 2 stents exposes the site of balloon injury as well the lack of anti-stenotic drug distribution (if it is in between 2 DES) will clearly increase the risk for re-stenosis • • • DES Deployment in a Clot-Laden Segment: Logically, it seems that
