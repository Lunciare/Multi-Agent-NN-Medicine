Restenosis

• "Thrombostenosis" Phenomenon: Oikawa et al was the first to describe the intriguing theory in which chronic thrombus formation may play an integral role in the development of ISR. • • Vessel Remodelling: The implantation of DES in vessels that have already undergone positive remodelling secondary to large plaque burden ("Glagov" phenomenon) have an increased risk for ISR. • Stent Factors: • Polymer Release Characteristics: In one the earlier trials involving Paclitaxel, they found that the duration of the drug release had a far greater impact on the inhibition of neointimal proliferation than the actual drug dose delivered. Several molecular biological studies have indicated that the genetic mechanisms responsible for the inflammatory proliferative response remain potentially active for a period of 21 days after vessel wall injury. These polymer release kinetics could explain some of the disparities in the ISR among different DES. It seems clear that when the antistenotic drug is delivered at a set threshold dose for a sustained prolonged period of time may be required to control the inflammatory proliferative response and hence reduce the occurrence of ISR. • • Non-uniform Drug Distribution: • Ideally, the anti-stenotic drug should be delivered in a homogeneous fashion to the
