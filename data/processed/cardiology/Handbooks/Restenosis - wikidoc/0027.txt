with recurrent angina about 2 years after the stent implantation. Among the clinical predictors of coronary re-stenosis, diabetes mellitus continues to be a strong clinical predictor. In a study conducted by Singh et al., they found that patients with treated diabetes mellitus had a 45% higher risk of restenosis compared with nondiabetics. Interestingly, in their study they found that current smokers have less restenosis. This smoker's paradox has been described in the past. Some of the other predictors are increasing age, female sex and chronic renal disease and patients on hemodialysis. Angiographic and other predictors are listed under the other sections.

Patients who develop clinical restenosis after balloon angioplasty should be treated with bare metal stent (BMS) or drug eluting stent (DES) if anatomic factors are appropriate and if the patient is able to comply with and tolerate dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).[26] (Level of Evidence: B)" "2. Patients who develop clinical restenosis after bare metal stent (BMS) should be treated with drug eluting stent (DES) if anatomic factors are appropriate and the patient is able to comply with and tolerate dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).[27][28][29](Level of
