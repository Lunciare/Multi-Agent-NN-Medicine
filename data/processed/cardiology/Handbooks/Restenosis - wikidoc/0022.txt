Restenosis

The incidence of DES fracture has been reported from 1% to 8%. In fact, in the only randomized controlled trial reporting the incidence and outcomes of stent fracture in DES (LONG-DES II study), where they had a follow-up angiography, a 14% incidence of restenosis was observed. There are 2 important mechanisms for stent fracture. Firstly, with excessive movements during myocardial contraction, significant tension is exerted at hinge points where the myocardial contractility forces act in opposing direction and result in fracture. Secondly, when a stent has a closed cell design (as seen with Sirolimus DES), the stent cannot dissipate the myocardial contractility pressures and hence the stent itself succumbs to this force and results in a fracture. Hence, with these principle mechanisms in mind; long stents, right coronary artery lesions, excessive tortuosity, angulation and torsion of the vessel, overlapping stents, saphenous vein graft lesions, tight calcified lesions that have been vigorously post dilated and expanded, myocardial bridges' sites and closed cell design stents (such as Sirolimus DES) predispose towards stent fracture. • • Technical Factors: • Barotrauma/Geographical Miss (GM): When a stent is deployed and if its fails to cover the sites of balloon injury or the atherosclerotic in its
