depending on several factors (which favor acute thrombosis) the above mentioned process can evolve very quickly resulting in thrombosis of the coronary vessel. This process can then follow any of the pathways: • the patient seeks immediate help and the percutaneous coronary intervention can open up the vessel and prevent progression of the acute coronary syndrome • the patient fails to seek help and can die from a massive myocardial infarction • sometimes, without seeking help, the patient lives through this coronary thrombosis and the clot becomes organised and recanalised. In more simple words, coronary restenosis can be thought of as a sub-acute to chronic vascular inflammatory response to iatrogenic controlled injury; while stent thrombosis is an acute vascular response resulting in acute thrombosis and a high propensity to cause sudden death or significant morbidity. In balloon angioplasty, the lumen size is increased from its baseline diseased state through the dilatation of the balloon at the site of the diseased region. However, the elastic recoil (of the artery), negative remodeling, contraction and finally neo-intima formation, results in restenosis. Also, to be noted is the fact that there is a 30% risk of abrupt closure of the vessel from acute thrombosis
