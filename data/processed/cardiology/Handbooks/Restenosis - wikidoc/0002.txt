Restenosis

meet angiographic criteria, but meets the criteria for a physiologically significant lesion by fractional flow reserve (FFR) or anatomically by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) with the appropriate clinical context, it is still considered 'Clinical Re-stenosis'. PCI has evolved significantly from plain balloon angioplasty to the development of biodegradable stents in the last few decades. Currently, almost all coronary interventions use a bare metal stent (BMS) or more so a drug eluting stent (DES). Hence, the discussion in the following paragraphs will focus on in-stent re-stenosis of drug eluting and bare metal stents. Coronary Restenosis There are probably several mechanisms that lead to restenosis. An important one is the inflammatory response, which induces tissue proliferation around an angioplasty site. Cardiologists have tried a number of approaches to decrease the risk of restenosis. Stenting is becoming more commonplace; replacing balloon angioplasty. During the stenting procedure, a metal mesh (stent) is deployed against the wall of the artery revascularizing the artery. Other approaches include local radiotherapy and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, coated onto the stenting mesh. Analogues of rapamycin, such as tacrolimus (FK-506), sirolimus and more so everolimus, normally used as immunosuppressants but recently discovered to also inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth
