Restenosis

of the hyperplastic vascular smooth muscle cells and the extracellular protein rich matrix. The current evidence points to the fact that these smooth muscle cells are of luminal origin, however, there is data that indicates that they can be of adventitial origin too.[12] [13] The later stages of restenosis is contributed predominantly by the deposition of extracellular matrix.[14] [15] After reviewing the existing evidence, it seems that migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells form the major final common pathway for restenosis. In the presence of growth factors and cytokines, these vascular smooth cells undergo a phenotypic modulation from a contractile state to a synthetic phenotype. Hence, most of the molecular research in the past few years has been focused on understanding the common pathways that multiple receptors employ to transmit mitogenic signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus of the vascular smooth cells after arterial injury.[16] [17] The three common pathways which result in pathological mitosis of the vascular smooth cells are: • Ras-raf mitogen activated protein kinase • Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase dependent signalling • Cyclin dependent kinase complexes Several rat models have shown that alteration of these pathways can worsen or prevent neo initmal formation.[18]
