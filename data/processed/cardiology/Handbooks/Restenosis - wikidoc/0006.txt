contraction and finally neo-intima formation, results in restenosis. Also, to be noted is the fact that there is a 30% risk of abrupt closure of the vessel from acute thrombosis from plain balloon angioplasty as it is a form of vascular injury too (iatrogenic controlled injury). Based on individual clinical and angiographic characteristics, some patients develop this fatal complication, while others do not. In stent implantation, the lumen size is increased from its baseline diseased state and has a better patency than plain balloon angioplasty, as the stent scaffold holds the vessel open; therefore the component of elastic recoil and negative remodeling is reduced significantly. Thus the restenosis rates are lower in BMS when compared to plain balloon angioplasty, as the elastic recoil and negative remodeling is virtually eliminated. Hence, the final lumen size is greater and neo-intima formation does not materialize into clinical restenosis as seen to occur more commonly with balloon angioplasty. Similarly, it is well known that DES has a lower re-stenosis rate than BMS as the DES have the added advantage of releasing anti-stenotic drug which can retard the neo-intima 2/10 formation. Rapamycin, an immunosuppresant agent approved by the FDA, inhibits both rat and human vascular
