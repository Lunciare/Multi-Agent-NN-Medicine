Restenosis

to prevent coronary restenosis after a percutaneous coronary intervention. Once again, there are several other factors involved in re-stenosis of BMS and DES (as discussed below). Coronary re-stenosis can be considered in two different settings of a percutaneous coronary intervention: • In pure balloon angioplasty (in the absence of stenting)- Following balloon angioplasty, there is injury to the vessel wall, which triggers the expected inflammatory response from the vessel wall. Hence, there is elastic recoil, negative remodelling (reduction in lumen size due to the healing process) or contraction, thrombus at the site of injury (i.e., release of prothrombotic thromboplastin like material from the vessel wall, exposure of the collagen of the media), smooth muscle proliferation and migration and excessive extracellular matrix production. • With stenting- Stenting prevents elastic recoil and negative remodelling. However, neointimal formation progresses and causes re-stenosis, which is reduced with antistenotic drugs. Restenosis in patients after stent implantation is caused predominantly by neointimal hyperplasia. However neointima formation in plain balloon angioplasty has a minor role.[7] [8] Through immunohistochemical identification, it has been shown that there is a steady accumulation of macrophages within stented segments (with clustering of macrophages around stent struts), where as there virtually no accumulation
