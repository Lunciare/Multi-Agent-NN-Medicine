the inflammatory proliferative response and hence reduce the occurrence of ISR. • • Non-uniform Drug Distribution: • Ideally, the anti-stenotic drug should be delivered in a homogeneous fashion to the vessel wall (i.e., transmural and circumferential). However, due to local blood flow alterations (secondary to atherosclerotic plaque and calcified lesions), non-compliant vessels (i.e., calcified, tortuous), strut overlap, stent design, stent gap, vessel curvature, bifurcation lesions, ostial lesions, stent fracture and polymer damage can result in focal areas of the vessel receiving sub-optimal anti-stenotic drug. • • • Stent delivery in calcified lesions can result in stripping of the polymer base. • • 6/10 • Finally, individual variations in metal to artery ratio and variability in drug elution can all contribute to stent re-stenosis. • • Strut Thickness: Thicker stent struts have been associated with increased risk of ISR with BMS and smaller vessels. This could be explained by the fact that the thinner stent strut would have a lesser dose of foreign body exposure to the vessel wall, hence reducing the intensity of the inflammatory proliferative response. • • On- and Off-Label Use: The STENT group is the largest, multicenter, prospective registry involving >15,000 patients, evaluating the late outcomes associated
