Restenosis

average reference cross-sectional area. • • Stent Malapposition: In malapposition, the stent struts are not apposed to the vessel wall (blood occupies the space between the stent struts and vessel wall). It is commonly seen with undersized stents, tortuous arteries and non-homogeneity in the reference arterial lumen diameter within the treated segment. • • Stent Fracture: It is defined as complete or partial separation of a stent, which was contiguous on initial implantation. This commonly happens with non-uniform stent expansion in region with both very compliant and resilient vessel walls. IVUS is an accurate imaging modality to recognize this abnormality. Partial stent fracture is defined as the absence of atleast one third or 120 degrees of stent struts for at least 1 frame. Complete stent fracture is defined Caosok tiehse h eclpo ums dpelleivteer oaubr sseervniccees.

There have been various classification systems to represent the severity of stent fracture. The incidence of DES fracture has been reported from 1% to 8%.
