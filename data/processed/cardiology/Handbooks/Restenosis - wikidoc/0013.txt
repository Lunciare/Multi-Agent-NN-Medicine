Restenosis

to these drugs vary. This resistance can be the result of inherited genetic mutations or acquired following the exposure of a cytotoxic drug.[20] [21] • Genetic Factors Affecting the Inflammatory Response: Polymorphism of glycoprotein IIIa and a mutant form of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase appear to increase the risk of ISR.[22] Interestingly, allele 2 of interleukin IL-1ra gene appears to be protective. However, 4/10 these are just some of the genetic factors which have been identified in the causation of ISR. Hence, there remains the possibility of complex multigenic abnormalities (interplay of multiple variant forms of genes and environmental factors), which can play a significant role in ISR. These identified and yet to be identified genetic factors may explain as to why some patients develop ISR and some don’t despite identical clinical factors and stent characteristics. • Hypersensitivity: The implantation of these stents is recognized as foreign antigens and hence a hypersensitivity reaction [23] can be triggered, which can lead to ISR. As mentioned earlier, the DES has 3 components and the BMS has only the scaffold, which can all contribute towards this hypersensitivity reaction. • • • Stent Platform: The stent platforms of the BMS and first generation DES (paclitaxel and
