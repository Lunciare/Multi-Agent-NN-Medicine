exposure of bare-metal areas, which has been demonstrated in bench studies involving both first and second generation DES using light or scanning electron microscopy. It is plausible that this bare metal exposure and stent regions in the absence of anti-stenotic drug can form a nidus for inflammatory and proliferative response. Seen more so in stent implantation in tortuous calcified lesions. • Mechanical Factors: • Stent Underexpansion: When the stent is deployed and it is not well expanded, it results in a vessel lumen size whose stent cross-sectional area is significantly smaller that of the reference lumen size or other cross-sectional areas within the stent, despite good apposition of the stent struts against the vessel wall. If the minimum stent area is smaller than the reference lumen size to begin with, then the same amount of neointimal formation would be of greater significance than in a scenario where the minimum stent area was larger. An excellent expansion is considered if the minimal cross-sectional area in the stent is >90% of the average reference cross-sectional area. • • Stent Malapposition: In malapposition, the stent struts are not apposed to the vessel wall (blood occupies the space between the stent struts and vessel
