development of ISR following DES implantation. On the contrary, low and near normal levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were associated with a lack of a significant re-stenotic response. • • • Genetic factors: As mentioned above can play a significant role in the inflammatory response, which can result in ISR. • B) Arterial Factors: • Wall Shear Stress: The laminar flow of blood is a well known phenomenon, where the blood flows the fastest at the vessel center (or at the carina of a bifurcation) and slowest when it flows closest to the vessel wall (or at the ostium of a bifurcation). Hence, regions of low shear stress lead to accumulation of biological mediators, which promote atherosclerosis or neointimal formation. Adapting this principle would mean that a divider or the formation of a new carina should reduce the incidence of ISR. Kim at al demonstrated reduced occurrence of ISR by 'shotgun stenting' (i.e., simultaneous V-stenting with the formation of a new carina in the left main stem or other suitably sized vessels) but conversely, Stinus et al demonstrated increased target lesion revascularization rate with V-stenting when compared 5/10 with the 'Crush' technique. This disparity can have a couple of explanations:
