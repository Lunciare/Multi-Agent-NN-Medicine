Restenosis

sized vessels) but conversely, Stinus et al demonstrated increased target lesion revascularization rate with V-stenting when compared 5/10 with the 'Crush' technique. This disparity can have a couple of explanations: 1) lesion location 2) post stent lumen size 3) reference lumen size 4) exposure of the new carina (formed by stent struts) for thrombus formation. The presence of patchy areas of low shear stress within stented segments, secondary to local geometric factors (such as angulation or curvature) can predispose towards increased neointimal formation and hence ISR. This was demonstrated by Papafaklis et al on 6 month follow-up with BMS and Paclitaxel DES. However, this was not seen with Sirolimus DES. This difference can be explained by the differing pharmacological mode of action and shorter drug-release kinetics. • • Progression of Atherosclerosis within a Stented Segment: If the necrotic plaque within the stent progresses or if a lipid core plaque at the stent edge is not covered completely, then these lesions can progress to cause ISR or even thrombus formation. • • "Thrombostenosis" Phenomenon: Oikawa et al was the first to describe the intriguing theory in which chronic thrombus formation may play an integral role in the development of ISR. •
