Restenosis

Overview Restenosis literally means the reoccurrence of stenosis. This is usually restenosis of an artery, or other blood vessel, but possibly any hollow organ that has been "unblocked". This term is common in vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, interventional radiology, or interventional cardiology following angioplasty, all branches of medicine that frequently treat stenotic lesions. In simple words, coronary restenosis can be considered as the reduction in the lumen diameter after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which induces iatrogenic arterial injury and results in neointimal tissue proliferation.[1] It can be defined based on angiography or as clinical restenosis. By angiography, the term 'Binary Angiographic Re-stenosis' is defined as > 50% luminal narrowing at follow-up angiography.[2] However, the most widely accepted and relevant definition would be a 'Clinical Re-stenosis', which is defined as need for a repeat target lesion revascularization (TLR) due to symptomatic coronary ischemia from the previously intervened vessel (proposed by the Academic Research Consortium). Therefore, this definition needs angiographic narrowing as well as clinical correlation. If the lesion does not meet angiographic criteria, but meets the criteria for a physiologically significant lesion by fractional flow reserve (FFR) or anatomically by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) with the appropriate clinical context, it is
