Restenosis

or intimal tear can initiate an inflammatory process which can promote thrombosis of neighbouring stenotic lesions. Thus, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the patient as coronary re-stenosis can present as an acute coronary syndrome. BMS ISR has been reported to occur usually after five and half months after stent implantation. The time frame for DES ISR presentation is not well-known with one study reporting a mean time duration of 12 months. Delayed restenosis is known to occur especially with DES. There have been reports, using intravascular ultrasound that have shown neointimal proliferation to occur even at 4 years after stent implantation. The exact reasons as to why this delayed neointimal proliferation occurs is not well known. Some of the suspected pathophysiological mechanisms are delayed healing response, persistent biological reaction caused by the drug present in the polymer, or a hypersensitivity reaction to the polymer and a possible a genetic predisposition. This eludes to the fact that the clinician should entertain the possibility of coronary re-stenosis in patients who present with recurrent angina about 2 years after the stent implantation. Among the clinical predictors of coronary re-stenosis, diabetes mellitus continues to be a strong clinical predictor. In a study conducted
