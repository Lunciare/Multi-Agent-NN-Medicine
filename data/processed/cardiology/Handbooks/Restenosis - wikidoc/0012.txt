kinase • Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase dependent signalling • Cyclin dependent kinase complexes Several rat models have shown that alteration of these pathways can worsen or prevent neo initmal formation.[18] Pathophysiology In this section we will discuss the etiological and various pathophysiological factors, which lead to restenosis. DES predominantly consist of 3 elements: • Scaffold or the stent platform, which forms the skeleton of the stent (this made of stainless steel or cobalt chromium). • The antistenotic drug (such as paclitaxel, everolimus, etc). • The polymer or the carrier on which the drug is mounted. Unlike, the DES the BMS consist only the scaffold or the platform. The pathophysiology seems to be the interplay of clinical characteristics, biological factors, mechanical factors, technical factors and finally de-novo lesions which arise within the stent itself. The various pathophysiological factors are discussed as follows: • Biological and Genetic Factors: • Drug Resistance: Recent studies have revealed a genetic basis for drug resistance.[19] Depending on the penetrance and expressivity of these mutations, the sensitivity to these drugs vary. This resistance can be the result of inherited genetic mutations or acquired following the exposure of a cytotoxic drug.[20] [21] • Genetic Factors Affecting the Inflammatory
