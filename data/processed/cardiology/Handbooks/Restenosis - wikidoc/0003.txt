Restenosis

the stenting mesh. Analogues of rapamycin, such as tacrolimus (FK-506), sirolimus and more so everolimus, normally used as immunosuppressants but recently discovered to also inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, have appeared to be quite effective in preventing restenosis in clinical trials. Antisense knockdown of c-myc, a protein critical for progression of cell replication, is another approach to inhibit cell proliferation in the artery wall and has been through preliminary clinical trials using Morpholino oligos. Histopathology and Molecular Mechanisms Restenosis can considered a local vascular manifestation of the general biological response to arterial wall injury. Following vessel wall injury with endothelium damage, the exposure of tunica media to the flowing blood results in platelet adhesion to the media's collagen via the Von Williebrand factor. This results in platelet activation, which is followed by aggregation and soon evolving into a vicious cycle, which feeds and nurtures itself till a clot is formed from the coagulation cascade (which is activated from the tissue thromboplastin released from the media following vessel wall injury) and fibrin. Basically, this phenomenon can be considered synonymous to hemostasis. Activated platelets express adhesion molecules, to which circulating leukocytes attach and begin the process of leukocyte migration.
