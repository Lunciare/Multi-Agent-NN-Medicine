Bundle of His
KEYWORDS: bundle, branches, muscle, ventricular, fibers, bundle branches, heart, conduction, ventricles, purkinje, left, electrical, impulse, block, cardiac

give rise to thin filaments known as Purkinje fibers. These fibers distribute the impulse to the ventricular muscle. Together, the bundle branches and Purkinje network comprise the ventricular conduction system. It takes about 0.03-0.04 seconds for the impulse to travel from the bundle of His to the ventricular muscle. Pathology If the Bundle of His becomes blocked, there will be dissociation between the activity of the atria and the ventricles. This complete dissociation between the atria and the ventricles is called third degree heart block. Other causes of third degree heart block would be complete block of the right, left anterior, and left posterior bundle branches. Third degree block is a serious medical condition that often requires insertion of an artificial pacemaker. His Bundle Pacing In 2000, Dr. Pramod Deshmukh, an electrophysiologist in Sayre, PA announced that he had successfully performed Direct His-Bundle pacing that produced synchronous ventricular depolarization and improved cardiac function relative to apical pacing. This breakthrough was hailed by Dr. Melvin M. Scheinman, considered by many to be the father of electrophysiology, for what he called a "tour de force" deserving "strong accolades" for the technical accomplishment.
