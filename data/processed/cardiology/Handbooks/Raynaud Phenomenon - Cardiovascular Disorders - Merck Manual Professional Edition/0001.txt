Raynaud phenomenon, is vasospasm of parts of the hand in response to cold or emotional stress, causing reversible discomfort and color changes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema, or a combination) in one or more digits. Occasionally, other acral parts (eg, nose, tongue) are affected. The condition may be primary or secondary. Diagnosis is clinical; testing focuses on distinguishing primary from secondary disease. Treatment of uncomplicated cases includes avoidance of cold, biofeedback, smoking cessation, and, as needed, vasodilating calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine) or other medications. Overall prevalence is approximately 3 to 5%; women are affected more than men, and younger people are affected more than older people (1, 2). Raynaud phenomenon is probably due to an exaggerated alpha-2 adrenergic response that triggers vasospasm; the mechanism is not defined. Primary Raynaud phenomenon (also called Raynaud disease) is much more common (80 to 90% of cases) than secondary; it occurs without symptoms or signs of other disorders (3, 4). In the remaining 10 to 20% of patients with Raynaud symptoms, a causative underlying disease (eg, systemic sclerosis) will be evident at initial presentation or diagnosed subsequently. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon (also called Raynaud syndrome) accompanies various disorders and conditions, mostly systemic rheumatic diseases (see table
