For patients who do not tolerate calcium channel blockers, alternative agents include topical nitrates, oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), angiotensin II receptor blockers, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine). Beta-blockers, clonidine, and ergot preparations are contraindicated because they cause vasoconstriction and may trigger or worsen symptoms. Treatment of secondary Raynaud phenomenon focuses on the underlying disorder. Calcium channel blockers and other medications are given as above for primary Raynaud phenomenon. Antibiotics, analgesics, and, occasionally, surgical debridement may be necessary for ischemic ulcers. Low-dose aspirin may prevent thrombosis but theoretically may worsen vasospasm via prostaglandin inhibition. IV prostaglandins (alprostadil, epoprostenol, iloprost) appear to be effective and may be an option for patients with severely ischemic digits. These medications often require administration in the inpatient setting but may be provided in an experienced outpatient center with appropriate monitoring.

Sympathectomy often abolishes the symptoms, but relief may be temporary. Key Points Raynaud phenomenon is reversible vasospasm of parts of the hand in response to cold or emotional stress.
