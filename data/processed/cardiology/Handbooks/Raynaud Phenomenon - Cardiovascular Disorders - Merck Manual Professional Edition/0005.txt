1:40) antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer No history or physical findings suggesting another cause Findings suggesting secondary Raynaud phenomenon are the following: Age at onset > 40 years Severe painful attacks that may be asymmetric and unilateral Ischemic lesions History and findings suggesting an accompanying disorder Laboratory testing Vascular laboratory testing includes measuring digital pulse wave forms and pressures. The main blood tests are to diagnose autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (eg, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein, antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anticentromere antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [CCP] antibodies, anti- scleroderma [SCL] 70 antibody) . Treatment of Raynaud Phenomenon Trigger avoidance Smoking cessation Calcium channel blockers or other medications Treatment of primary Raynaud phenomenon involves avoidance of cold, smoking cessation, and, if stress is a triggering factor, relaxation techniques (eg, biofeedback) or counseling (1, 2). Medications are used more often than behavioral treatments because of convenience. Vasodilating long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, extended-release nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine, or isradipine ) are most effective and typically used as first-line agents. For patients who do not tolerate calcium channel blockers, alternative agents include topical nitrates, oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), angiotensin II receptor blockers, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
