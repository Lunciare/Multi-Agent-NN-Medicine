Raynaud Phenomenon

systemic sclerosis. Diagnosis of Raynaud Phenomenon History and physical examination Evaluation and testing for underlying disorder Sometimes Doppler ultrasound and laboratory testing Diagnostic criteria for Raynaud phenomenon are based upon a history of unusual cold sensitivity, biphasic color changes involving white and blue digits (pallor or duskiness in patients with dark-skin), and additional history and examination-based elements (1). Acrocyanosis also causes color change of the digits in response to cold but differs from Raynaud phenomenon in that it is persistent, not easily reversed, and does not cause trophic changes (thin, shiny, or discolored skin; hair loss; brittle nails), ulcers, or pain. 4/7 Primary and secondary forms are distinguished clinically, supported by vascular laboratory studies and blood testing. Clinical findings A thorough history and physical examination directed at identifying a causative disorder are helpful but rarely diagnostic. Findings suggesting primary Raynaud phenomenon are the following (1): Age at onset < 40 years (in two-thirds of cases) Mild symmetric attacks affecting both hands No tissue necrosis or gangrene Negative or low (< 1:40) antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer No history or physical findings suggesting another cause Findings suggesting secondary Raynaud phenomenon are the following: Age at onset > 40 years Severe painful attacks
