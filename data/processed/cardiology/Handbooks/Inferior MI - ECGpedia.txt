This is part of: Myocardial Infarction
ST elevation in II, III and aVF
ST elevation or depression in V4R can help in differentiating a RCA from a RCX occlusion.
This part of the heart muscle lies on the diaphragm and is supplied of blood bij the right coronary artery (RCA) in 80% of patients. In the remaing 20% the inferior wall is supplied by the ramus circumflexus(RCX).
An occlusion of the RCA can be distinguished of a RCX occulusion on the ECG:Zimetbaum
Distal RCA occlusion (sens 90%, spec 71%)
ST segment elevation in III higher than ST segment elevation in II ("the highest elevation points at the culprit")and
ST segment depression in I, AVL, or both (>1 mm)
Proximal RCA occlusion (sens 79%, spec 100%)
Additional ST segment elevation in V1, V4R or both
RCX occlusion (sens 83%, spec 96%)
ST segment elevation in I, AVL, V5, and V6 and
ST segment depression in V1, V2, and V3
Examples
