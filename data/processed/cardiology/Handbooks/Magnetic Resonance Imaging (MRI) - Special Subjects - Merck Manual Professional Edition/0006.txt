Magnetic Resonance Imaging

are presumed to be the structures most involved in that particular task. Gradient echo imaging Gradient echo is a pulse sequence that can be used for fast imaging of moving blood and cerebrospinal fluid (eg, in MRA). Because this technique is fast, it can reduce motion artifacts (eg, blurring) during imaging that requires patients to hold their breath (eg, during imaging of cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal structures). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) MRS combines the information obtained by MRI (mainly based on water and fat content of tissues) with that of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR provides information about tissue metabolites and biochemical abnormalities; this information can help differentiate certain types of tumors and other abnormalities. Magnetic resonance enterography Magnetic resonance enterography is often used for follow-up imaging of children with known inflammatory conditions of the small bowel. Because magnetic resonance enterography does not require ionizing radiation, it has an advantage over CT enterography. Perfusion MRI Perfusion MRI is a method of assessing relative cerebral blood flow. It can be used to detect: Areas of ischemia during imaging for stroke Areas of increased vascularity that can indicate tumors This information can help direct biopsy. Positron emission tomography (PET)–MRI PET-MRI combines functional
