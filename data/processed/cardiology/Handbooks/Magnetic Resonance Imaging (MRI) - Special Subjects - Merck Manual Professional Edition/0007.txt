Magnetic Resonance Imaging

to detect: Areas of ischemia during imaging for stroke Areas of increased vascularity that can indicate tumors This information can help direct biopsy. Positron emission tomography (PET)–MRI PET-MRI combines functional PET with whole-body MRI. T1-weighted and short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequences are frequently used. This modality (available since 2010) is generally available only in major academic medical centers. Disadvantages of MRI MRI is relatively expensive, requires longer imaging times than CT, and may not be immediately available in all areas. Other disadvantages include problems related to: The magnetic field Patient claustrophobia Contrast reactions Magnetic field MRI is relatively contraindicated in patients with implanted materials that can be affected by powerful magnetic fields. These materials include: Ferromagnetic metal (ie, containing iron) Magnetically activated or electronically controlled medical devices (eg, pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cochlear implants) Nonferromagnetic electrical wires or materials (eg, some pacemaker wires, certain pulmonary artery catheters) Ferromagnetic material may be displaced by the strong magnetic field, injuring a nearby organ; for example, displacement of vascular clips can result in hemorrhage. Displacement is more likely if the material has been in place < 6 weeks (before scar tissue forms). Ferromagnetic material can also cause imaging artifacts. Magnetically activated medical
