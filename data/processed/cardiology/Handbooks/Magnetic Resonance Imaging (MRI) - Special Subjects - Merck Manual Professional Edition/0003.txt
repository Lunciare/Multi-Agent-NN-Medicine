cord abnormalities, inflammation, trauma, suspected musculoskeletal tumors, or internal joint derangement). MRI is also useful for the following: Vascular imaging: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used to image arteries with good diagnostic accuracy and is less invasive than conventional angiography. A gadolinium contrast agent is sometimes used. MRA can be used to image the thoracic and abdominal aorta and arteries of the brain, neck, abdominal organs, kidneys, and lower extremities. Venous imaging (magnetic resonance venography, or MRV) provides the best images of venous abnormalities, including thrombosis and anomalies. Hepatic and biliary tract abnormalities: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive, highly accurate method of imaging the biliary and pancreatic duct systems. Masses in the female reproductive organs: MRI supplements ultrasound to further characterize adnexal masses and to stage uterine tumors. Certain fractures: As one example, MRI can provide accurate images of hip fractures in patients with osteopenia. Bone marrow infiltration and bone metastases: MRI is particularly useful for evaluating patients with positive bone scintigraphy and normal radiographs as well as for characterizing bone marrow abnormalities as metastases versus nonmalignant lesions. MRI can be substituted for CT with contrast in patients with a high risk of reactions to iodinated contrast agents.
