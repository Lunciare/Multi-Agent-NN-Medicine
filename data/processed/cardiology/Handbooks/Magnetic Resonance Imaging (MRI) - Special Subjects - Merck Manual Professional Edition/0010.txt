at the injection site. Serious contrast reactions are rare and much less common than with iodinated contrast agents. However, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been reported in a small number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. NSF is a rare but life-threatening disorder that involves fibrosis of the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs, resulting in severe disability or death (1). Gadolinium-based contrast agents are categorized into Group I and Group II, based on their risk of NSF. Most NSF cases are linked to group I agents, which are not advised for use in the United States and Europe (2). The likelihood of developing NSF or nephrotoxicity is extremely low in patients who received group II gadolinium-based contrast media, even in high-risk patients. The consensus statement from the American College of Radiology and the National Kidney Foundation indicates that kidney function screening is not mandatory for any patients receiving group II gadolinium-based contrast media (3). Gadolinium-based contrast agents should be used only when necessary and at the lowest possible dose.
