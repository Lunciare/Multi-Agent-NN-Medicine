Magnetic Resonance Imaging

injure anyone in its path. The only way to separate the object from the magnet may be to turn off (quench) the magnetic field. Claustrophobia The imaging tube of an MRI machine is a tight, enclosed space that can trigger claustrophobia even in patients without preexisting phobias or anxiety. Also, some patients with obesity do not fit on the table or within the machine. Premedication with an antianxiety medication (eg, alprazolam or lorazepam) 15 to 30 minutes before scanning is effective for most anxious patients. 6/7 MRI scanners with an open side can be used for patients with claustrophobia (or those with severe obesity). Images obtained during open MRI may be inferior to those of enclosed scanners depending on the field strength of the magnet, but they are usually sufficient for making a diagnosis. Patients should be warned that the MRI machine makes loud, banging noises during scanning. Contrast reactions Gadolinium-based contrast agents injected IV can cause headache, nausea, pain, and distortion of taste, as well as sensation of cold at the injection site. Serious contrast reactions are rare and much less common than with iodinated contrast agents. However, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been reported in a small number
