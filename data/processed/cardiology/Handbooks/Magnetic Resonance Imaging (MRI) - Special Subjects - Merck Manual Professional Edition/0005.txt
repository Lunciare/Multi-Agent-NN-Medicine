heart activity and reducing motion artifacts. However, its use is limited because it requires special technical hardware and is more sensitive to various artifacts than conventional MRI. Functional MRI Functional MRI is used to assess brain activity by location. Most commonly, the brain is scanned at low resolution very frequently (eg, every 2 to 3 seconds). The change in oxygenated hemoglobin can be discerned and used to estimate metabolic activity of different parts of the brain. In clinical settings, functional MRI is especially helpful clinically in the mapping of motor or language cortices (ie, cortical areas that, when removed, result in deficits in sensory processing, motor function, or language processing) in patients with intracranial abnormalities such as tumors and arteriovenous malformations for whom surgery is being planned. It is also used to plan epilepsy surgery. Researchers may use functional MRI to correlate brain function and anatomy (called brain mapping). MRI is performed while subjects do different cognitive tasks (eg, solve a math equation); the metabolically active parts of the brain are presumed to be the structures most involved in that particular task. Gradient echo imaging Gradient echo is a pulse sequence that can be used for fast imaging of moving
