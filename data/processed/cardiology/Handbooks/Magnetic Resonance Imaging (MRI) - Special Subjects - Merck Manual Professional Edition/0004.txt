for characterizing bone marrow abnormalities as metastases versus nonmalignant lesions. MRI can be substituted for CT with contrast in patients with a high risk of reactions to iodinated contrast agents. Contrast agents Contrast agents are often used with MRI to highlight vascular structures and to help characterize inflammation and tumors. The most commonly used agents are gadolinium derivatives, which have magnetic properties that affect proton relaxation times. MRI of intra-articular structures may include injection of a diluted gadolinium derivative into a joint. Variations of MRI Diffusion (diffusion-weighted) MRI Signal intensities are related to diffusion of water molecules in tissue. This type of MRI can be used: To detect early cerebral ischemia and infarction To detect white matter disease of the brain To differentiate abscess from a cystic tumor To stage various tumors such as non–small cell lung cancer Echo planar imaging This ultrafast technique (images obtained in < 1 second) is used for diffusion, perfusion, and functional imaging of the brain and heart. Its potential advantages include showing brain and heart activity and reducing motion artifacts. However, its use is limited because it requires special technical hardware and is more sensitive to various artifacts than conventional MRI. Functional MRI Functional
