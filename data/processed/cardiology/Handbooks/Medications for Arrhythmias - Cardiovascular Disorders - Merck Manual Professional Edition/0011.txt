Medications for Arrhythmias

only at fast heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very potent antiarrhythmics and have minimal effects on atrial tissue. Class Ib drugs do not block potassium channels directly. Class Ib drugs are used for the suppression of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) and ventricular premature beats (2). Class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs Class Ic drugs have slow kinetics; they express their electrophysiologic effects at all heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal heart rates usually shows fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ic drugs are more potent antiarrhythmics than class Ib drugs. Class Ic drugs do not block potassium channels directly. Class Ic drugs may organize and slow atrial tachyarrhythmias enough to permit 1:1 AV conduction with marked acceleration of the ventricular response rate. Class Ic drugs are used for suppression of Atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter Atrial premature beats Supraventricular tachycardia Ventricular fibrillation Ventricular premature beats Ventricular tachycardias Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs Class II antiarrhythmic drugs are the Beta-blockers Beta-blockers affect predominantly slow-channel tissues (sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes), where they decrease rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity,
