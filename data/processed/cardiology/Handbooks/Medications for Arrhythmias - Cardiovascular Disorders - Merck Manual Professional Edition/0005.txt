drugs) Uses: Any tachyarrhythmia except torsades de pointes VT Noncompetitive beta- blocking, calcium channel Pulmonary toxicity, QTc blocking, and sodium prolongation; torsades de channel blocking effects, pointes VT; bradycardia; with a long delay in onset gray or blue discoloration of action of sun-exposed skin; Amiodarone‡ Prolongs refractoriness hepatic abnormalities; more homogeneously peripheral neuropathy; than other QT-prolonging corneal microdeposits, drugs, so torsades de altered thyroid function; pointe VT is less common serum creatinine increase IV form can be used for rhythm conversion Azimilide* Torsades de pointes VT — Also has class II properties Used to treat potentially lethal refractory Bretylium* Hypotension ventricular tachyarrhythmias (intractable VT, recurrent VF) Contraindicated with Dofetilide Torsades de pointes VT prolonged QTc or decreased GFR Dronedarone QTc prolongation, Modified amiodarone torsades de pointes VT, molecule with shorter half- 4/10 Selected Adverse Drug Comments Effects bradycardia, GI upset, life, smaller volume of hepatotoxicity, serum distribution, fewer adverse creatinine increase effects, and poorer efficacy Should not be used with history of heart failure or with permanent AF Used to terminate AF and Ibutilide Torsades de pointes VT atrial flutter Clinically available formulations also have Similar to class II; possible beta blocking (class II) depressed left ventricular Sotalol activity function
