Medications for Arrhythmias

reduced, but conduction velocity is not significantly affected. Because the action potential is prolonged, rate of automaticity is reduced. The predominant effect on the ECG is QT-interval prolongation. These medications are used to treat supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Class III drugs have a risk of ventricular proarrhythmia, particularly torsades de pointes VT, and are not used in patients with torsades de pointes VT. Class IV Antiarrhythmic Drugs Class IV drugs are Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers These medications depress calcium-dependent action potentials in slow-channel tissues and thus decrease the rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness. Heart rate is slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV node transmits rapid atrial depolarizations at a lower frequency. These medications are used primarily to treat supraventricular tachycardias. They may also be used to slow the ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. One form of VT (left septal, Belhassen, or fascicular VT) can be treated with verapamil.
