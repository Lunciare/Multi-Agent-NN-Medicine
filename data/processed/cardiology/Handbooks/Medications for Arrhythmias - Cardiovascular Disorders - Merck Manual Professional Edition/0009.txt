prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the ECG, this effect is reflected as QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates. Class Ib drugs and class Ic drugs do not block potassium channels directly. The primary indications for all class I drugs are ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). Class Ia and class Ic drugs are also indicated for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardias) (1). Adverse effects of class I drugs include proarrhythmia, a drug-related arrhythmia worse than the arrhythmia being treated, which is the most worrisome adverse effect. All class I drugs may worsen ventricular tachycardia (VT). Class I drugs also tend to depress ventricular contractility. Because these adverse effects are more likely to occur in patients with a structural heart disorder, class I drugs are usually used only in patients who do not have a structural heart disorder or in patients who have a structural heart disorder but who have no other therapeutic alternatives. There are other adverse effects of class I drugs that are specific to the subclass or individual drug. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs Class Ia drugs have kinetics that are intermediate between the fast kinetics of class Ib and the slow
