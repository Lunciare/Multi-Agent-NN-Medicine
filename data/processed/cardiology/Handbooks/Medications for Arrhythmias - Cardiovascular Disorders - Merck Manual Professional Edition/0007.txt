symptoms; multiple White syndrome) because arrhythmias (VPBs, VT, digoxin shortens APBs, atrial tachycardia, Digoxin refractory periods of the second-degree or third- accessory connection; if AF degree AV block, or occurs, ventricular combinations) response may be excessive and life- threatening * Availability uncertain. † QRS duration is expected to widen. Medication is changed only if duration increase is excessive. ‡ Amiodarone dosing varies significantly by age and indication; manufacturer's prescribing information should be checked. AF = atrial fibrillation; APB = atrial premature beat; AV = atrioventricular; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; GI = gastrointestinal; IV = intravenous; LV = left ventricular; QTc = QT interval corrected for heart rate; SVT = supraventricular tachycardia; VF = ventricular fibrillation; VPB = ventricular premature beat; VT = ventricular tachycardia. Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are Sodium channel blockers (membrane-stabilizing drugs), which block fast sodium channels, slowing conduction in fast-channel tissues (working atrial and ventricular myocytes, His- Purkinje system) In the electrocardiogram (ECG), this effect may be reflected as widening of the P wave or QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, or a combination. Class I drugs are subdivided based on the kinetics of the sodium channel effects, which determine the
