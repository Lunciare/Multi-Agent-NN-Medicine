P wave or QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, or a combination. Class I drugs are subdivided based on the kinetics of the sodium channel effects, which determine the heart rates at which their electrophysiologic effects become manifest. Class Ib drugs have fast kinetics, so they express their electrophysiologic effects only at fast heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very potent antiarrhythmics and have minimal effects on atrial tissue. Class Ic drugs have slow kinetics, so they express their electrophysiologic effects at all heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal heart rates usually shows fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ic drugs are more potent than class 1b antiarrhythmics. Class Ia drugs have intermediate kinetics, so their fast-channel tissue conduction slowing effects may or may not be evident on an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates. Class Ia drugs also block repolarizing potassium channels, prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the ECG, this effect is reflected as QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates. Class Ib drugs and class Ic drugs do not
