Medications for Arrhythmias

are specific to the subclass or individual drug. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs Class Ia drugs have kinetics that are intermediate between the fast kinetics of class Ib and the slow kinetics of class Ic. Their fast-channel tissue conduction slowing effects may or may not be evident on an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates. Class Ia drugs block repolarizing potassium 7/10 channels, prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the ECG, this effect is reflected as QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates. The primary indications for class Ia drugs are Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia) Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) Class Ia drugs also are used for suppression of atrial or ventricular premature beats. Class Ia drugs may cause torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Class Ia drugs may organize and slow atrial tachyarrhythmias enough to permit 1:1 AV conduction with marked acceleration of the ventricular response rate. Class Ib antiarrhythmic drugs Class Ib drugs have fast kinetics; they express their electrophysiologic effects only at fast heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very
