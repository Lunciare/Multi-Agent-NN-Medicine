The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used. Most antiarrhythmic drugs are grouped into 4 main classes (Vaughan Williams classification) based on their dominant cellular electrophysiologic effect, with subsequent updates to the classification system for newer medications (see table Antiarrhythmic Drugs (Vaughan Williams Classification)) (1, 2). Class I: Class I drugs are sodium channel blockers (membrane-stabilizing drugs) that block fast sodium channels and slow conduction in fast-channel tissues (working atrial and ventricular myocytes, His-Purkinje system). Class I drugs are subdivided into subclasses Ia, Ib, and Ic.
