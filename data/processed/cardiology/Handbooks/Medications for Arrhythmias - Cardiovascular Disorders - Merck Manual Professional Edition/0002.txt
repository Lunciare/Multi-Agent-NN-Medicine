potential duration and refractoriness in slow- and fast-channel tissues. Class IV: Class IV drugs are the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which depress calcium-dependent action potentials in slow-channel tissues and thus decrease the rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness. Digoxin, adenosine, and ivabradine were not included in the original Vaughan Williams classification. The original Vaughan Williams classification system for antiarrhythmic drugs has been extended (2) to include these and other antiarrhythmic drugs introduced since the original classification (eg, amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide). Digoxin shortens atrial and ventricular refractory periods and is vagotonic, thereby prolonging AV nodal conduction and AV nodal refractory periods. Adenosine slows or blocks AV nodal conduction and can terminate tachyarrhythmias that rely upon AV nodal conduction for their perpetuation. Ivabradine inhibits the SA node funny current and slows SA node rate.
