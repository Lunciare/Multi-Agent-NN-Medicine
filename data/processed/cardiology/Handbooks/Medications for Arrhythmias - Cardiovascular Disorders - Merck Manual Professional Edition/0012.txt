tachycardias Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs Class II antiarrhythmic drugs are the Beta-blockers Beta-blockers affect predominantly slow-channel tissues (sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes), where they decrease rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness. Thus, heart rate is slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV node transmits rapid atrial depolarizations at a lower frequency. Class II drugs are used primarily to treat supraventricular tachycardias, including sinus tachycardia, and to slow the ventricular response rates to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. These drugs are also used to treat ventricular tachycardia to raise the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and reduce the ventricular proarrhythmic effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Beta-blockers are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include lassitude, sleep disturbance, and gastrointestinal upset. These medications are contraindicated in patients with asthma. Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs Class III drugs are Membrane-stabilizing drugs, primarily potassium channel blockers Class III drugs prolong action potential duration and refractoriness in slow- and fast-channel tissues. Thus, the capacity of all cardiac tissues to transmit impulses at high frequencies is reduced, but conduction velocity is not significantly affected. Because the action potential is prolonged, rate of automaticity is reduced. The predominant effect on the ECG is QT-interval prolongation. These medications
