Atherosclerosis

is initially asymptomatic, often for decades. Symptoms and signs develop when lesions impede blood flow (see table Clinical Manifestations of Atherosclerosis). The symptoms depend on the vascular bed affected and the acuity and severity of blood flow impairment. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or resting pain in the limbs may develop when unstable plaques rupture and acutely occlude a major artery, with superimposed thrombosis or embolism. Plaque rupture may also cause sudden death without preceding angina. TABLE Clinical Manifestations of Atherosclerosis Vascular Bed Acute Manifestations Chronic Manifestations Transient ischemic attacks Transient ischemic attack and vascular dementia: (TIA) or stroke: Sudden Memory loss; confusion; Carotid or cerebral neurologic symptoms (eg, trouble with reasoning, arteries numbness, weakness planning, judgment, especially when focal, language, and other confusion, aphasia) thinking abilities Acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina and myocardial infarction): Stable coronary artery Angina, dyspnea, nausea, Coronary arteries disease: Angina, dyspnea, vomiting, sweating, fatigue arrhythmia, hypotension, shock, sudden cardiac death Thoracic aorta Dissection or thoracic Thoracic aortic aneurysm: aortic aneurysm rupture: Often asymptomatic Sudden severe chest or upper back pain, dyspnea, 12/28 Vascular Bed Acute Manifestations Chronic Manifestations syncope, hypotension, shock Abdominal aortic Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture: aneurysm: Throbbing or Abdominal aorta Sudden severe
