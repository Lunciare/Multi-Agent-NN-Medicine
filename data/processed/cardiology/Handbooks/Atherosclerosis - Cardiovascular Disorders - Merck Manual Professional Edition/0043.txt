Atherosclerosis

on lipid metabolism, reduced inflammation, and improved endothelial function (42), and they have been associated with reduction in some major cardiovascular outcomes (43). GLP-1 receptor agonists act by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric emptying. These agents may have substantial cardiovascular benefits, by preventing endothelial dysfunction through the promotion of angiogenesis and inhibition of oxidative stress; reducing systemic inflammation; and reducing monocyte recruitment, formation of proinflammatory macrophages and foam cells, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and plaque development (44). Canakinumab, an anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1beta, showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction and an elevated C-reactive protein level (45). Colchicine, by inhibiting microtubule polymerization and consequent suppression of inflammatory cell activation and adhesion, has been shown to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic coronary disease (but not in the setting of acute myocardial infarction) (46, 47). Although routine anticoagulation is not generally advised for atherosclerosis treatment (or prevention), it can play a supplementary role in some cases. The combination of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular and
