(1): Fiber intake: 30 to 45 grams per day, preferably from whole grains Fruit consumption: At least 200 grams per day (≥ 2 to 3 servings) Vegetable consumption: At least 200 grams per day (≥ 2 to 3 servings) Nuts: 30 grams of unsalted nuts per day 19/28 Red meat consumption: Reduction to less than 350 to 500 grams per week Fish consumption: 1 to 2 times per week. Diets that include increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and lean protein (preferably fish) have consistently been shown to improve survival compared to standard diets low in these ingredients (3, 4, 5). Studies also show that improved outcomes are associated with a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, daily intake of 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, and intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in plant-based oils, seeds, and fatty fish) and monounsaturated fatty acids (found in oils, avocados, and nuts) (6, 7). Dietary elements that increase cardiovascular risk Saturated fats (found in animal products and certain oils) and trans fats (prevalent in processed and fried foods) are associated with increased all-cause mortality, supporting recommendations to replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats in
