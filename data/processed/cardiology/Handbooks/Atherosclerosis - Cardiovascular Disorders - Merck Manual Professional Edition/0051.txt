Atherosclerosis

(39). The threshold for intervention varies based on several factors, including aneurysm size, location, growth rate, patient symptoms, and overall risk of rupture. 27/28 Treatment references Key Points The development of atherosclerosis involves the deposition of LDL particles, recruitment of inflammatory cells, endothelial dysfunction, and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of fibrous and calcified plaques within the arterial wall. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include age, family history of premature atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic factors (diabetes, hypertension, obesity and chronic kidney disease), inflammation, and lifestyle related risk factors (smoking, sedentary lifestyle, diet, alcohol consumption, and psychosocial factors). Symptoms develop when plaque growth or rupture leads to reduced or obstructed blood flow, resulting in conditions such as angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and claudication. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through clinical evaluation and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography. Management includes lifestyle changes and medications such as lipid-lowering agents (statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe), antiplatelet medications (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors), antihypertensives, and antihyperglycemic agents (SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists) to stabilize plaques and prevent cardiovascular events. Catheter-based interventions include balloon angioplasty with or without stenting, atherectomy, intravascular lithotripsy, thrombectomy, and brachytherapy to mechanically manage and stabilize plaques or
