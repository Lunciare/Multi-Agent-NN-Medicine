Atherosclerosis

intake (5). Despite advances in care, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis The atherosclerotic plaque is the hallmark feature of atherosclerosis. It has a complex and dynamic structure with the following major components: Lipid core: Consists mainly of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and other lipids Fibrous cap: A layer of smooth muscle cells and collagen that covers the lipid core 2/28 Inflammatory cells and smooth muscle cells: Macrophages, T cells, and other immune cells that infiltrate the plaque Cell debris: Dead or necrotic cells Calcium deposits: Contribute to the rigidity of the plaque Extracellular matrix: Includes elastin, collagen, and other macromolecules, providing structural support Artery: Cross Section 3D MODEL Atherosclerotic plaque formation All stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation and growth to plaque complication (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke), are considered a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response to injury (such as shear stress from hypertension, or oxidative injury from tobacco smoke) (1). During the initial stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation, apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, particularly low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, accumulate in the intima, the innermost layer of the arterial wall. Within the intimal layer, LDL particles are shielded from the protective antioxidant mechanisms of the plasma, and, as a result,
