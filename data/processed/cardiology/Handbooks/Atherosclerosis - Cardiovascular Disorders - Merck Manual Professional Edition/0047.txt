Atherosclerosis

stents are not standard of care (48). Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the insertion of a stent-graft via a catheter into the arterial lumen, followed by precise deployment within the aneurysm to strengthen the vessel wall and prevent aneurysmal rupture. EVAR is commonly used for the treatment of abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms (27). In specific patient populations, such as those undergoing stenting of complex coronary lesions or left main disease, the use of intravascular imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography is recommended for procedural guidance to optimize stent deployment and reduce future ischemic events (29). Atherectomy Atherectomy is an endovascular technique designed to excise or ablate atherosclerotic plaques from arterial walls, thereby restoring luminal patency and optimizing vascular flow. Potential techniques include: Rotational atherectomy, which uses a high-speed, rotating diamond-coated burr to pulverize hard, calcific plaques. Orbital atherectomy, which uses a diamond-coated crown that orbits within the artery, sanding down and pulverizing calcified plaques. Laser atherectomy, which uses a laser-emitting catheter to vaporize plaque, converting it into small particles. Intravascular lithotripsy Intravascular lithotripsy uses acoustic shock waves to fracture and disrupt calcified atherosclerotic plaques. This technique is particularly effective in addressing heavily calcified plaques and
