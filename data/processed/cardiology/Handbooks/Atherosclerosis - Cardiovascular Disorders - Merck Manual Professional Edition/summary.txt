Atherosclerosis is characterized by the development of fatty and/or fibrous intimal plaques (atheromas) in the arterial wall. Initially, the plaques contain lipid materials, but over time they may become fibrosed and calcified. The key pathophysiological processes in the development of atherosclerosis involve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, inflammatory cells, endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Common risk factors include age, family history of premature atherosclerotic disease, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular-kidney metabolic factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease), inflammation, and lifestyle factors (eg, cigarette smoking,a sedentary lifestyle). Symptoms develop when the growth or rupture of the plaque reduces or obstructs blood flow; specific symptoms depend on the affected artery. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and is confirmed by angiography, ultrasound, computed tomography, or other imaging tests.
