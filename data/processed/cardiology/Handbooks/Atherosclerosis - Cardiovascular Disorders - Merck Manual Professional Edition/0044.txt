can play a supplementary role in some cases. The combination of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and low-dose aspirin is recommended to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb-related events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease or following peripheral surgical or endovascular revascularization (27). Additionally, to reduce ischemic events in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with intravenous thrombolysis, parenteral anticoagulation is recommended to be continued for the entire hospital stay (up to 8 days) or until revascularization (29). Catheter-based interventions Catheter based interventions typically involve the displacement or removal of stenotic or occlusive atherosclerotic plaques. These interventions play an important role in the treatment of both acute 24/28 complications of atherosclerosis and the management of hemodynamically significant chronic atherosclerotic lesions. In general, a lesion is considered hemodynamically significant when it results in impaired blood flow sufficient to cause symptoms or objective evidence of ischemia. While the exact thresholds vary by vascular territory, this often corresponds to luminal narrowing of ≥ 50% in coronary or carotid arteries when associated with clinical symptoms or imaging evidence of reduced perfusion and ≥ 70% for asymptomatic lesions. Functional assessments, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the coronary circulation
