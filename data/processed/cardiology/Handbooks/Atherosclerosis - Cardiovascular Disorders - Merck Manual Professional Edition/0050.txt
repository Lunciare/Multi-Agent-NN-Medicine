Atherosclerosis

of atherosclerotic plaque from the intimal layer of the artery, thereby restoring luminal diameter and improving blood flow. The most frequently performed variant is carotid endarterectomy, which is used to reduce ischemic stroke rate in patients with high- grade carotid stenosis. While recommendations vary, carotid endarterectomy is generally strongly recommended in patients with 70 to 99% symptomatic carotid stenosis (ie, those who have experienced a transient ischemic attack or stroke within the last 6 months corresponding to the vascular territory of the narrowed vessel) (52, 53). Early intervention is emphasized. Carotid endarterectomy may also be considered in patients with 50 to 69% symptomatic stenosis or in those with ≥ 60% asymptomatic stenosis, depending upon life expectancy and perioperative risk. Aneurysm repair involves the surgical reinforcement of the weakened segment of an artery to prevent rupture. This is accomplished by replacing the aneurysmal vessel with a synthetic graft, which ensures vascular integrity. This procedure is primarily indicated for acute aortic complications or for large, high- risk abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms (39). The threshold for intervention varies based on several factors, including aneurysm size, location, growth rate, patient symptoms, and overall risk of rupture. 27/28 Treatment references Key Points The development
