For adults age 20 to 39 years, the evaluation of traditional ASCVD risk factors (age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking) is recommended. For adults age 40 to 75 years, the pooled cohort equation risk calculator is also recommended to evaluate 10-year ASCVD risk (7). CLINICAL CALCULATORS Cardiovascular Risk Assessment (10-year, Revised Pooled Cohort Equations 2018) Other risk estimation calculators are available: American Heart Association Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTs (PREVENT) calculator incorporates chronic kidney disease as a significant risk factor (see PREVENT) (8), but this calculator has not been endorsed by any major cardiovascular guidelines. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2021 cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines recommend using the
