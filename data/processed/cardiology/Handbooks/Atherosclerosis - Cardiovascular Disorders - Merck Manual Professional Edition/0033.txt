is associated with increased atherosclerotic disease risk, challenging prior data suggesting that a low or moderate level of alcohol consumption is associated with lower risk of, or could even be protective against, atherosclerotic disease (11, 12, 13). Current recommendations include limiting alcohol consumption to less than 100 grams per week or 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men, avoiding binge drinking, and not initiating alcohol consumption as a preventive measure against ASCVD (1, 14). Physical activity and exercise Sedentary behavior is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor (15). Regular physical activity leads to improvements in measures of obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as well as enhancing endothelial function and reducing systemic inflammation; all of these collectively help reduce the risk of ASCVD (16, 17, 18, 19). Recommendations for all adults are to engage in at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity weekly. For adults who are not able to perform these activities, the recommendation is to stay as active as their health condition allows (2). Resistance exercise for 2 or more days per week is also recommended (1). 20/28 Stress reduction and mental health
