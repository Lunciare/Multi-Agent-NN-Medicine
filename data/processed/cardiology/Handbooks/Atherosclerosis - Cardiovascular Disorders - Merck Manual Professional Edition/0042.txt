Atherosclerosis

surgery or gastrointestinal bleeding, 23/28 concomitant use of anticoagulants, and severe uncontrolled hypertension. The primary goal is to restore cerebral perfusion, minimize brain injury, and improve clinical outcomes. In acute coronary syndromes, the use of systemic thrombolysis is restricted to ST elevation myocardial infarction when the anticipated delay from first medical contact to primary percutaneous intervention is expected to be greater than 120 minutes (29). Antihypertensives primarily affect atherosclerosis by reducing pressure and thus stress on the arterial wall. This effect is particularly important in aortic aneurysms, where the risk of rupture is directly related to blood pressure (41). For patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, antihypertensive therapy is recommended with systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 80 mm Hg. By lowering glucose levels, some antihyperglycemic medications mitigate the harmful effects of hyperglycemia, which include endothelial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. The SGLT2 inhibitors reduce serum glucose by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, leading to glucosuria. SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated favorable effects on lipid metabolism, reduced inflammation, and improved endothelial function (42), and they have been associated with reduction in some major cardiovascular outcomes (43). GLP-1 receptor agonists act by enhancing glucose-dependent
