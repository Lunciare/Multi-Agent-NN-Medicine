Atherosclerosis

no recent history of percutaneous revascularization or myocardial infarction. Other medications Beyond lipid-lowering agents and antiplatelet agents, additional medications are considered in patients with specific risk profiles or comorbidities. For example, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are used in patients with diabetes and heart failure, while anti-inflammatory therapies such as canakinumab or colchicine may benefit patients with persistent inflammatory risk after myocardial infarction. In selected patients with peripheral artery disease or after revascularization, low-dose anticoagulation combined with aspirin is recommended to further reduce ischemic events. Thrombolysis remains a cornerstone for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (28). Thrombolysis involves administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), such as alteplase, to dissolve occlusive thrombi that are obstructing cerebral blood flow. It is recommended for eligible patients who can be treated within 4.5 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Key indications include the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with measurable neurologic deficits, exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage by imaging, and careful consideration of contraindications such as recent surgery or gastrointestinal bleeding, 23/28 concomitant use of anticoagulants, and severe uncontrolled hypertension. The primary goal is to restore cerebral perfusion, minimize brain injury, and improve clinical outcomes. In acute
