tests, depending on the organ involved (see elsewhere in The Manual). Noninvasive techniques that can assess atherosclerosis severity and plaque characteristics include: Ankle-brachial index (ABI): The ABI is a simple, noninvasive test that compares the blood pressure in the ankle with the blood pressure in the arm. It is used for the evaluation of peripheral artery disease. Vascular ultrasound: Doppler ultrasound is used to visualize atherosclerotic plaques and assess the severity of stenosis. Vascular ultrasound can be used to assess the carotid 13/28 arteries, renal arteries, abdominal aorta, and peripheral arteries. It offers high temporal resolution without the use of ionizing radiation. Noncontrast CT, including coronary artery calcium scoring CT: CT is used to evaluate the presence and extent of calcified plaques. It can be used as a dedicated examination (eg, coronary calcium scoring CT with standard ECG-gated image acquisition) or for opportunistic evaluation using CT images acquired for other indications. CT angiography (CTA): CTA uses iodinated contrast-enhanced CT to evaluate atherosclerotic plaque morphology and detect stenosis severity with high spatial resolution. This technique involves ionizing radiation and can be applied to any vascular bed, making it ideal for small, mobile vascular beds like the coronary arteries. CT fractional flow
