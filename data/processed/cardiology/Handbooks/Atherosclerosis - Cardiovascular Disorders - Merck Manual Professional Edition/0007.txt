ones. The strength of the fibrous cap and its resistance to rupture depend on the balance between collagen deposition and degradation. Plaque rupture involves secretion of metalloproteinases, cathepsins, and collagenases by activated macrophages within the plaque. These enzymes digest the fibrous cap, particularly at its edges, causing the cap to thin and ultimately rupture. T cells in the plaque contribute by secreting cytokines that inhibit smooth muscle cells from synthesizing and depositing collagen, which normally reinforces the plaque. Once the plaque ruptures, the thrombogenic contents of the plaque are exposed to circulating blood, triggering thrombosis. Tissue factor produced by macrophages and smooth muscle cells significantly contributes to this process by promoting thrombin generation in vivo, leading to thrombin-mediated fibrin formation from fibrinogen and activation of platelet aggregation. One of 4 outcomes may occur: 4/28 The resultant thrombus may organize and be incorporated into the plaque, altering its shape and causing its rapid growth. The thrombus may rapidly occlude the vascular lumen, precipitating an acute ischemic event. The plaque may fill with blood, balloon out, and immediately occlude the artery. Plaque contents or the thrombus may embolize, occluding vessels downstream. Plaque stability depends on multiple factors, including plaque composition (relative proportions
