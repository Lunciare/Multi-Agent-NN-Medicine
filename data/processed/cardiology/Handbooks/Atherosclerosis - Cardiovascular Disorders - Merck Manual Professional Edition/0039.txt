and thrombosis. The following medications can be used: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and disrupts thromboxane A2 production, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. 22/28 P2Y12 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) block the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-mediated activation of platelets. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor is indicated for at least 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are not at high risk for bleeding (29). For individuals with low to moderate bleeding risk following acute coronary syndrome, it is recommended to switch from dual antiplatelet therapy to single antiplatelet therapy at 6 months following percutaneous coronary intervention (30). Aspirin monotherapy at a low dose (75 to 100 mg) is recommended to reduce atherosclerotic events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and no indication for oral anticoagulation (30). For patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, antiplatelet monotherapy with aspirin (75 to 325 mg daily) is also recommended to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events (27). While aspirin therapy is a cornerstone of secondary prevention in patients with established cardiovascular disease, its role in primary prevention is controversial, and it is not recommended routinely for this purpose (2). Single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg
