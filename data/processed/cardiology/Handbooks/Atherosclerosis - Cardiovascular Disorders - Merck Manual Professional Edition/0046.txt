proliferation. Cutting balloon angioplasty uses a balloon with micro blades on its surface to create controlled incisions in the plaque as the balloon is inflated. This technique is designed to treat resistant calcific lesions. Stenting Stent placement is frequently performed following balloon angioplasty. It involves the placement of an expandable metallic scaffold within an atherosclerotic artery to preserve luminal integrity and maintain adequate blood flow. Stenting can be performed by using: Bare-metal stents are rarely used due to high restenosis rates and the superiority of drug- eluting stents. Drug-eluting stents are most frequently used. These stents are coated with antiproliferative agents such as sirolimus, everolimus, paclitaxel, or zotarolimus to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and reduce restenosis. 25/28 Covered stents are encased with a synthetic covering to seal aneurysms or manage other vascular abnormalities. Biodegradable stents are designed to provide temporary scaffolding to maintain vessel patency and then gradually dissolve, potentially reducing long-term complications such as restenosis. Trials have shown mixed results in terms of outcomes compared to drug-eluting stents, so biodegradable stents are not standard of care (48). Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the insertion of a stent-graft via a catheter into the arterial lumen, followed by precise deployment within the
