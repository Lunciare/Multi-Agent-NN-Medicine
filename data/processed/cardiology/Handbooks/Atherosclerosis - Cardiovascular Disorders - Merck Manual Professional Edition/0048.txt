it into small particles. Intravascular lithotripsy Intravascular lithotripsy uses acoustic shock waves to fracture and disrupt calcified atherosclerotic plaques. This technique is particularly effective in addressing heavily calcified plaques and is typically followed by balloon angioplasty and stent placement (49). It is primarily used in the treatment of coronary arteries and peripheral vessels (50). Thrombectomy Thrombectomy is a procedure used to remove intravascular thrombi to restore circulation. It can be performed using several techniques: Mechanical thrombectomy: Mechanical removal of the thrombus using specialized devices Aspiration thrombectomy: Aspiration of the thrombus using a suction device Catheter-directed thrombolysis: Thrombolytic medications are delivered directly to the thrombus to dissolve it 26/28 Thrombectomy can be the preferred procedure in patients with acute stroke (28) or acute limb ischemia (27). However, in patients with acute coronary syndrome, the use of manual or aspiration thrombectomy is not recommended due to the lack of demonstrated benefit (29). Brachytherapy Brachytherapy delivers targeted radiation therapy within the arteries to prevent restenosis following angioplasty and stenting. Using a specialized catheter, radioactive isotopes are positioned at the site of the treated artery, where they emit localized radiation that inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby preventing neointimal hyperplasia. This localized radiation
