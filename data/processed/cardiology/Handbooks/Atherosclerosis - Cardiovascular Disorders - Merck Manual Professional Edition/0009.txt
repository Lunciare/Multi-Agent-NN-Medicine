Atherosclerosis

produce predictable exercise-induced stable angina. Clinical consequences of plaque rupture in coronary arteries depend not only on the anatomical location of the plaque but also on the relative balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant activity in the blood, as well as the vulnerability of the myocardium to arrhythmias. Plaque erosion is the second most common underlying mechanism for acute coronary syndromes, accounting for about one-third of the cases (and about two-thirds of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions) (9, 10). Unlike plaque rupture, plaque erosion happens without breaking the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque. The primary underlying mechanism is the loss of the endothelial cells over an intact fibrous cap, exposing the underlying plaque material to the circulating blood and triggering thrombosis. Erosion has been associated with the activation of innate immune cells, especially through pattern- recognition receptors such as Toll-l ike receptor 2, and the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes leading to the destruction of the endothelial lining (11). Lesions complicated by plaque erosion tend to have a rich extracellular matrix with less lipid content and do not exhibit a vulnerable thin fibrous cap.
