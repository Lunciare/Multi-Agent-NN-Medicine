Atherosclerosis

for atherosclerotic events, even in patients whose 9/28 LDL levels are adequately controlled by statin therapy (residual triglyceride risk) (14). Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic factors Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is an interconnected health disorder involving obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease (15). CKM syndrome includes individuals at risk for atherosclerosis as well as those with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with the following CKM stages (15): Stage 0: No CKM risk factors Stage 1: Excess or dysfunctional adiposity Stage 2: Metabolic risk factors such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or moderate- to high-risk chronic kidney disease Stage 3: Subclinical cardiovascular disease in CKM syndrome or risk equivalents, such as high predicted cardiovascular risk or very high-risk chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 4: Clinical cardiovascular disease in CKM syndrome Diabetes leads to formation of advanced glycation end products, which increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells (16). The oxidative stress and reactive oxygen radicals generated in diabetes directly injure the endothelium and promote atherogenesis. Hypertension is a well known risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Among other mechanisms, endothelial cell activation, oxidative stress, and the contribution to smooth muscle cell proliferation have been implicated (17).
