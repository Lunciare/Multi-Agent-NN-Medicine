spatial resolution. This technique involves ionizing radiation and can be applied to any vascular bed, making it ideal for small, mobile vascular beds like the coronary arteries. CT fractional flow reserve (FFR): This technique combines CTA with computational fluid dynamics to assess the physiologic significance of coronary artery stenoses by estimating the pressure drop across a coronary lesion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA): MRA may be done without contrast or with gadolinium-based contrast. It is used to evaluate vascular size and/or stenosis severity without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation. However, this technique has suboptimal spatial resolution for visualizing small, mobile vascular beds. Positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging: This technique uses molecular imaging tracers to detect metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques (F18- fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) or microcalcifications (F18-sodium fluoride). Stress testing: Stress testing, which assesses the functional significance of coronary stenosis, includes exercise treadmill test, stress echocardiography, or exercise/pharmacological myocardial perfusion imaging (including single photon emission tomography [SPECT], PET, or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). PET and MRI myocardial perfusion imaging can quantify myocardial blood flow, which also aids in the diagnosis of coronary microvascular disease. 14/28 Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) with Gadolinium-Based Contrast IMAGE IMAGE COURTESY OF ATTILA FEHER, MD, PHD.
