and certain oils) and trans fats (prevalent in processed and fried foods) are associated with increased all-cause mortality, supporting recommendations to replace saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats in the diet (8). Saturated fats should account for less than 10% of total energy intake, and should be replaced by polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as carbohydrates from whole grains (1). Reduction in dietary sodium intake has been associated with lowered blood pressure and a reduced rate of cardiovascular events. Consuming more than 2 grams of sodium per day is linked to increased cardiovascular mortality (9). Consuming added sugar exceeding 10% of daily calories has been linked to higher cardiovascular mortality (10). Additionally, the use of sweetened beverages and juices has been associated with an increased rate of coronary events and cardiovascular mortality (4). The frequency and amount (> 14 g/day) of red and processed meat consumption has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (9). Several large studies suggest that any amount of alcohol consumption is associated with increased atherosclerotic disease risk, challenging prior data suggesting that a low or moderate level of alcohol consumption is associated with lower risk of, or could even be
