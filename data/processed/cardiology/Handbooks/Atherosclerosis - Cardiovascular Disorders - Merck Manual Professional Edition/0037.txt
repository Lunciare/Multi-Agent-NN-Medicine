Atherosclerosis

added to standard statin therapy, ezetimibe has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in both patients with a prior acute coronary syndrome, and those with chronic coronary artery disease at very high risk, particularly when LDL cholesterol levels are ≥ 70 mg/dL ( ≥ 1.8 mmol/L) despite maximally tolerated statin therapy (29, 31). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, or PCSK9 inhibitors, are monoclonal antibodies (evolocumab, alirocumab) that target PCSK9. PCSK9 binds to LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells, promoting their degradation; the inhibition of PCSK9 leads to increased clearance of plasma LDL cholesterol. Clinical trials with evolocumab and alirocumab have shown reduction in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events (34, 33). PCSK9 inhibitors are most frequently used in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]), with or without familial hypercholesterolemia, or in patients with established ASCVD for whom target LDL could not be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy. Inclisiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that also inhibits production of PCSK9 and has been shown to provide sustained LDL-lowering effects with infrequent (twice-yearly) dosing (34). Other therapeutic agents, including small interfering RNAs (eg, olpasiran, lepodisiran) and antisense oligonucleotide technology (eg, pelacarsen),
