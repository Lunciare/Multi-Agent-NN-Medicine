with blood, balloon out, and immediately occlude the artery. Plaque contents or the thrombus may embolize, occluding vessels downstream. Plaque stability depends on multiple factors, including plaque composition (relative proportions of lipids, inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, connective tissue, and thrombus), wall stress (cap fatigue), size and location of the core, and the configuration of the plaque in relation to blood flow. Intraplaque hemorrhage, by contributing to rapid growth and lipid deposition, may play an important role in transforming stable plaques into unstable plaques. In general, unstable coronary artery plaques have a high macrophage content, a thick lipid core, and a thin fibrous cap; they tend to rupture unpredictably, and often narrow the vessel lumen by < 50% (7, 8). Unstable carotid artery plaques have a similar composition but typically cause problems through severe stenosis and occlusion or by deposition of platelet thrombi, which embolize rather than rupture. Low- risk plaques have a thicker cap and contain fewer lipids; they often narrow the vessel lumen by > 50% and may produce predictable exercise-induced stable angina. Clinical consequences of plaque rupture in coronary arteries depend not only on the anatomical location of the plaque but also on the relative balance of
