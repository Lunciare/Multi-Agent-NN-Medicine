proximal to a stenosis in the presence of maximal blood flow (hyperemia, typically induced by adenosine). In coronary arteries, an FFR ≤ 0.80 indicates a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Coronary flow reserve (CFR):-This technique uses a Doppler or a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guidewire to assess the functional significance of coronary artery disease and microvascular disease by measuring the ratio of maximal flow in a coronary artery to the flow under resting conditions. Endothelial function testing: A vasoactive agent (eg, acetylcholine) is injected into the coronary arteries to provoke vasospasm and assess the endothelial response. Coronary Atherosclerosis (Diagnostic Tests) IMAGE IMAGES COURTESY OF ATTILA FEHER, MD, PHD. Patients with symptoms also should be evaluated for atherosclerosis risk factors through the following assessments (1, 2): History and physical examination, including body mass index and waist circumference Blood pressure measurement (to assess hypertension) Fasting lipid profile with lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity CRP assessment if indicated Fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels Renal function tests (to check for chronic kidney disease) Smoking status, including passive smoking exposure 16/28 Assessment for any history of radiation therapy to the thoracic region Evaluation of menopausal status and adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, preeclampsia) in females Genetic testing for
