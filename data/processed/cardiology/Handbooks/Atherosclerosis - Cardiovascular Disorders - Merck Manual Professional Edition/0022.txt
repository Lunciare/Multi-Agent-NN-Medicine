Symptomatic patients Patients with signs and symptoms of ischemia (see table Clinical Manifestations of Atherosclerosis) are evaluated for the extent and location of atherosclerotic disease burden and vascular occlusion using various invasive and noninvasive tests, depending on the organ involved (see elsewhere in The Manual). Noninvasive techniques that can assess atherosclerosis severity and plaque characteristics include: Ankle-brachial index (ABI): The ABI is a simple,
