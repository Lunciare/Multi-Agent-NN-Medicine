Atherosclerosis

arteries when associated with clinical symptoms or imaging evidence of reduced perfusion and ≥ 70% for asymptomatic lesions. Functional assessments, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the coronary circulation or pressure gradients and flow measurements in peripheral vessels, are also used to more accurately define hemodynamic significance. Treatment modalities include: Balloon angioplasty Stenting Atherectomy Intravascular lithotripsy Thrombectomy Brachytherapy See also Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) for more information about catheter-based interventions in the setting of coronary artery disease. Balloon angioplasty Balloon angioplasty, also referred to as "plain-old balloon angioplasty" (POBA), is a percutaneous intervention involving advancement of a catheter with a deflated balloon to the site of arterial stenosis. The balloon is then inflated to compress atherosclerotic plaque materials against the vessel wall, thereby restoring luminal diameter and blood flow. In addition to POBA, other techniques are available, including: Drug-coated balloon angioplasty, which involves inflating a balloon that is coated with an antiproliferative medication such as paclitaxel or sirolimus. These medications help to prevent restenosis by inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation. Cutting balloon angioplasty uses a balloon with micro blades on its surface to create controlled incisions in the plaque as the balloon is inflated. This technique is designed to
