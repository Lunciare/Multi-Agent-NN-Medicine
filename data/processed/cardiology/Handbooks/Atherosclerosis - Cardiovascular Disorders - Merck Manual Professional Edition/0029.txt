A calcium score of zero has an excellent negative prognostic value, with an estimated 1% risk for major adverse cardiovascular events over 10 years (11, 12). 17/28 Calcified Atherosclerosis on Calcium Scoring Computed Tomography (CT...

Given the well-established link between dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, lowering LDL is the cornerstone of the recommended therapy for established atherosclerotic disease (ASCVD). Lifestyle changes include diet modification, smoking cessation, regular participation in physical activity, stress reduction strategies, and limitation of alcohol use. Medications to treat dyslipidemia and other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, and diabetes are often required. These lifestyle changes and medications directly or indirectly improve endothelial function and reduce inflammation, and thus serve a role both in
