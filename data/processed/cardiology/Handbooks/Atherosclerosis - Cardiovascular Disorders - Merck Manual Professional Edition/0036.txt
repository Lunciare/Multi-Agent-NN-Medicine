Intermediate-risk adults with risk-enhancing factors: Consider initiating or intensifying statin therapy Borderline-risk adults with risk-enhancing factors: Consider moderate-intensity stating therapy High-intensity statin therapy has the goal of lowering LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50%. Moderate-intensity stating therapy has the goal of lowering LDL cholesterol by 30 to 50%. Maximally tolerated statin 21/28 therapy is the highest dose that is tolerated by the patient. In patients with acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including peripheral artery disease), high-intensity statin therapy is recommended (27, 28, 29, 30). For patients already on maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an LDL cholesterol level of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), a non-statin lipid-lowering agent is recommended. In addition, for this high-risk patient population, it is reasonable to further intensify lipid-lowering therapy if the LDL cholesterol level is 55 to 70 mg/dL (1.4 to 1.8 mmol/L) and the patient is already on a maximally tolerated statin therapy. Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol by blocking the uptake of cholesterol from the small intestine. When added to standard statin therapy, ezetimibe has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in both patients with a prior acute coronary syndrome, and those with chronic coronary artery disease at
