risk factor (see PREVENT) (8), but this calculator has not been endorsed by any major cardiovascular guidelines. European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2021 cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines recommend using the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2 (SCORE2) for individuals aged 40 to 69 and SCORE2-OP (Older Persons) for risk estimation for those over the age of 70 (9, 10). Calcium scoring CT uses ECG-gated noncontrast CT to quantify calcified atherosclerotic plaque burden and can be used for risk stratification and reclassification, to help make decisions about withholding or recommending statin therapy. For example, in patients with intermediate risk (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% but < 20%) or in selected patients with borderline risk (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% but < 7.5%), if the calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years as long as the patient does not smoke, does not have diabetes, and has no family history of premature coronary artery disease; if the calcium score is ≥ 100, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. A calcium score of zero has an excellent negative prognostic value, with an estimated 1% risk for major adverse cardiovascular events over
