immune mechanisms. Autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors (age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking) (23). The strongest associations have been described in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (24), systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison disease, and type 1 diabetes. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), characterized by the presence of an expanded somatic blood-cell clone in individuals without other hematologic abnormalities, is associated 10/28 with nearly twice the risk of coronary artery disease and early-onset myocardial infarction (25). Infection may also play a role in atherogenesis. Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at increased risk for developing myocardial infarction and other atherosclerotic complications due to a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors, immune cell activation, direct viral effects on endothelial cells, altered lipoprotein metabolism, and antiretroviral therapy associated dyslipidemia, and/or insulin resistance (26). Infections such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (COVID-19), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, those associated with periodontal disease, and others may cause endothelial dysfunction through direct infection, exposure to endotoxins, or stimulation of systemic or subendothelial inflammation (27).
