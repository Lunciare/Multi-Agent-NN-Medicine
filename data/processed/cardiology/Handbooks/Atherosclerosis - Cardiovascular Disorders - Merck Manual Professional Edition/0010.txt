Pathophysiology references Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis There are numerous risk factors for atherosclerosis (see table Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis) (1), both modifiable and non-modifiable. Status Risk Factor Age Family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Nonmodifiable and genetic predisposition* Male sex† Ethnicity (eg,South Asian ancestry) Modifiable Dyslipidemia (lipid abnormalities): High non-HDL and high LDL level, especially small, dense LDL High apolipoprotein B (ApoB) level High lipoprotein (a) level Hypertriglyceridemia Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic factors: Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance Hypertension Obesity, especially central obesity Chronic kidney disease Inflammation: High C-reactive protein (CRP) level Systemic inflammatory diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, vasculitides) Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) Infection: HIV Chlamydia pneumoniae Cytomegalovirus Helicobacter pylori Periodontal disease Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) 6/28 Status Risk Factor Influenza Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Lifestyle: Tobacco smoking Sedentary lifestyle Dietary factors such as low intake of fruits and vegetables Psychosocial factors (eg, chronic stressors, anger and hostility, depression, anxiety, socioeconomic status) Alcohol intake (other than moderate) Other: Prothrombotic states (eg, hyperfibrinogenemia, high plasminogen activator inhibitor level) Radiation therapy to thorax Treatment with chemotherapy agents (eg, anthracyclines, taxanes, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune
