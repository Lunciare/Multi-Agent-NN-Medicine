Atherosclerosis

disease, and others may cause endothelial dysfunction through direct infection, exposure to endotoxins, or stimulation of systemic or subendothelial inflammation (27). Lifestyle Tobacco smoke contains nicotine and other chemicals that are toxic to vascular endothelium. Smoking, including passive smoking, increases platelet reactivity (potentially promoting platelet thrombosis) and raises plasma fibrinogen levels (28, 29). Smoking increases LDL and decreases HDL levels, promotes lipid peroxidation, induces vasoconstriction, and stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. Sedentary lifestyle, diet, alcohol consumption, chronic stress and hostility, and other psychosocial factors are also lifestyle-related risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. Other risk factors Prothrombotic states (see Overview of Thrombotic Disorders) increase the likelihood of atherothrombosis. Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is also observed after thoracic radiation therapy (30). Atherosclerosis is likely the result of radiation-induced endothelial injury associated with reactive oxygen species production and intimal proliferation. In addition, certain chemotherapeutic agents such as anthracyclines, taxanes, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammation, or disrupted lipid metabolism, potentially contributing to the development or worsening of atherosclerosis (31). Premature menopause has been associated with a significantly increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (32). Data suggest that young
