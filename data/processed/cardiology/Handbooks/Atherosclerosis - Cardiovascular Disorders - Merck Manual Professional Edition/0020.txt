Atherosclerosis

contributing to the development or worsening of atherosclerosis (31). Premature menopause has been associated with a significantly increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (32). Data suggest that young women with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia, have a higher rate of coronary atherosclerosis compared to women without a documented history of adverse pregnancy outcomes (33, 34). Documented vascular disease The presence of atherosclerotic disease in one vascular territory increases the likelihood of disease in other vascular territories. Patients with noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular disease have cardiac event rates comparable to those of patients with known coronary artery disease. As a result, they are considered to have a coronary artery disease risk equivalent and should be treated as aggressively as patients with coronary artery disease (35). 11/28 Assessing Overall Risk Overall ASCVD risk is determined by a patient's individual risk factors. See Diagnosis - Asymptomatic Patients (Screening) for information on determining overall ASCVD risk in individual patients using a risk estimation calculator. Risk factor references Symptoms and Signs of Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is initially asymptomatic, often for decades. Symptoms and signs develop when lesions impede blood flow (see table Clinical Manifestations of Atherosclerosis). The symptoms depend on the vascular bed affected and
