in patients with established cardiovascular disease, its role in primary prevention is controversial, and it is not recommended routinely for this purpose (2). Single antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or aspirin (75 to 325 mg daily) is also recommended for preventing adverse events in patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (27). Among the available P2Y12 inhibitors, clopidogrel is the least potent and takes the longest time to reach maximum platelet inhibition. While other P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) are more potent, they are also associated with higher bleeding risk. Therefore, in acute coronary syndrome, the use of clopidogrel is only recommended when other P2Y12 inhibitors are not available, not tolerated, or contraindicated (29). In individuals with a high risk of bleeding, de-escalation from dual antiplatelet therapy to single antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor is recommended one month after percutaneous coronary intervention (29). The recommended duration of antiplatelet therapy also depends on concurrent anticoagulation. For example, no additional antiplatelet therapy is recommended in patients already on therapeutic anticoagulation who have no recent history of percutaneous revascularization or myocardial infarction. Other medications Beyond lipid-lowering agents and antiplatelet agents, additional medications are considered in patients with specific risk profiles or comorbidities. For
