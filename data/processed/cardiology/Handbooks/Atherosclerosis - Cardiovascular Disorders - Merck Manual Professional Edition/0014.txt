Atherosclerosis

LDL) accumulate in the intimal layer of the arteries where they undergo oxidation and switch to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This event leads to the migration and activation of inflammatory cells, primarily monocytes and T cells (6). As a result, LDL plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. A growing body of literature suggests that the risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is proportional to the cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol, often referred to as cholesterol years (7). Additionally, the concentration of small, dense, lipid-depleted LDL particles is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (8). The main determinant for risk of ASCVD, however, is the concentration of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, which is best reflected by the apolipoprotein B (ApoB) concentration, or by the non-high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration if a specific ApoB test is unavailable (9). For risk estimation, ApoB generally provides a more accurate and consistent prediction, especially in cases of discordance between ApoB and LDL cholesterol (10). ApoB-100 is capable of binding the LDL receptor and is responsible for cholesterol transport. It is also responsible for transporting oxidized phospholipids and possesses proinflammatory properties. HDL has been traditionally viewed as a protective factor against atherosclerosis
