the following groups (2): Adults aged 20 to 75 years with high low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]): Maximally tolerated statin therapy High-risk adults (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk: > 20%): High-intensity statin therapy Adults with diabetes and multiple ASCVD risk factors: High-intensity statin therapy Adults (aged 40 to 75 years) with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk: Moderate-intensity statin therapy (consider high-intensity) Intermediate-risk adults (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk: 7.5% to < 20%): Moderate-intensity statin therapy, following a discussion about risks Intermediate-risk adults (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk: 7.5% to < 20%) and adults with borderline risks (estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 5% to < 7.5%) with a calcium score measurement: Score of 0, and no diabetes, family history of premature ASCVD, cigarette smoking: Reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years Score of 1 to 99: Reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years Score of 100 or higher or 75th percentile or higher: Reasonable to initiate statin therapy Intermediate-risk adults with risk-enhancing factors: Consider initiating or intensifying statin therapy Borderline-risk adults with risk-enhancing factors: Consider moderate-intensity stating therapy High-intensity statin therapy has the goal of lowering LDL cholesterol
