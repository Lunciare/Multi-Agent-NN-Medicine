in the intima, the innermost layer of the arterial wall. Within the intimal layer, LDL particles are shielded from the protective antioxidant mechanisms of the plasma, and, as a result, they undergo oxidation and other modifications mediated by oxidative, lipolytic, and proteolytic enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen species. These chemical modifications lead to a proinflammatory and immunogenic switch in phenotype. This event triggers the migration of proinflammatory, classic monocytes into the intimal layer, facilitated by adhesion molecules (eg, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells. The local abundance of chemoattractant cytokines facilitates the movement of these bound monocytes into the arterial wall. Inside the intima, monocytes transform into macrophages, expressing scavenger receptors that allow them to ingest lipoprotein particles and become foam cells, a hallmark of the early atherosclerotic plaque. The migration of T cells also plays a significant role in establishing the inflammatory environment of the developing atherosclerotic plaque (2). In response to signals from the accumulating leukocytes, smooth muscle cells originating from the tunica media also migrate into the intimal layer, augmenting the population of resident intimal smooth muscle cells. 3/28 As atherosclerotic plaques evolve, both resident and recruited smooth muscle
