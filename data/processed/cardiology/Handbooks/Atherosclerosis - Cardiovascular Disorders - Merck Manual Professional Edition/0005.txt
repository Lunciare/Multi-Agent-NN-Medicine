Atherosclerosis

from the tunica media also migrate into the intimal layer, augmenting the population of resident intimal smooth muscle cells. 3/28 As atherosclerotic plaques evolve, both resident and recruited smooth muscle cells produce extracellular matrix molecules, including collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, resulting in intimal thickening (3). Within the maturing lesion, smooth muscle cells and macrophages proliferate. These smooth muscle cells and macrophages may also undergo necrosis or apoptosis (programmed cell death), leading to the accumulation of cell debris and forming a necrotic, lipid-rich core. Certain chemokines, such as interferon gamma released by T cells, can inhibit the ability of smooth muscle cells to produce interstitial collagen, thereby weakening their capacity to repair and sustain the fibrous cap that overlays the necrotic core. Additionally, activated macrophages increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases, a family of enzymes that can degrade the interstitial collagen vital for the fibrous cap's strength. This degradation results in the thinning and weakening of the fibrous cap, making the plaque more prone to rupture. Plaque stability and rupture Atherosclerotic plaques may be stable or unstable. Stable plaques either regress, remain static, or grow slowly over several decades, potentially causing vascular stenosis or occlusion. During the progression of the
