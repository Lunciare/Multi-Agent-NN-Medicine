Atherosclerosis

quantify myocardial blood flow, which also aids in the diagnosis of coronary microvascular disease. 14/28 Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) with Gadolinium-Based Contrast IMAGE IMAGE COURTESY OF ATTILA FEHER, MD, PHD. Fluorine-18–Labeled Deoxyglucose (FDG)/–Positron Emission Tomography... IMAGE IMAGE COURTESY OF ATTILA FEHER, MD, PHD. Invasive catheter-based tests that can assess atherosclerosis severity and plaque characteristics include: Invasive angiography: A catheter is inserted at the origin of the artery being investigated and iodinated contrast is injected. This technique allows the severity of stenosis to be estimated. In addition, therapeutic interventions, including thrombectomy and angioplasty, can be conducted. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS): An intravascular ultrasound transducer is used to assess the composition and extent of atherosclerotic plaques and to guide intravascular 15/28 procedures. Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This optical imaging-based method can be used to assess the composition and extent of atherosclerotic plaques and guide intravascular procedures. Fractional flow reserve (FFR): A pressure wire is used to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of a stenosis. FFR is based on the ratio of pressure distal and proximal to a stenosis in the presence of maximal blood flow (hyperemia, typically induced by adenosine). In coronary arteries, an FFR ≤ 0.80 indicates a hemodynamically significant stenosis. Coronary flow
