Alcohol intake (other than moderate) Other: Prothrombotic states (eg, hyperfibrinogenemia, high plasminogen activator inhibitor level) Radiation therapy to thorax Treatment with chemotherapy agents (eg, anthracyclines, taxanes, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors) Conditions specific to women (eg, adverse pregnancy outcomes such as. preeclampsia, premature menopause) 7/28 * Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is considered premature when it occurs in a male first-degree relative before age 55 years and in a female first-degree relative before age 65 years. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction, angina or coronary artery stenosis), cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, carotid stenosis), peripheral artery disease, and aortic atherosclerotic disease. † Atherosclerosis is increasingly prevalent in young women and women members of minority groups and populations in developing countries.
