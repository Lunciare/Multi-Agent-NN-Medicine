Atherosclerotic plaques may be stable or unstable. Stable plaques either regress, remain static, or grow slowly over several decades, potentially causing vascular stenosis or occlusion. During the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion, the arterial wall expands outwardly to preserve the vascular lumen (positive remodeling, also known as the Glagov phenomenon) (4). This outward remodeling can mask the severity of atherosclerosis, allowing significant plaque buildup without narrowing that is detectable with angiography. Unstable, or "vulnerable," plaques are prone to spontaneous erosion or rupture, leading to acute thrombosis, occlusion, and infarction, often long before they cause hemodynamically significant stenosis. These plaques typically feature a large lipid core covered by a thin (< 60 microns) fibrous cap. Most clinical events result from unstable plaques that do not appear hemodynamically significant when examined with angiography. Therefore, plaque stabilization is a critical strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality. Plaque complications include plaque rupture and erosion. Plaque rupture is the most common cause of acute coronary thrombosis leading to acute myocardial infarctions (5, 6), particularly fatal ones. The strength of the fibrous cap and its resistance to rupture depend on the balance between collagen deposition and degradation. Plaque rupture involves secretion of metalloproteinases, cathepsins, and collagenases
