Atherosclerosis

receptor and is responsible for cholesterol transport. It is also responsible for transporting oxidized phospholipids and possesses proinflammatory properties. HDL has been traditionally viewed as a protective factor against atherosclerosis by facilitating reverse cholesterol transport. Studies indicate a U-shaped association between cardiovascular risk and HDL levels, suggesting that individuals with both the lowest (< 40 mg/dL [< 1.0 mmol/L ] in men and < 50 mg/dL [< 1.3 mmol/L] in women) and highest (approximately 80 to 100 mg/dL [2.07 to 2.59 mmol/L]) HDL cholesterol levels face an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (11, 12) (see table Cholesterol Levels and Cardiovascular Risk). Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a pro-atherogenic lipoprotein that consists of an LDL-like core associated with an additional protein, apolipoprotein(a), which is covalently linked with the ApoB-100 molecule. Elevated Lp(a) levels confer an independent risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (13). Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined and remain fairly stable throughout life. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins also play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic events, even in patients whose 9/28 LDL levels are adequately controlled by statin therapy (residual triglyceride risk) (14).
