atherosclerosis. There is a dramatic increase observed in the prevalence of peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms with advanced age (2). Male sex is a well-established risk factor for earlier and more severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (3). While younger women generally have a lower risk of atherosclerosis, by the time they reach 8/28 their seventies, the incidence of myocardial infarction in women exceeds that of men, indicating an interaction between sex and age (2). Patients with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease also exhibit increased risk for development of atherosclerosis (4). The list of genetic disorders documented in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is growing and includes both monogenetic conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia associated with LDL receptor gene mutations, and polygenetic heredity. There are significant ethnic differences in atherosclerosis risk. For example, people of South Asian ancestry show a substantially higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than people of European ancestry (5). Modifiable risk factors Dyslipidemia In the presence of dyslipidemia, apolipoprotein B-containing particles (mainly LDL) accumulate in the intimal layer of the arteries where they undergo oxidation and switch to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This event leads to the migration and activation of inflammatory cells,
