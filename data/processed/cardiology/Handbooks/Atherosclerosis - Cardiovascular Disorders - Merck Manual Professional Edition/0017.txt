for atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Among other mechanisms, endothelial cell activation, oxidative stress, and the contribution to smooth muscle cell proliferation have been implicated (17). ASCVD risk increases above a threshold blood pressure as low as 115 mmHg (systolic) and 75 mmHg (diastolic), levels that do not fall within the hypertensive range (18). Risk then continues to increase roughly linearly as blood pressure increases (19, 20). Chronic kidney disease promotes the development of atherosclerosis through several pathways, including worsening hypertension, insulin resistance, and increased levels of lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (21). Inflammation Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (high sensitivity CRP ≥ 2 mg/L) has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, even in the presence of a normal lipid profile (or one well- controlled on medication even if not completely normal), representing a "residual inflammatory risk" (22). CRP is produced by the liver as a primary acute phase reactant and is involved in platelet activation and the regulation of the innate immune mechanisms. Autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors (age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking) (23).
