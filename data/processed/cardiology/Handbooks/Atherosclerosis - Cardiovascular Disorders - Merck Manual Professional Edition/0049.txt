radioactive isotopes are positioned at the site of the treated artery, where they emit localized radiation that inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby preventing neointimal hyperplasia. This localized radiation treatment is particularly beneficial for patients with recurrent in-stent restenosis (51). Surgical interventions Surgical techniques for atherosclerotic disease include: Bypass surgery Surgical endarterectomy Aneurysm repair Bypass surgery involves creating arterial connections to "bypass" blocked arteries using autogenous or prosthetic grafts, restoring blood flow to the affected area. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is critical in treating multivessel coronary artery disease (29, 51) and lower extremity peripheral artery disease (27). The decision to perform surgical or catheter-based revascularization in complex coronary artery disease should involve guideline-directed discussions, a team-based approach, and shared decision making. Patients with triple-vessel disease who have diabetes ideally should undergo surgical revascularization, with the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafted to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, unless they are poor candidates for surgery, in which case percutaneous revascularization could be considered. Surgical endarterectomy involves the excision of atherosclerotic plaque from the intimal layer of the artery, thereby restoring luminal diameter and improving blood flow. The most frequently performed variant is carotid endarterectomy, which is used to
