and has been shown to provide sustained LDL-lowering effects with infrequent (twice-yearly) dosing (34). Other therapeutic agents, including small interfering RNAs (eg, olpasiran, lepodisiran) and antisense oligonucleotide technology (eg, pelacarsen), aim to specifically reduce lipoprotein(a) levels and are being evaluated for their efficacy and safety (35, 36). Eicosapent ethyl is a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid, a key omega-3 fatty acid. It reduces triglyceride levels by inhibiting liver triglyceride synthesis and enhancing the clearance of triglyceride- rich lipoproteins and has anti-inflammatory, endothelial stabilizing, and antiplatelet effects (37). It significantly reduces cardiovascular event rates in patients with cardiovascular disease who have elevated triglyceride levels despite statin therapy (38). Unlike prescription eicosapent ethyl, over-the- counter fish oil supplements typically contain a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in lower and variable doses and have not consistently demonstrated cardiovascular event reduction in large clinical trials (39, 40). Antiplatelet medications Oral antiplatelet medications are essential in preventing atherosclerosis-related complications as most events originate from plaque fissure or rupture, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis. The following medications can be used: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and disrupts thromboxane A2 production, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. 22/28 P2Y12 inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor)
