Atherosclerosis

is to stay as active as their health condition allows (2). Resistance exercise for 2 or more days per week is also recommended (1). 20/28 Stress reduction and mental health care Stress reduction strategies, in particular cognitive behavioral therapy, have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with known ASCVD (20, 21). Multiple studies have also demonstrated that the treatment of depression reduces cardiovascular risk (22, 23). Pharmacotherapy Lipid lowering therapy Statins primarily lower cardiovascular risk by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, which leads to the upregulation of liver LDL receptors and increased LDL clearance from the blood. Other potential beneficial effects of statins include enhanced endothelial nitric oxide production, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced lipid accumulation in the arterial wall, and regression of plaques (24). However, statins may also carry risks, including myalgia and, rarely, rhabdomyolysis, as well as an increased risk of new-onset diabetes and potential liver enzyme elevations (25, 26). Statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the following groups (2): Adults aged 20 to 75 years with high low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]): Maximally tolerated statin therapy High-risk adults
