may develop, probably secondary to microemboli, in about 25 to 30% (1). Cognitive or behavioral changes are more prevalent in older patients, prompting suspicion that these changes are most likely due to diminished "neuronal reserve," making older patients more susceptible to minor injuries incurred during cardiopulmonary bypass. Dysfunction ranges from mild to severe and may persist for weeks to years. It is not clear that using a beating heart technique (off-pump CABG, which uses no cardiopulmonary bypass) decreases long-term risks of neuropsychiatric effects. Other common complications of CABG include Arrhythmias Focal myocardial ischemia Global myocardial ischemia Perioperative myocardial infarction occurs in about 1% of patients. For patients with a normal-sized heart, no history of MI, good ventricular function, and no additional risk factors, risk is < 5% for perioperative MI. Atrial fibrillation occurs in 15 to 40% of patients, typically 2 to 4 days after surgery. Beta-blockers (including sotalol) and amiodarone appear to reduce the likelihood of the development of atrial arrhythmias after cardiac surgery. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia may occur in up to 50% of patients. Mortality depends mainly on patients’ underlying health; operator and institutional experience (ie, number of annual procedures) also is important. In an experienced program, periprocedural
