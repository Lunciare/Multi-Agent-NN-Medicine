of coronary artery bypass grafting Complications and disadvantages of traditional CABG involve mainly Sternotomy Cardiopulmonary bypass Median sternotomy is surprisingly well tolerated; however, healing takes 4 to 6 weeks. Also, wound infections occasionally cause mediastinitis or sternal osteomyelitis, which can be difficult to treat. CPB causes several major complications, including Bleeding Organ dysfunction, including neuropsychiatric effects Stroke Post-CPB bleeding is a common problem caused by various factors, including hemodilution, heparin use, platelet dysfunction due to exposure to the bypass pump, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and induced hypothermia. Organ dysfunction may result from a systemic inflammatory response caused by the CPB machine (probably due to exposure of blood components to the foreign material of the bypass circuit); this response can cause organ dysfunction in any system (eg, pulmonary, renal, brain, gastrointestinal). Aortic cannulation, cross-clamping, and release can trigger release of emboli, causing stroke. For patients with a normal-sized heart, no history of MI, good ventricular function, and no additional risk factors, risk is 1 to 2% for stroke. 2/5 Post-CPB neuropsychiatric effects may develop, probably secondary to microemboli, in about 25 to 30% (1). Cognitive or behavioral changes are more prevalent in older patients, prompting suspicion that these changes are most likely
