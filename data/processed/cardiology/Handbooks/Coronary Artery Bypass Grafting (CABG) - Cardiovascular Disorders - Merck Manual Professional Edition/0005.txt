Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)

in up to 50% of patients. Mortality depends mainly on patients’ underlying health; operator and institutional experience (ie, number of annual procedures) also is important. In an experienced program, periprocedural mortality in otherwise healthy patients is typically < 1 to 3% (2). For patients with a normal-sized heart, no history of MI, good ventricular function, and no additional risk factors, risk is ≤ 1% for mortality. Risks of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, and mortality increase with age, poor LV function, and presence of underlying disease. A simple calculator can categorize risks associated with CABG into three groups (low, intermediate, high). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) publishes a more advanced Short-Term/Operative Risk Calculator used to assess risk of operative mortality, major morbidity, and complications after most cardiac procedure categories in the Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (ACSD) (eg, stroke, renal failure).
