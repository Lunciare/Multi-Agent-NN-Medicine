(off-pump CABG) Avoiding median sternotomy (minimally invasive CABG) Both Off-pump CABG Cardiopulmonary bypass can be avoided in select patients by using techniques that allow the surgeon to revascularize the beating heart. Various devices and methods stabilize a portion of the myocardium, holding the operative site relatively motionless. Off-pump CABG procedures are more commonly done through small parasternal or intercostal incisions (minimally invasive CABG), sometimes with endoscopy or even robotic assistance, but they may be done through a traditional median sternotomy, which provides better operative exposure. Allowing the heart to beat means that the myocardium requires more oxygen than when CPB is used. Thus, the heart is sensitive to the interruption of blood flow necessitated while the vascular anastomosis is done; this interruption can cause ischemia or infarction in the myocardium supplied by the affected vessel. Some surgeons place a temporary coronary artery shunt to provide distal perfusion. Off-pump CABG is technically more challenging but may be appropriate in patients who have significant aortic calcifications that causes manipulation of the aorta to be of higher risk. Compared to on-pump procedures, off-pump CABG is associated with increased need for revascularization at one year. Minimally invasive CABG The minimally invasive CABG technique is
