Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involves bypassing native coronary arteries that have high-grade stenosis or occlusion not amenable to angioplasty with stent insertion. Indications are changing as percutaneous interventions are being increasingly used. Chest X-Ray of a Patient After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Hide Details Frontal and lateral chest x-ray of a patient post coronary artery bypass surgery showing sternal sutures (black arrow) and surgical clips (red arrow). Traditional CABG Procedure Traditional coronary artery bypass grafting involves thoracotomy via a midline (median) sternotomy. A heart-lung machine is used to establish cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), allowing the heart to be stopped and emptied of blood to maximize operative exposure and facilitate vessel anastomosis; stopping the heart also markedly decreases myocardial oxygen demand. Before initiation of CPB, the patient is given a very high dose of heparin to prevent clotting in the bypass circuit.
