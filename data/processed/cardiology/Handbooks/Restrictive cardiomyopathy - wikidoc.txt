Overview
Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCMP) is a rare form among other cardiomyopathies, characterized by increased stiffness of the ventricles in the
presence of normal diastolic volume and normal ventricular wall thickness. It may be classified into primary i.e EMF(endomyocardial
fibrosis),Loffler’s endocarditis, Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy and secondary i.e, infiltrative diseases(e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and
radiation carditis) and storage diseases (e.g., hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disorders, and Fabry’s disease). Cardiac amyloidosis is the most
common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Mainly due to deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space and misfolding into β-pleated
sheets which are antiparallel to each other making them resistant to proteolysis, and also cause oxidative stress as a result leading to myocardial
damage. Sarcoidosis characterized by noncaseating granulomas formation in various tissues including heart and hemochromatosis due to excessive
accumulation of iron within the cells of various organs liver, pancreas, heart, and several endocrine glands leading to cirrhosis, diabetes, heart failure,
skin pigmentation is also the common causes. Cardiac genes for desmin, α-actin, troponin I and troponin T are involved in the pathogenesis of
restrictive cardiomyopathy. Restrictive cardiomyopathy should be differentiated from dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
congestive heart failure. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is very rare among all other types and accounts for approximately 5% of all cases. Its prevalence
varies depending on regionality, ethnicity, age, and gender. Amyloidosis affects men and women equally. The wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis is
most often found in the elderly population. Common complications of restrictive cardiomyopathy include thromboembolism, rhythm
abnormalities(dysrhythmias), cardiac cirrhosis, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension. Common symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations,
syncope. Jugular venous distension is noted sometimes with Kussmaul sign and Hepatojugular reflux.S3 and S4 gallops seen. ECG shows Low QRS
voltages, conduction disturbances, nonspecific ST abnormalities. Transmitral spectral Doppler often shows restrictive filling pattern and Ejection
fraction (EF) is normal. The main purpose of treatment in restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the elevated filling
pressures without significantly lowering the cardiac output.Pharmacologic therapy may include Beta blockers, Amiodarone, Cardioselective [[calcium
channel blockers], Diuretics, Anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation, Melphalan (for antiplasma cell therapy in systemic amyloidosis),
Chemotherapy (in amyloidosis). Other approaches like Pacemaker implantation and endomyocardectomy are also available.
Historical Perspective
• In 1957 for the first time Brigden coined the term ‘cardiomyopathy’ to describe group of uncommon, non-coronary myocardial diseases.[1][2][3]
• But later in 1961 Goodwin redefined cardiomyopathies as “myocardial diseases of unknown cause”. Infact he is the one who put them into 3
seperate entities “dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive”, which we are still using today.
• In 1980 World Health Organization (WHO) and International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC) combinedly published a classification
which included the three subgroups proposed by Goodwin.
Classification
• There is no established system for the classification of restrictive cardiomyopathy[4] [5][6][7][8]
• It may be classified into:
• Primary
• EMF(endomyocardial fibrosis)
• Loffler’s endocarditis
• Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy
• Secondary
• Infiltrative diseases(e.g., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and radiation carditis)
• Storage diseases (e.g., hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disorders, and Fabry’s disease)
Pathophysiology
Pathogenesis
• The exact pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is not completely understood[4].
• Mainly characterized by impaired ventricular filling and reduced diastolic volume of one or both ventricles, with either normal or near-normal
systolic function.
• Hemodynamic abnormalities constitute the main pathological aspect of restrictive cardiomyopathy.
• The primary abnormality of restrictive cardiomyopathy is impaired myocardial relaxation along with interstitial fibrosis as well as calcifications.
• Restrictive filling can been seen which is due to higher diastolic pressure.
Cardiac Amyloidosis
• It is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM).

• Mainly due to deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular space and misfolding into β-pleated sheets which are antiparallel to each other
making them resistant to proteolysis, and also cause oxidative stress as a result leading to myocardial damage.
Sarcoidosis
• Characterised by noncaseating granulomas formation in various tissues including heart.
• The usual location is basal septum, AV node, bundle of His, the ventricular free walls, and papillary muscles.
• Formation of granuloma includes 3 histological stages: edema, granulomatous infiltration, and fibrosis.
Hemochromatosis
• Due to excessive accumulation of iron within the cells of various organs liver, pancreas, heart, and several endocrine glands leading to cirrhosis,
diabetes, heart failure, skin pigmentation.
Genetics
Genes involved in the pathogenesis of restrictive cardiomyopathy include[9][10][11][12]:
• Cardiac genes for desmin, α-actin, troponin I and troponin T.
• Missense mutation (D190H) in the region of the cTnI gene (TNNI3).
• De novo mutations (R192H and K178E) in the TNNI3 gene.
• Mutations in the α-cardiac actin (ACTC), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and cTnT (TNNT2) genes have been noticed to have etiological causes
of restrictive cardiomyopathy.

• Other Specific lab findings will depend upon the cause (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in sarcoidosis, complete blood count (CBC) with
peripheral smear helping to establish eosinophilia in hypereosinophilic syndromes, serum iron concentrations, total iron-binding capacity and
ferritin levels in hemocromatosis, immunoglobulin free light κ, λ chain testing, and serum and urine immunofixation in amyloidosis, etc.
Electrocardiogram
Shown below is an example of restrictive cardiomyopathy with low voltage and flipped anterior T waves.
X-ray
A chest X-ray may show atrial dilatation most of the times.
Echocardiography and Ultrasound
Echocardiography may be helpful in the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Findings on an echocardiography suggestive of restrictive
cardiomyopathy include:
• Normal or increased wall thickness
• Transmitral spectral Doppler often shows restrictive filling pattern.
• Marked left or biatrial dilatation usually as a consequence of chronically elevated filling pressures.
• Ejection fraction (EF) is normal or near normal.
• The main purpose of echo is the differential diagnosis between constrictive pericarditis(CP) and resrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM).
• Both present as heart failure with normal-sized ventricles and preserved EF, dilated atria, and doppler findings of increased filling pressure often
seen in restrictive cardiomyopathy.
CT scan
MRI
• Magnetic Resonance imaging and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is very helpful in providing information about anatomic structures,
perfusion, ventricular function, as well as tissue characterization.[29][30]
• Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) depending on the pattern of scar formation can help the doctor in establishing the diagnosis to specific
subtypes of restrictive cardiomyopathy(RCM).
• MRI can also quantify the myocardial iron load in patients with haemochromatosis or thalassemia who receive transfusions.
Other Imaging Findings
• Radionuclide imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography (PET), is also used for the
diagnostic work-up of amyloidosis.[31][32][33][34]
• An increased myocardial uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate or Tc-99m 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid helps to identify patients with
familial transthyretin-related amyloidosis(ATTR) and also it can differentiate them from those with light chain amyloid(AL).
• Radionuclide imaging with 18fluorodeoxyglucose- (FDG-) PET is recently being used to assist in the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.
• Decrease in myocardial perfusion with enhanced 18FDG uptake is consistent with inflammation, while decreased perfusion with reduced 18FDG
uptake is associated with scarring.
Other Diagnostic Studies
Treatment
Medical Therapy
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy has no definitive treatment. But However, the ones directed at individual causes have been proven to be
effective.[14][4][35][36]
• The main purpose of treatment in restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the elevated filling pressures without
significantly lowering the cardiac output.
• Pharmacologic therapy may include:
• Beta blockers
• Amiodarone
• Cardioselective calcium channel blockers
• Diuretics
