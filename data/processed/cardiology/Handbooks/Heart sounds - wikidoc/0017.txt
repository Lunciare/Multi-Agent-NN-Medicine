increase in intensity with expiration. Having the patient lie supine and raising their legs up to a 45 degree angle facilitates an increase in venous return to the right side of the heart producing effects similar to inhalation-increased blood flow. Surface anatomy The opening and closing of the valves is usually much less loud than the sound of the blood rushing through the valve and "colliding" with the subsequent barrier. Because of this, auscultation to determine function of a valve is usually not performed at the position of the valve, but at a downstream position where the listener can best hear the blood colliding after the valve is closed. Pulmonary valve (to pulmonary trunk) second intercostal space left upper sternal border Aortic valve (to aorta) second intercostal space right upper sternal border Mitral valve (to left ventricle) fifth intercostal space lateral to left midclavicular line Tricuspid valve (to right ventricle) fourth intercostal space lower left sternal border One can remember the positions of the sounds by the mnemonic "All The Presidents Men".
