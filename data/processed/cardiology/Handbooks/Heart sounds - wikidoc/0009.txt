Heart sounds

Poor Left Ventricular Function • Post-MI - the death of tissue in the ventricular wall due to loss of blood supply causes areas which do not move as well, if at all (hypokinetic and akinetic), meaning they do not relax quickly enough so the ventricular filling is relatively too quick. • Dilated cardiomyopathy - the ventricular walls are abnormal for a variety of reasons, and become thin and stiff so do not relax well. • Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy • Cardiomegaly of a variety of causes In conditions affecting the pericardium or diseases that primarily affect the heart muscle (restrictive cardiomyopathies) a similar sound can be heard, but is usually more high-pitched and is called a 'pericardial knock'. The S3 can also be confused with a widely split S2, or a mitral opening snap, but these sounds are typically of much higher pitch and occur closer to the onset of S2. Treatment The gallop rhythm itself does not need to be treated; the underlying cause requires correction; depending on the etiology the gallop rhythm may resolve following treatment. Fourth heart sound S 4 S (or fourth heart sound) occurs just before S (thus right at the end of one whole cycle),
