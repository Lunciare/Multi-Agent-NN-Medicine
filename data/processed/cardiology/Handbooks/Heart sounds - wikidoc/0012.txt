Heart sounds

a single sound. Abnormal sounds Aortic area, pulmonic area, tricuspid area and mitral area are the area where we auscultate the heart. Heart murmurs are produced as a result of turbulent flow of blood, turbulence sufficient to produce audible noise. They usually are heard as a whooshing sound. The term murmur only refers to a sound believed to originating within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce a murmur. Though not fully reliable, soft murmurs are less likely to reflect a serious, if any, health problem; loud murmurs essentially always reflect a problem. Yet most heart problems do not produce any murmur and most valve problems also do not produce an audible murmur. The following paragraphs overview the murmurs most commonly heard in adults, adults who do not have major congenital heart abnormalities. • Regurgitation through the mitral valve is by far the most commonly heard murmur, sometimes fairly loud to a practiced ear, even though the volume of regurgitant blood flow may be quite 5/8 small. Yet, though often obvious, probably about 20% of cases of mitral regurgitation, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, do not produce an audible murmur. • Stenosis of
