availability of echocardiography and other techniques, heart status can be recognized and quantified much more accurately than formerly possible with only a stethoscope, examination and experience. Clicks: With the advent of newer, non-invasive imaging techniques, the origin of other, so-called adventitial sounds or "clicks" has been appreciated. These are short, high-pitched sounds. There are two types of clicks, ejection click and non-ejection click. • Ejection clicks are caused by bicuspid aortic valve and bicuspid pulmonary valve early in the systole. 6/8 • Non-ejection clicks are seen in mitral valve prolapse, ventricular septal aneurysm, atrial septal aneurysm, cardiac tumors, pulmonary hypertension and systemic hypertension. Patients with mitral valve prolapse may have a mid-systolic click along with a murmur. • The atrioventricular valves of patients with mitral stenosis may open with an opening snap on the beginning of diastole. Rubs: Patients with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), may have an audible pericardial friction rub. This is a characteristic scratching, creaking, high- pitched sound emanating from the rubbing of both layers of inflammated pericardium. It is the loudest in systole, but can often be heard also at the beginning and at the end of diastole. It is very
