("atrial kick") and is the sound of blood being forced into a stiff/hypertrophic left ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop. Pathophysiology and Etiology It is caused by the atria contracting forcefully in an effort to overcome an abnormally-stiff ventricle. Differential Diagnosis of Causes of an S 4 The S rhythm is associated with disorders that increases the stiffness of the ventricle, including: 4 • Long-standing hypertension • Aortic stenosis • Overload of the ventricle • Fibrosis of the ventricle • Left ventricular hypertrophy • Coronary Artery Disease • Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy • Pulmonary Hypertension Treatment Again, the rhythm itself does not require treatment; the underlying cause of ventricular stiffness or dysfunction does. Summation Gallop If a fast heart rate (tachycardia) is present along and S and S both occur, the rate may become 3 4 high enough so that the distinction between the two sounds is lost, and they summate into a single sound. Abnormal sounds Aortic area, pulmonic area, tricuspid area and mitral area are the area where we auscultate the heart. Heart murmurs are produced as a result of
