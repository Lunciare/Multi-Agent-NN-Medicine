Heart sounds

blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. [1] Second heart tone S the "dub"(components A and P ) 2 2 2 The second heart tone, or S , is caused by the sudden block of reversing blood flow due to closure 2 of the aortic valve and pulmonary valve at the end of ventricular systole, i.e beginning of ventricular diastole. As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta, aortic blood flow quickly reverses back toward the left ventricle, catching the aortic valve leaflets and is stopped by aortic (outlet) valve closure. Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary (outlet) valve closes. The S sound 2 results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal. Splitting of the second heart sound {{#ev:youtube|5tBk1XuEyuM}} Physiologic Splitting During inspiration, negative intrathoracic pressure causes increased blood return into the right side of the heart, yet some slowing of emptying from the left side. The increased blood volume in the right ventricle causes the pulmonary valve to stay open longer during ventricular systole. This causes an increased delay in
