Heart sounds

stenosis restricting the opening of a heart valve, causing turbulence as blood flows through it. Valve insufficiency (or regurgitation) allows backflow of blood when the Diagram showing relations of incompetent valve is supposed to be closed. Different murmurs are opened heart to front of thoracic audible in different parts of the cardiac cycle, depending on the wall. Ant. Anterior segment of cause of the murmur. tricuspid valve. A O. Aorta. A.P. Anterior papillary muscle. In. Normal heart sounds Innominate artery. The first heart tone, or S , is caused by the sudden block of reverse blood flow due to closure of the 1 atrioventricular valves, mitral and tricuspid, at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the pressure in the ventricles rises above the pressure in the atria, venous blood flow entering the ventricles is pushed back toward the atria, catching the valve leaflets, closing the inlet valves and preventing regurgitation of blood from the ventricles back into the atria. The S sound 1 results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves.
