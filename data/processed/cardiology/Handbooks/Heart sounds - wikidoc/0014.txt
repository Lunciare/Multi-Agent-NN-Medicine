audible murmurs are associated with abnormal openings between the left ventricle and right heart or from the aortic or pulmonary arteries back into a lower pressure heart chamber. Gradations of Murmurs[3] ( Grade Description Very faint, heard only after Grade 1 listener has "tuned in"; may not be heard in all positions. Quiet, but heard immediately Grade 2 after placing the stethoscope on the chest. Grade 3 Moderately loud. Grade 4 Loud, with palpable thrill. Very loud, with thrill. May be Grade 5 heard when stethoscope is partly off the chest. Very loud, with thrill. May be Grade 6 heard with stethoscope entirely off the chest. As noted, several different cardiac conditions can cause heart murmurs. However, the murmurs produced often change in complex ways with the severity of the cardiac disease. An astute physician can sometimes diagnose cardiac conditions with some accuracy based largely on the murmur, related physical examination and experience with the relative frequency of different heart conditions. However, with the advent of better quality and wider availability of echocardiography and other techniques, heart status can be recognized and quantified much more accurately than formerly possible with only a stethoscope, examination and experience.
