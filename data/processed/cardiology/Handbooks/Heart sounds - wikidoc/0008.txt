Heart sounds

ventricle as in dilated congestive heart failure (CHF). This sound is called a protodiastolic gallop or ventricular gallop, a type of gallop rhythm. Pathophysiology and Etiology 3/8 It is caused by the sudden slowing of blood rushing in from the atrium into the ventricle as it is relaxing. Differential Diagnosis of Causes of an S 3 It is associated with heart failure, caused by conditions which have: Rapid ventricular filling • Mitral regurgitation - this is when one of the heart valves that usually stops blood going from the left ventricle to the left atria fails, allowing blood into the atria during systole. This means they will be overfilled when they come to contract, leading to the rapid ventricular filling. • Elevated left atrial and left ventricular filling pressures, usually a result of a stiffened and dilated left ventricle • Ventricular septal defect - this is a hole in the wall between the two ventricles, which allows rapid filling from the other ventricle. • Elevated atrial pressure • High-output states Poor Left Ventricular Function • Post-MI - the death of tissue in the ventricular wall due to loss of blood supply causes areas which do not move as well, if
