Heart sounds

2 Because of the delayed activation of the right heart in RBBB the pulmonary valve closure is delayed causing a split in the second heart sound which is persistent in both inspiration and expiration. Paradoxical Splitting 2/8 This phenomenon is seen in left bundle branch block (LBBB), aortic stenosis, severe heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Delayed activation of the left ventricle and in turn delayed closure of the aortic valve causes the pulmonic component of the second heart sound to occur before the aortic component. This split is better appreciated while expiration than during inspiration. Fixed Splitting If this splitting does not vary with inspiration, it is termed "fixed split S2" and is usually due to an atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD). The ASD or VSD creates a left to right shunt that increases the blood flow to the right side of the heart, thereby causing the pulmonic valve to close later than the aortic valve independent of inspiration/expiration. Loud P 2 Pulmonary hypertension is the most common cause of a loud P . When the pulmonary artery 2 pressures are more than 50 mm Hg a loud pulmonic component of S is heard in the
