Heart sounds

early diastole, shortly after the second heart sound S , giving a rhythm much 2 like the cadence in the word 'Kentucky'. It can be a normal finding in people under 40 years of age, but over this age is usually a sign of heart failure. It is usually low-pitched and difficult to hear, and is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. An S rhythm is also known as ventricular gallop. The 3 third heart sound or protodiastolic sound is not of valvular origin, as it occurs at the beginning of diastole just after S2. This sound occurs when the left ventricle is not very compliant, and at the beginning of diastole the rush of blood into the left ventricle suddenly is halted, resulting in a vibration of the ventricle and surrounding structures. The third heart sound is normal in children and young adults, but disappears before middle age. Abnormal reemergence of this sound late in life indicates a pathological state, often a sign of a failing left ventricle as in dilated congestive heart failure (CHF). This sound is called a protodiastolic gallop or ventricular gallop, a type of gallop rhythm. Pathophysiology and Etiology 3/8 It is caused
