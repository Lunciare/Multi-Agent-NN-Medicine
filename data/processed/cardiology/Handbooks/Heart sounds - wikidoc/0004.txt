Heart sounds

emptying from the left side. The increased blood volume in the right ventricle causes the pulmonary valve to stay open longer during ventricular systole. This causes an increased delay in the P component of S relative to the A component. This is defined 2 2 2 as physiologic splitting of S . During expiration, the positive intrathoracic pressure causes 2 decreased blood return to the right side of the heart. The reduced volume in the right ventricle allows the pulmonary valve to close earlier at the end of ventricular systole, causing P to occur 2 earlier, and "closer" to A . It is physiological to hear a "splitting" of the second heart tone in 2 younger people, during inspiration and in the "pulmonary area", i.e. the 2nd ICS (intercostal space) at the left edge of the sternum. During expiration, the interval between the two components normally shortens and the S2 sounds becomes merged. Persistent Splitting Persistent splitting of S is seen in right bundle branch block (RBBB) and pulmonary hypertension. 2 Because of the delayed activation of the right heart in RBBB the pulmonary valve closure is delayed causing a split in the second heart sound which is persistent in
