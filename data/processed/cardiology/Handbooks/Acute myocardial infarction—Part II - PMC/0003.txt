indicators of acute ischaemia. ST segment elevation in association with a positive QRS complex, or ST segment depression in leads V1, V2, or V3 (which have predominantly negative QRS complexes), is not expected in uncomplicated left bundle branch block and is termed “inappropriate concordance.” Inappropriate concordance strongly indicates acute ischaemia. Extreme ST segment elevation (⩾5 mm) in leads V1 and V2 also suggests acute ischaemia. If doubt persists, serial electrocardiograms may show evolving changes. Right bundle branch block Right bundle branch block is most commonly seen in association with coronary artery disease, but in many cases no organic heart disease is present. Uncomplicated right bundle branch block usually causes little ST segment displacement and neither causes nor masks Q waves. Thus it does not generally interfere with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, though it may mask a posterior myocardial infarction. 2/15 The Brugada syndrome, which is familial, occurs particularly in young men and is characterised by right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads. There is a high incidence of death as a result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias Differential diagnosis of ST segment elevation ST segment elevation has numerous possible causes. It may be a
