Acute myocardial infarction—Part II - PMC

branch block occurs in the context of an acute myocardial infarction the infarct is usually anterior and mortality is extremely high. The electrocardiographic changes of acute myocardial infarction can be difficult to recognise when left bundle branch block is present, and many of the conventional diagnostic criteria are not applicable. Abnormal ventricular depolarisation in left bundle branch block leads to secondary alteration in the recovery process (see earlier article about bradycardias and atrioventricular conduction block). This appears on the electrocardiogram as repolarisation changes in a direction opposite to that of the main QRS deflection—that is, “appropriate discordance” between the QRS complex and the ST segment. Thus leads with a predominantly negative QRS complex show ST segment elevation with positive T waves (an appearance similar to that of acute anterior myocardial infarction). Recognition of acute ischaemia Many different electrocardiographic criteria have been proposed for identifying acute infarction in left bundle branch block, but none has yet proved sufficiently sensitive to be useful in the acute setting. However, some features are specific indicators of acute ischaemia. ST segment elevation in association with a positive QRS complex, or ST segment depression in leads V1, V2, or V3 (which have predominantly negative QRS complexes),
