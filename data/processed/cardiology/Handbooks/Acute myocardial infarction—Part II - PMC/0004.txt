Acute myocardial infarction—Part II - PMC

There is a high incidence of death as a result of ventricular tachyarrhythmias Differential diagnosis of ST segment elevation ST segment elevation has numerous possible causes. It may be a variant of normal or be due to cardiac or non-cardiac disease. A correct diagnosis has obvious advantages for the patient but is also particularly important before the use of thrombolytic treatment so that unnecessary exposure to the risks of thrombolytic drugs can be avoided. Causes of ST segment elevation Acute myocardial infarction “High take-off” Benign early repolarisation Left bundle branch block Left ventricular hypertrophy Ventricular aneurysm Coronary vasospasm/Printzmetal's angina Pericarditis Brugada syndrome Subarachnoid haemorrhage The interpretation of ST segment elevation should always be made in the light of the clinical history and examination findings. There are often clues in the electrocardiogram to differentiate the ST segment elevation of acute ischaemia from other causes; for example, reciprocal changes (see last week's article) may be present, which strongly indicate acute ischaemia. Serial electrocardiography or continuous ST segment monitoring is also useful as ischaemic ST segment elevation evolves over time. Old electrocardiograms are also useful for comparison. “High take-off” 3/15 Care is required when interpreting ST segment elevation in right sided chest leads
