the associated subepicardial myocarditis. The zone of injured tissue causes abnormal ST vectors; the end result is that leads facing the epicardial surface record ST segment elevation, whereas those facing the ventricular cavity (leads aVR and V1) record ST segment depression. The absence of widespread reciprocal change, the 4/15 presence of PR segment depression, and absence of Q waves may be helpful in distinguishing pericarditis from acute myocardial infarction. Other causes of ST segment elevation The characteristic features of left ventricular hypertrophy are also often misinterpreted as being caused by acute ischaemia. ST segment elevation in the precordial leads is a feature of left ventricular hypertrophy and is due to secondary repolarisation abnormalities. ST segment abnormalities are seen in association with intracranial (particularly subarachnoid) haemorrhage. ST segment elevation or depression may be seen; a putative explanation is that altered autonomic tone affects the duration of ventricular repolarisation, producing these changes. Printzmetal's angina (vasospastic angina) is associated with ST segment elevation. As the changes are due to coronary artery spasm rather than acute infarction, they may be completely reversible if treated promptly. ST segment abnormalities may be seen in association with cocaine use and are probably due to a combination of
