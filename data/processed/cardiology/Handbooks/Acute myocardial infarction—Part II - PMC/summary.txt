This article describes the association of bundle branch block with acute myocardial infarction and the differential diagnosis of ST segment elevation. Bundle branch block Acute myocardial infarction in the presence of bundle branch block carries a much worse prognosis than acute myocardial infarction with normal ventricular conduction. This is true both for patients whose bundle branch block precedes the infarction and for those in whom bundle branch block develops as a result of the acute event. Thrombolytic treatment produces dramatic reductions in mortality in these patients, and the greatest benefits are seen in those treated early. It is therefore essential that the electrocardiographic identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with bundle branch block is both timely and accurate. Left bundle branch block Left bundle branch block is most commonly seen in patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, or dilated cardiomyopathy.
