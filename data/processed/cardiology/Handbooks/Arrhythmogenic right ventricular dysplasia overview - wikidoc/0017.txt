to prevent thrombus formation and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Catheter ablation Catheter ablation may be used to treat intractable ventricular tachycardia. It has a 60-90% success rate.[6] Unfortunately, due to the progressive nature of the disease, recurrence is common (60% recurrence rate), with the creation of new arrhythmogenic foci. Indications for catheter ablation include drug-refractory VT and frequent recurrence of VT after ICD placement, causing frequent discharges of the ICD. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator An ICD is the most effective prevention against sudden cardiac death. Due to the prohibitive cost of ICDs, they are not routinely placed in all individuals with ARVD.

Due to the extreme thinning of the RV free wall, it is possible to perforate
