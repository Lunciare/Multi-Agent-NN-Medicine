death. 2/10 The first clinical signs of ARVD are usually during adolescence. However, signs of ARVD have been demonstrated in infants. Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of ARVD is largely unknown. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) appears to play a large role. It is unclear why only the right ventricle is involved. The disease process starts in the subepicardial region and works its way towards the endocardial surface, leading to transmural involvement (possibly accounting for the aneurysmal dilatation of the RV). Residual myocardium is confined to the subendocardial region and the trabeculae of the RV. These trabeculae may become hypertrophied. Aneurysmal dilatation is seen in 50% of cases at autopsy. It usually occurs in the diaphragmatic, apical, and infundibular regions (known as the triangle of dysplasia). The left ventricle is involved in 50-67% of individuals. If the left ventricle is involved, it is usually late in the course of disease, and confers a poor prognosis. There are two pathological patterns seen in ARVD, Fatty infiltration and fibro-fatty infiltration. Fatty infiltration The first, fatty infiltration, is confined to the right ventricle. This involves a partial or near- complete substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue without wall thinning. It involves predominantly the apical and infundibular
