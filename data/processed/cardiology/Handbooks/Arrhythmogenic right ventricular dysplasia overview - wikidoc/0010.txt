also be present. Cardiac MRI Fatty infiltration of the RV free wall can be visible on cardiac MRI. Fat has increased intensity in T1- weighted images. However, it may be difficult to differentiate intramyocardial fat and the epicardial fat that is commonly seen adjacent to the normal heart. Also, the sub-tricuspid region may be difficult to distinguish from the atrioventricular sulcus, which is rich in fat. Cardiac MRI can visualize the extreme thinning and akinesis of the RV free wall. However, the normal RV MRI in a patient affected by ARVC/D (long axis free wall may be about 3 mm thick, making the test view of the right ventricle): note the transmural less sensitive. diffuse bright signal in the RV free wall on spin echo T1 (a) due to massive myocardial atrophy with fatty replacement (b). Right ventricular angiography Right ventricular angiography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of ARVD. Findings consistent with ARVD are an akinetic or dyskinetic bulging localized to the infundibular, apical, and subtricuspid regions of the RV. The specificity is 90%; however, the test is observer dependent. Right ventricular biopsy Transvenous biopsy of the right ventricle can be highly specific for ARVD, but it
