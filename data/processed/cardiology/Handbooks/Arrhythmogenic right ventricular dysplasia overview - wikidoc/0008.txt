Arrhythmogenic right ventricular

• Atrial septal defect • Partial anomalous venous return • Acquired heart disease • Tricuspid valve disease • Pulmonary hypertension • Right ventricular infarction • Bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia • Miscellaneous • Pre-excited AV re-entry tachycardia • Idiopathic RVOT tachycardia • Sarcoidosis Clinical testing In order to make the diagnosis of ARVD, a number of clinical tests are employed, including the electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiography, right ventricular angiography, cardiac MRI, and genetic testing. Electrocardiogram 90% of individuals with ARVD have some EKG abnormality. The most common EKG abnormality seen in ARVD is T wave inversion in leads V to V . However, this is a non-specific finding, and 1 3 may be considered a normal variant in right bundle branch block (RBBB), women, and children under 12 years old. RBBB itself is seen frequently in individuals with ARVD. This may be due to delayed activation of the right ventricle, rather than any intrinsic abnormality in the right bundle branch. The epsilon wave is found in about 50% of those with ARVD. This is described as a terminal notch in the QRS complex. It is due to slowed intraventricular conduction. The epsilon wave may be seen on a surface EKG; however, it is
