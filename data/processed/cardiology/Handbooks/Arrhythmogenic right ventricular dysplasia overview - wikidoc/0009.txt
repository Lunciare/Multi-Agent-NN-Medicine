is described as a terminal notch in the QRS complex. It is due to slowed intraventricular conduction. The epsilon wave may be seen on a surface EKG; however, it is more commonly seen on signal averaged EKGs. 4/10 Ventricular ectopy seen on a surface EKG in the setting of ARVD is typically of left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology, with a QRS axis of -90 to +110 degrees. The origin of the ectopic beats is usually from one of the three regions of fatty degeneration (the "triangle of The epsilon wave dysplasia"): the RV outflow tract, the RV inflow tract, and the RV apex. The epsilon wave (marked by red triangle), seen in ARVD. Signal averaged ECG Signal averaged ECG (SAECG) is used to detect late potentials and epsilon waves in individuals with ARVD. Echocardiography Echocardiography may reveal an enlarged, hypokinetic right ventricle with a paper-thin RV free wall. The dilatation of the RV will cause dilatation of the tricuspid valve annulus, with subsequent tricuspid regurgitation. Paradoxical septal motion may also be present. Cardiac MRI Fatty infiltration of the RV free wall can be visible on cardiac MRI. Fat has increased intensity in T1- weighted images. However, it may be
