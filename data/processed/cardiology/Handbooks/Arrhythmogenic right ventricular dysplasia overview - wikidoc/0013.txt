major and 2 minor criteria or 4 minor criteria. Major Criteria • Right ventricular dysfunction • Severe dilatation and reduction of RV ejection fraction with little or no LV impairment • Localized RV aneurysms • Severe segmental dilatation of the RV • Tissue characterization • Fibrofatty replacement of myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy • Conduction abnormalities • Epsilon waves in V - V . 1 3 • Localized prolongation (>110 ms) of QRS in V - V 1 3 • Family history 6/10 • Familial disease confirmed on autopsy or surgery Minor Criteria • Right ventricular dysfunction • Mild global RV dilatation and/or reduced ejection fraction with normal LV. • Mild segmental dilatation of the RV • Regional RV hypokinesis • Tissue characterization • Conduction abnormalities • Inverted T waves in V and V in an individual over 12 years old, in the absence of a right 2 3 bundle branch block (RBBB) • Late potentials on signal averaged EKG. • Ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology • Frequent PVCs (> 1000 PVCs / 24 hours) • Family history • Family history of sudden cardiac death before age 35 • Family history of ARVD Natural history There
