Arrhythmogenic right ventricular

fibro-fatty tissue is consistent with ARVD. Genetic Testing ARVD is an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. Approximately 40-50% of ARVD patients have a mutation identified in one of several genes encoding components of the desmosome, which can help confirm a diagnosis of ARVD.[4] Since ARVD is an autosomal dominant trait, children of an ARVD patient have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease causing mutation. Whenever a mutation is identified by genetic testing, family-specific genetic testing can be used to differentiate between relatives who are at-risk for the disease and those who are not. ARVD genetic testing is clinically available.[5] In vitro MRI and corresponding cross section of Diagnostic Criteria the heart in ARVD show RV dilatation with anterior and posterior aneurysms (17 year old There is no pathognomonic feature of ARVD. The asymptomatic male athlete who died suddenly diagnosis of ARVD is based on a combination of during a soccer game). major and minor criteria. To make a diagnosis of ARVD requires either 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria or 4 minor criteria. Major Criteria • Right ventricular dysfunction • Severe dilatation and reduction of RV ejection fraction with little or no LV impairment
