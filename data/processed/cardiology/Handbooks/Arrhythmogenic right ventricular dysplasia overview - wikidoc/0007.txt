to aneurysm formation. Ventricular arrhythmias Ventricular arrhythmias due to ARVD typically arise from the diseased right ventricle. The type of arrhythmia ranges from frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to ventricular tachycardia (VT) to ventricular fibrillation (VF). While the initiating factor of the ventricular Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia arrhythmias is unclear, it may be due to triggered activity or reentry. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricular outflow tract. 3/10 Ventricular arrhythmias are usually exercise-related, suggesting that they are sensitive to catecholamines. The ventricular beats typically have a right axis deviation. Multiple morphologies of ventricular tachycardia may be present in the same individual, suggesting multiple arrhythmogenic foci or pathways. Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is the most common VT seen in individuals with ARVD. In this case, the EKG shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology with an inferior axis. Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for the ventricular tachycardia due to ARVD include: • Congenital heart disease • Repaired tetralogy of Fallot • Ebstein's anomaly • Uhl's anomaly • Atrial septal defect • Partial anomalous venous return • Acquired heart disease • Tricuspid valve disease • Pulmonary hypertension • Right ventricular infarction • Bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia • Miscellaneous
