of the RV. The specificity is 90%; however, the test is observer dependent. Right ventricular biopsy Transvenous biopsy of the right ventricle can be highly specific for ARVD, but it has low sensitivity. False positives include other conditions with fatty infiltration of the ventricle, such as chronic alcohol abuse and Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy. False negatives are common, however, because the disease progresses typically from the epicardium to the endocardium (with the biopsy sample coming from the endocardium), and the segmental naCtuoorkeie so hfe lpth ues d edliivseer aosure s. erAvilcseos., B yd uusein gt oou rt sherev icpeas,p yoeur -atghreien t o roiugrh utse vofe cnootrkiiecsu.lar free wall that is 5/10 common in this disease process, most biopsy samples are taken from the ventricular septum, which is commonly not involved in the disease process. A biopsy sample that is consistent with ARVD would have > 3% fat, >40% fibrous tissue, and <45% myocytes. Autopsy A post mortem histological demonstration of full thickness substitution of the RV myocardium by fatty or fibro-fatty tissue is consistent with ARVD. Genetic Testing ARVD is an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. Approximately 40-50% of ARVD patients have a mutation identified in one of several
