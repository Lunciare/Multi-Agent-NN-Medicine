Arrhythmogenic right ventricular

associated arrhythmias originating in the right ventricle. ARVD is often found in association with diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair, because their genes are nearby and often inherited together [1]:513[2] OK 1/10 ARVC/D is an important cause of ventricular arrhythmias in children and young adults. It is seen predominantly in males, and 30-50% of cases have a familial distribution. Genetics It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with variable expression. Novel studies showed that mutations (point mutations) in genes encoding for desmosomal proteins (see intercalated disc) are the main causatives for the development of this disease. Recently it could be shown, that mutations in the desmin gene could cause ARVC. Desmin is an intermediate filament protein, which is linked to the desmosomes. The penetrance is 20–35% in general, but significantly higher in Italy. Seven gene loci have been implicated in ARVD. However, about 50% of families that express ARVD that undergo genetic screening do not show linkage with any of the known chromosomal loci. It is unclear whether the pathogenesis varies with the different loci involved. Standard genetic screening test are currently tested and evaluated in different state of the art cardiovascular research centres and hospitals. Types include:
