Cardiac Pacemakers
By L. Brent Mitchell, MD, Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary
Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary
Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025
The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is
directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs,
cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special
form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used.
Pacemakers sense electrical events and respond when necessary by delivering electrical stimuli to the
heart (1). Permanent pacemaker leads are placed via thoracotomy or transvenously, but some
temporary emergency pacemaker leads can be placed on the chest wall. Pacemaker functionality also is
included in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs).

Indications for pacemaker placement
Indications for pacemaker placement are numerous (see table) but generally involve symptomatic
bradycardia or high-grade atrioventricular block (AV block). Some tachyarrhythmias may be terminated
by overdrive pacing with a brief period of pacing at a faster rate; the pacemaker is then slowed to the

cardiovert and defibrillate as well as pace (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators).

Types of cardiac pacemakers
Types of pacemakers are designated by 3 to 5 letters (see table Pacemaker Codes), representing which
cardiac chambers are paced, which chambers are sensed, how the pacemaker responds to a sensed
event (inhibits or triggers pacing), whether it can increase heart rate during exercise (rate-modulating),
and whether pacing is multisite (in both atria, both ventricles, or more than one pacing lead in a single

chamber). For example, a VVIR pacemaker paces (V) and senses (V) events in the ventricle, inhibits
pacing in response to sensed event (I), and can increase its rate during exercise (R).
VVI and DDD pacemakers are the devices most commonly used. They offer equivalent survival benefits.
Compared with VVI pacemakers, physiologic pacemakers (AAI, DDD, VDD) appear to reduce risk of atrial
fibrillation (AF) and heart failure and slightly improve quality of life.
Modern pacemakers include lower-energy circuitry, new battery designs, and corticosteroid-eluting
leads (which reduce pacing threshold), all of which increase pacemaker longevity. Mode switching refers
to an automatic change in the mode of pacing in response to sensed events (eg, from DDDR to VVIR
during AF). Leadless ventricular pacemakers consist of a combined impulse generator and lead that are
entirely contained within the right ventricle. They are placed transvenously using specially designed
delivery systems and are retained in the right ventricle by screws or tines. The leadless pacemakers
currently in use are approximately 1 mL in size, 2 grams in weight, and are of VVI or VVIR configuration
(2).

* The pacemaker code is defined by 3 to 5 letters (here defined by positions I to V). Any one
of the letters may be used for each particular position. For example, in position I, the letter
code may be A, V, or D. In position III, the letter code may be O, I, T, or D and so on.
Complications of pacemaker use
Pacemakers may malfunction by
Oversensing events
Undersensing events
Failing to pace
Failing to capture
Pacing at an abnormal rate
Tachycardias are an especially common complication. Rate-modulating pacemakers may increase
stimuli in response to vibration, muscle activity, or voltage induced by magnetic fields during magnetic
resonance imaging. In pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, a normally functioning dual-chamber
pacemaker senses a ventricular premature or paced beat transmitted to the atrium (ie, through the AV
node or a retrograde-conducting accessory pathway), which triggers ventricular stimulation in a rapid,
repeating cycle.
Additional complications associated with normally functioning devices include cross-talk inhibition, in
which sensing of the atrial pacing impulse by the ventricular channel of a dual-chamber pacemaker
leads to inhibition of ventricular pacing, and pacemaker syndrome, in which AV asynchrony induced by
ventricular pacing causes fluctuating, vague cerebral (eg, light-headedness), cervical (eg, neck
pulsations), or respiratory (eg, dyspnea) symptoms. Pacemaker syndrome is managed by restoring AV
synchrony by atrial pacing (AAI), single-lead atrial sensing ventricular pacing (VDD), or dual-chamber
pacing (DDD), most commonly the latter.
Environmental interference comes from electromagnetic sources such as surgical electrocautery and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although MRI may be safe when the pacemaker generator and leads
are not inside the magnet. MRI conditional pacing systems have been designed to withstand MRI but an
abandoned lead, even if MRI conditional, may be hazardous when exposed to an MRI field. Cellular
telephones and electronic security devices are potential sources of interference; telephones should not
be placed close to the device but are not a problem when used normally for talking. Walking through
metal detectors does not cause pacemaker malfunction as long as patients do not linger.
