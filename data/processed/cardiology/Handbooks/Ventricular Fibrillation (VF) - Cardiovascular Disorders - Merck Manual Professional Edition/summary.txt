Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions. It causes immediate syncope and death within minutes. Treatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including immediate defibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is due to multiple wavelet reentrant electrical activity and is manifested on electrocardiogram (ECG) by ultrarapid baseline undulations that are irregular in timing and morphology. Although early reports noted that VF was the presenting rhythm for about 75% of patients in cardiac arrest (1), the proportion of cardiac arrests due to VF has been decreasing. More recently, VF has been reported to be the presenting rhythm in about 40% of cardiac arrests (2).
