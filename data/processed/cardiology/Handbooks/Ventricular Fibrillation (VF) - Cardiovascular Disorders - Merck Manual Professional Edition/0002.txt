Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)

any disorder is increased by electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, hypoxemia, or ischemia. Ventricular fibrillation is much less common among infants and children, in whom asystole is the more common presentation of cardiac arrest. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation Patients who have been resuscitated from VF cardiac arrest are evaluated for cardiac disease, particularly coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and channelopathies (3). If comprehensive electrocardiographic, imaging, and provocative testing do not identify any such causative disorder, the patient is considered to have idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. It is thought that some of these patients likely have an unrecognized or unknown genetic disorder. Because of the possibility that the disorder is familial, it is recommended that family members undergo close surveillance for possible cardiac events (eg, syncope, palpitations) and, should any occur, undergo testing, including ECG, exercise stress testing, and echocardiography. Genetic testing of survivors and cascade genetic testing of family members is done in selected patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy or a suspected channelopathy (3) (see also Arrhythmogenic Cardiac Disorders). Treatment is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (3). Treatment of Ventricular Fibrillation Defibrillation Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Treatment of ventricular fibrillation is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including defibrillation, beginning with biphasic 120 to 200 joules (or monophasic 360 joules).
