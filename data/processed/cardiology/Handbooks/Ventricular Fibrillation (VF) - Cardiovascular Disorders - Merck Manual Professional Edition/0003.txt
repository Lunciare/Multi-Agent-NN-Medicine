Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)

of Ventricular Fibrillation Defibrillation Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Treatment of ventricular fibrillation is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including defibrillation, beginning with biphasic 120 to 200 joules (or monophasic 360 joules). The success rate for immediate defibrillation (within seconds as can be achieved by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) is about 99% provided that overwhelming pump failure does not preexist. Thereafter, the first shock defibrillation success rate decreases by about 10% per minute (1). Patients who have VF without a reversible or transient cause are at high risk of future VF events and of sudden death. Most of these patients require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; many require concomitant antiarrhythmic medications to reduce the frequency of subsequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and VF (2).
