Overview
The tricuspid valve is on the right side of the heart, between the right atrium and the right
ventricle. The normal tricuspid valve usually has three leaflets and three papillary muscles.
Tricuspid valves may also occur with two or four leaflets, and the number may change during life
(Van Pragh, 1998).
Valves
• The largest cusp is interposed between the atrioventricular orifice and the conus arteriosus
and is termed the anterior or infundibular cusp.
• A second, the posterior or marginal cusp, is in relation to the right margin of the ventricle.
• A third, the medial or septal cusp, to the ventricular septum.
• The tricuspid valve prevents the blood from returning to the right atrium when the right ventricle
contracts

Pathology
A small amount of leakage or regurgitation is not uncommon in the tricuspid valve. It is a common
valve to be infected (endocarditis) in IV drug users.[1][2] Although it is not a common site of
endocarditis, patients with a small VSD usually develop endocarditis of the tricuspid valve.
The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever which can cause tricuspid stenosis or
tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation).
Some patients are born with congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve. Congenital apical
displacement of the tricuspid valve is called Ebstein's anomaly and typically causes significant
tricuspid regurgitation.
The first endovascular tricuspid valve implant was performed by physicians at the Cleveland Clinic.
