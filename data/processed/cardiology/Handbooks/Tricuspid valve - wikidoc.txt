Pathology
A small amount of leakage or regurgitation is not uncommon in the tricuspid valve. It is a common
valve to be infected (endocarditis) in IV drug users.[1][2] Although it is not a common site of
endocarditis, patients with a small VSD usually develop endocarditis of the tricuspid valve.
The tricuspid valve can be affected by rheumatic fever which can cause tricuspid stenosis or
tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation).
Some patients are born with congenital abnormalities of the tricuspid valve. Congenital apical
displacement of the tricuspid valve is called Ebstein's anomaly and typically causes significant
tricuspid regurgitation.
The first endovascular tricuspid valve implant was performed by physicians at the Cleveland Clinic.
