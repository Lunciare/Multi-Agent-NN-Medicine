Paediatric electrocardiography
KEYWORDS: right, waves, age, ventricular, heart, normal, hypertrophy, wave, left, ventricular hypertrophy, leads, children, precordial, congenital, lead

the adult precordial pattern of R and S waves will all suggest right ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy may be indicated by deep Q waves in the left precordial leads or the typical adult changes of lateral ST depression and T wave inversion. 4/18 Normal values in paediatric electrocardiograms Age PR interval QRS duration R wave (S wave) (ms) (ms) amplitude (mm) Lead V1 Lead V6 Birth 80-160 <75 5-26 (1-23) 0-12 (0-10) 6 70-150 <75 3-20 (1-17) 6-22 (0-10) months 1 year 70-150 <75 2-20 (1-20) 6-23 (0-7) 5 years 80-160 <80 1-16 (2-22) 8-25 (0-5) 10 years 90-170 <85 1-12 (3-25) 9-26 (0-4) Open in a new tab The QT interval must be corrected for heart rate by dividing its value by the square root of the R-R interval. A corrected QT interval exceeding 0.45 s should be considered prolonged, but it should be noted that the QT interval is highly variable in the first three days of life. QT prolongation may be seen in association with hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothermia, drug treatment, cerebral injury, and the congenital long QT syndrome. Other features of the long QT syndrome include notching of the T waves, abnormal U waves, relative bradycardia
