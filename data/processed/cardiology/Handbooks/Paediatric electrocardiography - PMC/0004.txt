Paediatric electrocardiography

V3) between ages 7 days and 7 years are a potentially important abnormality and usually indicate right ventricular hypertrophy. The QRS complex also reflects these changes. At birth, the mean QRS axis lies between +60° and +160°, R waves are prominent in the right precordium, and S waves are prominent in the left precordium. By age 1 year, the axis changes gradually to lie between +10° and +100°. 3/18 The resting heart rate decreases from about 140 beats/min at birth to 120 beats/min at age 1 year, 100 at 5 years, and adult values by 10 years. The PR interval decreases from birth to age 1 year and then gradually increases throughout childhood. The P wave duration and the QRS duration also increase with age. The QT interval depends on heart rate and age, increasing with age while decreasing with heart rate. Q waves are normally seen in the inferior or lateral leads but signify disease if present in other leads. Abnormal paediatric electrocardiograms Diagnosis of abnormality on a paediatric electrocardiogram will require knowledge of normal age related values, particularly for criteria relating to right or left ventricular hypertrophy. P wave amplitude varies little with age and is best evaluated
