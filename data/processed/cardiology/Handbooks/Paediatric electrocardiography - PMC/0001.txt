Paediatric electrocardiography

General clinicians and junior paediatricians may have little experience of interpreting paediatric electrocardiograms. Although the basic principles of cardiac conduction and depolarisation are the same as for adults, age related changes in the anatomy and physiology of infants and children produce normal ranges for electrocardiographic features that differ from adults and vary with age. Awareness of these differences is the key to correct interpretation of paediatric electrocardiograms. Successful use of paediatric electrocardiography Be aware of age related differences in the indications for performing electrocardiography, the normal ranges for electrocardiographic variables, and the typical abnormalities in infants and children Genuine abnormality is unusual; if abnormality is suspected, seek a specialist opinion Indications for paediatric electrocardiography • Syncope or seizure • Electrolyte disturbance • Exertional symptoms • Kawasaki disease • Drug ingestion • Rheumatic fever • Tachyarrhythmia • Myocarditis • Bradyarrhythmia • Myocardial contusion • Cyanotic episodes • Pericarditis • Heart failure • Post cardiac surgery • Hypothermia • Congenital heart defects Recording the electrocardiogram To obtain a satisfactory recording in young children requires patience, and the parents may be helpful in providing a source of distraction. Limb electrodes may be placed in a more proximal position to reduce movement artefacts. Standard
