The aortic valve is one of the valves of the heart. It lies between the left ventricle and the aorta. • Common causes of aortic stenosis include rheumatic fever, degenerative calcification, and congenital diseases such as unicuspid aortic valve, bicuspid aortic valve, tricuspid aortic valve with commissural fushion, quadricuspid aortic valve and hypoplastic aortic annulus. • Common causes of aortic regurgitation include dilation of the aorta, previous rheumatic fever, infection, i.e. infective endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve, Marfan's syndrome and rupture of a congenitally fenestrated aortic cusp. Bicuspid aortic valve The most common congenital abnormality of the heart is the bicuspid aortic valve.
