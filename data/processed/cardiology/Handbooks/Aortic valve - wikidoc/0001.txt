Aortic valve

The aortic valve is one of the valves of the heart. It lies between the left ventricle and the aorta. • Common causes of aortic stenosis include rheumatic fever, degenerative calcification, and congenital diseases such as unicuspid aortic valve, bicuspid aortic valve, tricuspid aortic valve with commissural fushion, quadricuspid aortic valve and hypoplastic aortic annulus. • Common causes of aortic regurgitation include dilation of the aorta, previous rheumatic fever, infection, i.e. infective endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve, Marfan's syndrome and rupture of a congenitally fenestrated aortic cusp. Bicuspid aortic valve The most common congenital abnormality of the heart is the bicuspid aortic valve. In this condition, instead of three cusps, the aortic valve has two cusps. This condition is often undiagnosed until later in life when the person develops symptomatic aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis occurs in this condition usually in patients in their 40s or 50s, an average of 10 years earlier than can occur in people with congenitally normal aortic valves. Aortic Valve Replacement Aortic valve replacement means that a patient's aortic valve is replaced by a different valve. The aortic valve can be affected by a range of diseases and require aortic valve replacement. The valve
