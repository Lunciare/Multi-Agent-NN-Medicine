Cardiac Pacemakers

magnetic resonance imaging. In pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, a normally functioning dual-chamber pacemaker senses a ventricular premature or paced beat transmitted to the atrium (ie, through the AV node or a retrograde-conducting accessory pathway), which triggers ventricular stimulation in a rapid, repeating cycle. Additional complications associated with normally functioning devices include cross-talk inhibition, in which sensing of the atrial pacing impulse by the ventricular channel of a dual-chamber pacemaker leads to inhibition of ventricular pacing, and pacemaker syndrome, in which AV asynchrony induced by ventricular pacing causes fluctuating, vague cerebral (eg, light-headedness), cervical (eg, neck pulsations), or respiratory (eg, dyspnea) symptoms. Pacemaker syndrome is managed by restoring AV synchrony by atrial pacing (AAI), single-lead atrial sensing ventricular pacing (VDD), or dual-chamber pacing (DDD), most commonly the latter. Environmental interference comes from electromagnetic sources such as surgical electrocautery and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although MRI may be safe when the pacemaker generator and leads are not inside the magnet. MRI conditional pacing systems have been designed to withstand MRI but an abandoned lead, even if MRI conditional, may be hazardous when exposed to an MRI field. Cellular telephones and electronic security devices are potential sources of interference; telephones should not be placed close
