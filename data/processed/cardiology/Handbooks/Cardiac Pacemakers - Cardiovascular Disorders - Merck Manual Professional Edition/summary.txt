Cardiac Pacemakers
KEYWORDS: class, block, evidence, heart, opinion, patients, ventricular, pacemaker, pacing, sinus, bradycardia, symptoms, rate, iii, symptomatic

The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used. Pacemakers sense electrical events and respond when necessary by delivering electrical stimuli to the heart (1). Permanent pacemaker leads are placed via thoracotomy or transvenously, but some temporary emergency pacemaker leads can be placed on the chest wall. Pacemaker functionality also is included in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs).
