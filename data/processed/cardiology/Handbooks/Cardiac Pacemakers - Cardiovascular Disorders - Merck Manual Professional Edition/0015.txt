Cardiac Pacemakers

Atrium O = None O = None programmable I = Inhibits V = Ventricle V = Ventricle A = Atrium pacemaker T = Triggers pacemaker to R =Rate- D = Dual (both) D = Dual (both) V = Ventricle stimulate modulated ventricles D = Dual (both): For events sensed in ventricles, D = Dual (both) inhibits; for events sensed in atria, triggers 11/13 * The pacemaker code is defined by 3 to 5 letters (here defined by positions I to V). Any one of the letters may be used for each particular position. For example, in position I, the letter code may be A, V, or D. In position III, the letter code may be O, I, T, or D and so on. Complications of pacemaker use Pacemakers may malfunction by Oversensing events Undersensing events Failing to pace Failing to capture Pacing at an abnormal rate Tachycardias are an especially common complication. Rate-modulating pacemakers may increase stimuli in response to vibration, muscle activity, or voltage induced by magnetic fields during magnetic resonance imaging. In pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, a normally functioning dual-chamber pacemaker senses a ventricular premature or paced beat transmitted to the atrium (ie, through the AV node or a retrograde-conducting
