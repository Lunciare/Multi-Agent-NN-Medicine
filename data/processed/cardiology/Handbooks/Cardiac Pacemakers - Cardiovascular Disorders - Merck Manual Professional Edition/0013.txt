Cardiac Pacemakers

AV = atrioventricular; BBB = bundle branch block; CRT = cardiac resynchronization therapy; EF = ejection fraction; HV interval = interval from the His signal to the beginning of the first ventricular signal; ICD = implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; LBBB = left bundle branch block; LV = left ventricular; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SVT = supraventricular tachycardia; VT = ventricular tachycardia. Types of cardiac pacemakers Types of pacemakers are designated by 3 to 5 letters (see table Pacemaker Codes), representing which cardiac chambers are paced, which chambers are sensed, how the pacemaker responds to a sensed event (inhibits or triggers pacing), whether it can increase heart rate during exercise (rate-modulating), and whether pacing is multisite (in both atria, both ventricles, or more than one pacing lead in a single 10/13 chamber). For example, a VVIR pacemaker paces (V) and senses (V) events in the ventricle, inhibits pacing in response to sensed event (I), and can increase its rate during exercise (R). VVI and DDD pacemakers are the devices most commonly used. They offer equivalent survival benefits. Compared with VVI pacemakers, physiologic pacemakers (AAI, DDD, VDD) appear to reduce risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure and slightly improve quality
