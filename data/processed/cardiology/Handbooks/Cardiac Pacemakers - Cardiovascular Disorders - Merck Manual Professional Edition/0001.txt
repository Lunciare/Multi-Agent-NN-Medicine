Cardiac Pacemakers

The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used. Pacemakers sense electrical events and respond when necessary by delivering electrical stimuli to the heart (1). Permanent pacemaker leads are placed via thoracotomy or transvenously, but some temporary emergency pacemaker leads can be placed on the chest wall. Pacemaker functionality also is included in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Pacemakers Chest Radiograph of a Patient with Pacemaker This radiograph shows a patient with a pacemaker in the left upper chest with leads in the right atrium (1) and right ventricle (2). Indications for pacemaker placement Indications for pacemaker placement are numerous (see table) but generally involve symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade atrioventricular block (AV block). Some tachyarrhythmias may be terminated by overdrive pacing with a brief period of pacing at a faster rate; the pacemaker is then slowed to the 1/13 desired rate. Nevertheless, ventricular tachyarrhythmias are better treated with devices that can cardiovert and defibrillate as well as pace (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators). TABLE Indications
