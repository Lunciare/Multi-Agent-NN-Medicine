Cardiac tamponade overview

aneurysm. In developed countries malignancy is the leading cause of cardiac tamponade secondary to pericardial effusion. The incidence of cardiac tamponade based on a giant sample size of about 216 million emergency admissions was about 115,638(0.05%). The incidence of cardiac tamponade increases with age; the mean age was around 61.9. Cardiac temponade mortality rate is significantly different due to its underlying cause. Risk Factors Most potent risk factors for cardiac tamponade include heart surgeries, cardiac myxomas, myocardial infarction and traumas. Screening Cardiac tamponade is more of a clinical diagnosis. If the patient clinical manifestation was raising suspicious toward tamponade, CT scan and echocardiogram are diagnostic gold standards for the disease. Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent intervention to remove the pericardial fluid. Complications include pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock and ultimately death. Cardiac tamponade has a good prognosis if detected early and treated immediately. Short-term survival is mostly dependent on early diagnosis and relief of tamponade. Long-term survival depends upon the prognosis of the underlying cause, irrespective of the mode of treatment. Diagnosis Diagnostic Study of Choice 3/6 Cardiac tamponade is more of a clinical diagnosis, but still some diagnostic studies may
