of the underlying cause, irrespective of the mode of treatment. Diagnosis Diagnostic Study of Choice 3/6 Cardiac tamponade is more of a clinical diagnosis, but still some diagnostic studies may be helpful. History and Symptoms Patients with cardiac tamponade may present with sudden onset of chest pain, palpitations, breathlessness and lightheadedness. Presentation vary with the cause and acuteness of development of tamponade. An acute cardiac tamponade follows trauma to the chest or rupture of the aorta or heart. A subacute cardiac tamponade occurs in the setting of a neoplasm or renal failure. A low pressure cardiac tamponade occurs in patients who are hypovolemic secondary to hemorrhage or over diuresis. Physical Examination Physical examination may vary depending on the type of cardiac tamponade. Physical examination may show the classic Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sound, and elevated jugular venous distension), tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and pericardial rub depending on the type, and severity of tamponade. Initial diagnosis can be challenging, as there are a number of differential diagnoses, including tension pneumothorax, and acute heart failure. Laboratory Findings Non-specific markers of inflammation are generally elevated in pericarditis. This include the CBC, elevated C-reactive protein, ESR. The cardiac troponin is elevated if there is
