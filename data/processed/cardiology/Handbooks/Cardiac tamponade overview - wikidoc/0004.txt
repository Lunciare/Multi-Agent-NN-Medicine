Cardiac tamponade overview

to a decreased stroke volume. Causes 2/6 Cardiac tamponade is caused by the accumulation of a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances. Common causes of increased pericardial effusion include hypothyroidism, trauma (either penetrating trauma involving the pericardium or blunt chest trauma), pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), iatrogenic trauma (during an invasive procedure), and ventricular rupture. Differentiating cardiac tamponade from Other Diseases The initial diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can be challenging, as there are a number of differential diagnoses, including tension pneumothorax, hypovolemia and acute congestive heart failure. The differential diagnosis of cardiac tamponade differs based on the type of cardiac tamponade (either acute or subacute). Epidemiology and Demographics The cardiac tamponade is most often attributed to the rupture of an acute myocardial infarction or an intrapericardial rupture of a dissecting ascending aortic aneurysm. In developed countries malignancy is the leading cause of cardiac tamponade secondary to pericardial effusion. The incidence of cardiac tamponade based on a giant sample size of about 216
