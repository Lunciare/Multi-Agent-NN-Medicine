Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency condition in which fluid/blood accumulates in the pericardium (the sac in which the heart is enclosed). The elevated pericardial pressure puts significant pressure on the heart, causing a decrease in the diastolic filling of the ventricles, and hence in stroke volume. The end result is ineffective pumping of blood, shock, and potentially death. It is caused mainly by the accumulation of a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances.
