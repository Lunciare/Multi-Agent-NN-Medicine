palpitations, breathlessness and lightheadedness. Physical examination may show the classic Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sound, and elevated jugular venous distension), tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, and pericardial rub depending on the type, and severity of tamponade. The electrocardiogram in cardiac tamponade usually demonstrates sinus tachycardia, and may sometimes show reduced QRS voltage and electrical alternans. Chest X ray will demonstrate pneumopericardium and cardiac silhouette changes. Echocardiography findings include pericardial effusion, diastolic compression of the RV, diastolic compression of the right atrium (RA), plethora of the inferior vena cava and paradoxical septal motion. Pericardiocentesis can provide a diagnostic sampling of pericardial fluid and can be used as a therapeutic maneuver to evacuate pericardial fluid and lower the pericardial pressure. Historical Perspective Cardiac tamponade is a very common emergent manifestation, which can be caused by traumatic injuries, since the emulation of the disease tracks back to centuries ago. Acknowledgment of existing pericardial is first done by hippocrates, which was continued by Galen to describing what is now known as pericardial effusion. Classification Cardiac tamponade is an emergency form of cardiac effusion. it is more over classified by the pathological causes. The management of emergent situation is not very differed by the basic cause.
