tamponade is an emergency form of cardiac effusion. it is more over classified by the pathological causes. The management of emergent situation is not very differed by the basic cause. Pathophysiology Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial space fills up with fluid faster than the pericardial sac can stretch. If the amount of fluid increases slowly (such as in hypothyroidism) the pericardial sac can expand to contain a liter or more of fluid prior to tamponade occurring. If the fluid occurs rapidly (as may occur after trauma or myocardial rupture) as little as 100 ml can cause tamponade. However, if the volume of the fluid accumulation is too rapid and or large, then the hemodynamic compromise can occur with a rise in pericardial pressure. This in turn reduces stroke volume, and eventually, cardiac output. If fluid continues to accumulate, then with each successive diastole, less and less blood enters the ventricles, as the increasing pressure presses on the heart and forces the septum to bend into the left ventricle, leading to a decreased stroke volume. Causes 2/6 Cardiac tamponade is caused by the accumulation of a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case
