acute heart failure. Laboratory Findings Non-specific markers of inflammation are generally elevated in pericarditis. This include the CBC, elevated C-reactive protein, ESR. The cardiac troponin is elevated if there is injury to the underlying myocardium, a condition termed myopericarditis. Diagnostic pericardiocentesis and biopsy help in identifying an underlying infectious or malignant process. Electrocardiogram The electrocardiogram in cardiac tamponade usually demonstrates sinus tachycardia, and may sometimes show reduced QRS voltage and electrical alternans. X-ray Cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis, however chest X ray can be helpful sometimes. It will demonstrate pneumopericardium and cardiac silhouette changes. Echocardiography and Ultrasound The role of echocardiography in the evaluation of the patient with pericarditis is to characterize the presence, size, location and hemodynamic impact of a pericardial effusion. Tamponade is characterized by pericardial effusion, diastolic compression of the RV, diastolic compression of the right atrium (RA), plethora of the inferior vena cava and paradoxical septal motion. CT scan 4/6 A CT scan is not commonly used for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade as it is effectively diagnosed based on clinical features and echocardiography. Findings on CT include [Superior vena cava]] andInferior vena cava enlargement, Hepatic and renal vein enlargment, periportal edema, reflux of contrast
