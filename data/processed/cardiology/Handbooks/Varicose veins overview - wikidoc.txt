Varicose veins overview
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [3] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)
Overview
Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and twisted. The term commonly refers to the
veins on the leg, although varicose veins occur elsewhere. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood
from flowing backwards (retrograde). Leg muscles pump the blood in veins to return it to the
heart. When veins become enlarged, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the
valves don't work. A common cause of valve failure is Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), which can
cause permanent damage to the valves. The blood collects in the veins and they enlarge even more.
Varicose veins are common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure
when standing.
Causes
Varicose veins are more common in women than in men, and are linked with heredity.[1] Other
related factors are pregnancy, obesity, menopause, aging, prolonged standing, leg injury and
abdominal straining. Varicose veins are bulging veins that are larger than spider veins, typically 3
mm or more in diameter.[2] Varicose veins are distinguished from reticular veins (blue veins) and
telangiectasias (spider veins) which also involve valvular insufficiency,[3] by the size and location of
the veins.
Natural History, Complications and Prognosis
These often occur in people who are involved in work requiring prolonged periods of standing. The
high pressure that builds up during those periods cause the veins to become tortuous and their
valves to fail. With time, these varicosities can enlarge and cause swelling as well as pain of legs at
the end of the day. Eventually, these can become associated with superficial ulcers which can bleed
and/or get infected. Stagnation of the venous blood in these veins can also lead to formation of
blood clots.
Serious complications are rare but severe varicosities can lead to major complications such as
thrombophlebitis, venous ulcers & clotting of blood[4], due to the poor circulation through the
affected limb.

Besides cosmetic problems, varicose veins are often tortuous and painful, especially when standing
or walking. They often itch, and scratching them can cause ulcers.
Treatment
Medical Therapy
Non-surgical treatments include sclerotherapy, elastic stockings, elevating the legs, and exercise.
The traditional surgical treatment has been vein stripping to remove the affected veins. Newer
surgical treatments are less invasive (see radiofrequency ablation) and are slowly replacing
traditional surgical treatments. Since most of the blood in the legs is returned by the deep veins,
and the superficial veins only return about 10%, they can be removed or ablated without serious
harm.[5]
Surgery
Several techniques have been performed for over a century, from the more invasive named
"saphenous stripping" up to mini invasives like superficial phlectomies and CHIVA cure.
