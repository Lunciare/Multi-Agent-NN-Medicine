Holter monitor
Template:Infobox laboratory equipment
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)

In addition to wearing the device, most patients are asked to keep a diary of activities such as
running and sleeping, symptoms, and times that their symptoms occur. This information is used
by doctors and technicians to rapidly pinpoint problem areas in the vast amount of data recorded
during the monitoring period.
