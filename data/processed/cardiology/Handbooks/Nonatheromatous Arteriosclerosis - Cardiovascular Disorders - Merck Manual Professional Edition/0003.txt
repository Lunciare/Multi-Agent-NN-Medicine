radiograph and CT, while the medial location of calcification can be confirmed on intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography. While this disorder does not generally cause direct clinical symptoms, it is clinically important because the reduced compressibility of the arteries can result in false elevation of blood pressure readings.

There are 2 variants of nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis: arteriolosclerosis and Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis. Diabetes, hypertension, and age are risk factors for the development of nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis.
