Nonatheromatous Arteriosclerosis

control of typical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (1). Arteriolosclerosis Arteriolosclerosis affects distal arteries and commonly occurs in patients with diabetes or hypertension (2). There are 2 histologically distinct forms (3): Hyaline arteriolosclerosis affects small arteries and arterioles in patients with diabetes. It is characterized by hyaline thickening of the arteriolar wall, which degenerates and narrows the lumen, leading to diffuse ischemia, most notably in the kidneys. Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is characterized by laminated, concentric thickening and luminal narrowing. It may also involve fibrinoid deposits and necrosis of the vessel wall (necrotizing arteriolitis). Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis (also known as medial arterial calcification, Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis, or medial calcific sclerosis) typically affects patients in middle age and older (4). This age-related degeneration of the arterial media is characterized by focal calcification. The affected arterial segments may become rigid, forming calcified tubes without luminal narrowing. The diagnosis may be suggested by an elevated ankle-brachial index (though this finding is not reliable) and be visible on plain radiograph and CT, while the medial location of calcification can be confirmed on intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography. While this disorder does not generally cause direct clinical symptoms, it
