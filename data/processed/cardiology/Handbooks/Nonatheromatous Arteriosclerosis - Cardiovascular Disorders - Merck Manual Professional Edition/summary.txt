Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis is age-related loss of elasticity due to fibrosis or calcification in the aorta and its major branches. No specific treatment is available. Arteriosclerosis is a general term for several disorders that cause thickening and loss of elasticity in the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is discussed separately. Nonatheromatous forms of arteriosclerosis include: Arteriolosclerosis Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis causes intimal thickening and weakens and disrupts the elastic lamellae. The smooth muscle layer (media) atrophies, and the lumen of the affected artery widens (becomes ectatic), predisposing to aneurysm or dissection.
