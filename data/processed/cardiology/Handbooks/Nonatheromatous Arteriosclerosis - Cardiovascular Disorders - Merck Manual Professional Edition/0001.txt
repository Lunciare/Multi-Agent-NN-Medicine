Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis is age-related loss of elasticity due to fibrosis or calcification in the aorta and its major branches. No specific treatment is available. Arteriosclerosis is a general term for several disorders that cause thickening and loss of elasticity in the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is discussed separately. Nonatheromatous forms of arteriosclerosis include: Arteriolosclerosis Mönckeberg medial calcific sclerosis Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis causes intimal thickening and weakens and disrupts the elastic lamellae. The smooth muscle layer (media) atrophies, and the lumen of the affected artery widens (becomes ectatic), predisposing to aneurysm or dissection. Conditions associated with arteriosclerosis include older age, hypertension, diabetes, vitamin D deficiency or excess, and some genetic conditions (1). Intimal injury, ectasia, and ulceration may lead to thrombosis, embolism, or complete arterial occlusion. Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis is usually asymptomatic until complications, such as aneurysms, develop. It may be incidentally detected during imaging tests performed for unrelated reasons. Arteriolosclerosis increases arteriolar rigidity and peripheral resistance, which may contribute to the maintenance of hypertension. There is no treatment for nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis beyond the control of typical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (1). Arteriolosclerosis Arteriolosclerosis affects distal arteries and commonly occurs in patients with diabetes or hypertension (2). There are 2
