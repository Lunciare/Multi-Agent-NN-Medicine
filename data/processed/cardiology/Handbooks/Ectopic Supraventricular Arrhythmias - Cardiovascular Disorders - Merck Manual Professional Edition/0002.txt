Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

conducted and are usually followed by a noncompensatory pause (1). Aberrantly conducted APBs (usually with right bundle branch block morphology) must be distinguished from premature beats of ventricular origin. Occasional APBs in apparently healthy people are generally considered benign, and nearly everyone has some. Frequent APBs have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of stroke, of all-cause mortality, of cardiovascular mortality, and atrial fibrillation (2, 3). It is not known if these associations are the consequence of APBs, of unidentified structural heart disorders, of unidentified atrial fibrillation, or simply that they all share the same risk factors (such as aging). Atrial escape beats are ectopic atrial beats that emerge after long sinus pauses or sinus arrest. They may be single or multiple; escape beats from a single focus may produce a continuous rhythm (called ectopic or escape atrial rhythm). Heart rate is typically 40 to 60 beats/minute, P wave morphology is typically different, and PR interval is slightly shorter than in sinus rhythm. Accelerated atrial rhythm (also 2/6 called a nonsinus atrial rhythm) may occur at a rate higher than the sinus rate due to either enhanced normal automaticity or abnormal automaticity. Accelerated atrial rhythm is distinguished
