Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

2/6 called a nonsinus atrial rhythm) may occur at a rate higher than the sinus rate due to either enhanced normal automaticity or abnormal automaticity. Accelerated atrial rhythm is distinguished from atrial tachycardia by being slower with an arbitrary rate cut-off (usually 100 or 120 beats/minute). Junctional escape beats are ectopic beats that emerge after long sinus pauses or sinus arrest when not terminated by an atrial escape beat. The "junction" includes the atrioventricular (AV) node, His bundle, and adjacent atrial tissue that produce escape beats that cannot be more specifically localized by the ECG. They may be single or multiple; escape beats from a single junctional focus may produce a continuous rhythm (called ectopic or escape junctional rhythm). Heart rate is typically slow (35 to 50 beats/minute), P wave morphology typically shows low to high atrial activation (negative P waves in leads II, III, aVF), and P waves are located immediately before (< 0.1 second), during (thus hidden), or immediately after (< 0.1 second) the QRS complex. Focal atrial tachycardia Focal atrial tachycardia is a regular rhythm caused by consistent, rapid atrial activation from a single atrial focus. Heart rate is usually 150 to 200 beats/minute; however, with a
