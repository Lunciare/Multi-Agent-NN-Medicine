Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

by underlying cardiac disease such as coronary artery disease, and electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia. Treatment is 4/6 directed at the underlying disorder. When therapy directed at the arrhythmia is required, the most effective agents are IV magnesium, IV verapamil, and a beta-blocker (5). Treatment with digoxin, class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, or cardioversion is usually ineffective (5). Wandering atrial pacemaker Wandering atrial pacemaker (multifocal atrial rhythm) is an irregularly irregular rhythm caused by the random discharge of multiple ectopic atrial foci. By definition, heart rate is ≤ 100 beats/minute. Except for the rate, features are the same as those of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Treatment is directed at causes, which tend to be the same as the causes of atrial premature beats. Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia is caused by abnormal automaticity in the AV node or adjacent tissue, which typically follows open heart surgery, acute inferior myocardial infarction, myocarditis, or digitalis toxicity. Heart rate is 60 to 120 beats/minute; thus, symptoms are usually absent. ECG shows regular, normal-appearing QRS complexes without identifiable P waves or with retrograde P waves (inverted in the inferior leads) that occur shortly before (< 0.1 second) or after the QRS complex.
