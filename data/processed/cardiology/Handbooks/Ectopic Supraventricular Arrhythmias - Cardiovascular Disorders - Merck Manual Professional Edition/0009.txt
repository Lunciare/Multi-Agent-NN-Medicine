Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

rate is slower, in the range of 120 to 200 beats/minute. Antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy may be successful with amiodarone, flecainide, ivabradine, procainamide, propranolol, or verapamil (5). Transcatheter ablation is less successful than in other supraventricular tachycardias and has a higher risk of inadvertent creation of AV block.
