Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias
KEYWORDS: atrial, tachycardia, beats, rate, atrial tachycardia, rhythm, heart, sinus, usually, waves, beats minute, minute, premature, focal, focal atrial

Various rhythms result from supraventricular foci (usually in the atria). Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Many are asymptomatic and require no treatment. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) Ectopic supraventricular rhythms include Atrial premature beats Atrial tachycardia Multifocal atrial tachycardia Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia Wandering atrial pacemaker Atrial premature beats Atrial premature beats (APB), or premature atrial contractions (PAC), are common episodic impulses. They may occur in normal hearts with or without precipitating factors (eg, caffeine, alcohol, pseudoephedrine) or may be a sign of a cardiopulmonary disorder. They are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
