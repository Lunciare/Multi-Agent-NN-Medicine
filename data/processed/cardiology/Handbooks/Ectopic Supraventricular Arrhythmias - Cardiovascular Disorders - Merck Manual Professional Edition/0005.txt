Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

from an abnormal automatic focus or micro-reentry. P waves precede the QRS complexes; it is often a long RP interval tachycardia (PR < RP) but may be a short RP tachycardia (PR > RP) if atrioventricular nodal conduction is slow. Vagal maneuvers may be used to slow the heart rate, allowing visualization of P waves when they are hidden, but these maneuvers do not usually terminate the arrhythmia (because the AV node is not an obligate part of the arrhythmia circuit). Acute treatment begins with IV adenosine, which may terminate atrial tachycardias due to adenosine- sensitive delayed after depolarizations (DAD) that result from intracellular calcium overload (one form of triggered activity) or reveal the mechanism by producing AV block without termination of the tachycardia. Acute treatment includes discontinuing digoxin therapy when this is the cause. The ventricular response rate may be slowed with an IV beta-blocker,IV verapamil, or IV diltiazem (5), although this is often unsuccessful. The atrial arrhythmia may be terminated by IV procainamide, IV flecainide, or IV amiodarone. An episode may also be terminated by direct current cardioversion. Pharmacologic approaches to prevention of focal atrial tachycardia include beta-blockers, non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and/or antiarrhythmic medications in class
