Various rhythms result from supraventricular foci (usually in the atria). Diagnosis is by electrocardiography. Many are asymptomatic and require no treatment. (See also Overview of Arrhythmias.) Ectopic supraventricular rhythms include Atrial premature beats Atrial tachycardia Multifocal atrial tachycardia Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia Wandering atrial pacemaker Atrial premature beats Atrial premature beats (APB), or premature atrial contractions (PAC), are common episodic impulses. They may occur in normal hearts with or without precipitating factors (eg, caffeine, alcohol, pseudoephedrine) or may be a sign of a cardiopulmonary disorder. They are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They occasionally cause palpitations. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography (ECG—see figure Atrial Premature Beat). Atrial Premature Beat (APB) In lead II, after the second beat of sinus origin, the T wave is deformed by an APB. Because the APB occurs relatively early during the sinus cycle, the sinus node pacemaker is reset, and a pause—less than fully compensatory—precedes the next sinus beat. Sinus Rhythm With Atrial Premature Beats (Arrows) APBs may be normally, aberrantly, or not conducted and are usually followed by a noncompensatory pause (1). Aberrantly conducted APBs (usually with right bundle branch block morphology) must be distinguished from premature beats of ventricular origin. Occasional
