Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

normal-appearing QRS complexes without identifiable P waves or with retrograde P waves (inverted in the inferior leads) that occur shortly before (< 0.1 second) or after the QRS complex. The rhythm is distinguished from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by the lower heart rate and gradual onset and offset. Treatment is directed at the underlying heart disorder. Junctional ectopic tachycardia Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a rare (< 1%) supraventricular tachycardia that is caused by enhanced automaticity, abnormal automaticity, or triggered activity in the AV node, His bundle, or adjacent atrial tissue; the automaticity may be congenital (occurring in utero or in the first 6 months of life), postoperative (in children after heart surgery that includes surgery near the junction), or in adults with myocardial ischemia or digoxin-intoxication (6). Heart rate is 200 to 250 beats/minute in children; thus, a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure may result. JET is distinguished from nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia by the faster rate and the sudden onset-sudden/offset character of JET. JET is rare in adults, and the rate is slower, in the range of 120 to 200 beats/minute. Antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy may be successful with amiodarone, flecainide, ivabradine, procainamide, propranolol, or verapamil (5). Transcatheter ablation is less successful
