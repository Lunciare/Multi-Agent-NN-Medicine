Ectopic Supraventricular Arrhythmias

tachycardia Focal atrial tachycardia is a regular rhythm caused by consistent, rapid atrial activation from a single atrial focus. Heart rate is usually 150 to 200 beats/minute; however, with a very rapid atrial rate, nodal dysfunction, and/or digitalis toxicity, AV block may be present, and ventricular rate may be slower. Mechanisms include abnormal automaticity, triggered activity, and micro-reentry. Focal atrial tachycardia is the least common (5 to 10%) form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (4) and usually occurs in patients with a structural heart disorder. Other causes include atrial irritation (eg, pericarditis), medications (eg, digoxin), alcohol, and toxic gas inhalation. Symptoms are those of other tachycardias (eg, light-headedness, dizziness, palpitations, and rarely syncope). When focal atrial tachycardia is incessant, it may lead to a tachycardic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Diagnosis is by electrocardiography (ECG); P waves, which differ in morphology from normal sinus P waves, precede QRS complexes but may be hidden within the preceding T wave (see figure Focal Atrial Tachycardia). 3/6 Focal Atrial Tachycardia This narrow QRS tachycardia arises from an abnormal automatic focus or micro-reentry. P waves precede the QRS complexes; it is often a long RP interval tachycardia (PR < RP) but may be a short RP
