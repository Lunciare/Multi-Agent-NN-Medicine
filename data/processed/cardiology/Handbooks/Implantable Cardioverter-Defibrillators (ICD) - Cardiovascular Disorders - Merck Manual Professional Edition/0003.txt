Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD)

Opinion Supports) Hemodynamically unstable VT or VF when there is no transient or reversible cause 2/8 Class of Evidence* Specific Indications Hemodynamically stable sustained VT in patients with a structural heart disorder Syncope of undetermined origin with sustained monomorphic VT induced during an electrophysiologic study Ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class II or class III heart failure symptoms during optimal medical therapy, and LV ejection fraction ≤ 0.35 measured at least 40 days post-MI and at least 90 days post- revascularization Ischemic cardiomyopathy, NYHA class I heart failure symptoms during optimal medical therapy, and LV ejection fraction ≤ 30% measured at least 40 days post-MI and at least 90 days post- revascularization Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class II or class III heart failure symptoms during optimal medical therapy, and LV ejection fraction ≤ 0.35 Ischemic cardiomyopathy, nonsustained VT, LV ejection fraction ≤ 40% measured at least 40 days post-MI, and inducible VF or sustained VT detected during an electrophysiologic study Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with sustained VT, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or severe right or left ventricular systolic dysfunction Long QT syndrome with documented VT or symptoms suggestive thereof while receiving beta-blocker therapy Short QT interval with sustained VT, or cardiac arrest
