Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD)

Radiograph of a Patient with a Biventricular (bi-V) Implantabl... Impulse generators for ICDs typically last 5 to 7 years. Indications for ICDs ICDs are the preferred treatment for patients who have had An episode of VF or hemodynamically significant VT not due to reversible or transient conditions (eg, electrolyte disturbance, antiarrhythmic drug proarrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction) ICDs may also be indicated for patients with VT or VF inducible during an electrophysiologic study and for patients with idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 35%, and a high risk of VT or VF. Other indications (see table Indications for Implantable Cardioverter- Defibrillators) are less clear. Because ICDs treat rather than prevent VT or VF, patients prone to these arrhythmias may require both an ICD and antiarrhythmic drugs to reduce the number of episodes and need for uncomfortable shocks; this approach also prolongs the life of the ICD.
