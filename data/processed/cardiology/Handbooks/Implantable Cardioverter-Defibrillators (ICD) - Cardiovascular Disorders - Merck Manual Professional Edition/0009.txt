Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD)

such as lead or impulse generator migration, undersensing, an increase in pacing threshold due to fibrosis at the site of prior shocks, and battery depletion. When an ICD discharges For patients who report that the ICD has discharged but do not have associated symptoms of syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, or persistent palpitations, a follow-up with the ICD clinic and/or the electrophysiologist should be arranged as soon as feasible. The ICD can be electronically interrogated to determine the reason for discharge. If such associated symptoms were present, or the patient received multiple shocks, urgent referral is indicated to look for a treatable cause (eg, coronary ischemia, electrolyte abnormality) or device malfunction.
