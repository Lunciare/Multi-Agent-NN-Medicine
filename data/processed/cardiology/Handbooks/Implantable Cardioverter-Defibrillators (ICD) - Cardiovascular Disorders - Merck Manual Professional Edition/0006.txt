extensive late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ARVC without sustained VT/VF or severe right or left ventricular systolic dysfunction but with fewer other risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (Towbin et al) Class III (Not Indicated or Harmful) Syncope of unknown etiology in absence of inducible VT or VF and without a structural heart disorder Incessant VT or VF VT or VF with mechanisms amenable to catheter or surgical ablation 5/8 Class of Evidence* Specific Indications VT or VF due to transient or reversible disorders when correction is feasible and likely to prevent recurrence Psychiatric disorders that may worsen with ICD implantation or that preclude follow-up Patients with no reasonable expectation of survival with an acceptable functional status for ≥ 1 year Patients with NYHA class IV medication- refractory heart failure symptoms who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation or a CRT ICD 6/8 * Class I: Conditions for which there is evidence for and/or general agreement that the procedure or treatment is useful and effective Class IIa: The weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment Class IIb: Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence or opinion Class III: Conditions for which there
