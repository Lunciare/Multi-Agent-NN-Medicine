ARVC without sustained VT/VF or severe right or left ventricular systolic dysfunction but with prior syncope or with multiple other risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (Towbin JA et al) NYHA class IV heart failure in nonhospitalized patients awaiting cardiac transplantation 4/8 Class of Evidence* Specific Indications Cardiac sarcoidosis with LV ejection fraction > 35% who have ≥ 1 of the following: unexplained syncope, significant myocardial scar visible on cardiac MRI or PET scan, inducible sustained VT or VF, or an independent indication for a permanent pacemaker Giant cell myocarditis with VF or unstable VT during optimal medical therapy Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class I heart failure symptoms during optimal medical therapy, LV ejection fraction ≤ 0.35 Long QT syndrome with no symptoms but a QTc > 0.50 second during beta- blocker therapy Syncope and an advanced structural heart disorder if invasive and Class IIb (Less Well Supported by noninvasive investigations have not Evidence or Opinion) identified a cause HCM without the risk factors listed above but with nonsustained VT or extensive late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ARVC without sustained VT/VF or severe right or left ventricular systolic dysfunction but with fewer other risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias
