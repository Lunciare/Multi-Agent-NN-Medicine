weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment Class IIb: Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence or opinion Class III: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that the procedure or treatment is not useful/effective and in some cases may be harmful Data on classes of evidence from Jacobs AK, Kushner FG, Ettinger SM, et al.
