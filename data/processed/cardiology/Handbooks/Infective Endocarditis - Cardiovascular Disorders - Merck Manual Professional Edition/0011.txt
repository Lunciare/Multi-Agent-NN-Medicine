Infective Endocarditis

white blood cell count, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased immunoglobulin levels, and the presence of circulating immune complexes and rheumatoid factor, but these findings are not diagnostically helpful. Urinalysis often shows microscopic hematuria and, occasionally, red blood cell casts, pyuria, or bacteriuria. Identification of organisms Identification of the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibility is vital to guide treatment. If endocarditis is suspected, at least 2 (ideally 3) sets of blood cultures should be obtained under strict aseptic technique, with one aerobic and one anaerobic culture in each set. Samples should contain 8 to10 mL of blood per bottle and, ideally, are obtained > 6 hours apart (if presentation suggests acute bacterial endocarditis, 2 culture samples are obtained within the first 1 to 2 hours). Each set of cultures should be obtained from a separate, fresh venipuncture site (ie, not from preexisting vascular catheters). Blood cultures do not need to be restricted to times during chills or fever because most patients have continuous bacteremia. When endocarditis is present and no prior antibiotic therapy was given, at least one culture is positive in 90% of patients if more than 2 peripheral blood samples were taken at different times, ideally more than 6
