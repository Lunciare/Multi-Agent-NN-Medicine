Infective Endocarditis

and subsequent endocarditis are also recommended (1). Endocarditis prophylaxis during implantation of prosthetic devices has changed to accommodate the rise in endocarditis due to enterococci. Prophylaxis often involves the addition of vancomycin or use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid instead of a cephalosporin (2). Dental and cutaneous hygiene is recommended for the general population but particularly for patients at intermediate risk (those with native valve disease) and high risk. Patients at high risk The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients at high risk of an adverse outcome as a result of infective endocarditis (3). Such patients include those with Prosthetic heart valves, including transcatheter implanted prostheses Prosthetic material used for heart valve repair (eg, annuloplasty rings, chords) Previous infective endocarditis 22/26 Certain congenital heart diseases (CHD): Unrepaired cyanotic CHD (including palliative shunts and conduits), completely repaired CHD during the first 6 months after surgery if prosthetic material or device was used, repaired CHD that has residual defects at or adjacent to the site of repair Heart transplant recipients with valvulopathy Procedures requiring antibiotic prophylaxis Most procedures for which prophylaxis is required for patients at high risk are oral-dental procedures that manipulate the gingiva or the periapical region of teeth
