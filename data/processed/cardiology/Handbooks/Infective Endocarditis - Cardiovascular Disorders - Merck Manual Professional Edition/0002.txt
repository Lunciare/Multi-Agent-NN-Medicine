Infective Endocarditis

with prosthetic heart valves and other intracardiac devices are at highest risk. There is also an increased risk in patients with indwelling intravascular catheters. The normal heart is relatively resistant to infection. Bacteria and fungi do not easily adhere to the endocardial surface, and constant blood flow helps prevent them from settling on endocardial structures. Thus, 2 factors are typically required for endocarditis: A predisposing abnormality of the endocardium Microorganisms in the bloodstream (eg, bacteremia) Massive bacteremia or particularly virulent microorganisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) cause endocarditis on normal valves. Endocardial factors Endocarditis usually involves the heart valves. Major predisposing factors are congenital heart defects, rheumatic valvular disease, bicuspid aortic valves, calcific aortic valves, mitral valve prolapse, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and prior endocarditis. Prosthetic valves and other intracardiac devices are a particular risk. Occasionally, mural thrombi, ventricular septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus sites become infected. The nidus for infection is usually a sterile fibrin-platelet vegetation formed when damaged endothelial cells release tissue factor. Infective endocarditis occurs most often on the left side (eg, mitral or aortic valve). Approximately 5 to 10% of cases are right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic valve) (1). Patients who use intravenous drugs have a much higher incidence of
