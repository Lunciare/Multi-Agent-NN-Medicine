Infective Endocarditis

valvulopathy Procedures requiring antibiotic prophylaxis Most procedures for which prophylaxis is required for patients at high risk are oral-dental procedures that manipulate the gingiva or the periapical region of teeth or perforate the oral mucosa (see table Procedures Requiring Antimicrobial Endocarditis Prophylaxis). Other procedures include Respiratory tract procedures in which mucosa is incised Vaginal or cesarean delivery in selected patients at high risk (patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair and for patients with unrepaired and palliated cyanotic congenital heart disease) Gastrointestinal procedures that involve an area with an established infection Genitourinary procedures that involve an area with an established infection Musculoskeletal procedures that involve an area with an established infection Recognition that other non-dental procedures may cause endocarditis may result in expansion of this list in future guidelines (4, 5). TABLE Procedures Requiring Antimicrobial Endocarditis Prophylaxis in Patients at High Risk for Endocarditis Type Examples Dental extraction Dental implant placement or reimplantation of avulsed teeth Periodontal procedures, including surgery, scaling, root planing, and Oral-dental* probing Prophylactic cleaning of teeth or implants when bleeding is anticipated Root canal instrumentation or surgery beyond the apex Respiratory tract Bronchoscopy if mucosa is to be incised
