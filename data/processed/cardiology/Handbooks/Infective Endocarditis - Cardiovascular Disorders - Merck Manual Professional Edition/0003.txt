side (eg, mitral or aortic valve). Approximately 5 to 10% of cases are right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic valve) (1). Patients who use intravenous drugs have a much higher incidence of right-sided endocarditis. Microorganisms Microorganisms that infect the endocardium may originate from distant infected sites (eg, cutaneous abscess, inflamed or infected gums, urinary tract infection) or have obvious portals of entry such as a central venous catheter or a drug injection site. Almost any implanted foreign material (eg, ventricular or peritoneal shunt, prosthetic device) is at risk of bacterial colonization, thus becoming a source of 2/26 bacteremia and hence endocarditis. Endocarditis also may result from asymptomatic bacteremia, such as typically occurs during invasive dental, medical, or surgical procedures. Even toothbrushing and chewing can cause bacteremia (usually due to viridans streptococci) in patients with gingivitis. Causative microorganisms vary by site of infection, source of bacteremia, and host risk factors (eg, intravenous drug use), but overall, 80 to 90% of cases are caused by Streptococci, or Staphylococcus aureus Most of the rest of endocarditis cases are caused by Enterococci Gram-negative bacilli HACEK organisms (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) Fungi However, the incidence of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis
