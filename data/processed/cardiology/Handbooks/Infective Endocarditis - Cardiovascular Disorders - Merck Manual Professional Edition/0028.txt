Infective Endocarditis

lack of therapeutic response), then valve repair is preferred over replacement to avoid future prosthetic valve infection due to any continued IV drug use. Prophylactic placement of an epicardial pacing lead is recommended at time of tricuspid valve surgery (5). Prophylactic placement avoids any future need for an endovascular pacing lead to traverse the (native or prosthetic) tricuspid valve and potentially cause tricuspid regurgitation. Surgery is usually delayed for a month after intracranial hemorrhage or major ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation Patients taking anticoagulants are at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke and for bleeding resulting from urgent invasive procedures. Anticoagulation should be withheld in patients with cerebral emboli, because it increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. The decision to withhold anticoagulation in other patients should be based on the relative risks of hemorrhagic stroke and thromboembolism (6). Response to treatment After starting therapy, patients with penicillin-susceptible streptococcal endocarditis usually feel better, and fever is reduced within 3 to 7 days. Fever may continue for reasons other than persistent infection (eg, medication allergy, phlebitis, infarction due to emboli). Patients with staphylococcal endocarditis tend to respond more slowly. Diminution of vegetation size can be followed by serial echocardiography. Echocardiography should be done at the
