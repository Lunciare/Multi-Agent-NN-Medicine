Advice from a consultant familiar with these patterns is imperative. † Based on ideal rather than actual weight in patients with obesity. ‡ With vancomycin, serum levels must be monitored if doses > 2 g/24 hours are administered. § HACEK microorganisms: Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. MIC = minimum inhibitory concentration; NVE = native valve endocarditis; PVE = prosthetic valve endocarditis.

Circulation 132 (15):1435– 1486, 2015. doi: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000296 Pearls & Pitfalls If endocarditis is suspected, withhold antibiotics until adequate blood cultures (minimally 2, or ideally 3, samples from different sites over 1 hour) are obtained. Native valve right-sided endocarditis can often be treated with 4 weeks of therapy or even as short as 2 weeks for certain typical pathogens (eg,methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) if combination therapy with gentamicin is used.
