Infective Endocarditis

with abnormal metabolic activity involving a native or prosthetic valve (at least 3 months after valve implantation), ascending aortic graft (with concomitant evidence of valve involvement), intracardiac device leads, or other prosthetic material Surgical: Evidence of infective endocarditis observed on direct inspection during cardiac surgery. Minor criteria Predisposition: , Previous history of infective endocarditis, Prosthetic valve Previous valve repair Congenital heart disease More than mild regurgitation or stenosis of any etiology Endovascular intracardiac implantable electronic device Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Injection drug use Fever ≥ 38.0° C (≥ 100.4°F) Vascular phenomena (confirmed by clinical or imaging evidence): Arterial embolism 12/26 Septic pulmonary infarction Abscess of the cerebrum or spleen Mycotic aneurysm Intracranial hemorrhage Conjunctival hemorrhage Janeway lesions Purulent purpura Immunologic phenomena: Immune complex glomerulonephritis Osler nodes Roth spots Rheumatoid factor Microbiologic evidence of infection consistent with but not meeting major criteria: 1. Blood culture showing an organism consistent with infective endocarditis OR 2. Positive culture, PCR, or other nucleic acid–based test for an organism consistent with infective endocarditis from a sterile body site other than cardiac tissue, cardiac prosthesis, or arterial embolus; or a single finding of a skin bacterium by PCR on a valve or wire without additional clinical or
