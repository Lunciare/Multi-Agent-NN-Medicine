Infective Endocarditis

with small white centers (Roth spots). Cutaneous manifestations include petechiae (on the upper trunk, conjunctivae, mucous membranes, and distal extremities), painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules on or near the tips of digits (Osler nodes), nontender hemorrhagic macules or papules on the palms or soles (Janeway lesions), and splinter hemorrhages under the nails. About 35% of patients have central nervous system (CNS) effects, including transient ischemic attacks, stroke, toxic encephalopathy (due to infective microemboli), and, if a mycotic CNS aneurysm ruptures, brain abscess and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Renal emboli may cause flank pain and, rarely, gross hematuria. Splenic emboli may cause left upper quadrant pain. Prolonged infection may cause splenomegaly or clubbing of fingers and toes. Cutaneous Manifestations of Infective Endocarditis 5/26 Infective Endocarditis (Osler Nodes) This patient with infective endocarditis has multiple Osler nodes (tender, erythematous nodules on the toes). Infective Endocarditis (Janeway Lesions) This patient with infective endocarditis has multiple Janeway lesions (nontender, erythematous papules) on the palms. The patient also has some Osler nodes (tender, erythematous nodules on the fingers).
