Infective Endocarditis

Criteria for Infective Endocarditis: Updating the Modified Duke Criteria [published correction appears in Clin Clinical Criteria for Infective Endocarditis According to the 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease Major criteria Microbiology: 1. Two or more positive separate sets of blood cultures for organisms typical of endocarditis OR Three or more positive separate sets of blood cultures for organisms that rarely or occasionally cause endocarditis 2. PCR or other nucleic acid technique that identifies Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella species, or Tropheryma whipplei from blood OR Serologic evidence of Coxiella burnetii (IgG titer > 1:800) or 1 positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii OR Indirect immunofluorescence assays for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana (IgG titer> 1:800) Imaging (eg, echocardiographic, CT, [18F]-FDG-PET/CT(A): 1. Echocardiography and/or cardiac CT showing vegetation, valvular/leaflet perforation/aneurysm, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, or intracardiac fistula OR Echocardiography showing significant new valvular regurgitation. Worsening or changing of preexisting regurgitation is not sufficient. OR New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve (compared with previous imaging) 2. [18F]-FDG-PET/CT imaging with abnormal metabolic activity involving a native or prosthetic valve (at least 3 months after valve implantation), ascending aortic graft (with concomitant evidence of valve involvement), intracardiac device leads, or
