Infective Endocarditis

body site other than cardiac tissue, cardiac prosthesis, or arterial embolus; or a single finding of a skin bacterium by PCR on a valve or wire without additional clinical or microbiological supporting evidence Imaging criteria: [18F]-FDG-PET/CT imaging with abnormal metabolic activity involving a native or prosthetic valve (within 3 months after valve implantation), ascending aortic graft (with concomitant evidence of valve involvement), intracardiac device leads, or other prosthetic material Physical examination criteria: If echocardiography is not available, auscultatory evidence of new valvular regurgitation. Worsening or changing of preexisting regurgitation is not sufficient. International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases Criteria for Infective Endocarditis: Updating the Modified Duke Criteria [published correction appears in Clin Infect Dis 2023 Oct 13;77(8):1222]. Clin Infect Dis 77(4):518–526, 2023. Treatment of Infective Endocarditis IV antibiotics (based on the organism and its susceptibility) Sometimes valve debridement, repair, or replacement Dental evaluation and treatment (to minimize oral sources of bacteremia) Removal of potential source of bacteremia (eg, internal catheters, devices) Withholding anticoagulation in patients with cerebral embolism Treatment consists of a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy (1). Surgery may be needed for mechanical complications or resistant organisms. Typically, antimicrobials are given IV. Because they 14/26 must be given for
