phlebitis, infarction due to emboli). Patients with staphylococcal endocarditis tend to respond more slowly. Diminution of vegetation size can be followed by serial echocardiography. Echocardiography should be done at the completion of therapy to establish a new baseline for valvular appearance (including sterile vegetations) and insufficiency. Relapse usually occurs within 4 weeks. Antibiotic retreatment may be effective, but surgery may also be required. In patients without prosthetic valves, recrudescence of endocarditis after 6 weeks usually results from a new infection rather than a relapse. Even after successful antimicrobial therapy, sterile 20/26 emboli and valve rupture may occur up to 1 year later. Risk of recurrence is significant, so ongoing life- long dental and cutaneous hygiene is advised. Patients who require antibiotic therapy for any reason should have at least 3 sets of blood cultures drawn before antibiotics are started. Prognosis for Infective Endocarditis Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate for endocarditis is 15 to 20%, with a 1-year mortality rate approaching 40% (1). Untreated, infective endocarditis is always fatal. Even with treatment, death is more likely and the prognosis is generally poorer for older patients and patients who have Infection with resistant organisms An underlying disorder A long delay in treatment
