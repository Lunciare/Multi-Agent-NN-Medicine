procedures, a single dose shortly before the procedure is effective. For oral- dental and respiratory procedures, a medication effective against viridans group streptococci is used (see table Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures). For vaginal delivery, give ampicillin 2 g IV or IM plus gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 120 mg) IV administered within 30 minutes before delivery, followed by ampicillin 1 g IV or IM (or amoxicillin 1 g [as the trihydrate] orally) 6 hours later. For gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal procedures on areas involving infected tissue, antibiotics should be selected based on the known organism and its sensitivities. If infection is present but the infecting organism has not been identified, antibiotics for gastrointestinal and genitourinary prophylaxis should be effective against enterococci (eg, amoxicillin or ampicillin, or vancomycin for patients who are allergic to penicillin). Antibiotics for skin and musculoskeletal prophylaxis should be effective against staphylococci and beta- hemolytic streptococci (eg, a cephalosporin or vancomycin or clindamycin if infection with methicillin- resistant staphylococci is possible). Guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis vary geographically. 24/26 Additional information regarding prophylactic regimens is provided by guidelines from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology (3, 4).
