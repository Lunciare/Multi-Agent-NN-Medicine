antibiotic therapy was given, at least one culture is positive in 90% of patients if more than 2 peripheral blood samples were taken at different times, ideally more than 6 hours apart (1). Premature use of empiric antibiotic therapy should be avoided in patients with acquired or congenital valvular or shunt lesions to avoid inability to isolate causative organisms (culture-negative) endocarditis (2). If prior antimicrobial therapy was given, blood cultures should still be obtained, but results may be negative. Blood cultures may require 3 to 4 weeks of incubation for certain organisms; however, automated culture monitoring systems available in most clinical laboratories can identify positive cultures within a week. Other organisms (eg, Aspergillus) may not produce positive cultures. Some organisms (eg, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella species, Chlamydia psittaci, Brucella species) require serodiagnosis; others (eg, Legionella pneumophila) require special culture media or polymerase chain reaction (eg, Tropheryma whippelii). Metagenomic sequencing testing (cell-free DNA testing) may be helpful in selected cases when no pathogen is detected by culture or PCR testing (2). Negative blood culture results may indicate suppression due to Prior antimicrobial therapy Infection with organisms that do not grow in standard culture media Another diagnosis (eg, noninfective endocarditis, atrial myxoma with
