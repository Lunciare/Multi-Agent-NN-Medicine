treatment, death is more likely and the prognosis is generally poorer for older patients and patients who have Infection with resistant organisms An underlying disorder A long delay in treatment Aortic valve or multiple valve involvement Large vegetations Polymicrobial bacteremia Prosthetic valve infections Mycotic aneurysms Valve ring abscess Major embolic events 21/26 Septic shock is more likely in patients with diabetes, acute kidney injury, S. aureus infection, vegetation size > 15 mm, or signs of persistent infection. The mortality rate for viridans streptococcal endocarditis without major complications is < 10% (2) but is greater than 90% for Aspergillus endocarditis after prosthetic valve surgery (3). The prognosis is better with right-sided than left-sided endocarditis because tricuspid valve dysfunction is tolerated better, systemic emboli are absent, and right-sided S. aureus endocarditis responds better to antimicrobial therapy. Prevention of Infective Endocarditis Preventive dental examination and therapy before surgery to repair heart valves or congenital heart lesions is recommended. Measures to reduce health care–acquired bacteremia aim to curb the rising incidence of iatrogenic bacteremia and subsequent endocarditis are also recommended (1). Endocarditis prophylaxis during implantation of prosthetic devices has changed to accommodate the rise in endocarditis due to enterococci. Prophylaxis often involves the addition
