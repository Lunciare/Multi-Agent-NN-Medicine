Infective Endocarditis

endocarditis cases are caused by Enterococci Gram-negative bacilli HACEK organisms (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) Fungi However, the incidence of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis has been increasing, and streptococcal endocarditis has been decreasing. The disease develops in 3 stages: Bacteremia: Microorganisms are present in the blood Adhesion: The microorganism adheres to abnormal or damaged endothelium via surface adhesions Colonization: Proliferation of the organism together with inflammation, leading to a mature vegetation Many of the causative microorganisms produce polysaccharide biofilms that shield them from host immune defences and impede antibiotic penetration.

Local consequences Local consequences of infective endocarditis include 3/26 Myocardial abscesses with tissue destruction and sometimes conduction system abnormalities (usually with low septal abscesses) Sudden, severe valvular regurgitation, causing heart failure and death (usually due to lesions of the mitral valve or the aortic valve) Aortitis due
