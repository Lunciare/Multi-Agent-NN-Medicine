The image on the right shows a close up of a Roth spot with central clearing. Acute bacterial endocarditis and prosthetic valvular endocarditis Symptoms and signs of acute bacterial endocarditis and prosthetic valvular endocarditis are similar to those of subacute bacterial endocarditis, but the course is more rapid. Fever (78%), cardiac murmur (65%), and congestive heart failure (27%) are the most frequent symptoms at presentation (1). Rarely, purulent meningitis occurs. Right-sided endocarditis Septic pulmonary emboli may cause cough, pleuritic chest
