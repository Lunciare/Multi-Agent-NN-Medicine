Infective Endocarditis

for culture results, empiric antibiotic therapy before organism identification may be necessary in seriously ill patients. Antibiotics should not be given until adequate blood cultures (minimally 2, but ideally 3, samples from different sites over 1 hour) have been obtained. An empiric regimen should cover typical pathogens (ie, Staphylococci and Streptococci species), take into account local resistance pattern, such as MRSA prevalence, and include an agent highly effective at killing (eg, a beta-lactam antibiotic). A typical regimen in the United States may be vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Certain risk factors for having endocarditis with a less common pathogen or having a more difficult to eradicate infection include a recently placed prosthetic valve, prolonged healthcare exposure, and critical illness. Combination therapy is commonly started in these scenarios and often includes broader spectrum of antibacterial activity and consideration of synergistic agents like aminoglycosides. As soon as possible, the empiric antimicrobial regimen should be adjusted based on culture results.
