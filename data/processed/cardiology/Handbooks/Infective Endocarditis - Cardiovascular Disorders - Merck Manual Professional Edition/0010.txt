Infective Endocarditis

cardiac murmur (65%), and congestive heart failure (27%) are the most frequent symptoms at presentation (1). Rarely, purulent meningitis occurs. Right-sided endocarditis Septic pulmonary emboli may cause cough, pleuritic chest pain, and sometimes hemoptysis. A murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is typical. Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis Blood cultures or serologic testing Echocardiography and sometimes other imaging modalities Clinical criteria Because symptoms and signs are nonspecific, vary greatly, and may develop insidiously, diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with fever and no obvious source of infection, particularly if a heart murmur is present. Suspicion of endocarditis should be very high if blood cultures are positive in patients who have a history of a heart valve disorder, who 8/26 have had certain recent invasive procedures, or who inject drugs. Patients with documented bacteremia should be examined thoroughly and repeatedly for new valvular murmurs and signs of emboli. Other than positive blood cultures, there are no specific laboratory findings. Established infections often cause a normocytic-normochromic anemia, elevated white blood cell count, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased immunoglobulin levels, and the presence of circulating immune complexes and rheumatoid factor, but these findings are not diagnostically helpful.
