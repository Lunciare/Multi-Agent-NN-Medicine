Patients with heart failure (particularly those with prosthetic, aortic, or native mitral valve endocarditis and those with pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock) Patients with uncontrolled infection (those with persistent infection, infection with fungal or resistant organisms, recurrent prosthetic valve endocarditis, or endocarditis complicated by heart block, abscess, aneurysm, fistula, or enlarging vegetation) Patients at risk for embolism (particularly those with prosthetic, aortic, or native mitral valve endocarditis, and large vegetations [defined as > 10 mm] or those with recurrent emboli). Early surgery in these patients decreases the risk of embolic events. Timing of surgery requires experienced clinical judgment. If heart failure caused by a correctable lesion is worsening (particularly when the organism is S. aureus, a gram-negative bacillus, or a fungus), surgery may be required after only 24 to 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. Endocarditis involving an implanted cardiac electronic device requires complete removal of the pacemaker or defibrillator, including all leads and the generator. Right-sided endocarditis is usually managed medically. If surgery is necessary (due to heart failure or lack of therapeutic response), then valve repair is preferred over replacement to avoid future prosthetic valve infection due to any continued IV drug use.
