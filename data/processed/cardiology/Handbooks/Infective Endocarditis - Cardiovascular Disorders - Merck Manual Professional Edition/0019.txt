Infective Endocarditis

of a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy (1). Surgery may be needed for mechanical complications or resistant organisms. Typically, antimicrobials are given IV. Because they 14/26 must be given for 2 to 8 weeks, home IV therapy is often used. Any apparent source of bacteremia must be managed: necrotic tissue debrided, abscesses drained, and foreign material and infected devices removed. Patients with infective endocarditis should be evaluated by a dentist and treated for oral diseases that could cause bacteremia and subsequent endocarditis. Existing IV catheters (particularly central venous ones) should be changed. If endocarditis persists in a patient with a newly inserted central venous catheter, that catheter should also be removed. If continuous infusions are used instead of intermittent boluses, infusions should not be interrupted for long periods. Organisms within biofilms adherent to catheters and other devices may not respond to antimicrobial therapy, leading to treatment failure or relapse. Antibiotic regimens Medications and dosages depend on the microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility. Although most patients are stable enough to wait for culture results, empiric antibiotic therapy before organism identification may be necessary in seriously ill patients. Antibiotics should not be given until adequate blood cultures (minimally 2, but ideally 3,
