Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease) without compromising specificity. It is especially useful for infection associated with implanted devices, where imaging is hampered by metallic shadowing and postoperative changes (5, 6). PET scanning also detects extracardiac infection, such as septic emboli, and is an emerging tool for the diagnosis of endocarditis originating in prosthetic and intracardiac devices. CT and PET abnormalities are included as major criteria in the Duke criteria and European guidelines (5). Routine brain imaging has been proposed because up to approximately 70% of patients have clinically silent lesions (7). Its utility for prognosis and management is yet to be defined. Diagnostic criteria Infective endocarditis is definitively diagnosed when microorganisms are seen histologically in (or cultured from) endocardial vegetations obtained during cardiac surgery, embolectomy, or autopsy. Because vegetations are not usually available for examination, there are various clinical criteria for establishing a diagnosis. These include the latest iteration of the Duke criteria (2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease Criteria) (8), which has a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 94% (9) (see tables Definitions of Infective Endocarditis and Clinical Criteria for Infective Endocarditis) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 modified criteria (5).
