blood culture results may indicate suppression due to Prior antimicrobial therapy Infection with organisms that do not grow in standard culture media Another diagnosis (eg, noninfective endocarditis, atrial myxoma with embolic phenomena, vasculitis) Imaging studies Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be done initially. It has sensitivity of 50 to 90% and specificity > 90% (3). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can reveal vegetations too small to be seen on TTE. It has sensitivity of 90 to 100% (4). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be done when 9/26 Patients have a prosthetic valve (where TTE sensitivity is limited) Transthoracic echocardiography is nondiagnostic Diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been established clinically (done to detect perforations, abscesses, and fistulas) Serial TEE enables diagnosis of complications that evolve during treatment, such as increasing vegetation size or abscess formation. CT is used as needed to fully define paravalvular abscesses and for detection of mycotic aneurysms. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning improves the sensitivity of the modified Duke criteria (see table Clinical Criteria for Infective Endocarditis According to the 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease) without compromising specificity. It is especially useful for infection associated with implanted devices, where imaging is hampered by metallic shadowing and postoperative changes (5,
