system abnormalities (usually with low septal abscesses) Sudden, severe valvular regurgitation, causing heart failure and death (usually due to lesions of the mitral valve or the aortic valve) Aortitis due to contiguous spread of infection Prosthetic valve infections are particularly likely to involve valve ring abscesses, obstructing vegetations, myocardial abscesses, and mycotic aneurysms manifested by valve obstruction, dehiscence, and conduction disturbances. Systemic consequences Systemic consequences of endocarditis are primarily due to Embolization of infected material from the heart valve Immune-mediated phenomena (primarily in chronic infection) Right-sided lesions typically produce septic pulmonary emboli, which may result in pulmonary infarction, pneumonia, or empyema. Left-sided lesions may embolize to any tissue, particularly the kidneys, spleen, and central nervous system. Mycotic aneurysms can form in any major artery. Cutaneous and retinal emboli are common. Diffuse glomerulonephritis may result from immune complex deposition. Classification of Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis may have an indolent, subacute course or a more acute, fulminant course with greater potential for rapid decompensation. Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), although aggressive, usually develops insidiously and progresses slowly (ie, over weeks to months). Often, no source of infection or portal of entry is evident. SBE is caused most commonly by streptococci (especially viridans, microaerophilic,
