Infective Endocarditis

often be treated with 4 weeks of therapy or even as short as 2 weeks for certain typical pathogens (eg,methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) if combination therapy with gentamicin is used. For left-sided endocarditis, guidelines recommend 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. However, a multicenter, randomized, non-blinded study of uncomplicated left-sided endocarditis found switching to oral antibiotics (after a minimum of 10 days of parenteral therapy) to be non-inferior to continued parenteral therapy. In addition, length of hospital stay was shortened in the patients switched to oral therapy. This approach has the potential to reduce the psychologic stress and some of the risks inherent to prolonged inpatient parenteral therapy (2). Long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotics, such as dalbavancin, have also been used successfully as part of sequential therapy for Gram positive endocarditis (3). These options may be particularly useful for patients in whom home parenteral therapy is not feasible. Cardiac valve surgery 19/26 Surgery (debridement, valve repair, or valve replacement) is sometimes required for treatment of infectious endocarditis (4). Surgery is typically indicated in Patients with heart failure (particularly those with prosthetic, aortic, or native mitral valve endocarditis and those with pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock) Patients with uncontrolled infection (those with persistent infection,
