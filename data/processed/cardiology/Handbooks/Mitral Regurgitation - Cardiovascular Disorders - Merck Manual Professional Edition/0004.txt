and cardiogenic shock or sudden cardiac death. Complications of chronic MR include gradual enlargement of the LA; LV enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy, which initially compensates for regurgitant flow (preserving forward stroke volume) but eventually decompensates (reducing forward stroke volume); atrial fibrillation, which may be further complicated by thromboembolism; and infective endocarditis. Symptoms and Signs of Mitral Regurgitation Acute mitral regurgitation causes the same symptoms and signs as acute heart failure (dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, edema) and cardiogenic shock (hypotension with resultant multisystem organ damage). Specific signs of mitral regurgitation may be absent. Chronic mitral regurgitation is initially asymptomatic. Symptoms develop insidiously as the LA enlarges, pulmonary artery pressure and venous pressure increase, and LV compensation fails. Symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue (due to heart failure), orthopnea, and palpitations (often due to atrial fibrillation). Rarely, patients present with endocarditis (eg, with fever, weight loss, embolic phenomena). Signs develop only when mitral regurgitation becomes moderate or severe (see table Grading of Mitral Regurgitation). Inspection and palpation may detect a brisk apical impulse and sustained left parasternal movement due to systolic expansion of an enlarged LA. An LV impulse that is sustained, enlarged, and displaced downward and to the left suggests LV hypertrophy and dilation.
