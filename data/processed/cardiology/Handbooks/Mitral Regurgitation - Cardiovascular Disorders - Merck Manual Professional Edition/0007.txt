Mitral Regurgitation

not specific for mitral regurgitation. ECG may show LA enlargement and LV hypertrophy with or without ischemia. Sinus rhythm is usually present when MR is acute because the atria have not had time to stretch and undergo remodeling. Chest radiograph in acute MR may show pulmonary edema; abnormalities in cardiac silhouette are not evident unless an underlying chronic disorder is also present. Chest radiograph in chronic MR may show LA and LV enlargement (see image Chest Radiograph (Prosthetic Heart Valve)). It may also show pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema with heart failure. Diagnosis of mitral regurgitation is suspected clinically and confirmed by echocardiography. Doppler echocardiography is used to detect regurgitant flow and pulmonary hypertension. Two-dimensional or 3-dimensional echocardiography is used to evaluate the leaflet morphology and motion; to determine the cause and severity of MR (see table Grading of Mitral Regurgitation), the presence and extent of annular calcification, and the size and function of the LV and LA; and to detect pulmonary hypertension. When it is acute, severe MR may not be apparent on color Doppler echocardiography, but suspicion is raised when acute heart failure is accompanied by hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
