Mitral regurgitation (MR) is incomplete closure of the mitral valve causing backflow from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium during systole. MR can be primary (common causes are mitral valve prolapse and rheumatic fever) or secondary to LV dilation or infarction. Complications include progressive heart failure, arrhythmias, and endocarditis. Symptoms and signs include palpitations, dyspnea, and a holosystolic apical murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Prognosis depends on LV function and etiology, severity, and duration of MR. Patients with mild, asymptomatic MR may be monitored, but progressive or symptomatic MR requires mitral valve repair or replacement. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation, also called mitral insufficiency, may be: Acute or chronic Primary (organic) or secondary (functional) Causes of acute mitral regurgitation include the following: Ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture Infective endocarditis with rupture of the chordae tendineae Acute rheumatic fever Myxomatous rupture of the chordae tendineae Acute dilation of the left ventricle due to myocarditis or myocardial ischemia Mechanical failure of a prosthetic mitral valve Common causes of chronic mitral regurgitation are intrinsic valve pathology including mitral valve prolapse (primary MR) or distortion of a normal valve by
