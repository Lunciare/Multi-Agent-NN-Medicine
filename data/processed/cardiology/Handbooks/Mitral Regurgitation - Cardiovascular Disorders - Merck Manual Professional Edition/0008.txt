may not be apparent on color Doppler echocardiography, but suspicion is raised when acute heart failure is accompanied by hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Mitral Regurgitation VIDEO TABLE Grading of Mitral Regurgitation Parameter Moderate MR Severe MR Vena contracta* 3–7 mm > 7 mm Effective regurgitant 2 2 0.20–0.40 cm > 0.40 cm orifice area Regurgitant volume 30–60 mL > 60 mL Regurgitant fraction 30–50% > 50% * The narrowest diameter of the fluid stream downstream of an abnormal valve orifice; it is slightly smaller than the anatomic valve orifice. MR = mitral regurgitation. If endocarditis or valvular thrombi are suspected, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide a more detailed view of the mitral valve and LA. TEE, with 3-dimensional imaging when feasible, is also indicated to evaluate the mechanism of MR in more detail when mitral valve repair instead of replacement is being considered. Cardiac catheterization is performed before surgery, mainly to determine whether coronary artery disease (CAD) is present. A prominent systolic c-v wave is seen on pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) tracings during ventricular systole. Ventriculography can be used to quantify MR. Cardiac MRI can accurately measure regurgitant fraction and determine the cause of dilated myopathy
