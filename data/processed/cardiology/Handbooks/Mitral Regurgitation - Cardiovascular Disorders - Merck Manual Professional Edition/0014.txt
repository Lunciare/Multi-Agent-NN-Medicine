than with surgical repair (5). Clinical success and outcomes depend on careful patient selection and clinical care, so most centers that offer TEER do so through a specialized multidisciplinary heart team (1, 6, 7). In some decompensated patients, prosthetic valve implantation markedly depresses ejection fraction because in such patients, ventricular function has become dependent on the afterload reduction of MR. For patients with atrial fibrillation, concomitant procedures such as ablation therapy and surgically occluding the left atrial appendage to reduce the risk of stroke may be beneficial. Anticoagulation Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin is required in patients with a mechanical valve to prevent thromboembolism. A mitral bioprosthetic valve requires anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 to 6 months postoperatively. Long-term non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants or warfarin can be considered in patients with a bioprosthetic valve and atrial fibrillation (see also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease). Prognosis for Mitral Regurgitation Prognosis of mitral regurgitation varies by duration, severity, and cause. Some MR worsens and eventually becomes severe. Once MR becomes severe, approximately 8% of asymptomatic patients become symptomatic each year thereafter. Approximately 15% of patients with chronic moderate or severe MR require surgical intervention, with surgical
