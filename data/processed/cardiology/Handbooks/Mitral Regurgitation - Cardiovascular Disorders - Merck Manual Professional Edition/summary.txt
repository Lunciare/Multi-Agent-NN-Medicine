Mitral Regurgitation
KEYWORDS: mitral, valve, regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, secondary, patients, mitral valve, left, heart, acute, atrial, repair, chronic, pulmonary, severe

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is incomplete closure of the mitral valve causing backflow from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium during systole. MR can be primary (common causes are mitral valve prolapse and rheumatic fever) or secondary to LV dilation or infarction. Complications include progressive heart failure, arrhythmias, and endocarditis. Symptoms and signs include palpitations, dyspnea, and a holosystolic apical murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Prognosis depends on LV function and etiology, severity, and duration of MR.
