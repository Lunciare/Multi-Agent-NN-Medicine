Mitral Regurgitation

replacement results in less mitral regurgitation and heart failure 2 years after treatment (4). When the mechanism of secondary MR is annular dilation due to atrial fibrillation, valve surgery may be beneficial when symptoms cannot be medically controlled. Another method of repair is transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) with a device that approximates the mitral leaflets. TEER is an option for patients with severe primary MR and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or class IV heart failure symptoms refractory to medical therapy who cannot undergo surgery. In secondary MR, given the lesser benefit of surgery, TEER is indicated even for patients whose surgical risk is not prohibitive if they have NYHA class II or IV symptoms refractory to medical therapy, ejection fraction 20 to 50%, LV end-systolic diameter ≤ 70 mm, pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg, and an anatomically suitable valve. In carefully selected patients, TEER can reduce symptoms, induce reverse remodelling, and improve clinical outcomes, even though rates of residual and recurrent MR are higher than with surgical repair (5). Clinical success and outcomes depend on careful patient selection and clinical care, so most centers that offer TEER do so through a specialized multidisciplinary heart
