Mitral Regurgitation

may improve prognosis. If the ECG shows left bundle branch block, then biventricular pacing may be beneficial for secondary MR. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are helpful in patients with exertional or nocturnal dyspnea. Digoxin may reduce symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation or those in whom valve surgery is not appropriate. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not longer except for patients who have had valve replacement or repair utilizing prosthetic materials (see table Recommended Endocarditis Prophylaxis During Oral-Dental or Respiratory Tract Procedures). Anticoagulants are used to prevent thromboemboli in patients with atrial fibrillation. Indications for intervention Acute mitral regurgitation requires emergency mitral valve repair or replacement with concomitant coronary revascularization as necessary. Pending surgery, nitroprusside or nitroglycerin infusion and an intra-aortic ballon pump may be used to reduce afterload, thus improving forward stroke volume and reducing ventricular and regurgitant volume. Chronic primary mitral regurgitation that is severe needs intervention at the onset of symptoms or decompensation (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 60% or LV end-systolic diameter ≥ 40 mm). Even in the absence of these triggers, intervention may be beneficial when surgical risk is low and valve morphology suggests a high likelihood of successful repair.
