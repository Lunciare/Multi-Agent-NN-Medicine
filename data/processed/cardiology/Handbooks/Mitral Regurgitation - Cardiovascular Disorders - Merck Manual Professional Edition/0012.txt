with MR that is moderate. However, for secondary MR, the value of this practice is unclear. When studied, the addition of mitral valve repair compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone did not affect LV remodelling or survival, but an excess of adverse events occurred (3). Therefore, only severe secondary MR should be treated when CABG is being performed to treat ischemia. Choice of intervention 8/11 In primary mitral regurgitation, the closer the mitral valve intervention mimics the native valve, the better for LV preservation and mortality. Hence, the order of preference is: 1. Repair with leaflet remodelling and chordal replacement 2. Replacement with chordal preservation 3. Replacement with removal of chordae If mitral valve repair with leaflet remodelling and chordal replacement is not feasible, replacement with a mechanical prosthesis is preferred because tissue valves have reduced longevity in the mitral position. A bioprosthesis is an option for older patients. In secondary mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement is preferred over repair with a downsized annuloplasty ring because mitral valve replacement results in less mitral regurgitation and heart failure 2 years after treatment (4). When the mechanism of secondary MR is annular dilation due to atrial fibrillation, valve surgery may
