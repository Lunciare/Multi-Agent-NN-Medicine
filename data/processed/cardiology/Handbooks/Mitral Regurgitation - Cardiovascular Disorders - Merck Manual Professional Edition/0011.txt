in the absence of these triggers, intervention may be beneficial when surgical risk is low and valve morphology suggests a high likelihood of successful repair. Atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, flail leaflet, or left atrial dilation alone is not an indication for intervention (1). When the EF falls to < 30%, surgical risk is high, necessitating a careful weighing of risk and benefit. Chronic secondary mitral regurgitation has fewer indications for intervention. Because the initial pathology involves the LV muscle, correction of MR is not as beneficial and should be considered only when significant symptoms persist despite a trial of guideline-directed management and therapy, including biventricular pacing, if indicated. Patients with atrial functional mitral regurgitation may benefit from surgery more than patients with other causes of secondary mitral regurgitation (eg, regional or global ischemic changes) (2). Indications for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) are wider (more permissive) than those for other surgical options. For patients undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, concomitant mitral valve surgery should be considered for a repairable valve with MR that is moderate. However, for secondary MR, the value of this practice is unclear. When studied, the addition of mitral valve repair compared with coronary artery bypass grafting
