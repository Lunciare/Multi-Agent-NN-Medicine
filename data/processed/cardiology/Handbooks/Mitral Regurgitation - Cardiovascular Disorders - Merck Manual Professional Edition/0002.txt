Mechanical failure of a prosthetic mitral valve Common causes of chronic mitral regurgitation are intrinsic valve pathology including mitral valve prolapse (primary MR) or distortion of a normal valve by dilatation and impairment of the left ventricle and/or the mitral annulus (secondary MR). Primary (organic) MR pathology is most often mitral valve prolapse or rheumatic heart disease. Less common causes are connective tissue disorders, congenital cleft mitral valve, and radiation-induced heart disease. Secondary (functional) MR occurs when disease of the left ventricle or left atrium (LA) impairs valve function. Ventricular impairment and dilation displace the papillary muscles outward, which tether the otherwise normal leaflets and cause non-coaptation. The causes are myocardial infarction (ischemic chronic secondary MR) or intrinsic myocardial disease (nonischemic chronic secondary MR). One mechanism of secondary mitral regurgitation is atrial functional mitral regurgitation, caused by annular dilatation due to chronic atrial fibrillation with an enlarged left atrium. In the presence of cardiomyopathy, any degree of secondary MR worsens prognosis. In infants and children, causes of MR include LV dysfunction/dilation as in endocardial fibroelastosis or acute myocarditis, a cleft mitral valve with or without an endocardial cushion defect, papillary muscle dysfunction secondary to anomalous left coronary artery arising from
