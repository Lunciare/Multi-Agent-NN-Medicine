dysfunction/dilation as in endocardial fibroelastosis or acute myocarditis, a cleft mitral valve with or without an endocardial cushion defect, papillary muscle dysfunction secondary to anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve. MR may coexist with mitral stenosis when thickened valvular leaflets do not close normally (see table Typical Echocardiographic Findings in Different Types of Mitral Regurgitation).

Complications of chronic MR include gradual enlargement of the LA; LV enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy, which initially compensates for regurgitant flow (preserving forward
