Mitral Regurgitation

pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) tracings during ventricular systole. Ventriculography can be used to quantify MR. Cardiac MRI can accurately measure regurgitant fraction and determine the cause of dilated myopathy with MR. Periodic exercise testing (stress ECG) is often performed to detect any decrease in exercise tolerance, which would prompt consideration of surgical intervention. Periodic echocardiography is performed to detect progression of MR. 6/11 Phonocardiographic Characteristics of Heart Murmurs Treatment of Mitral Regurgitation Mitral valve repair preferred for primary MR Medical therapy or mitral valve replacement for secondary MR Anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other vasodilators do not delay LV dilation or MR progression and so have no role in asymptomatic MR with preserved LV function. However, if LV dilation or dysfunction is present, therapy using an angiotensin II receptor blocker, neprilysin inhibitor (eg, sacubitril, combined with the angiotensin II blocker valsartan), aldosterone antagonist, and/or 7/11 vasodilating beta-blocker (eg, carvedilol) is indicated. In secondary MR, these medications can reduce the severity of MR and may improve prognosis. If the ECG shows left bundle branch block, then biventricular pacing may be beneficial for secondary MR. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are helpful in patients with
