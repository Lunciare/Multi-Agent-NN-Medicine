myocardial ischaemia, may also occur. Reduced cardiac performance produces symptoms of faintness or syncope and leads to increased sympathetic stimulation, which may increase the heart rate further. 2/14 Electrocardiographic characteristics of atrial arrhythmias Sinus tachycardia P waves have normal morphology Atrial rate 100-200 beats/min Regular ventricular rhythm Ventricular rate 100-200 beats/min One P wave precedes every QRS complex Atrial tachycardia Abnormal P wave morphology Atrial rate 100-250 beats/min Ventricular rhythm usually regular Variable ventricular rate Atrial flutter Undulating saw-toothed baseline F (flutter) waves Atrial rate 250-350 beats/min Regular ventricular rhythm Ventricular rate typically 150 beats/min (with 2:1 atrioventricular block) 4:1 is also common (3:1 and 1:1 block uncommon) Atrial fibrillation P waves absent; oscillating baseline f (fibrillation) waves Atrial rate 350-600 beats/min Irregular ventricular rhythm Ventricular rate 100-180 beats/min As a general rule the faster the ventricular rate, the more likely the presence of symptoms—for example, chest pain, faintness, and breathlessness. Urgent treatment is needed for severely symptomatic patients with a narrow complex tachycardia. 3/14 Electrocardiographic features Differentiation between different types of supraventricular tachycardia may be difficult, particularly when ventricular rates exceed 150 beats/min. Electrocardiographic analysis should include measurement of the ventricular rate, assessment of the ventricular rhythm, identification of
