types of supraventricular tachycardia may be difficult, particularly when ventricular rates exceed 150 beats/min. Electrocardiographic analysis should include measurement of the ventricular rate, assessment of the ventricular rhythm, identification of P, F, or f waves , measurement of the atrial rate, and establishment of the relation of P waves to the ventricular complexes Knowledge of the electrophysiology of these arrhythmias will assist correct identification. Evaluation of atrial activity on the electrocardiogram is crucial in this process. Analysis of the ventricular rate and rhythm may also be helpful, although this rate will depend on the degree of atrioventricular block. Increasing atrioventricular block by manoeuvres such as carotid sinus massage or administration of intravenous adenosine may be of diagnostic value as slowing the ventricular rate allows more accurate visualisation of atrial activity. Such manoeuvres will not usually stop the tachycardia, however, unless it is due to re-entry involving the atrioventricular node. Sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia is usually a physiological response but may be precipitated by sympathomimetic drugs or endocrine disturbances. The rate rarely exceeds 200 beats/min in adults. The rate increases gradually and may show beat to beat variation. Each P wave is followed by a QRS complex. P wave morphology and
