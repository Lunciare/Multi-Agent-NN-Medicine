tachycardia and/or flutter. Atrial flutter Atrial flutter is due to a re-entry circuit in the right atrium with secondary activation of the left atrium. This produces atrial contractions at a rate of about 300 beats/min—seen on the electrocardiogram as flutter (F) waves. These are broad and appear saw-toothed and are best seen in the inferior leads and in lead V1. The ventricular rate depends on conduction through the atrioventricular node. Typically 2:1 block (atrial rate to ventricular rate) occurs, giving a ventricular rate of 150 beats/min. Identification of a regular tachycardia with this rate should prompt the diagnosis of atrial flutter. The non-conducting flutter waves are often mistaken for or merged with T waves and become apparent only if the block is 6/14 increased. Manoeuvres that induce transient atrioventricular block may allow identification of flutter waves. The causes of atrial flutter are similar to those of atrial fibrillation, although idiopathic atrial flutter is uncommon. It may convert into atrial fibrillation over time or, after administration of drugs such as digoxin. Atrial tachycardia Atrial tachycardia typically arises from an ectopic source in the atrial muscle and produces an atrial rate of 150-250 beats/min—slower than that of atrial flutter. The P waves
