of these waves varies between leads but may be so coarse that they are mistaken for flutter waves. Conduction of atrial impulses to the ventricles is variable and unpredictable. Only a few of the impulses transmit through the atrioventricular node to produce an irregular ventricular response. This combination of absent P waves, fine baseline f wave oscillations, and irregular ventricular complexes is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The ventricular rate depends on the degree of atrioventricular conduction, and with normal conduction it varies between 100 and 180 beats/min. Slower rates suggest a higher degree of atrioventricular block or the patient may be taking medication such as digoxin. Fast atrial fibrillation may be difficult to distinguish from other tachycardias. The RR interval remains irregular, however, and the overall rate often fluctuates. Mapping R waves against a piece of paper or with calipers usually confirms the diagnosis. Atrial fibrillation may be paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. It may be precipitated by an atrial extrasystole or result from degeneration of other supraventricular tachycardias, particularly atrial tachycardia and/or flutter. Atrial flutter Atrial flutter is due to a re-entry circuit in the right atrium with secondary activation of the left atrium. This produces atrial contractions at a
