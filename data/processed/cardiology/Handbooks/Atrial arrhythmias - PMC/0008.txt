Atrial tachycardia Atrial tachycardia typically arises from an ectopic source in the atrial muscle and produces an atrial rate of 150-250 beats/min—slower than that of atrial flutter. The P waves may be abnormally shaped depending on the site of the ectopic pacemaker. Types of atrial tachycardia Benign Incessant ectopic Multifocal Atrial tachycardia with block (digoxin toxicity) The ventricular rate depends on the degree of atrioventricular block, but when 1:1 conduction occurs a rapid ventricular response may result. Increasing the degree of block with carotid sinus massage or adenosine may aid the diagnosis. There are four commonly recognised types of atrial tachycardia. Benign atrial tachycardia is a common arrhythmia in elderly people. It is paroxysmal in nature, has an atrial rate of 80-140 beats/min and an abrupt onset and cessation, and is brief in duration. Incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia is a rare chronic arrhythmia in children and young adults. The rate depends on the underlying sympathetic tone and is characteristically 100-160 beats/min. It can be difficult to distinguish from a sinus tachycardia. Diagnosis is important as it may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy if left untreated. 7/14 Conditions associated with atrial tachycardia Cardiomyopathy Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Ischaemic heart disease Rheumatic heart
