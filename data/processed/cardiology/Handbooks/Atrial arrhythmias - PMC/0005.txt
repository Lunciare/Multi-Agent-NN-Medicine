the sinus tachycardia may be due to a re-entry phenomenon in the sinoatrial node. This is recognised by abrupt onset and termination, a very regular rate, and absence of an underlying physiological stimulus. The electrocardiographic characteristics are otherwise identical. The rate is usually 130-140 beats/min, and vagal manoeuvres may be successful in stopping the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation 5/14 This is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Overall prevalence is 1% to 1.5%, but prevalence increases with age, affecting about 10% of people aged over 70. Causes are varied, although many cases are idiopathic. Prognosis is related to the underlying cause; it is excellent when due to idiopathic atrial fibrillation and relatively poor when due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation is caused by multiple re-entrant circuits or “wavelets” of activation sweeping around the atrial myocardium. These are often triggered by rapid firing foci. Atrial fibrillation is seen on the electrocardiogram as a wavy, irregular baseline made up of f (fibrillation) waves discharging at a frequency of 350 to 600 beats/min. The amplitude of these waves varies between leads but may be so coarse that they are mistaken for flutter waves. Conduction of atrial impulses to the ventricles is variable and unpredictable. Only
