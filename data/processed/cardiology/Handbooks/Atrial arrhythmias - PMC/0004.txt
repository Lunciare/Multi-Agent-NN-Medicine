Atrial arrhythmias - PMC

rarely exceeds 200 beats/min in adults. The rate increases gradually and may show beat to beat variation. Each P wave is followed by a QRS complex. P wave morphology and axis are normal, although the height of the P wave may increase with the heart rate and the PR interval will shorten. With a fast tachycardia the P wave may become lost in the preceding T wave. 4/14 Causes of sinus tachycardia Physiological—Exertion, anxiety, pain Pathological—Fever, anaemia, hypovolaemia, hypoxia Endocrine—Thyrotoxicosis Pharmacological—Adrenaline as a result of phaeochromocytoma; salbutamol; alcohol, caffeine Recognition of the underlying cause usually makes diagnosis of sinus tachycardia easy. A persistent tachycardia in the absence of an obvious underlying cause should prompt consideration of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia. Causes of atrial fibrillation • Ischaemic heart disease • Cardiomyopathy (dilated or hypertrophic) • Hypertensive heart disease • Sick sinus syndrome • Rheumatic heart disease • Post-cardiac surgery • Thyrotoxicosis • Chronic pulmonary disease • Alcohol misuse (acute or • Idiopathic (lone) chronic) Open in a new tab Rarely the sinus tachycardia may be due to a re-entry phenomenon in the sinoatrial node. This is recognised by abrupt onset and termination, a very regular rate, and absence of an
