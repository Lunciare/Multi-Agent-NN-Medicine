Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD)
By L. Brent Mitchell, MD, Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary
Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary
Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025
The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is
directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs,
cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special
form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used.
ICDs cardiovert or defibrillate the heart in response to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular
fibrillation (VF). Tiered-therapy ICDs also provide antibradycardia pacing and antitachycardia pacing
(to terminate responsive atrial or ventricular tachycardias) and store intracardiac electrograms (1).
ICDs are implanted subcutaneously or subpectorally, with electrodes inserted transvenously into the
right ventricle and sometimes also the right atrium. A biventricular ICD also has a left ventricular
epicardial lead placed via the coronary sinus venous system or via thoracotomy to allow cardiac
resynchronization therapy pacing (CRT-D). ICD platforms also include an ICD that is completely
implanted subcutaneously (S-ICD) with no intravascular components (2) and a wearable vest-like
defibrillator for short-term use (3).

Impulse generators for ICDs typically last 5 to 7 years.
Indications for ICDs
ICDs are the preferred treatment for patients who have had
An episode of VF or hemodynamically significant VT not due to reversible or transient
conditions (eg, electrolyte disturbance, antiarrhythmic drug proarrhythmia, acute
myocardial infarction)
ICDs may also be indicated for patients with VT or VF inducible during an electrophysiologic study and
for patients with idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 35%, and
a high risk of VT or VF. Other indications (see table Indications for Implantable Cardioverter-
Defibrillators) are less clear.
Because ICDs treat rather than prevent VT or VF, patients prone to these arrhythmias may require both
an ICD and antiarrhythmic drugs to reduce the number of episodes and need for uncomfortable shocks;
this approach also prolongs the life of the ICD.

ICD malfunction
ICDs may malfunction by
Delivering inappropriate pacing or shocks
Not delivering pacing or shocks when needed

ICDs may deliver inappropriate pacing or shocks in response to sinus rhythm, supraventricular
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or nonphysiologically generated impulses (eg. due to lead
fracture).
ICDs may not deliver appropriate pacing or shocks when needed because of factors such as lead or
impulse generator migration, undersensing, an increase in pacing threshold due to fibrosis at the site of
prior shocks, and battery depletion.
When an ICD discharges
For patients who report that the ICD has discharged but do not have associated symptoms of syncope,
dyspnea, chest pain, or persistent palpitations, a follow-up with the ICD clinic and/or the
electrophysiologist should be arranged as soon as feasible. The ICD can be electronically interrogated to
determine the reason for discharge. If such associated symptoms were present, or the patient received
multiple shocks, urgent referral is indicated to look for a treatable cause (eg, coronary ischemia,
electrolyte abnormality) or device malfunction.
