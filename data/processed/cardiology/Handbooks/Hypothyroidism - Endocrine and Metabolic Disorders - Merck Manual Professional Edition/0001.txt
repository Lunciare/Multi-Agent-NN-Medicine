Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. Diagnosis is with thyroid function tests. Management includes administration of thyroxine. Hypothyroidism occurs at any age but is particularly common among older adults, where it may present subtly and be difficult to recognize. Hypothyroidism may be Primary: Caused by disease in the thyroid Secondary: Caused by disease in the hypothalamus or pituitary Primary hypothyroidism Primary hypothyroidism is due to decreased secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) from the thyroid. Serum T4 and T3 levels are low, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is increased. In the United States, the most common cause is autoimmune inflammation. It usually results from Hashimoto thyroiditis and is often associated with a firm goiter or, later in the disease process, with a shrunken fibrotic thyroid with little or no function. The second most common cause is treatment for hyperthyroidism (post-therapeutic hypothyroidism), especially after radioactive iodine therapy or surgery for hyperthyroidism, goiter, or thyroid cancer. Hypothyroidism during overtreatment with propylthiouracil, methimazole, or iodide abates after therapy is stopped. Iodine deficiency may cause endemic goiter and goitrous hypothyroidism.
