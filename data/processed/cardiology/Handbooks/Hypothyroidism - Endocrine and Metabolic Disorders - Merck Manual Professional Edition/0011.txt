Hypothyroidism

until there is evidence of adequate cortisol secretion (or cortisol therapy is given), because levothyroxine could precipitate adrenal crisis. Myxedema coma Myxedema coma is treated as follows: T4 given IV Corticosteroids Supportive care as needed Conversion to oral T4 when patient is stable Patients require a large initial dose of T4 (300 to 500 mcg IV) or T3 (25 to 50 mcg IV). The intravenous maintenance dose of T4 is 75 to 100 mcg once a day and of T3, 10 to 20 mcg twice a day until T4 can be given orally. Corticosteroids are also given because the possibility of central hypothyroidism usually cannot be initially ruled out. The patient should not be rewarmed rapidly, which may precipitate hypotension or arrhythmias. Hypoxemia is common, so the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) should be monitored. If ventilation is compromised, immediate mechanical ventilatory assistance is required. The precipitating factor should be rapidly and appropriately treated and fluid replacement given carefully, because hypothyroid patients do not excrete water appropriately. Finally, all medications should be given cautiously because they are metabolized more slowly than in healthy people.
