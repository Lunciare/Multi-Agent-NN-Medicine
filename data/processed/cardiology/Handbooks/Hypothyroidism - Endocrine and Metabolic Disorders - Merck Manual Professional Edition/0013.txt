The most common etiology of hypothyroidism is primary thyroid disease, often due to Hashimoto thyroiditis, but sometimes caused by some treatments (thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiation therapy to the neck, or some medications). Secondary hypothyroidism is caused by hypothalamic or pituitary disease. Signs and symptoms of primary hypothyroidism are often mild and nonspecific and can include fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, fluid retention, periorbital edema, and/or impaired mental clarity. Subclinical hypothyroidism (minimal or no symptoms and an elevated serum level of thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) and normal free thyroxine [T4]) is common. Diagnose primary or secondary hypothyroidism by testing serum TSH and T4. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH is elevated and T4 is low; in secondary hypothyroidism, both TSH and T4 are low. Myxedema coma (coma, hypothermia, and other organ dysfunction) is a rare life- threatening condition that can occur during acute illness in patients with hypothyroidism; it requires rapid diagnosis and treatment. Treat with levothyroxine and adjust dose until TSH levels are normal. Check cortisol levels in patients with secondary hypothyroidism before starting thyroid replacement therapy, because of the serious risk of adrenal crisis. Screen selected patients (neonates, older adults with risk factors) with a serum TSH.
