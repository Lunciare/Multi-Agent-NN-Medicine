The incidence of permanent hypothyroidism after radiation therapy is high, and thyroid function (through measurement of serum TSH) should be evaluated at 6- to 12-month intervals. Secondary hypothyroidism Secondary hypothyroidism occurs when the hypothalamus produces insufficient thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or the pituitary produces insufficient TSH. Sometimes, deficient TSH secretion due to deficient TRH secretion is termed tertiary hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism Subclinical hypothyroidism is elevated serum TSH in patients with absent or minimal symptoms of hypothyroidism and normal serum levels of free thyroxine (T4). Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is relatively common; it occurs in approximately 15% of older females and 10% of older males (1), particularly in those with underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis. In patients with serum TSH > 10 mIU/L (> 10 microIU/mL), there is a high likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism with low serum levels of free T4 within the next 10 years. These patients are also more likely to have hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. They should be treated with levothyroxine, even if they are asymptomatic. For patients with TSH levels between 4.5 and 10 mUI/L, (4.5 and 10 microIU/L) a trial of levothyroxine is
