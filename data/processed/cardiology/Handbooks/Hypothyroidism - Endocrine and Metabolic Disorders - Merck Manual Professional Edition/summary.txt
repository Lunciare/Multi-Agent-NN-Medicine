Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency. Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin. Diagnosis is with thyroid function tests. Management includes administration of thyroxine. Hypothyroidism occurs at any age but is particularly common among older adults, where it may present subtly and be difficult to recognize.
