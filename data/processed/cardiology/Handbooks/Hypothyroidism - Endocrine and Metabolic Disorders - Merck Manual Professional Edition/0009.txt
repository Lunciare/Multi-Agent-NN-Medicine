Infants and Children). In young or middle-aged patients who are otherwise healthy, the starting dose of levothyroxine can be 100 mcg or 1.7 mcg/kg orally once a day. In patients with heart disease, therapy is begun with low doses of levothyroxine, usually 25 mcg once a day. The dose is adjusted every 6 weeks until maintenance dose is achieved. The maintenance dose may need to be increased in patients who are pregnant. Dose may also need to be increased if medications that decrease T4 absorption or increase its metabolic clearance are administered concomitantly. The dose used should be the lowest that restores serum TSH levels to the midnormal range (though this 5/8 criterion cannot be used in patients with secondary hypothyroidism). In secondary hypothyroidism the dose of levothyroxine should achieve a free T4 level in the midnormal range. Liothyronine (L-triiodothyronine) should not be used alone for long-term replacement because of its short half-life and the large peaks in serum T3 levels it produces. The administration of standard replacement amounts (25 to 37.5 mcg twice a day) results in rapidly increasing serum T3 to between 300 and 1000 ng/dL (4.62 to 15.4 nmol/L) within 4 hours due to its almost complete
