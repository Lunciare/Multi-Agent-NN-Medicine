Although typically easy to diagnose in younger adults, hypothyroidism may be subtle and manifest atypically in older adults. Older patients have significantly fewer symptoms than do younger patients, and symptoms and signs are often subtle and vague. Many older patients with hypothyroidism present with nonspecific geriatric syndromes—confusion, anorexia, weight loss, falling, incontinence, and decreased mobility. Musculoskeletal symptoms (especially arthralgias) occur often, but arthritis is rare. Muscular aches and weakness, often mimicking polymyalgia rheumatica or polymyositis, and an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level may occur. In older patients, hypothyroidism may mimic dementia or parkinsonism. In older patients, levothyroxine therapy is begun with low doses, usually 25 mcg once a day. Maintenance doses may also need to be lower in older patients. Key Points Hypothyroidism is deficiency of thyroid hormone. The most common etiology of hypothyroidism is primary thyroid disease, often due to Hashimoto thyroiditis, but sometimes caused by some treatments (thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiation therapy to the
