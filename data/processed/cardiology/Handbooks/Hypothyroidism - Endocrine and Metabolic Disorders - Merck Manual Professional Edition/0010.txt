Hypothyroidism

to 37.5 mcg twice a day) results in rapidly increasing serum T3 to between 300 and 1000 ng/dL (4.62 to 15.4 nmol/L) within 4 hours due to its almost complete absorption; these levels return to normal by 24 hours. Additionally, patients receiving liothyronine are chemically hyperthyroid for at least several hours a day, potentially increasing cardiac risks. T3 does not cross the placenta and should not be administered to patients who are pregnant. Similar patterns of serum T3 changes occur when mixtures of T3 and T4 are taken orally, although peak T3 is lower because less T3 is given. Replacement regimens with synthetic T4 preparations reflect a different pattern in serum T3 response. Increases in serum T3 occur gradually, and normal levels are maintained when adequate doses of T4 are given. Desiccated animal thyroid preparations contain variable amounts of T3 and T4 and should not be prescribed unless the patient is already taking the preparation and has normal serum TSH. In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine should not be given until there is evidence of adequate cortisol secretion (or cortisol therapy is given), because levothyroxine could precipitate adrenal crisis. Myxedema coma Myxedema coma is treated as follows: T4 given IV
