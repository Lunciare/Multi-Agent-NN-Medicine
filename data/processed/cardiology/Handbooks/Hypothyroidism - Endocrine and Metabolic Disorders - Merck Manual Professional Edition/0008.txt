Hypothyroidism

As the hypometabolic state is corrected, anemia subsides, sometimes requiring 6 to 9 months. Serum cholesterol is usually high in primary hypothyroidism but not as high in secondary hypothyroidism. In addition to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, other conditions may cause decreased levels of total T4, such as euthyroid sick syndrome and serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) deficiency. Screening Screening for hypothyroidism is warranted in select populations (eg, neonates, older adults with risk factors) in which it is relatively more prevalent, especially because it can cause significant morbidity and its manifestations can be subtle. Screening is done by measuring TSH levels. Treatment of Hypothyroidism Levothyroxine, adjusted until TSH levels are in midnormal range (1) Various thyroid hormone preparations are available for replacement therapy, including synthetic preparations of T4 (levothyroxine), T3 (liothyronine), combinations of the 2 synthetic hormones, and desiccated porcine thyroid extract. Levothyroxine is preferred; the usual maintenance dose is 75 to 150 mcg orally once a day, depending on age, body mass index, and absorption (for pediatric treatment, see Hypothyroidism in Infants and Children). In young or middle-aged patients who are otherwise healthy, the starting dose of levothyroxine can be 100 mcg or 1.7 mcg/kg orally once a day. In patients
