without rapid treatment. Precipitating factors include illness, infection, trauma, medications or substances that suppress the central nervous system, and exposure to cold. Free thyroxine (T4) level Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement is the most sensitive test for diagnosing hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, there is decreased feedback inhibition of the intact pituitary, and serum TSH is always elevated, whereas serum free T4 is low. In secondary hypothyroidism, free T4 and serum TSH are low (sometimes TSH is normal but with decreased bioactivity). Many patients with primary hypothyroidism have normal circulating levels of triiodothyronine (T3), probably caused by sustained TSH stimulation of the failing thyroid, resulting in preferential synthesis and secretion of biologically active T3. Therefore, serum T3 is not sensitive for hypothyroidism. Anemia is often present, usually normocytic-normochromic and of unknown etiology, but it may be hypochromic because of iron deficiency due to heavy menstrual bleeding and sometimes macrocytic because of associated pernicious anemia or decreased absorption of folate. Anemia is rarely severe (hemoglobin is usually > 9 g/dL [> 90 g/L]). As the hypometabolic state is corrected, anemia subsides, sometimes requiring 6 to 9 months. Serum cholesterol is usually high in primary hypothyroidism but not as high in secondary hypothyroidism. In
