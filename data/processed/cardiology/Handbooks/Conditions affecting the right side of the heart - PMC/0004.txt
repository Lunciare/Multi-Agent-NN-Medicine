of right axis deviation. Secondary changes may be observed in the right precordial chest leads, where ST segment depression and T wave inversion are seen. Conditions associated with right axis deviation Right ventricular hypertrophy Left posterior hemiblock Lateral myocardial infarction Acute right heart strain Right axis deviation is normal in infants and children A dominant R wave in lead V1 can occur in other conditions, but the absence of right axis deviation allows these conditions to be differentiated from right ventricular hypertrophy. Isolated right axis deviation is also associated with a range of conditions. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3/15 In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperinflation of the lungs leads to depression of the diaphragm, and this is associated with clockwise rotation of the heart along its longitudinal axis. This clockwise rotation means that the transitional zone (defined as the progression of rS to qR in the chest leads) shifts towards the left with persistence of an rS pattern as far as V5 or even V6. This may give rise to a “pseudoinfarct” pattern, with deep S waves in the right precordial leads simulating the appearance of the QS waves and poor R wave progression seen in anterior myocardial infarction.
