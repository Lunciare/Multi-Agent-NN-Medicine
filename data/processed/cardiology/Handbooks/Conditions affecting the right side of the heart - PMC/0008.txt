Conditions affecting the right side of the heart

Right axis deviation 5/15 Right sided valvular problems Tricuspid stenosis Tricuspid stenosis is a rare disorder and is usually associated with rheumatic heart disease. It appears in the electrocardiogram as P pulmonale. It generally occurs in association with mitral valve disease, and therefore the electrocardiogram often shows evidence of biatrial enlargement, indicated by a large biphasic P wave in lead V1 with an initial positive deflection followed by a terminal negative deflection. Tricuspid regurgitation The electrocardiogram is an unhelpful tool for diagnosing tricuspid regurgitation and generally shows the features of the underlying cardiac disease. The electrocardiographic manifestations of tricuspid regurgitation are non-specific and include incomplete right bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary stenosis Pulmonary stenosis leads to pressure overload in the right atrium and ventricle. The electrocardiogram may be completely normal in the presence of mild pulmonary stenosis. More severe lesions are associated with electrocardiographic features of right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy, with tall P waves, marked right axis deviation, and a tall R wave in lead V1.
