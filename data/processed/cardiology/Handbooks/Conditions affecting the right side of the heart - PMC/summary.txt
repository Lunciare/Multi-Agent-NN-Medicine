Many diseases of the right side of the heart are associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Electrocardiography is neither a sensitive nor specific tool for diagnosing conditions such as right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, or pulmonary hypertension. However, an awareness of the electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with these conditions may support the patient's clinical assessment and may prevent the changes on the electrocardiogram from being wrongly attributed to other conditions, such as ischaemia. This article discusses right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, and the electrocardiographic changes associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolus, acute right heart strain, and valvular heart disease Right atrial enlargement The forces generated by right atrial depolarisation are directed anteriorly and inferiorly and produce the early part of the P wave. Right atrial hypertrophy or dilatation is therefore associated with tall P 1/15 waves in the anterior and inferior leads, though the overall duration of the P wave is not usually prolonged. A tall P wave (height ⩾2.5 mm) in leads II, III, and aVF is kn…
