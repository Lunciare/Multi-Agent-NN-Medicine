lead I and a Q wave in lead III. T wave inversion in lead III may also be present, producing the well known S1, Q3, T3 pattern. The S1, Q3, T3 pattern is seen in about 12% of patients with a massive pulmonary embolus Acute right heart strain When the electrocardiogram shows features of right ventricular hypertrophy accompanied by ST segment depression and T wave inversion, a ventricular “strain” pattern is said to exist. Ventricular strain is seen mainly in leads V1 and V2. The mechanism is unclear. A strain pattern is sometimes seen in acute massive pulmonary embolism but is also seen in patients with right ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of any detectable stress on the ventricle. Both pneumothorax and massive pleural effusion with acute right ventricular dilatation may also produce a strain pattern. Electrocardiographic abnormalities found in acute pulmonary embolism Sinus tachycardia Atrial flutter or fibrillation S1, Q3, T3 pattern Right bundle branch block (incomplete or complete) T wave inversion in the right precordial leads P pulmonale Right axis deviation 5/15 Right sided valvular problems Tricuspid stenosis Tricuspid stenosis is a rare disorder and is usually associated with rheumatic heart disease. It appears in the electrocardiogram as
