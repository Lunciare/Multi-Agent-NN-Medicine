a “pseudoinfarct” pattern, with deep S waves in the right precordial leads simulating the appearance of the QS waves and poor R wave progression seen in anterior myocardial infarction. The amplitude of the QRS complexes may be small in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the hyperinflated lungs are poor electrical conductors. About three quarters of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have electrocardiographic abnormalities. P pulmonale is often but not invariably present and may occur with or without clinical evidence of cor pulmonale In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the electrocardiographic signs of right ventricular hypertrophy may be present, indicating the presence of cor pulmonale Cardiac arrhythmias may occur in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly in association with an acute respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, or pulmonary embolism. Arrhythmias are sometimes the result of the underlying disease process but may also occur as side effects of the drugs used to treat the disease. The arrhythmias are mostly supraventricular in origin and include atrial extrasystoles, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and multifocal atrial tachycardia. Ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Acute pulmonary embolism The electrocardiographic features of acute pulmonary embolism depend on the size of the embolus
