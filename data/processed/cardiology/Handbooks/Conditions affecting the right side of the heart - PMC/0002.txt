as the P pulmonale. Diagnostic criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (Provided the QRS duration is less than 0.12 s) Right axis deviation of +110° or more Dominant R wave in lead V1 ⩾ R wave in lead V1 7 mm Supporting criteria ST segment depression and T wave inversion in leads V1 to V4 Deep S waves in leads V5, V6, I, and aVL The electrocardiographic changes suggesting right atrial enlargement often correlate poorly with the clinical and pathological findings. Right atrial enlargement is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease—for example, pulmonary stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot. In practice, most cases of right atrial enlargement are associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, and this may be reflected in the electrocardiogram. The electrocardiographic features of right atrial enlargement without coexisting right ventricular hypertrophy are seen in patients with tricuspid stenosis. P pulmonale may appear transiently in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Right ventricular hypertrophy The forces generated by right ventricular depolarisation are directed rightwards and anteriorly and are almost completely masked by the dominant forces of left ventricular depolarisation. In the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy the forces of depolarisation increase, and if the hypertrophy is
