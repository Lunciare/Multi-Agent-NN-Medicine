flutter, and multifocal atrial tachycardia. Ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia may also occur. Acute pulmonary embolism The electrocardiographic features of acute pulmonary embolism depend on the size of the embolus and its haemodynamic effects and on the underlying cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient. The timing and frequency of the electrocardiographic recording is also important as changes may be transient. Patients who present with a small pulmonary embolus are likely to have a normal electrocardiogram or a trace showing only sinus tachycardia. 4/15 Right ventricular dilatation may lead to right sided conduction delays, which manifest as incomplete or complete right bundle branch block. There may be some rightward shift of the frontal plane QRS axis.Right atrial dilatation may lead to prominent P waves in the inferior leads. Atrial arrhythmias including flutter and fibrillation are common, and T wave inversion in the right precordial leads may also occur If the embolus is large and associated with pulmonary artery obstruction, acute right ventricular dilatation may occur. This may produce an S wave in lead I and a Q wave in lead III. T wave inversion in lead III may also be present, producing the well known S1, Q3, T3 pattern. The S1, Q3,
