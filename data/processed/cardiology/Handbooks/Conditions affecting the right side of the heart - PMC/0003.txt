and are almost completely masked by the dominant forces of left ventricular depolarisation. In the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy the forces of depolarisation increase, and if the hypertrophy is severe these forces may dominate on the electrocardiogram. Right ventricular hypertrophy is associated with pulmonary hypertension, mitral stenosis, and, less commonly, conditions such as pulmonary stenosis and congenital heart disease 2/15 The electrocardiogram is a relatively insensitive indicator of the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy, and in mild cases of right ventricular hypertrophy the trace will be normal. Conditions associated with tall R wave in lead V1 Right ventricular hypertrophy Posterior myocardial infarction Type A Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Right bundle branch block A tall R wave in lead V1 is normal in children and young adults Lead V1 lies closest to the right ventricular myocardium and is therefore best placed to detect the changes of right ventricular hypertrophy, and a dominant R wave in lead V1 is observed. The increased rightward forces are reflected in the limb leads, in the form of right axis deviation. Secondary changes may be observed in the right precordial chest leads, where ST segment depression and T wave inversion are seen. Conditions associated with right axis
