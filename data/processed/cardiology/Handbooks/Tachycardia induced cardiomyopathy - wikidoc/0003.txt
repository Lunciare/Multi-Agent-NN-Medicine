Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy
KEYWORDS: tachycardia, cardiomyopathy, left, ventricular, atrial, function, patients, induced, tachycardia induced, left ventricular, rate, ventricular function, diagnosis, normal, following

or near normal left ventricular function following resolution of the tachycardia establishes the diagnosis. The diagnosis should be suspected if a patient was known to have normal LV function who sustains a decline in the setting of recurrent, paroxysmal or a chronic tachyarrhythmia. Holter monitoring can be useful to gauge the patients heart rate throughout 24 hours as the heart rate may vary tremendously with exercise and rest. Treatment The primary treatment for a tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy is correct the underlying tachycardia. This may include the use of: • Negative chronotropic agents such as beta blockers • Cardioversion • AV node ablation • Treatment of the underlying condition such as hyperthyroidism or atrial fibriallation Supportive agents such as ACE inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers are of benefit to try to prevent remodeling of the left ventricle.
