of rhythm) in 10 patients initially diagnosed as having an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, there was an improvement in left ventricular function at 30 months [7]. Epidemiology and Demographics Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy occurs in patients of all ages [8][9][10][11] Estimates of the incidence of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy among patients with atrial fibrillation vary widely from 25% to 75% in small series [12][13][14][15][16]. Risk Factors The rate and duration of the elevation in heart rate necessary to cause a cardiomyopathy is unclear and is likely dependent on a number of other factors. It has been speculated that the rate, type, duration of the rhythm as well as the patient's age, and co-morbidities all play a role[17]. Natural History, Complications, and Prognosis Depending upon the duration of the tachycardia, the condition is either completely or partially reversible after some time.[18] The pace of recovery of left ventricual dysfunctionis similar to that of hibernating myocardium [19]. It may take one year for instance for left ventricular function to recover [20][21] Diagnosis Resumption of normal or near normal left ventricular function following resolution of the tachycardia establishes the diagnosis. The diagnosis should be suspected if a patient was known to have normal LV function who
