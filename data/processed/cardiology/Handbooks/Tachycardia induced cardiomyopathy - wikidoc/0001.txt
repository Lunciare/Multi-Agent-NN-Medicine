Synonyms and Keywords: chronotropic cardiomyopathy; tachycardiomyopathy; tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy As a result of the reduced cardiac output, there is activation of the neurohormonal axis with elevations of the following hormones: • Plasma cathecholamines • Atrial natriuretic peptide • Renin • Aldosterone Although the precise mechanism is not known, it has been speculated that the underlying mechanism of disease involves a depletion of myocardial energetics[4][5]. There also appear to be abnormalities in calcium handling and calcium channel activity that may explain the reduction in cardiac contractility[6] These abnormalities can persist up to 4 weeks after discontinuation of the tachycardia. Causes The following tachyarrhythmias have all been associated with the development of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy: • Atrial fibrillation • Atrial flutter • AV nodal reentry tachycardia • Ventricular tachycardia Disorders that Tachycardia Induced Cardiomyopathy Must be distinguished From Patients with atrial fibrillation and a very low left ventricular ejection fraction can be presumptively diagnosed as having an primary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with secondary atrial fibrillation. Following aggressive rate control (pharmacologic and conversion of rhythm) in 10 patients initially diagnosed as having an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, there was an improvement in left ventricular function at 30 months [7].
