Medications for Arrhythmias
By L. Brent Mitchell, MD, Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary
Reviewed By Jonathan G. Howlett, MD, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary
Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025
The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is
directed at causes. If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including antiarrhythmic drugs,
cardioversion-defibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), pacemakers (and a special
form of pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy), catheter ablation, surgery, or a combination, is used.
Most antiarrhythmic drugs are grouped into 4 main classes (Vaughan Williams classification) based on
their dominant cellular electrophysiologic effect, with subsequent updates to the classification system
for newer medications (see table Antiarrhythmic Drugs (Vaughan Williams Classification)) (1, 2).
Class I: Class I drugs are sodium channel blockers (membrane-stabilizing drugs) that block
fast sodium channels and slow conduction in fast-channel tissues (working atrial and
ventricular myocytes, His-Purkinje system). Class I drugs are subdivided into subclasses Ia,
Ib, and Ic.
Class II: Class II drugs are beta-blockers, which affect predominantly slow-channel tissues
(sinoatrial [SA] and atrioventricular [AV] nodes), where they decrease rate of automaticity,
slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness.
Class III: Class III drugs are primarily potassium channel blockers, which prolong action
potential duration and refractoriness in slow- and fast-channel tissues.
Class IV: Class IV drugs are the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which
depress calcium-dependent action potentials in slow-channel tissues and thus decrease the
rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness.
Digoxin, adenosine, and ivabradine were not included in the original Vaughan Williams classification.
The original Vaughan Williams classification system for antiarrhythmic drugs has been extended (2) to
include these and other antiarrhythmic drugs introduced since the original classification (eg,
amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide).
Digoxin shortens atrial and ventricular refractory periods and is vagotonic, thereby prolonging AV nodal
conduction and AV nodal refractory periods.
Adenosine slows or blocks AV nodal conduction and can terminate tachyarrhythmias that rely upon AV
nodal conduction for their perpetuation.
Ivabradine inhibits the SA node funny current and slows SA node rate.

Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are
Sodium channel blockers (membrane-stabilizing drugs), which block fast sodium channels,
slowing conduction in fast-channel tissues (working atrial and ventricular myocytes, His-
Purkinje system)
In the electrocardiogram (ECG), this effect may be reflected as widening of the P wave or QRS complex,
prolongation of the PR interval, or a combination.
Class I drugs are subdivided based on the kinetics of the sodium channel effects, which determine the
heart rates at which their electrophysiologic effects become manifest.
Class Ib drugs have fast kinetics, so they express their electrophysiologic effects only at fast heart rates.
Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel
tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very potent antiarrhythmics and have minimal effects
on atrial tissue.
Class Ic drugs have slow kinetics, so they express their electrophysiologic effects at all heart rates. Thus,
an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal heart rates usually shows fast-channel tissue
conduction slowing. Class Ic drugs are more potent than class 1b antiarrhythmics.
Class Ia drugs have intermediate kinetics, so their fast-channel tissue conduction slowing effects may
or may not be evident on an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates. Class Ia drugs also
block repolarizing potassium channels, prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the
ECG, this effect is reflected as QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates. Class Ib drugs and class Ic
drugs do not block potassium channels directly.
The primary indications for all class I drugs are ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia
and ventricular fibrillation). Class Ia and class Ic drugs are also indicated for supraventricular
tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardias) (1).
Adverse effects of class I drugs include proarrhythmia, a drug-related arrhythmia worse than the
arrhythmia being treated, which is the most worrisome adverse effect. All class I drugs may worsen
ventricular tachycardia (VT). Class I drugs also tend to depress ventricular contractility. Because these
adverse effects are more likely to occur in patients with a structural heart disorder, class I drugs are
usually used only in patients who do not have a structural heart disorder or in patients who have a
structural heart disorder but who have no other therapeutic alternatives. There are other adverse
effects of class I drugs that are specific to the subclass or individual drug.
Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs
Class Ia drugs have kinetics that are intermediate between the fast kinetics of class Ib and the slow
kinetics of class Ic. Their fast-channel tissue conduction slowing effects may or may not be evident on an
ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates. Class Ia drugs block repolarizing potassium

channels, prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the ECG, this effect is reflected as
QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates.
The primary indications for class Ia drugs are
Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia)
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation)
Class Ia drugs also are used for suppression of atrial or ventricular premature beats.
Class Ia drugs may cause torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Class Ia drugs may organize and
slow atrial tachyarrhythmias enough to permit 1:1 AV conduction with marked acceleration of the
ventricular response rate.
Class Ib antiarrhythmic drugs
Class Ib drugs have fast kinetics; they express their electrophysiologic effects only at fast heart rates.
Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel
tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very potent antiarrhythmics and have minimal effects
on atrial tissue. Class Ib drugs do not block potassium channels directly.
Class Ib drugs are used for the suppression of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia,
ventricular fibrillation) and ventricular premature beats (2).
Class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs
Class Ic drugs have slow kinetics; they express their electrophysiologic effects at all heart rates. Thus, an
ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal heart rates usually shows fast-channel tissue conduction
slowing. Class Ic drugs are more potent antiarrhythmics than class Ib drugs. Class Ic drugs do not block
potassium channels directly.

marked acceleration of the ventricular response rate.

Class II Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class II antiarrhythmic drugs are the
Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers affect predominantly slow-channel tissues (sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes), where
they decrease rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness. Thus, heart
rate is slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV node transmits rapid atrial depolarizations at a
lower frequency.
Class II drugs are used primarily to treat supraventricular tachycardias, including sinus tachycardia, and
to slow the ventricular response rates to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. These drugs are also used to
treat ventricular tachycardia to raise the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and reduce the ventricular
proarrhythmic effects of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.
Beta-blockers are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include lassitude, sleep disturbance, and
gastrointestinal upset. These medications are contraindicated in patients with asthma.
Class III Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class III drugs are
Membrane-stabilizing drugs, primarily potassium channel blockers
Class III drugs prolong action potential duration and refractoriness in slow- and fast-channel tissues.
Thus, the capacity of all cardiac tissues to transmit impulses at high frequencies is reduced, but
conduction velocity is not significantly affected. Because the action potential is prolonged, rate of
automaticity is reduced. The predominant effect on the ECG is QT-interval prolongation.
These medications are used to treat supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Class III drugs
have a risk of ventricular proarrhythmia, particularly torsades de pointes VT, and are not used in
patients with torsades de pointes VT.

Class IV Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Class IV drugs are
Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
These medications depress calcium-dependent action potentials in slow-channel tissues and thus
decrease the rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness. Heart rate is
slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV node transmits rapid atrial depolarizations at a lower
frequency. These medications are used primarily to treat supraventricular tachycardias. They may also
be used to slow the ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. One form of VT (left
septal, Belhassen, or fascicular VT) can be treated with verapamil.
