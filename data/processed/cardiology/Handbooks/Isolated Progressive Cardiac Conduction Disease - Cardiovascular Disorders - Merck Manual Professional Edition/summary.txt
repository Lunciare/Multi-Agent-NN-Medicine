Isolated progressive cardiac conduction disease (PCCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders that involve progressively worsening defects in cardiac conduction, including sinus node dysfunction, varying degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block and/or His-Purkinje system conduction delays or blocks. PCCD may be Structural: Accompanied or followed by structural heart disease (eg, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy) Isolated: Occurring in a structurally normal heart The most common form of PCCD associated with a cardiomyopathy is one in which mutations in LMNA are present (see Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathies). Some such patients present with an apparently structurally normal heart but subsequently develop cardiomyopathy.
