Isolated Progressive Cardiac Conduction Disease

encodes the Nav1.5 channel responsible for the inward sodium (INa) current. Inheritance is typically in an autosomal dominant pattern. Overlap syndromes with the long QT syndrome and with Brugada syndrome have been reported. The disorder is manifest by ECG changes including prolonged PR interval, widened P wave, widened QRS complex, AV block, right bundle branch block, left anterior hemiblock, left posterior hemiblock, left bundle branch block, or nonspecific interventricular conduction block. Patients also have a higher risk of sudden death. Patients should have cardiac imaging (eg, echocardiography, MRI) to detect any structural disorders. Patients without structural disease should have genetic testing, particularly if they have a family history of sudden cardiac death or of need for pacemaker implantation at a young age. If testing reveals a genetic abnormality, family members should be screened with ECG and genetic testing. Treatment is with a pacemaker following the usual indications for pacemaker implantation, including third-degree AV block or symptomatic second-degree AV block. Because PCCD is progressive, there is a consensus recommendation that pacemakers may also be useful in patients with isolated PCCD who have bifasicular block.
