Isolated progressive cardiac conduction disease (PCCD) refers to a group of genetic disorders that involve progressively worsening defects in cardiac conduction, including sinus node dysfunction, varying degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block and/or His-Purkinje system conduction delays or blocks. PCCD may be Structural: Accompanied or followed by structural heart disease (eg, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy) Isolated: Occurring in a structurally normal heart The most common form of PCCD associated with a cardiomyopathy is one in which mutations in LMNA are present (see Lamin A/C Cardiomyopathies). Some such patients present with an apparently structurally normal heart but subsequently develop cardiomyopathy. Patients with isolated PCCD typically present with early-onset (age < 50 years) progressive conduction system disease, which manifests as one or more of the following: Sinus node dysfunction Slowed intra-atrial conduction AV node disease His-Purkinje system disease (ie, bundle branch blocks or fascicular blocks) A degenerative form, in which the conducting system becomes sclerotic, has been referred to as Lenègre-Lev disease Isolated PCCD results predominantly from mutations in SCN5A, the gene that encodes the Nav1.5 channel responsible for the inward sodium (INa) current. Inheritance is typically in an autosomal dominant pattern. Overlap syndromes with the long QT syndrome and with Brugada syndrome
