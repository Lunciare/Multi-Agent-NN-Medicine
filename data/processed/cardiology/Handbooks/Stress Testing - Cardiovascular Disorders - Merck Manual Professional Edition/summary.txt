In stress testing, the heart is monitored by electrocardiography (ECG) and often imaging studies during an induced episode of increased cardiac demand so that ischemic areas potentially at risk of infarction can be identified. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a blood supply that is adequate at rest may be inadequate when cardiac demands are increased by exercise or other forms of stress. Heart rate is increased to 85% of age-predicted maximum (target heart rate) or until symptoms develop, whichever occurs first. Stress testing is used for Diagnosing coronary artery disease Stratifying risk in patients with known CAD Monitoring patients with known CAD Stress testing is less invasive and less expensive than cardiac catheterization, and it detects abnormalities of blood flow; however, it is less accurate for diagnosis in patients with a low pretest likelihood of CAD. It can define the functional significance of abnormalities in coronary artery anatomy identified with coronary angiography during catheterization.
