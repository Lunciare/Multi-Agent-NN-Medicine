of deconditioning. Echocardiography Echocardiography can usually distinguish athlete’s heart from cardiomyopathies (see table Features Distinguishing Athlete's Heart From Cardiomyopathy), but the distinction is not always clear because there is a continuum from physiologic to pathologic cardiac enlargement. The zone of overlap between athlete’s heart and cardiomyopathy is left ventricular septal thickness: In males, 13 to 15 mm In females, 11 to 13 mm In this overlap area, the presence of mitral valve systolic anterior motion strongly suggests hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also, diastolic indexes may be abnormal in cardiomyopathy but are usually normal in athlete's heart. In general, echocardiographic changes correlate poorly with level of training and cardiovascular performance. Trace mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are commonly detected. Of note, reduction of physical training will result in regression of cardiac enlargement in patients with athlete's heart but not in those with cardiomyopathy. Exercise echocardiography may help to differentiate athlete's heart from dilated cardiomyopathy. In one study, a change during exercise in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 11% and a peak LVEF ≤ 63% during exercise predicted dilated cardiomyopathy with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 92% (2). 3/7 Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging Although confirmation in large studies is pending,
