Athlete’s Heart

a systematic review and meta-analysis. Br J Sports Med 55(21):1233–1238, 2021. doi:10.1136/bjsports-2021- 103994 Key Points Intensive physical exercise increases left ventricular muscle mass, wall thickness, and chamber size, but systolic function and diastolic function remain normal. Resting heart rate is slow and there may be a systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border, and a third heart sound (S3); a fourth heart sound (S4) should be considered abnormal. ECG shows bradycardia and signs of hypertrophy and sometimes other findings such as sinus arrhythmia, atrial or ventricular ectopy, and first or second degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Structural and ECG changes due to athlete's heart are asymptomatic; the presence of cardiovascular symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations) or third-degree AV block should prompt a search for an underlying cardiac disorder.
