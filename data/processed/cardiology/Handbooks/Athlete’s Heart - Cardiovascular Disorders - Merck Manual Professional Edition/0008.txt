Distinguishing Athlete's Heart From Cardiomyopathy Feature Athlete’s Heart Cardiomyopathy In males, < 13 mm In males, > 15 mm Left ventricular septal thickness* In females, < 11 mm In females, > 13 mm Left ventricular end- < 60 mm > 70 mm 4/7 Feature Athlete’s Heart Cardiomyopathy diastolic diameter† Diastolic function Normal (E:A ratio > 1‡) Abnormal (E:A ratio < 1) Asymmetric (in Septal hypertrophy Symmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) Family history None May be present Blood pressure response Normal or reduced systolic Normal to exercise blood pressure response Left ventricular No left ventricular Deconditioning hypertrophy regression hypertrophy regression * A value of 13 to 15 mm in men and 11 to 13 mm in women is indeterminate. † A value of 60 to 70 mm is indeterminate. ‡ E:A ratio = ratio of early to late atrial transmitral flow velocity. Treatment of Athlete’s Heart Possibly a period of deconditioning to monitor LV regression No treatment is required, although 3 months of deconditioning may be needed to monitor LV regression as a way of distinguishing this syndrome from cardiomyopathy. Such deconditioning can greatly interfere with an athlete’s life and may meet with resistance. Prognosis for Athlete’s Heart Although gross structural changes resemble
