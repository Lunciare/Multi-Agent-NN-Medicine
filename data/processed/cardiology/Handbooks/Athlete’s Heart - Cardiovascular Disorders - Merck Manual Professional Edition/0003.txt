A third heart sound (S3) due to early, rapid diastolic ventricular filling Hyperdynamic carotid pulses These signs reflect structural cardiac changes that are adaptive for intense exercise. The presence of a fourth heart sound (S4) is almost always abnormal in an athlete. Diagnosis of Athlete’s Heart Clinical evaluation Usually ECG Sometimes echocardiography Rarely, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging Rarely, stress testing Findings are typically detected during routine screening or during evaluation of unrelated symptoms. Most athletes do not require extensive testing, although ECG is often warranted. If symptoms suggest a cardiac disorder (eg, palpitations, chest pain), ECG, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing are done. Athlete's heart is a diagnosis of exclusion; it must be distinguished from disorders that cause similar findings but are life threatening (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease [eg, coronary artery disease], arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy—[1]). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging may be helpful when findings from other diagnostic modalities are inconclusive. Sometimes a trial of deconditioning is required to differentiate athlete's heart from cardiomyopathy. ECG Numerous changes in rhythm and ECG morphology can occur; they correlate poorly with level of training and cardiovascular performance. The most common ECG finding is 2/7 Sinus bradycardia Rarely, heart
