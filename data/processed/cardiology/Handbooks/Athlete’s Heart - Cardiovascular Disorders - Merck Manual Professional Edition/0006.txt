≤ 63% during exercise predicted dilated cardiomyopathy with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 92% (2). 3/7 Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging Although confirmation in large studies is pending, data so far suggest that CMR may also help differentiate athlete's heart from cardiomyopathy. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3), CMR may identify focal hypertrophy not identified on the echocardiogram, particularly in the apex, anterior free wall, and posterior septum. Delayed imaging after injection of contrast may show a typical pattern of mid-wall fibrosis in some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly in left ventricular wall segments that exhibit maximal hypertrophy. However, this finding is absent in up to 60% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Delayed enhancement on CMR is also evident in nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and may help differentiate dilated cardiomyopathy from athlete's heart. However, the finding is absent in 68% of patients with genetically proven dilated cardiomyopathy. T1 and T2 mapping, extracellular volume quantification, late gadolinium enhancement, deformation imaging and diffusion tensor imaging are all promising techniques to differentiate between athlete's heart and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further studies are required to better determine the ability of these techniques to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in athletes (4, 5). Although exercise capacity as measured by
