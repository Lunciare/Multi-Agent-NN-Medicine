way of distinguishing this syndrome from cardiomyopathy. Such deconditioning can greatly interfere with an athlete’s life and may meet with resistance. Prognosis for Athlete’s Heart Although gross structural changes resemble those in some cardiac disorders, generally no adverse effects are apparent. However, numerous studies have found an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation in patients who participate in endurance and mixed sports (1). Athletes younger than 55 years are at higher risk (2). The dose of exercise at which the risk increases has not been documented in high quality studies. In most cases, structural changes and bradycardia regress with detraining, although up to 20% of elite athletes have residual chamber enlargement, raising questions, in the absence of long-term data, about whether athlete’s heart is truly benign.
