oxygen transport. Despite these changes, systolic function and diastolic function remain normal. Structural changes in females are typically less than those in males of the same age, body size, and level of training (1, 2). The prevalence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores greater than or equal to 100 Agatston units appears to be increased in people performing high levels of physical activity (equal to or more than 3000 MET [metabolic equivalent of task]-minutes/week) than those performing lower levels of physical activity. However, this does not translate into a greater risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality . The data support that even in the presence of CAC, the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality is less with high levels of physical activity than with lower levels of physical activity (3). Symptoms and Signs of Athlete’s Heart There are no symptoms. Signs vary but may include Bradycardia An LV impulse that is laterally displaced, enlarged, and increased in amplitude A systolic ejection (flow) murmur at the left lower sternal border A third heart sound (S3) due to early, rapid diastolic ventricular filling Hyperdynamic carotid pulses These signs reflect structural cardiac changes that are adaptive for intense exercise. The presence of
