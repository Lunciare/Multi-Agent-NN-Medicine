Athlete’s Heart

Numerous changes in rhythm and ECG morphology can occur; they correlate poorly with level of training and cardiovascular performance. The most common ECG finding is 2/7 Sinus bradycardia Rarely, heart rate is < 40 beats/minute. Sinus arrhythmia often accompanies the slow heart rate. Resting bradycardia may also predispose to Atrial or ventricular ectopy (including couplets and bursts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia); pauses after ectopic beats do not exceed 4 seconds Wandering atrial (supraventricular) pacemaker Other ECG findings that may occur include First-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (in up to one-third of athletes) Second-degree AV block (mainly type I); this finding occurs during rest and disappears with exercise High-voltage QRS with inferolateral T-wave changes (reflecting LV hypertrophy) Deep anterolateral T-wave inversion Incomplete right bundle branch block However, third-degree AV block is abnormal and should be investigated thoroughly. These ECG and rhythm changes have not been associated with adverse clinical events, suggesting that various arrhythmias are not abnormal in athletes. The arrhythmias are usually abolished or substantially reduced after a relatively brief period of deconditioning. Echocardiography Echocardiography can usually distinguish athlete’s heart from cardiomyopathies (see table Features Distinguishing Athlete's Heart From Cardiomyopathy), but the distinction is not always clear because there is a
