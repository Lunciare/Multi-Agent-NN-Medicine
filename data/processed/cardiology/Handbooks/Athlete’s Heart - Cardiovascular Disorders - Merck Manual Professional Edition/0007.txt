heart and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further studies are required to better determine the ability of these techniques to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in athletes (4, 5). Although exercise capacity as measured by stress testing does not differentiate between athlete's heart and dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced cardiac contractile reserve with exercise observed on CMR imaging may be useful in establishing a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy in an athlete. Stress testing During exercise stress testing, heart rate remains lower than normal at submaximal stress and increases appropriately and comparably to heart rate in nonathletes at maximal stress; it rapidly recovers after exercise. Blood pressure response is normal if: Systolic blood pressure increases Diastolic blood pressure falls Mean blood pressure stays relatively constant Many resting ECG changes decrease or disappear during exercise; this finding is unique to athlete's heart, distinguishing it from pathologic conditions. However, pseudonormalization of T-wave inversions could reflect myocardial ischemia and thus warrants further investigation in older athletes. Also, a normal exercise stress test result does not rule out a cardiomyopathy.
