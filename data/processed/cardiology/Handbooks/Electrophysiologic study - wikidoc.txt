Electrophysiologic study
Editor-In-Chief: C. Michael Gibson, M.S., M.D. [1] (mailto:charlesmichaelgibson@gmail.com)

Additional advantages of using these veins is that they are all part of the central venous system and
do not have the valves that peripheral veins contain. The advantage of approaching the heart via
the venous system as opposed to via the arterial system is that the risk of stroke is dramatically less
if the arterial system is not used. Also, since the venous system is lower pressure, complications
such as hematomas are typically easier to manage.
