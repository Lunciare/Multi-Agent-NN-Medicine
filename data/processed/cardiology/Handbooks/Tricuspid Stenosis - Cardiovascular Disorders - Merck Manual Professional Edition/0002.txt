Tricuspid Stenosis

occurs. Symptoms and Signs of Tricuspid Stenosis Patients with mild tricuspid stenosis have no symptoms. The only symptoms of severe tricuspid stenosis are fluttering discomfort in the neck (due to giant a waves in the jugular pulse), fatigue and cold skin (due to low cardiac output), and right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort (due to an enlarged liver). The primary visible sign is a giant flickering a wave with gradual y descent in the jugular veins. Jugular venous distention may occur, increasing with inspiration (Kussmaul sign). The face may become darker or flushed (a purple, red or pink skin tone in patients with light skin, or a deeper skin tone in patients with dark skin), and scalp veins may dilate when the patient is recumbent (suffusion sign). Hepatic congestion and peripheral edema may occur. Auscultation Soft opening snap Mid-diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation On auscultation, tricuspid stenosis is often inaudible but may produce a soft opening snap and a mid- diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation. The murmur becomes louder and longer with maneuvers that increase venous return (exercise, inspiration, leg-raising, Müller maneuver [forced inhalation across a closed airway]) and softer and shorter with maneuvers that decrease venous return (standing, Valsalva maneuver).
