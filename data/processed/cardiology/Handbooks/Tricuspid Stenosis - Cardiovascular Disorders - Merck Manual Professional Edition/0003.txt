with maneuvers that increase venous return (exercise, inspiration, leg-raising, Müller maneuver [forced inhalation across a closed airway]) and softer and shorter with maneuvers that decrease venous return (standing, Valsalva maneuver). Findings of tricuspid stenosis often coexist with those of mitral stenosis and are less prominent. The murmurs can be distinguished clinically (see table Distinguishing the Murmurs of Tricuspid Stenosis and Mitral Stenosis ). Diagnosis of Tricuspid Stenosis Echocardiography Diagnosis of tricuspid stenosis is suspected based on history and physical examination and confirmed by Doppler echocardiography showing an elevated pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve. Two- dimensional echocardiography shows thickened leaflets with reduced movement and right atrial (RA) enlargement. Severe tricuspid stenosis is characterized by: Mean forward gradient across the valve > 5 mm Hg (1, 2) ECG may show RA enlargement out of proportion to RV hypertrophy and tall, peaked P waves in inferior leads and V1. Chest radiograph may show a dilated superior vena cava and RA enlargement, indicated by an enlarged right heart border. Liver enzymes are elevated because of passive hepatic congestion. Cardiac catheterization is rarely indicated for evaluation of tricuspid stenosis. When catheterization is indicated (eg, to evaluate coronary anatomy), findings include elevated RA pressure with
