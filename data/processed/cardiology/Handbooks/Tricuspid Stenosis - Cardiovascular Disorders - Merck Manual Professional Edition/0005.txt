Tricuspid Stenosis

murmur becomes louder and longer with maneuvers that increase venous return (eg, exercise, inspiration, leg-raising) and softer and shorter with maneuvers that decrease venous return (standing, Valsalva maneuver). Treatment includes diuretics and aldosterone antagonists; surgical repair or replacement is rarely needed.
