because of passive hepatic congestion. Cardiac catheterization is rarely indicated for evaluation of tricuspid stenosis. When catheterization is indicated (eg, to evaluate coronary anatomy), findings include elevated RA pressure with a slow fall in early diastole and a diastolic pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve. Treatment of Tricuspid Stenosis Diuretics and aldosterone antagonists Rarely valve repair or replacement Evidence to guide treatment of tricuspid stenosis is scarce. Patients with symptoms who are not undergoing valve replacement or repair should receive a low-salt diet, diuretics, and aldosterone antagonists. Patients with severe tricuspid stenosis should undergo intervention if they are symptomatic or if cardiac surgery is being performed for other reasons. Percutaneous balloon tricuspid commissurotomy might be considered for severe TS in patients who cannot undergo surgical repair but only if there is no accompanying tricuspid regurgitation. Key Points Tricuspid stenosis is almost always due to rheumatic fever; tricuspid regurgitation and mitral stenosis are often also present. Heart sounds include a soft opening snap and a mid-diastolic rumble with presystolic accentuation; the murmur becomes louder and longer with maneuvers that increase venous return (eg, exercise, inspiration, leg-raising) and softer and shorter with maneuvers that decrease venous return (standing, Valsalva maneuver). Treatment includes
