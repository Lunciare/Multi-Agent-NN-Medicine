The decision to treat an arrhythmia depends on its symptoms and its potential severity. Treatment is

Such systems usually include a right atrial lead, right ventricular lead, and left ventricular lead. Biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (BiV-CRT) is a form of CRT that typically involves pacing of the right and left ventricles simultaneously. Leads may be placed transvenously or surgically via thoracotomy (1). Cardiac resynchronization may also be accomplished by conduction system pacing (His bundle or left bundle branch area) (2). In patients with heart failure who have New York Heart Association (see table NYHA classification) class II, III, or IV symptoms, CRT can reduce hospitalization for heart failure and reduce all-cause mortality (1). However, there is little to no benefit in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, right bundle branch block, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, or only mild prolongation of QRS duration (< 150 millisecond).
