be present with patchy myocarditis. Doppler or color Doppler echocardiography accurately detects valvular disorders and shunts. The combination of Doppler evaluation of mitral inflow with tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus can help identify and quantify LV diastolic dysfunction and LV filling pressures. Measuring LVEF can distinguish between predominant HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%) and HFrEF (EF ≤ 40%). It is important to re-emphasize that heart failure can occur with a normal LVEF. Speckle-tracking echocardiography, a measure of strain, is useful in detecting subclinical systolic dysfunction and specific patterns of myocardial dysfunction and may provide useful information regarding the pattern of myocardial involvement of cardiomyopathy, and therefore information about the cause. Radionuclide imaging also can help assess systolic and diastolic function, previous myocardial infarction, and inducible ischemia or myocardial hibernation. It is used most commonly to assess the presence and/or severity of ischemic heart disease and can also be used to quantify left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac MRI using late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE, also called fibrosis or scar imaging) is useful to evaluate the cause of myocardial disease and to detect focal and diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Cardiac amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemachromatosis, and myocarditis are causes of HF that can be
