Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is not able to meet the metabolic demands of the body due to a structural and or functional cardiac abnormality, leading to low cardiac output, elevated ventricular filling pressure, or both. Acute heart failure includes both new-onset heart failure and acute decompensated heart failure (an exacerbation of chronic heart failure). In both, there are progressive signs or symptoms of cardiac congestion, low output, or both.. Timely medical intervention, directed at reducing symptoms and managing the cause, is necessary. (See also Overview of Heart Failure.) Acute heart failure refers not only to the timing of clinical presentation within the overall disease course, but the importance of timely medical intervention (1). It may include new-onset (de novo) heart failure or acute decompensation of previously diagnosed heart failure.
