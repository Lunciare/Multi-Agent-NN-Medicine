with HFrEF (at similar degrees of symptoms), and up to 30% of patients with acute HFpEF have a BNP level below the commonly used threshold of 100 pg/mL (100 ng/L). Obesity, a common comorbidity in HF, is associated with reduced BNP production and increased BNP clearance, resulting in lower levels. Besides BNP, recommended blood tests include complete blood count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), electrolytes (including magnesium and calcium), glucose, albumin, ferritin, and liver tests. Thyroid function tests are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation and for selected, especially older, patients. Other tests Thoracic ultrasound is a noninvasive method of detecting pulmonary congestion in patients with heart failure. Sonographic "comet tail artifact" on thoracic ultrasound corresponds to the radiographic finding of Kerley B lines. Coronary angiography or CT coronary angiography is indicated when coronary artery disease is suspected or the etiology of HF is uncertain. Cardiac catheterization with intracardiac pressure measurements (invasive hemodynamic assessment) may be helpful in the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathies and constrictive pericarditis. Invasive hemodynamic measurements are also very helpful when the diagnosis of HF is equivocal, particularly in patients with HFpEF. In addition, perturbing the cardiovascular system (eg, exercise testing, volume challenge, medication challenges [eg, nitroglycerin,
