Acute Heart Failure

preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or heart failure with minimally reduced ejection fraction (HRmrEF). A pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex may occur, particularly if the LV is significantly dilated. Jugular venous distention indicates elevated right atrial pressure. Pulsus alternans (an pulse alternating between strong 2/11 and weak beats) may accompany severely reduced LV systolic function and has historically been considered a poor prognostic sign (1, 2). Pulmonary findings include early inspiratory basilar crackles that do not clear with coughing and, if pleural effusion is present, dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds at the lung base(s). Wheezing or stridor may be present due to inflammation of smaller airways as a result of pulmonary edema, or due to compression of larger airways by enlarged cardiac structures (ie, the left atrium or great vessels). Diagnosis of Acute Heart Failure History and physical examination Chest radiograph Echocardiography Laboratory evaluation, including neurohormonal biomarkers such as brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) levels Sometimes ECG, cardiac radionuclide scan, cardiac MRI, cardiac catheterization, and other tests for etiology and to assess effect on end-organ function Clinical findings (eg, exertional dyspnea or fatigue, orthopnea, edema, tachycardia, pulmonary crackles, S3, jugular venous distention) suggest
