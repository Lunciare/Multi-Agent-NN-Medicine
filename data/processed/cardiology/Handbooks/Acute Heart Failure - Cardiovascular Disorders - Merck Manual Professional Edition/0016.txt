Acute Heart Failure

does not respond to medication, permanent pacemaker insertion with complete or partial ablation of the atrioventricular node, or other atrial fibrillation ablation procedures, may be considered to restore a sinus or regular rhythm in selected patients. Isolated ventricular premature beats, which are common in HF, do not require specific treatment, although rarely very frequent ventricular premature beats (> 15,000/day) have been shown to precipitate heart failure (that reverses with suppression). However, optimization of HF treatments and correction of electrolyte abnormalities (especially of potassium and magnesium) reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 9/11 Sustained ventricular tachycardia that persists despite correction of cause (eg, low potassium or magnesium, ischemia) and optimal medical treatment of HF may require an antiarrhythmic medication. Amiodarone, beta-blockers, and dofetilide are the medications of choice because other antiarrhythmics have adverse proarrhythmic effects when LV systolic dysfunction is present. Because amiodarone increases digoxin and warfarin levels, digoxin and warfarin doses should be decreased by half or stopped. Serum digoxin level and INR (international normalized ratio) level should be routinely monitored. However, medication toxicity can occur even at therapeutic levels. Because long-term use of amiodarone can cause adverse effects, a low dose is used when possible; blood tests for liver
