also very helpful when the diagnosis of HF is equivocal, particularly in patients with HFpEF. In addition, perturbing the cardiovascular system (eg, exercise testing, volume challenge, medication challenges [eg, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside]) can be very helpful during invasive hemodynamic testing to help diagnose HF. Endomyocardial biopsy is sometimes done when an infiltrative cardiomyopathy or acute giant cell myocarditis is strongly suspected but cannot be confirmed with noninvasive imaging (eg, cardiac MRI). Treatment of Acute Heart Failure Pharmacotherapy 7/11 Respiratory and other organ system support as necessary Identification and treatment of cause Sometimes device therapy (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy, mechanical circulatory support) Sometimes cardiac transplantation Multidisciplinary care Immediate inpatient treatment is required for patients with acute or worsening heart failure (HF) due to certain disorders (eg, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation with a very rapid ventricular rate, severe hypertension, acute valvular regurgitation), as well as for patients with pulmonary edema, severe symptoms, new-onset HF, or HF unresponsive to outpatient treatment. Patients with mild exacerbations of previously diagnosed HF can be treated at home. The primary goal is to diagnose and to correct or treat the disorder that led to heart failure. Acute treatment goals include relieving symptoms and improving hemodynamics
