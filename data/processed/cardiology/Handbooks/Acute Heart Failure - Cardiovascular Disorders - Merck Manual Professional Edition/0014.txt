human pregnancy hormone relaxin-2) has been studied, but 8/11 benefits were not shown in a large international randomized study (7). Omecamtiv mecarbil (an oral cardiac myosin activator) reduced a composite endpoint of heart failure event or death but did not reduce overall cardiovascular mortality in a large randomized trial. (8). See Medications for Heart Failure for more detailed information on specific medication classes. Positive airway pressure via high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, or bi-level positive airway pressure, or endotracheal intubation generally reduce left ventricular afterload by increasing intrathoracic pressure and reducing transmural LV pressure. Arrhythmia treatment Because arrhythmias can worsen heart failure, it is important to identify and treat the cause of any arrhythmia. Electrolytes are normalized. Atrial and ventricular rates are controlled. Sometimes antiarrhythmic medications are given. Sinus tachycardia, a common compensatory change in heart failure, usually subsides when HF treatment is effective. If it does not, associated causes (eg, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary emboli, fever, anemia, pain) should be sought. If sinus tachycardia persists despite correction of causes, a beta- blocker, given in gradually increasing doses, may help selected patients. However, lowering heart rate with a beta-blocker can be detrimental to patients with advanced HFpEF (eg, restrictive
