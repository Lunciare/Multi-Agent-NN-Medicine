or low, depending on the changes in cardiac output, volume status, systemic vascular resistance due to the underlying disease, and the compensatory response. Patients with severe LV failure may appear visibly dyspneic or cyanotic, hypotensive, and confused or agitated because of hypoxia and poor cerebral perfusion. Some of these less specific symptoms (eg, confusion) are more common in older patients. Central cyanosis (affecting all of the body, including warm areas such as the tongue and mucous membranes) reflects severe hypoxemia. Peripheral cyanosis of the lips, fingers, and toes reflects low blood flow with increased oxygen extraction. If vigorous massage improves nail bed color, cyanosis may be peripheral; increasing local blood flow does not improve color if cyanosis is central. Cardiac findings in acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) include: Diffuse, sustained, and laterally displaced apical impulse Audible and occasionally palpable third (S3) and fourth (S4) heart sounds Accentuated pulmonic component (P2) of the second heart sound (S2) These abnormal heart sounds also can occur in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or heart failure with minimally reduced ejection fraction (HRmrEF). A pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex may occur, particularly if the LV is significantly
