monitored. However, medication toxicity can occur even at therapeutic levels. Because long-term use of amiodarone can cause adverse effects, a low dose is used when possible; blood tests for liver function and thyroid-stimulating hormone are done every 6 months. If the chest radiograph is abnormal or dyspnea worsens significantly, chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests are done yearly to check for pulmonary fibrosis. For sustained ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may be required; to reduce risk of sudden death, an oral loading dose is given twice a day for 1 to 3 weeks until rhythm control is adequate, then dose is decreased over 1 month to a once daily maintenance dose. Device therapy and mechanical circulatory support Device therapy, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), is primarily used for chronic heart failure. However, CRT may provide acute setting for select patients, when refractory arrhythmia is causing or exacerbating the heart failure. Ultrafiltration (venovenous filtration) can be useful in selected hospitalized patients with severe cardiorenal syndrome and volume overload refractory to diuretics. However, ultrafiltration should not be used routinely because evidence does not clearly show long-term clinical benefit (10). An intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon pump (IABP) is helpful in selected patients
