Acute Heart Failure

treated at home. The primary goal is to diagnose and to correct or treat the disorder that led to heart failure. Acute treatment goals include relieving symptoms and improving hemodynamics (optimizing preload, balancing ventricular function with myocardial oxygen demand, and appropriately reducing afterload); avoiding hypokalemia, renal dysfunction, and symptomatic hypotension; and correcting neurohumoral activation. The mainstay of the pharmacologic management of acute heart failure is decongestive therapy with diuretics, namely loop diuretics (eg, furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) in either oral or intravenous form. (See Pulmonary Edema for a more detailed discussion.) Loop diuretics may be augmented by adding other diuretic classes such as thiazides (eg, metolazone). Afterload reduction using both oral and intravenous arterial vasodilators (eg, nitroprusside) can also be used to improve acute heart failure. Pulmonary vasodilators (eg, nitrate therapies) may also be used to reduce symptoms of congestion acutely. Low output heart failure, particularly in the setting of cardiogenic shock, often requires acute treatment with intravenous inotropic agents (eg, milrinone, dobutamine). Management of the cause of heart failure may also be indicated acutely, particularly for certain causes such as acute ischemia or arrhythmia. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HRrEF) in the acute setting, guideline-directed medical therapy with
