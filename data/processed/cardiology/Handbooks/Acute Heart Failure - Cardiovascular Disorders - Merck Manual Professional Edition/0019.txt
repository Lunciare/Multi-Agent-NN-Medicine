is based mainly on availability and local medical center experience. Please see device therapy for chronic heart failure for more information. Treatment references Prognosis for Acute Heart Failure 10/11 Generally, patients hospitalized for acute heart failure have a poor prognosis unless the cause is correctable. Overall combined 5-year survival is estimated at 34%, and 10-year survival at 17%, for patients with after an initial hospitalization for all types of heart failure (1). Key Points Consider acute heart failure in patients with worsening or new onset of exertional dyspnea or fatigue, orthopnea, and/or edema, particularly in those with a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, or valvular disorders or murmurs. Perform chest radiograph, ECG, brain (B-type) natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography, and additional testing as necessary. Treat with guideline-directed medical therapy appropriate to heart failure type prior to hospital discharge. Treatment includes control of underlying disorders, medications, sometimes implantable devices (cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable cardioverter- defibrillators), education and lifestyle changes.
