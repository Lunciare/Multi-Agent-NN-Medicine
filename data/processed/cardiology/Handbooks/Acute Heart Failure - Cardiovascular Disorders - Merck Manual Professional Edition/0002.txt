Acute Heart Failure

presentation (2, 3). Symptoms and Signs of Acute Heart Failure Manifestations of heart failure differ depending on the extent to which the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) are initially affected. Acute RV failure is discussed separately. History In LV failure, the most common symptoms are dyspnea and fatigue due to increased pulmonary venous pressures with or without pulmonary edema, and low cardiac output (at rest or inability to augment cardiac output during exertion). Dyspnea may be exertional or occur with rest, depending on the severity of disease. Cardiogenic shock, if present, may cause abnormalities in mental status and organ system function. Examination General examination may detect signs of systemic or cardiac disorders that cause or aggravate heart failure (eg, anemia, hyperthyroidism, alcohol use disorder, hemochromatosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid rate, mitral regurgitation). In LV failure, tachycardia and tachypnea may occur. Heart rate is generally increased as a compensatory mechanism, but bradycardia may occur during decompensation or if there is an underlying bradyarrhythmia. Blood pressure may be high, normal, or low, depending on the changes in cardiac output, volume status, systemic vascular resistance due to the underlying disease, and the compensatory response. Patients with severe LV failure may appear
