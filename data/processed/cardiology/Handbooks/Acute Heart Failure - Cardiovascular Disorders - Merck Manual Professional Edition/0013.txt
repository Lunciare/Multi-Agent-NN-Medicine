also be indicated acutely, particularly for certain causes such as acute ischemia or arrhythmia. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HRrEF) in the acute setting, guideline-directed medical therapy with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, beta-blocker, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist should be initiated once the patient is stabilized (1, 2). Medication doses are increased rapidly to target doses during the hospitalization and the first 6 weeks of follow-up to reduce the risk of both mortality and re-admission. See Chronic Heart Failure and Medications for Heart Failure for more detailed information on these medications. Other medications, such as nesiritide (a brain natriuretic peptide), levosimendan (a calcium-sensitizing inotrope), vesnarinone (an inotrope with multiple mechanisms), and ibopamine (a dopaminergic and adrenergic receptor agonist), may provide short-term symptomatic or hemodynamic improvement but do not improve, and in some cases may worsen, long-term outcomes compared to standard therapy (in randomized trials mortality was higher with vesnarinone and ibopamine and similar with nesiritide (3, 4, 5,6). Serelaxin (a recombinant form of the human pregnancy hormone relaxin-2) has been studied, but 8/11 benefits were not shown in a large international randomized study (7).
