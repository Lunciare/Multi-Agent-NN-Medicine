catheterization, and other tests for etiology and to assess effect on end-organ function Clinical findings (eg, exertional dyspnea or fatigue, orthopnea, edema, tachycardia, pulmonary crackles, S3, jugular venous distention) suggest heart failure but are usually not apparent early. Some similar symptoms may result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or recurrent pneumonia or may be erroneously attributed to obesity or old age. Suspicion for heart failure should be high in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, valvular disorders, or murmurs and should be moderate in any patient who is older or has diabetes. Chest radiograph, ECG, and an objective test of cardiac function, typically echocardiography, should be done (see figure Diagnosis of Heart Failure of Acute Onset). Blood tests, except for BNP levels, are not used for diagnosis but are useful for identifying cause and systemic effects (1, 2). Similarly, blood tests, including lactic acid, electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic function, may identify effects on tissue and organ perfusion. 3/11 Diagnosis of Acute Heart Failure Data from McDonagh TA, Metra M, Adamo M, et al: 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure: Developed by the Task Force for the diagnosis and
