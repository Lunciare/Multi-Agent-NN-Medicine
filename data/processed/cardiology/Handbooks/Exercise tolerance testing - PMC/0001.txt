Exercise tolerance testing

Exercise tolerance testing is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool for assessing patients with suspected or known ischaemic heart disease. During exercise, coronary blood flow must increase to meet the higher metabolic demands of the myocardium. Limiting the coronary blood flow may result in electrocardiographic changes. This article reviews the electrocardiographic responses that occur with exercise, both in normal subjects and in those with ischaemic heart disease. ST segment depression (horizontal or downsloping) is the most reliable indicator of exercise-induced ischaemia Clinical relevance Exercise tolerance testing (also known as exercise testing or exercise stress testing) is used routinely in evaluating patients who present with chest pain, in patients who have chest pain on exertion, and in patients with known ischaemic heart disease. 1/16 Diagnostic indications for exercise testing Assessment of chest pain in patients with intermediate probability for coronary artery disease Arrhythmia provocation Assessment of symptoms (for example, presyncope) occurring during or after exercise Prognostic indications for exercise testing Risk stratification after myocardial infarction Risk stratification in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Evaluation of revascularisation or drug treatment Evaluation of exercise tolerance and cardiac function Assessment of cardiopulmonary function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or heart failure Assessment of treatment for
