the test the electrocardiogram machine provides a continuous record of the heart rate, and the 12 lead electrocardiogram is recorded intermittently. Blood pressure must be measured before the exercise begins and at the end of each exercise stage. Blood pressure may fall or remain static during the initial stage of exercise. This is the result of an anxious patient relaxing. As the test progresses, however, systolic blood pressure should rise as exercise increases. A level of up to 225 mm Hg is normal in adults, although athletes can have higher levels. Diastolic blood pressure tends to fall slightly. The aim of the exercise is for the patient to achieve their maximum predicted heart rate. Safety If patients are carefully selected for exercise testing, the rate of serious complications (death or acute myocardial infarction) is about 1 in 10 000 tests (0.01%). The incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is about 1 in 5000. Full cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilities must be available, and test supervisors must be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Limitations The specificity of ST segment depression as the main indicator of myocardial ischaemia is limited. ST segment depression has been estimated to occur in up to 20% of normal individuals
