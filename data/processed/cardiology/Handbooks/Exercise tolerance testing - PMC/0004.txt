Exercise tolerance testing

testing. Maximum predicted heart rate By convention, the maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 (210 for women) minus the patient's age A satisfactory heart rate response is achieved on reaching 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate Attainment of maximum heart rate is a good prognostic sign The patient is first connected to the exercise electrocardiogram machine. Resting electrocardiograms, both sitting and standing, are recorded as electrocardiographic changes, particularly T wave inversion, may occur as the patient stands up to start walking on the treadmill. A short period of electrocardiographic recording during hyperventilation is also valuable for identifying changes resulting from hyperventilation rather than from coronary ischaemia. 3/16 Contraindications for exercise testing Acute myocardial infarction (within 4-6 days) Unstable angina (rest pain in previous 48 hours) Uncontrolled heart failure Acute myocarditis or pericarditis Acute systemic infection Deep vein thrombosis Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >220 mm Hg, diastolic >120 mm Hg) Severe aortic stenosis Severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Untreated life threatening arrhythmia Dissecting aneurysm Recent aortic surgery During the test the electrocardiogram machine provides a continuous record of the heart rate, and the 12 lead electrocardiogram is recorded intermittently. Blood pressure must be measured before the exercise begins
