The specificity of ST segment depression as the main indicator of myocardial ischaemia is limited. ST segment depression has been estimated to occur in up to 20% of normal individuals on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. There are many causes of ST segment changes apart from coronary 4/16 artery disease, which confound the result of exercise testing. If the resting electrocardiogram is abnormal, the usefulness of an exercise test is reduced or may even be precluded. Repolarisation and conduction abnormalities—for example, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, pre- excitation, and effects of digoxin—preclude accurate interpretation of the electrocardiogram during exercise, and as a result, other forms of exercise test (for example, adenosine or dobutamine scintigraphy) or angiography are required to evaluate this group of patients. Normal trace during exercise The J point (the point of inflection at the junction of the S wave and ST segment) becomes depressed during exercise, with maximum depression at peak exercise. The normal ST segment during exercise therefore slopes sharply upwards. By convention, ST segment depression is measured relative to the isoelectric baseline (between the T and P waves) at a point 60-80 ms after the J point. There is intraobserver variation in the measurement of
