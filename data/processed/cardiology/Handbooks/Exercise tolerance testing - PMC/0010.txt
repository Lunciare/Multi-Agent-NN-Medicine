Exercise tolerance testing

is one in which 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate is achieved with a physiological response in blood pressure and no associated ST segment depression. Findings suggesting high probability of coronary artery disease ⩽ Horizontal ST segment depression of 2 mm Downsloping ST segment depression Early positive response within six minutes Persistence of ST depression for more than six minutes into recovery ST segment depression in five or more leads Exertional hypotension A test that indicates a high probability of coronary artery disease is one in which there is substantial ST depression at low work rate associated with typical angina-like pain and a drop in blood pressure. Deeper and more widespread ST depression generally indicates more severe or extensive disease. 7/16 False positive results are common in women, reflecting the lower incidence of coronary artery disease in this group. Prognostic testing Exercise testing in patients who have just had a myocardial infarction is indicated only in those in whom a revascularisation procedure is contemplated; a less strenuous protocol is used. Testing provides prognostic information. Patients with low exercise capacity and hypotension induced by exercise have a poor prognosis. Asymptomatic ST segment depression after myocardial infarction is associated with a
