Exercise tolerance testing

nor specific for coronary artery disease. Stopping the test In clinical practice, patients rarely exercise for the full duration (21 minutes) of the Bruce protocol. However, completion of 9-12 minutes of exercise or reaching 85% of the maximum predicted changes 6/16 in heart rate is usually satisfactory. An exercise test should end when diagnostic criteria have been reached or when the patient's symptoms and signs dictate. The most common reason for stopping an exercise test is fatigue and breathlessness as a result of the unaccustomed exercise After the exercise has stopped, recording continues for up to 15 minutes. ST segment changes (or arrhythmias) may occur during the recovery period that were not apparent during exercise. Such changes generally carry the same significance as those occurring during exercise. Interpreting the results Diagnostic testing Any abnormal electrocardiographic changes must be interpreted in the light of the probability of coronary artery disease and physiological response to exercise. A normal test result or a result that indicates a low probability of coronary artery disease is one in which 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate is achieved with a physiological response in blood pressure and no associated ST segment depression.
