Exercise tolerance testing

indicator of the need for further investigation. In certain asymptomatic groups with particular occupations (for example, pilots) there is a role for regular exercise testing, though more stringent criteria for an abnormal test result (such as ST segment depression of >2 mm) should be applied. In the United Kingdom, drivers of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles have to achieve test results clearly specified by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency before they are considered fit to drive.
