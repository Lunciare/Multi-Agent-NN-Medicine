protocol is the most widely adopted protocol and has been extensively validated. The protocol has seven stages, each lasting three minutes, resulting in 21 minutes' exercise for a complete test. In stage 1 the patient walks at 1.7 mph (2.7 km) up a 10% incline. Energy expenditure is estimated to be 4.8 METs (metabolic equivalents) during this stage. The speed and incline increase with each stage. A modified Bruce protocol is used for exercise testing within one week of myocardial infarction. Workload Assessment of workload is measured by metabolic equivalents (METs) Workload is a reflection of oxygen consumption and hence energy use 1 MET is 3.5 ml oxygen/kg per minute, which is the oxygen consumption of an average individual at rest To carry out the activities of daily living an exercise intensity of at least 5 METs is required Preparing the patient β Blockers should be discontinued the day before the test, and dixogin (which may cause false positive results, with ST segment abnormalities) should be stopped one week before testing. Maximum predicted heart rate By convention, the maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 (210 for women) minus the patient's age A satisfactory heart rate response is achieved
