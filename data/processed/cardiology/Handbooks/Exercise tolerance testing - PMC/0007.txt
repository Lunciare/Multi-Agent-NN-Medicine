is measured relative to the isoelectric baseline (between the T and P waves) at a point 60-80 ms after the J point. There is intraobserver variation in the measurement of this ST segment depression, and therefore a computerised analysis that accompanies the exercise test can assist but not replace the clinical evaluation of the test. Normal electrocardiographic changes during exercise P wave increases in height R wave decreases in height J point becomes depressed ST segment becomes sharply upsloping Q-T interval shortens T wave decreases in height Abnormal changes during exercise The standard criterion for an abnormal ST segment response is horizontal (planar) or downsloping depression of >1 mm. If 0.5 mm of depression is taken as the standard, the sensitivity of the test increases and the specificity decreases (vice versa if 2 mm of depression is selected as the standard). 5/16 Reasons for stopping a test Electrocardiographic criteria Severe ST segment depression (>3 mm) ST segment elevation >1 mm in non-Q wave lead Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (unless the test is to assessment ventricular arrhythmia) Onset of ventricular tachycardia New atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia Development of new bundle branch block (if the test is primarily to detect underlying coronary
