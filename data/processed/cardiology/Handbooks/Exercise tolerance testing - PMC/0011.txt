used. Testing provides prognostic information. Patients with low exercise capacity and hypotension induced by exercise have a poor prognosis. Asymptomatic ST segment depression after myocardial infarction is associated with a more than 10-fold increase in mortality compared with a normal exercise test. Conversely, patients who reach stage 3 of a modified Bruce protocol with a blood pressure response of >30 mm Hg have an annual mortality of <2%. Exercise testing can also add prognostic information in patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography or coronary artery bypass graft. Rationale for testing Bayes's theorem of diagnostic probability states that the predictive value of an abnormal exercise test will vary according to the probability of coronary artery disease in the population under study Exercise testing is therefore usually performed in patients with an moderate probablility of coronary artery disease, rather than in those with a very low or high probability Screening Exercise testing of asymptomatic patients is controversial because of the high false positive rate in such individuals. Angina remains the most reliable indicator of the need for further investigation. In certain asymptomatic groups with particular occupations (for example, pilots) there is a role for regular exercise testing, though more stringent criteria for
