is to assessment ventricular arrhythmia) Onset of ventricular tachycardia New atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia Development of new bundle branch block (if the test is primarily to detect underlying coronary disease) New second or third degree heart block Cardiac arrest Symptoms and signs Patient requests stopping because of severe fatigue Severe chest pain, dyspnoea, or dizziness Fall in systolic blood pressure (>20 mm Hg) Rise in blood pressure (systolic >300 mm Hg, diastolic >130 mm Hg) Ataxia Other recognised abnormal responses to exercise include ST elevation of >1 mm, particularly in the absence of Q waves. This suggests severe coronary artery disease and is a sign of poor prognosis. T wave changes such as inversion and pseudo-normalisation (an inverted T wave that becomes upright) are non-specific changes. A highly specific sign for ischaemia is inversion of the U wave. As U waves are often difficult to identify, especially at high heart rates, this finding is not sensitive. The presence of extrasystoles that have been induced by exercise is neither sensitive nor specific for coronary artery disease. Stopping the test In clinical practice, patients rarely exercise for the full duration (21 minutes) of the Bruce protocol. However, completion of 9-12 minutes
