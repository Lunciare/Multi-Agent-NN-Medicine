not occur. Symptoms may remain mild for years or become severe enough to cause total disability. Generalized vasomotor dysfunction is common, and Raynaud phenomenon may occur. Diagnosis of erythromelalgia is clinical (1). Testing is performed to detect causes. Genetic testing for a causative SCN9A mutation may be performed in primary erythromelalgia. Because erythromelalgia may precede a myeloproliferative disorder by several years, repeated blood counts may be indicated. Differential diagnosis includes posttraumatic reflex dystrophies, shoulder-hand syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, causalgia, Fabry disease, and bacterial cellulitis. Treatment of erythromelalgia is warmth avoidance, rest, elevation of the extremity, and application of cold (2). For primary erythromelalgia, multiple topical (eg, lidocaine, combination of amitriptyline and ketamine, midodrine, capsaicin, menthol) or oral (eg, mexiletine, carbamazepine) medications may be used. For secondary erythromelalgia, the underlying disorder is treated; aspirin may be helpful when a myeloproliferative disorder is the cause. Gabapentin, venlafaxine, and sertraline may also be of benefit for both primary and secondary forms.
