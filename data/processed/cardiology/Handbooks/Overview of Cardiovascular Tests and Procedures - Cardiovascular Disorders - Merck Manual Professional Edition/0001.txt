Overview of Cardiovascular Tests and Procedures

Many noninvasive and invasive tests can delineate cardiac structure and function (see table Tests for Assessing Cardiac Anatomy and Function). Also, treatments can be administered during certain invasive diagnostic tests (eg, percutaneous coronary intervention during cardiac catheterization, radiofrequency ablation during electrophysiologic testing). TABLE Tests for Assessing Cardiac Anatomy and Function Application Tests Cardiac computed tomography (CT) Contrast ventriculography Echocardiography Gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Left ventricular function Multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) radionuclide imaging Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging Coronary angiography Exercise or pharmacologic stress testing with ECG, myocardial perfusion imaging, Coronary artery disease diagnosis and or echocardiography prognosis Intravascular ultrasonography Magnetic resonance angiography Multidetector CT coronary angiography Application Tests Gated MRI PET Resting SPECT myocardial perfusion Myocardial viability imaging Stress testing (using low-dose dobutamine) with echocardiography
