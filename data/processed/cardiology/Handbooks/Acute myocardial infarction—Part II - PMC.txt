This article describes the association of bundle branch block with acute myocardial infarction and the
differential diagnosis of ST segment elevation.
Bundle branch block
Acute myocardial infarction in the presence of bundle branch block carries a much worse prognosis
than acute myocardial infarction with normal ventricular conduction. This is true both for patients
whose bundle branch block precedes the infarction and for those in whom bundle branch block
develops as a result of the acute event. Thrombolytic treatment produces dramatic reductions in
mortality in these patients, and the greatest benefits are seen in those treated early. It is therefore
essential that the electrocardiographic identification of acute myocardial infarction in patients with
bundle branch block is both timely and accurate.
Left bundle branch block
Left bundle branch block is most commonly seen in patients with coronary artery disease,
hypertension, or dilated cardiomyopathy. The left bundle branch usually receives blood from the left
anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery and from the right coronary artery. When new

left bundle branch block occurs in the context of an acute myocardial infarction the infarct is usually
anterior and mortality is extremely high.
The electrocardiographic changes of acute myocardial infarction can be difficult to recognise when
left bundle branch block is present, and many of the conventional diagnostic criteria are not
applicable.
Abnormal ventricular depolarisation in left bundle branch block leads to secondary alteration in the
recovery process (see earlier article about bradycardias and atrioventricular conduction block). This
appears on the electrocardiogram as repolarisation changes in a direction opposite to that of the main
QRS deflection—that is, “appropriate discordance” between the QRS complex and the ST segment.
Thus leads with a predominantly negative QRS complex show ST segment elevation with positive T
waves (an appearance similar to that of acute anterior myocardial infarction).
Recognition of acute ischaemia
Many different electrocardiographic criteria have been proposed for identifying acute infarction in
left bundle branch block, but none has yet proved sufficiently sensitive to be useful in the acute
setting. However, some features are specific indicators of acute ischaemia.
ST segment elevation in association with a positive QRS complex, or ST segment depression in leads
V1, V2, or V3 (which have predominantly negative QRS complexes), is not expected in
uncomplicated left bundle branch block and is termed “inappropriate concordance.”
Inappropriate concordance strongly indicates acute ischaemia. Extreme ST segment elevation (⩾5
mm) in leads V1 and V2 also suggests acute ischaemia. If doubt persists, serial electrocardiograms
may show evolving changes.
Right bundle branch block
Right bundle branch block is most commonly seen in association with coronary artery disease, but in
many cases no organic heart disease is present. Uncomplicated right bundle branch block usually
causes little ST segment displacement and neither causes nor masks Q waves. Thus it does not
generally interfere with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, though it may mask a posterior
myocardial infarction.

The Brugada syndrome, which is familial, occurs particularly in young men and is
characterised by right bundle branch block and ST segment elevation in the right
precordial leads. There is a high incidence of death as a result of ventricular
tachyarrhythmias
Differential diagnosis of ST segment elevation
ST segment elevation has numerous possible causes. It may be a variant of normal or be due to
cardiac or non-cardiac disease. A correct diagnosis has obvious advantages for the patient but is also
particularly important before the use of thrombolytic treatment so that unnecessary exposure to the
risks of thrombolytic drugs can be avoided.
Causes of ST segment elevation
Acute myocardial infarction
“High take-off”
Benign early repolarisation
Left bundle branch block
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Ventricular aneurysm
Coronary vasospasm/Printzmetal's angina
Pericarditis
Brugada syndrome
Subarachnoid haemorrhage
The interpretation of ST segment elevation should always be made in the light of the clinical history
and examination findings. There are often clues in the electrocardiogram to differentiate the ST
segment elevation of acute ischaemia from other causes; for example, reciprocal changes (see last
week's article) may be present, which strongly indicate acute ischaemia. Serial electrocardiography or
continuous ST segment monitoring is also useful as ischaemic ST segment elevation evolves over
time. Old electrocardiograms are also useful for comparison.

Care is required when interpreting ST segment elevation in right sided chest leads as the ST
segments, particularly in leads V2 and V3, tend to be upsloping rather than flat. Isolated ST segment
elevation in these leads should be interpreted with caution. (For more information on “high take-off”
see the second article in this series.)
Benign early repolarisation
A degree of ST segment elevation is often present in healthy individuals, especially in young adults
and in people of African descent. This ST segment elevation is most commonly seen in the precordial
leads and is often most marked in lead V4. It is usually subtle but can sometimes be pronounced and
can easily be mistaken for pathological ST segment elevation.
Benign early repolarisation can be recognised by its characteristic electrocardiographic features:
elevation of the J point above the isoelectric line, with high take-off of the ST segment; a distinct
notch at the junction of the R wave and S wave, the J point; an upward concavity of the ST segment;
and symmetrical, upright T waves, often of large amplitude.
Antecedent myocardial infarction
The ST segment elevation associated with acute infarction usually resolves within two weeks of the
acute event, but it may persist indefinitely, especially when associated with anterior myocardial
infarction. In these patients a diagnosis of left ventricular aneurysm should be considered. Care
should be taken when interpreting the electrocardiogram within two weeks of an acute event, and
comparison with old electrocardiograms may be useful.
Acute pericarditis
Acute pericarditis is commonly mistaken for acute myocardial infarction as both cause chest pain and
ST segment elevation. In pericarditis, however, the ST segment elevation is diffuse rather than
localised, often being present in all leads except aVR and V1. The elevated ST segments are concave
upwards, rather than convex upwards as seen in acute infarction. Depression of the PR segment may
also be seen.
ST segment elevation in pericarditis is thought to be due to the associated subepicardial myocarditis.
The zone of injured tissue causes abnormal ST vectors; the end result is that leads facing the
epicardial surface record ST segment elevation, whereas those facing the ventricular cavity (leads
aVR and V1) record ST segment depression. The absence of widespread reciprocal change, the

presence of PR segment depression, and absence of Q waves may be helpful in distinguishing
pericarditis from acute myocardial infarction.
Other causes of ST segment elevation
The characteristic features of left ventricular hypertrophy are also often misinterpreted as being
caused by acute ischaemia. ST segment elevation in the precordial leads is a feature of left ventricular
hypertrophy and is due to secondary repolarisation abnormalities.
ST segment abnormalities are seen in association with intracranial (particularly subarachnoid)
haemorrhage. ST segment elevation or depression may be seen; a putative explanation is that altered
autonomic tone affects the duration of ventricular repolarisation, producing these changes.
Printzmetal's angina (vasospastic angina) is associated with ST segment elevation. As the changes are
due to coronary artery spasm rather than acute infarction, they may be completely reversible if
treated promptly. ST segment abnormalities may be seen in association with cocaine use and are
probably due to a combination of vasospasm and thrombosis.
