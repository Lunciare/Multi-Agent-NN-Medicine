Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)

occurs in mitral valve prolapse. Severe ventricular arrhythmias or high ectopic burden occurs in < 10% of cases and is associated with sudden cardiac death (1). Features associated with severe arrhythmias include severe myxomatous change of the valve leaflets, severe mitral regurgitation, myocardial fibrosis, and MAD (2). MAD is repaired surgically, not by transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Symptoms and Signs of Mitral Valve Prolapse Most patients with mitral valve prolapse are asymptomatic. Some experience nonspecific symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, near syncope, migraines, anxiety) thought to be due to associated abnormalities in adrenergic signaling and sensitivity rather than to mitral valve pathology. In some patients, emotional stress precipitates palpitations, which may be a symptom of benign arrhythmias (atrial premature beats, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, ventricular premature beats, complex ventricular ectopy). Occasionally, patients present with mitral regurgitation. Rarely, patients present with endocarditis (eg, with fever, weight loss, thromboembolic phenomena) or stroke. Sudden death occurs in < 1%, most often in patients with ruptured or otherwise abnormal chordae tendineae and/or flail mitral valve leaflets. Death due to a ventricular arrhythmia is thought to be rare, but a significant fraction of patients with sudden cardiac death have no associated structural cardiac abnormality
