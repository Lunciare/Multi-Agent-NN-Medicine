mitral valve leaflets. Death due to a ventricular arrhythmia is thought to be rare, but a significant fraction of patients with sudden cardiac death have no associated structural cardiac abnormality (1, 2). Other physical findings associated with but not diagnostic of MVP include hypomastia, pectus excavatum, hypokyphosis (eg, straight back syndrome), and a narrow anteroposterior chest diameter. Auscultation Crisp mid-systolic click Typically, mitral valve prolapse causes no visible or palpable cardiac signs. MVP alone often causes a crisp mid-systolic click as the subvalvular apparatus abruptly tightens. The click is heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left apex when the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position. MVP with MR causes a click with a late-systolic MR murmur. The click moves closer to the first heart sound (S1) with maneuvers that decrease left ventricle (LV) size (eg, sitting, standing, Valsalva maneuver); the same maneuvers cause an MR murmur to appear or become louder and last longer. These effects occur because decreasing LV size causes papillary muscles and chordae tendineae to pull together more centrally beneath the valve, resulting in quicker, more forceful prolapse with earlier, more severe regurgitation. Conversely, squatting or isometric handgrip delays the S1
