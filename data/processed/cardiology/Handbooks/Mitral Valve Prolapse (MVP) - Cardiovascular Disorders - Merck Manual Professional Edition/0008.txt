for Mitral Valve Prolapse Mitral valve prolapse is usually benign, but severe myxomatous degeneration of the valve can lead to MR. The risk of progression to severe MR is related both to severity at initial diagnosis and specific anatomic factors of the mitral valve itself (1, 2). The incidence of cardiac events (endocarditis, stroke, cardioembolic event) in patients with significant MR due to mitral valve prolapse may be as high as 4% annually (3). The prevalence of mitral valve prolapse is also higher in patients experiencing sudden cardiac death than in the general population, suggesting an association (4). Key Points Mitral valve prolapse is most often caused by idiopathic myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve and chordae tendineae. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common complication. Heart sounds often include a sharp, mid-systolic click that occurs earlier with the Valsalva maneuver. Prognosis is usually benign unless MR develops, in which case there is increased risk of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and infective endocarditis. Treatment is not needed unless significant MR develops.
