Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)

and mitral regurgitation. Mitral annular disjunction is diagnosed echocardiographically when frame by frame analysis of the posterolateral annulus in the transthoracic parasternal long axis view reveals systolic separation of the annulus and ventricular myocardium by a few millimeters up to a centimeter. Mitral annular disjunction is associated with increased risk of sudden death from arrhythmia, and ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring is recommended. Treatment of Mitral Valve Prolapse Usually none Sometimes beta-blockers Mitral valve prolapse does not usually require treatment. Beta-blockers (eg, atenolol, propranolol) and calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) decrease symptoms due to associated ectopy but there is no evidence that they improve prognosis. Treatment of atrial fibrillation may be required. Treatment of mitral regurgitation depends on severity and associated left atrial and LV changes. Antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is not recommended, except after valve replacement. Anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolism are recommended only for patients with atrial fibrillation or prior transient ischemic attack or stroke. (See also Anticoagulation for patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or native valve disease.) Prognosis for Mitral Valve Prolapse Mitral valve prolapse is usually benign, but severe myxomatous degeneration of the valve can lead to MR. The risk of progression to severe MR is related
