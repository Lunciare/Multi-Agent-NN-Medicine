Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a billowing of mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole. The most common cause is idiopathic myxomatous degeneration. MVP is usually benign, but complications include mitral regurgitation, endocarditis, and chordal rupture. MVP is usually asymptomatic in the absence of significant regurgitation, although there are reports that some patients experience chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, and palpitations. Signs include a crisp mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic murmur if regurgitation is present. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Prognosis is excellent in the absence of significant regurgitation, but chordal rupture and endocarditis may occur. No specific treatment is necessary unless significant mitral regurgitation is present. (See also Overview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders.) Mitral valve prolapse is common; prevalence is 2.4% in otherwise normal populations, depending on the echocardiographic criteria used (1). Females and males are affected equally; onset usually follows the adolescent growth spurt. Etiology of Mitral Valve Prolapse Mitral valve prolapse is most often caused by: Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae In myxomatous degeneration, the fibrous collagen layer of the valve thins and mucoid (myxomatous) material accumulates. The chordae become longer and thinner and the valve leaflets
