In Equations 2, 3, and 4, reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH ), reduced nic- 2 the beta carbon (the second carbon from the right) of the otinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and H+. There- fatty acyl-C oA binds with an oxygen molecule—that is, the fore, for every stearic fatty acid molecule that is split to beta carbon becomes oxidized. form 9 acetyl- CoA molecules, 32 extra hydrogen atoms are Then, in Equation 5, the right-h and two- carbon portion removed. In addition, for each of the 9 molecules of acetyl- of the molecule is split off to release acetyl-C oA into the cell CoA that are subsequently degraded by the citric acid cy- fluid. At the same time, another CoA molecule binds at the cle, 8 more hydrogen atoms are removed, making another end of the remaining portion of the fatty acid molecule, and 72 hydrogen atoms. Thus a total of 104 hydrogen atoms are thus a new fatty acyl- CoA molecule is formed; this time,
