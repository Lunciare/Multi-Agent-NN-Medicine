of Helium-O xygen Mix- Symptoms of Decompression Sickness (“Bends”). The tures in Deep Dives. When divers must work at very deep symptoms of decompression sickness are caused by gas levels—between 250 feet and nearly 1000 feet—they fre- quently live in a large compression tank for days or weeks bubbles blocking many blood vessels in different tissues. at a time, remaining compressed at a pressure level near At first, only the smallest vessels are blocked by minute that at which they will be working. This procedure keeps bubbles, but as the bubbles coalesce, progressively larger 564 Chapter 45 Physiology of Deep-Sea Diving and Other Hyperbaric Conditions the tissues and fluids of the body saturated with the gases to which they will be exposed while diving. Then, when they return to the same tank after working, there are no significant changes in pressure, so decompression bubbles Mask do not occur. Hose In very deep dives, especially during saturation diving, helium is usually used in the gas mixture instead of nitro- gen for three reasons: (1) it has only about one-fifth the narcotic effect of nitrogen; (2) only about one-half as much Demand valve First-stage volume of helium dissolves in the body tissues
