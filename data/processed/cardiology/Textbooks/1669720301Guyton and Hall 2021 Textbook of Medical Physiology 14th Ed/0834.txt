pressure with vasoconstric- remodeling typically occurs because the lumen diameter is smaller and the vascular wall is thicker, but the total cross- sectional area of tion, which helps autoregulate tissue blood flow, as the vessel wall is hardly changed. In large blood vessels that do not discussed previously. The vasoconstriction decreases constrict in response to increased blood pressure, there may be hy- lumen diameter, which in turn tends to normalize the pertrophic remodeling, with increases in thickness and total cross- vascular wall tension (T), which, according to Laplace’s sectional area of the vascular wall. If blood vessels are exposed to equation, is the product of the radius (r) of the blood chronic increases in blood flow, there is typically outward remodeling, with increases in lumen diameter, little change in wall thickness, and vessel and its pressure (P): T = r × P increased total cross- sectional area of the vascular wall. If the blood In small blood vessels that constrict in response to vessel is exposed to long- term increases in blood pressure and blood increased blood pressure, the vascular smooth muscle flow, there is usually outward hypertrophic remodeling, with increas- cells and endothelial cells gradually—over a period of es
