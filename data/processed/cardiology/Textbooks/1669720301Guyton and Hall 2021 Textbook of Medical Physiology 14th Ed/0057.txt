Cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyo- Peroxisomes are physically similar to lysosomes, but cytes), for example, use large amounts of energy and have they are different in two important ways. First, they are far more mitochondria than fat cells (adipocytes), which believed to be formed by self- replication (or perhaps by are much less active and use less energy. Furthermore, budding off from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) the mitochondria are concentrated in those portions rather than from the Golgi apparatus.
