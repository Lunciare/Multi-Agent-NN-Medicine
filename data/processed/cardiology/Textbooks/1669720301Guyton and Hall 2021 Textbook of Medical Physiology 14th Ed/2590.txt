edge of the lens enter the lens ahead of the rays in the center. This effect is opposite to the effect in Figure 50- 4. A, Point focus of parallel light rays by a spherical con- the convex lens, and it causes the peripheral light rays to vex lens. B, Line focus of parallel light rays by a cylindrical convex lens. diverge from the light rays that pass through the center of the lens. Thus, the concave lens diverges light rays, but the cylindrical lenses at right angles to each other. The vertical convex lens converges light rays. cylindrical lens converges the light rays that pass through Cylindrical Lens Bends Light Rays in Only One Plane— the two sides of the lens, and the horizontal lens converges Comparison With Spherical Lenses. Figure 50- 4 shows the top and bottom rays. Thus, all the light rays come to both a convex spherical lens and a convex cylindrical lens. a single point focus. In other words, two cylindrical lenses Note that the cylindrical lens bends light rays from the two crossed at right angles to each other perform the same func- sides of the lens but not from the top or the
