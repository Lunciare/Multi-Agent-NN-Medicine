cell membrane into the I + HO CH CHNH COOH 2 2 2 follicle, iodine binds with about one sixth of the tyrosine Tyrosine amino acids within the thyroglobulin molecule. Figure 77- 3 shows the successive stages of iodination of tyrosine and final formation of thyroxine and triiodo- HO CH CHNH COOH + thyronine. Tyrosine is first iodized to monoiodotyrosine 2 2 and then to diiodotyrosine. Then, during the next few Monoiodotyrosine minutes, hours, and even days, more and more of the iodotyrosine residues become coupled with one another. The major hormonal product of the coupling reaction HO CH 2 CHNH 2 COOH is the molecule thyroxine (T ), which is formed when two 4 molecules of diiodotyrosine are joined together; the thy- Diiodotyrosine roxine then remains part of the thyroglobulin molecule. Or Monoiodotyrosine + Diiodotyrosine one molecule of monoiodotyrosine couples with one mole- cule of diiodotyrosine to form triiodothyronine (T ), which 3 HO O CH CHNH COOH represents about one-fifteenth of the final hormones. Small 2 2 amounts of reverse T (RT ) are formed by coupling of 3 3 diiodotyrosine with monoiodotyrosine, but RT 3 does not 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T 3) appear to be of functional significance in
