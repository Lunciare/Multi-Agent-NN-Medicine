efficiency can decrease to as low as 5%. minute, although its contribution is much less than that of the Frank- Starling mechanism. As discussed in Chapter 18, stretch of the atrium also activates stretch receptors REGULATION OF HEART PUMPING and a nervous reflex, the Bainbridge reflex, that is trans- mitted by the vagus nerve and may increase heart rate an When a person is at rest, the heart pumps only 4 to 6 additional 40% to 60%. liters of blood each minute. During strenuous exercise, Ventricular Function Curves the heart may pump four to seven times this amount. The basic mechanisms for regulating heart pumping are as fol- One of the best ways to express the functional ability of lows: (1) intrinsic cardiac pumping regulation in response the ventricles to pump blood is by ventricular function to changes in volume of blood flowing into the heart; and curves.
