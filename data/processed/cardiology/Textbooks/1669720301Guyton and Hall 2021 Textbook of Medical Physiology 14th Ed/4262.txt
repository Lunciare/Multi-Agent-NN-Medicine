vesicle fluid to form other nutrient substances, as well as large quantities of a weak fibrin coagulum that holds the semen in the prostaglandins and fibrinogen. During the process of deeper regions of the vagina where the uterine cervix emission and ejaculation, each seminal vesicle empties lies. The coagulum then dissolves during the next 15 to its contents into the ejaculatory duct shortly after the vas 30 minutes because of lysis by fibrinolysin formed from deferens empties the sperm. This action adds greatly to the prostatic profibrinolysin. In the early minutes after the bulk of the ejaculated semen, and the fructose and ejaculation, the sperm remain relatively immobile, pos- other substances in the seminal fluid are of considerable sibly because of the viscosity of the coagulum. As the nutrient value for the ejaculated sperm until one of the coagulum dissolves, the sperm simultaneously become sperm fertilizes the ovum. highly motile. Prostaglandins are believed to aid fertilization in two Although sperm can live for many weeks in the male ways: (1) by reacting with the female cervical mucus to genital ducts, once they are ejaculated in the semen, their make it more receptive to sperm movement and (2) by maximal life
