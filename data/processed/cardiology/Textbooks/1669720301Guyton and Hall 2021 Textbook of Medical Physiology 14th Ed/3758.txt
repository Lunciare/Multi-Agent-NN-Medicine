One of amount is slightly greater than the 12,000 calories per mole the prime examples of anaerobic energy utilization occurs in each of the two high-e nergy phosphate bonds of ATP. The in acute hypoxia. When a person stops breathing, a small formula for creatinine phosphate is the following: amount of oxygen is already stored in the lungs and an ad- ditional amount is stored in the hemoglobin of the blood.

This O H energy can be derived for another minute or so from glyco- lysis—that is, the glycogen of the cells splitting into pyruvic Unlike ATP, phosphocreatine cannot act as a direct acid, and the pyruvic acid becoming lactic acid, which dif- coupling agent for energy transfer between the foods and fuses out of the cells, as described in Chapter 68. the functional cellular systems, but it can transfer energy
