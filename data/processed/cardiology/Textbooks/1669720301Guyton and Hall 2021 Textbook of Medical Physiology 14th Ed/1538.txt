The increased water permeability in the distal nephron segments causes increased water reab- sorption and excretion of a small volume of concen- trated urine. Thus, water is conserved while sodium and other sol- Pituitary utes continue to be excreted in the urine. This causes dilution of the solutes in the extracellular fluid, thereby correcting the initial excessively concentrated extracellu- Osmoreceptors lar fluid. Baroreceptors The opposite sequence of events occurs when the Cardiopulmonary extracellular fluid becomes too dilute (hypo-o smotic). Supraoptic receptors For example, with excess water ingestion and a decrease neuron in extracellular fluid osmolarity, less ADH is formed, the Paraventricular renal tubules decrease their permeability for water, less Anterior neuron water is reabsorbed, and a large volume of dilute urine lobe is formed. This in turn concentrates the body fluids and Posterior returns plasma osmolarity toward normal. lobe ADH SYNTHESIS IN SUPRAOPTIC ADH AND PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEI OF HYPOTHALAMUS AND ADH RELEASE FROM POSTERIOR PITUITARY Figure 29-10 shows the neuroanatomy of the hypothala- mus and the pituitary gland, where ADH is synthesized and released. The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in
