second, synchronous waves begin to spread over adjacent cortical regions. These waves presum- ably result from localized reverberating circuits that may Primary gradually recruit adjacent areas of the cortex into the epi- generalized leptic discharge zone. The process spreads to adjacent areas seizure at a rate as slow as a few millimeters per minute to as fast as several centimeters per second. Focal seizures can spread locally from a focus or more re- Thalamus motely to the contralateral cortex and subcortical areas of the brain through projections to the thalamus, which has wide- spread connections to both hemispheres (Figure 60- 5). When C such a wave of excitation spreads over the motor cortex, it causes a progressive “march” of muscle contractions through- Figure 60- 5. A, Propagation of seizures from focal regions of the cortex can occur through fibers in the same cerebral hemisphere or out the opposite side of the body, beginning most characteris- fibers that connect to the contralateral cortex. B, Secondary generali- tically in the mouth region and marching progressively down- zation of a focal seizure can sometimes occur by spread to subcortical ward to the legs but at other times marching in the opposite areas through
