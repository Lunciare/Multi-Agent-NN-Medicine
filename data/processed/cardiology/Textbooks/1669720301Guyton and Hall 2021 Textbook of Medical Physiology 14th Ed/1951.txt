Type A blood can attach to two or more RBCs at the same time, thereby contains type A agglutinogens and anti- B agglutinins, and causing the cells to be bound together by the agglutinin. type B blood contains type B agglutinogens and anti- A This binding causes the cells to clump, which is the pro- agglutinins. Finally, type AB blood contains both A and B cess of agglutination. Then these clumps plug small blood agglutinogens but no agglutinins. vessels throughout the circulatory system.
