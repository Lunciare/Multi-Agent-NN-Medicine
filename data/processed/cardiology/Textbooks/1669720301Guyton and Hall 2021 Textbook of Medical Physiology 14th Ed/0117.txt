The basic building turns of the DNA helix and separation of the un- blocks of RNA form RNA nucleotides, exactly as described wound portions of the two strands. previously for DNA synthesis. Here again, four separate 3. The polymerase then moves along the DNA strand, nucleotides are used to form RNA. These nucleotides temporarily unwinding and separating the two contain the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. DNA strands at each stage of its movement. As it Note that these bases are the same as in DNA, except that moves along, at each stage it adds a new activated uracil in RNA replaces thymine in DNA. RNA nucleotide to the end of the newly forming “Activation” of RNA Nucleotides. The next step in the RNA chain through the following steps: synthesis of RNA is “activation” of RNA nucleotides by an a. First, it causes a hydrogen bond to form between enzyme, RNA polymerase. This activation occurs by add- the end base of the DNA strand and the base of ing two extra phosphate radicals to each
