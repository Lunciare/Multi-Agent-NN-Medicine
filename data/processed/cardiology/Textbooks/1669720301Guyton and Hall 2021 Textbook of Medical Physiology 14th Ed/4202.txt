tines. However, even in the absence of such an increase, tivity is caused by the fragments. it enhances the mineralization of bone. Here again, the 999 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction PTH to decrease excretion of calcium by the kidneys. The decline in phosphate concentration is caused by a strong effect of PTH to increase renal phosphate excretion, an Parathyroid glands effect that is usually great enough to override increased (located on posterior phosphate absorption from the bone. Thyroid gland side of the thyroid gland) Parathyroid Hormone Mobilizes Calcium and Phosphate From Bone PTH has two effects to mobilize calcium and phosphate from bone. One is a rapid phase that begins in minutes and increases progressively for several hours. This phase results from activation of the already existing bone cells (mainly the osteocytes) to promote calcium and phos- phate release. The second phase is a much slower one, requiring several days or even weeks to become fully Chief cell developed; it results from proliferation of the osteoclasts, followed by greatly increased osteoclastic resorption of bone, not merely release of the calcium phosphate salts Oxyphil cell from the bone.
