in Figure 3-7, assembly of RNA is accomplished lets (called codons) in the RNA. These codons, in turn, under the influence of an enzyme, RNA polymerase. This will control the sequence of amino acids in a protein to be large protein enzyme has many functional properties nec- synthesized in the cell cytoplasm. essary for formation of RNA, as follows: Building Blocks of RNA. The basic building blocks of 1. In the DNA strand immediately ahead of the gene RNA are almost the same as those of DNA, except for to be transcribed is a sequence of nucleotides called two differences. First, the sugar deoxyribose is not used the promoter. The RNA polymerase has an appro- in RNA formation. In its place is another sugar of slightly priate complementary structure that recognizes this different composition, ribose, which contains an extra hy- promoter and becomes attached to it, which is the droxyl ion appended to the ribose ring structure. Second, essential step for initiating the formation of RNA. thymine is replaced by another pyrimidine, uracil. 2. After the RNA polymerase attaches to the promot- er, the polymerase causes unwinding of about two Formation of RNA Nucleotides. The basic building turns of the
