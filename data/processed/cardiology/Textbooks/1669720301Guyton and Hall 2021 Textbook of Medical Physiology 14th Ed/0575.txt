in size. mean electrical axis of the ventricles to shift to the right. This shift occurs (1) at the end of deep inspiration, (2) Vectorial Analysis of Right Axis Deviation Resulting when a person stands up, and (3) normally in tall lanky from Hypertrophy of the Right Ventricle. The ECG of people whose hearts hang downward. Figure 12-13 shows intense right axis deviation, to an electrical axis of 170 degrees, which is 111 degrees to the Hypertrophy of One Ventricle. When one ventricle right of the normal 59- degree mean ventricular QRS axis. hypertrophies greatly, the axis of the heart shifts toward The right axis deviation demonstrated in this figure was the hypertrophied ventricle for two reasons. First, there caused by hypertrophy of the right ventricle as a result of is more muscle on the hypertrophied side of the heart congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. Right axis deviation than on the other side, which allows for the generation also can occur in other congenital heart conditions that of greater electrical potential on that side. Second, more cause hypertrophy of the right ventricle, such as tetralogy time is required for the depolarization wave to travel of Fallot and interventricular septal defect. 149
