sure difference develops between the two sides of the tion difference of water is called osmosis. membrane that is great enough to oppose the osmotic To illustrate osmosis, let us assume the conditions effect. The pressure difference across the membrane at shown in Figure 4-10, with pure water on one side of the this point is equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution cell membrane and a solution of sodium chloride on the that contains the nondiffusible solute. 57 UNIT II UNIT II Membrane Physiology, Nerve, and Muscle Chamber A Chamber B Thus, a solution that has 1 osmole of solute dissolved in each kilogram of water is said to have an osmolality of 1 osmole per kilogram, and a solution that has 1/1000 osmole dissolved per kilogram has an osmolality of 1 milliosmole per kilogram. The normal osmolality of the cm H O 2 extracellular and intracellular fluids is about 300 millios- moles per kilogram of water. Relationship of Osmolality to Osmotic Pressure. At normal body temperature, 37°C (98.6°F), a concentration Semipermeable of 1 osmole per liter will cause 19,300 mm Hg osmotic membrane pressure in the solution. Likewise, 1 milliosmole per lit- er concentration is equivalent to
