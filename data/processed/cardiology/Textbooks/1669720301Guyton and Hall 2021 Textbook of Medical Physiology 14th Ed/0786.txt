Lymph is derived from interstitial fluid that flows into the Figure 16- 8 shows the effect of different levels of intersti- lymphatics. Therefore, lymph as it first enters the termi- tial fluid hydrostatic pressure on lymph flow, as measured nal lymphatics has almost the same composition as the in animals. Note that normal lymph flow is very little at interstitial fluid. interstitial fluid pressures more negative than the normal 202 wolf hpmyl evitaleR Chapter 16 The Microcirculation and Lymphatic System: Capillary Fluid Exchange, Interstitial Fluid, and Lymph Flow Pores Valves Lymphatic capillaries Collecting lymphatic Figure 16- 9.
