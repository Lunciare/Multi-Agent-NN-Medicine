all the energy expended by the body is even- chemical reactions of the body occur in series, with the tually converted into heat. The only significant exception product of one reaction acting as a substrate for the next occurs when the muscles are used to perform some form reaction, and so on. Therefore, the overall rate of a complex of work outside the body. For example, when the muscles series of chemical reactions is determined mainly by the elevate an object to a height or propel the body up steps, a rate of reaction of the slowest step in the series, which is type of potential energy is created by raising a mass against called the rate- limiting step in the entire series. gravity. However, when external expenditure of energy is ADP Concentration as a Rate-C ontrolling Factor in En- ergy Release. Under resting conditions, the concentration not taking place, all the energy released by the metabolic processes eventually becomes body heat. of ADP in the cells is extremely slight, and thus the chemical The Calorie. To discuss the metabolic rate of the body reactions that depend on ADP as one of the substrates are and related subjects quantitatively, it
