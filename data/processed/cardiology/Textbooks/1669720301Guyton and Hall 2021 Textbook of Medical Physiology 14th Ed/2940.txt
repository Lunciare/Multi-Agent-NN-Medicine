the cerebral sensory cortex, motor cortex, basal ganglia, red Hemisphere Vermis nuclei, and reticular formation all have topographical rep- Anterior resentations of the different parts of the body, so does the lobe vermis and intermediate zones of the cerebellum. Figure 57- 3 shows two such representations. Note that the axial portions of the body lie in the vermis part of the cerebel- lum, whereas the limbs and facial regions lie in the interme- diate zones. These topographical representations receive afferent nerve signals from all the respective parts of the Posterior lobe body, as well as from corresponding topographical motor areas in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. In turn, they send motor signals back to the same respective topographi- cal areas of the cerebral motor cortex, as well as to topo- graphical areas of the red nucleus and reticular formation Flocculonodular Lateral zone in the brain stem.
