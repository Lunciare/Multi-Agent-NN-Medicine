Regardless of osteoclasts, whereas dentin does not have these charac- the precise means by which fluorine protects the teeth, it is teristics, as explained earlier. This difference undoubtedly known that small amounts of fluorine deposited in enamel make teeth about three times as resistant to caries as teeth explains the different rates of mineral exchange. without fluorine. In summary, continual mineral exchange occurs in the Malocclusion. Malocclusion is usually caused by a he- dentin and cementum of teeth, although the mechanism reditary abnormality that causes the teeth of one jaw to of this exchange in dentin is unclear. However, enamel grow to abnormal positions. In malocclusion, the teeth do exhibits extremely slow mineral exchange, so it maintains not interdigitate properly and therefore cannot perform most of its original mineral complement throughout life. their normal grinding or cutting action adequately.
