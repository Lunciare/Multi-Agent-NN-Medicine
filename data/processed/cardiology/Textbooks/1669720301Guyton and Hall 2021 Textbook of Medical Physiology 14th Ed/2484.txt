Interrelations Among the Tactile Sensations of Touch, Meissner’s corpuscles in that they transmit an initially Pressure, and Vibration. Although touch, pressure, and strong but partially adapting signal and then a continuing vibration are frequently classified as separate sensations, weaker signal that adapts only slowly. Therefore, they are 599 UNIT IX UNIT IX The Nervous System: A. General Principles and Sensory Physiology and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-o rgan (Fig- ure 48-1 ), are also touch receptors. A receptor adapts Free nerve endings readily and, like Meissner’s corpuscles, detects mainly the following: (1) movement of objects on the surface of Epidermis the body; or (2) initial contact with the body. Fifth, located in the deeper layers of the skin and also Dermis in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini’s endings, which are multibranched encapsulated endings, as shown in Figure 47- 1 and Figure 48- 1. These endings adapt Hair end-organ very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as Peripheral nerve bundle heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals. They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation. A Hairy skin Pacinian corpuscle
