rods of Corti, which are attached tightly to the basilar fibers. The basilar fibers, the rods of Corti, and the reticular lamina move as a rigid unit. Ca2+ Ca2+ Upward movement of the basilar fiber rocks the retic- ular lamina upward and inward toward the modiolus. Then, when the basilar membrane moves downward, the reticular lamina rocks downward and outward. The inward and outward motion causes the hairs on the hair cells to shear back and forth against the tectorial mem- Glutamate brane. Thus, the hair cells are excited whenever the basilar Afferent membrane vibrates. neuron Spiral Auditory Signals Are Transmitted Mainly by the ganglion Inner Hair Cells. Even though there are three to four times as many outer hair cells as inner hair cells, about 90% of the auditory nerve fibers are stimulated by the inner cells B rather than by the outer cells. Nonetheless, if the outer cells are damaged while the inner cells remain fully func- Figure 53- 7.

Therefore, it of the hairs projecting into the gel coating of the tectorial membrane. has been proposed that the
