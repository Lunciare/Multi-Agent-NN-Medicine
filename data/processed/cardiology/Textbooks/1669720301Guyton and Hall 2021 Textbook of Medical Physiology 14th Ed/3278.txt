Instead, it is during the vagus nerves, all the way to the brain stem. These sensory spike potentials, generated at the peaks of the slow waves, nerves can elicit local reflexes within the gut wall and still that significant quantities of calcium ions enter the fibers other reflexes that are relayed to the gut from either the and cause most of the contraction. prevertebral ganglia or the basal regions of the brain. 789 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Sympathetic Parasympathetic To prevertebral ganglia, spinal (mainly postganglionic) (preganglionic) cord, and brain stem Myenteric plexus Figure 63- 4.
