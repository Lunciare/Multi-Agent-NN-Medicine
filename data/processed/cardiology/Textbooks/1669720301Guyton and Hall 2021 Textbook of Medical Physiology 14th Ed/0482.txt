Figure 9- 15 shows effects of abnormal calcium concentrations are seldom of four cardiac function curves. These curves are similar to clinical concern. the ventricular function curves of Figure 9- 13. However, they represent function of the entire heart rather than EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON HEART that of a single ventricle. They show the relationship be- FUNCTION tween right atrial pressure at the input of the right heart and cardiac output from the left ventricle into the aorta. Increased body temperature, such as that which occurs The curves of Figure 9- 15 demonstrate that at any during fever, greatly increases the heart rate, sometimes given right atrial pressure, the cardiac output increases to double the normal rate. Decreased temperature greatly during increased sympathetic stimulation and decreases decreases the heart rate, which may fall to as low as a during increased parasympathetic stimulation. These few beats per minute when a person is near death from changes in output caused by autonomic nervous system hypothermia in the body temperature range of 60° to 70°F stimulation result from changes in heart rate and from (15.5°–21°C). These effects presumably result from the changes in contractile strength of the heart. fact that heat increases the
