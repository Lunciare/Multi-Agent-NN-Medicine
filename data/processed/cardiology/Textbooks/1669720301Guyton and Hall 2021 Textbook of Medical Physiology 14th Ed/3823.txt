As Figure 74- 8 demonstrates the effect of different skin discussed in Chapter 1, feedback gain is a measure of temperatures on the set point for sweating, showing that the effectiveness of a control system. In the case of body the set point increases as skin temperature decreases. temperature control, it is important for the internal core Thus, for the person represented in this figure, the hypo- temperature to change as little as possible, even though thalamic set point increased from 36.7°C when the skin the environmental temperature might change greatly temperature was higher than 33°C to a set point of 37.4°C from day to day or even hour to hour. The feedback gain when the skin temperature had fallen to 29°C. Therefore, of the temperature control system is equal to the ratio of when the skin temperature was high, sweating began at a the change in environmental
