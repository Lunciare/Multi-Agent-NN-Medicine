Formation and Function of Lipoproteins. Almost all mg/dl of Plasma the lipoproteins are formed in the liver, which is also where Cholesterol 180 most of the plasma cholesterol, phospholipids, and tri- glycerides are synthesized. In addition, small quantities of Phospholipids 160 HDLs are synthesized in the intestinal epithelium during Triglycerides 160 absorption of fatty acids from the intestines. Protein 200 The primary function of the lipoproteins is to transport their lipid components in the blood. The VLDLs transport triglycerides synthesized in the liver mainly to the adipose Types of Lipoproteins. Aside from the chylomicrons, tissue. The other lipoproteins are especially important in which are very large lipoproteins, there are four ma- different stages of phospholipid and cholesterol transport jor types of lipoproteins, classified by their densities as from the liver to the peripheral tissues or from the periph- measured in the ultracentrifuge: (1) very low density lipo- ery back to the liver.
