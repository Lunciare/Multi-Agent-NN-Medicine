almost always totally obscured by 2 the large ventricular QRS complex, although in some very Depolarization Repolarization QRS T abnormal states it does appear in the recorded ECG. Figure 12-10 QRS and T vectorcardiograms. Vectorcardiogram As noted previously, the vector of current flow through the III heart changes rapidly as the impulse spreads through the – –60(cid:31) I myocardium. It changes in two aspects. First, the vector in- creases and decreases in length because of increasing and decreasing voltage of the vector. Second, the vector changes direction because of changes in the average direction of the – + electrical potential from the heart. The vectorcardiogram I I II 180(cid:31) 0(cid:31) depicts these changes at different times during the cardiac cycle, as shown in Figure 12-10. In the large vectorcardiogram of Figure 12-10, point 5 is the zero reference point, and this point is the negative end of all the successive vectors. While the heart muscle is 120(cid:31) 59(cid:31) III polarized between heartbeats, the positive end of the vec- + tor remains at the zero point because there is no vectorial III electrical potential. However, as soon as current begins to Figure 12-11 Plotting the mean electrical axis of the ventricles
