The buffers of the body sodium and water almost invariably cause hypertension. fluids normally can buffer 500 to 1000 millimoles of acid Therefore, lesions that decrease GFR or increase tubular without lethal increases in extracellular fluid H+ concentra- reabsorption usually lead to hypertension of varying de- tion, and the phosphate compounds in the bones can buff- grees. Some specific types of renal abnormalities that can er an additional few thousand millimoles of H+. However, cause hypertension are as follows: when this buffering power is exhausted, the blood pH falls 1.
