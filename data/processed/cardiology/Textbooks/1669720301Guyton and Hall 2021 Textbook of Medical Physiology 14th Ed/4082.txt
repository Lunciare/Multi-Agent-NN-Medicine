cell, is present in small numbers in the islets and se- cretes a hormone called pancreatic polypeptide. Delta cell The close interrelations among these cell types in the islets of Langerhans allow cell- to- cell communication and direct control of secretion of some of the hormones by the other hormones. For example, insulin inhibits glucagon se- cretion, amylin inhibits insulin secretion, and somatostatin inhibits the secretion of both insulin and glucagon. Alpha cell INSULIN AND ITS METABOLIC EFFECTS Insulin was first isolated from the pancreas in 1922 by Red blood cells Banting and Best, and almost overnight rescued patients Beta cell with severe cases of diabetes mellitus from a rapid decline Figure 79- 1.

Historically, insulin has been pancreas. 973 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction Proinsulin peptide (C peptide). The insulin and C peptide are pack- C chain aged in secretory granules and secreted in equimolar amounts. About 5% to 10% of the final secreted product is –COOH still in the form of proinsulin. 21 Cleavage The proinsulin and C peptide have virtually no insu- 1 30 Cleavage lin activity. However, C peptide binds
