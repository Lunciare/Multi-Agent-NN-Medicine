The prothrombin activator catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin. 3. The thrombin acts as an enzyme to convert fibrino- subsequently form connective tissue all through the clot; gen into fibrin fibers that enmesh platelets, blood or (2) it can dissolve. The usual course for a clot that forms cells, and plasma to form the clot. in a small hole of a vessel wall is invasion by fibroblasts, We will first discuss the mechanism whereby the blood beginning within a few hours after the clot is formed, clot is formed, beginning with conversion of prothrombin which is promoted at least partially by growth factor to thrombin, and then come back to the initiating stages secreted by platelets. This process continues to complete in the clotting process whereby prothrombin activator is organization of the clot into fibrous tissue within about 1 formed. to 2 weeks. Conversely, when excess blood has leaked into the CONVERSION OF PROTHROMBIN TO tissues, and tissue clots have formed where they are not THROMBIN needed, special substances in the clot usually become activated. These substances function as enzymes to dis- 1. Prothrombin activator is formed as a result of rup- solve the clot, as discussed later in
