The right side of Figure 5- 4 shows a channel pro- tein (sometimes called a tandem pore domain, potassium Contribution of the Potassium Diffusion Potential. channel, or potassium [K+] “leak” channel) in the nerve In Figure 5-5 A, we assume that the only movement of membrane through which potassium ions can leak, even ions through the membrane is diffusion of potassium in a resting cell. The basic structure of potassium channels ions, as demonstrated by the open channels between was described in Chapter 4 (Figure 4- 4). These K+ leak the potassium symbol (K+) inside and outside the mem- 66 Chapter 5 Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials brane. Because of the high ratio of potassium ions inside 0 to outside, 35:1, the Nernst potential corresponding to — + this ratio is −94 millivolts because the logarithm of 35 is 1.54, and this, multiplied by −61 millivolts, is −94 mil- livolts. Therefore, if potassium ions were the only factor K CI Silver–silver
