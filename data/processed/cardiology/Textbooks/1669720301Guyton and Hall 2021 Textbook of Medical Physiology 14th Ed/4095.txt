the blood glucose concentration falls between One of the most important effects of insulin is to cause meals. Ordinarily, about 60% of the glucose in the meal most of the glucose absorbed after a meal to be rapidly is stored in this way in the liver and then returned later. stored in the liver in the form of glycogen. Then, between meals, when food is not available and the blood glucose Insulin Promotes Conversion of Excess Glucose Into concentration begins to fall, insulin secretion decreases Fatty Acids and Inhibits Gluconeogenesis in the rapidly and the liver glycogen is split back into glucose, Liver. When the quantity of glucose entering the liver which is released back into the blood to keep the glucose cells is more than can be stored as glycogen or can be used concentration from falling too low. for local hepatocyte metabolism, insulin promotes the The mechanism by which insulin causes glucose uptake conversion of all this excess glucose into fatty acids. These and storage in the liver includes several almost simultane- fatty acids are subsequently packaged as triglycerides in ous steps: very low density lipoproteins, which are transported in 1. Insulin inactivates liver phosphorylase, the principal the
