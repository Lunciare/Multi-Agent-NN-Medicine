Some of the many tissue products that cause these factor and interleukin-1 ) and other biochemical products reactions are histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglan- produced by the inflamed tissues that initiate the following dins, several different reaction products of the complement reactions: 454 Chapter 34 Resistance of the Body to Infection Rolling adhesion Tight binding Diapedesis Migration Receptors Neutrophil Endothelial cell Selectin ICAM-1 Cytokines Inflamed tissue Figure 34-7. Migration of neutrophils from the blood into inflamed tissue. Cytokines and other biochemical products of the inflamed tissue cause increased expression of selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) on the surface of endothelial cells. These adhesion mol- ecules bind to complementary molecules or receptors on the neutrophil, causing it to adhere to the wall of the capillary or venule. The neutrophil then migrates through the vessel wall by diapedesis or extravasation toward the site of tissue injury. 1. They cause increased expression of adhesion mol- neutrophils in the blood sometimes increases fourfold ecules, such as selectins and intercellular adhesion to fivefold—from a normal of 4,000 to 5,000 to 15,000 to molecule-1 (ICAM- 1) on the surface of endothelial 25,000 neutrophils/μl. This is called neutrophilia, which cells in
