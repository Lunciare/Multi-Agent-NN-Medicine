In fact, the ventral spinocerebellar tract even developed is weak; and (3) the movements are slow to transmits back to the cerebellum an “efference” copy of the turn off, usually allowing the movement to go well beyond actual motor control signals that reach the anterior motor the intended mark. Therefore, in the absence of the cer- neurons, and this information is also integrated with the ebellar circuit, the motor cortex has to think extra hard to signals arriving from the muscle spindles and other pro- turn ballistic movements on and off. Thus, the automa- prioceptor sensory organs, transmitted principally in the tism of ballistic movements is lost. dorsal spinocerebellar
