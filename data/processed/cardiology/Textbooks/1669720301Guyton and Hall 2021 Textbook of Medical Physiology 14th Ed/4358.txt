Estrogen in small amounts has a strong inhibitory effect and has been found to be a decapeptide with the fol- on production of LH and FSH. Also, when progesterone is lowing formula: available, the inhibitory effect of estrogen is multiplied, even though progesterone by itself has little effect (Figure 82- 11).
