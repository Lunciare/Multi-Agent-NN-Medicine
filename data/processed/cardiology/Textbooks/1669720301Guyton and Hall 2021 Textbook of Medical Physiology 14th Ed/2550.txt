The enkephalin is believed to cause Third Periventricular ventricle nuclei both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition of incoming type C and type Aδ pain fibers where they synapse in the dorsal horns. Periaqueductal gray Thus, the analgesia system can block pain signals at Aqueduct the initial entry point to the spinal cord. It can also block Mesencephalon many local cord reflexes that result from pain signals, Fourth ventricle Enkephalin neuron especially withdrawal reflexes described in Chapter 55.
