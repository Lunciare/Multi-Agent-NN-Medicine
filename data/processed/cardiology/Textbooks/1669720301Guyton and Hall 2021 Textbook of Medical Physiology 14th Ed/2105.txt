When the pulmo- tity becomes more than barely enough to begin flowing in the pleural cavity, the excess fluid is pumped away by nary capillary pressure remains elevated chronically (for lymphatic vessels opening directly from the pleural cav- at least 2 weeks), the lungs become even more resistant to pulmonary edema because the lymph vessels expand great- ity into the following: (1) the mediastinum; (2) the supe- ly, increasing their capability of carrying fluid away from rior surface of the diaphragm; and (3) the lateral surfaces the interstitial spaces perhaps as much as 10- fold.

Therefore, the pleural space—the fore, in patients with chronic mitral stenosis, pulmonary space between the parietal and visceral pleurae—is called capillary pressures of 40 to 45 mm Hg have been measured a potential space because it normally is so narrow that it without the development of lethal pulmonary edema. is not obviously a physical space.

A negative force is slightly above the safety factor level, lethal pulmonary ede- always required on the outside of the lungs to keep the
