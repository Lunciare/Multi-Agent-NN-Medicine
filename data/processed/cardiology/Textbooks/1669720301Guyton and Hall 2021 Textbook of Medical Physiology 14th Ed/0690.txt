The greater the viscosity, the body. This parallel arrangement permits each tissue the lower the flow in a vessel if all other factors are con- to regulate its own blood flow, to a great extent, indepen- stant. Furthermore, the viscosity of normal blood is about dently of flow to other tissues. three times as great as the viscosity of water. For blood vessels arranged in parallel (Figure 14-9B), What makes the blood so viscous? It is mainly the the total resistance to blood flow is expressed as follows: large numbers of suspended red cells in the blood, each 178 Chapter 14 Overview of the Circulation: Pressure, Flow, and Resistance 10 Viscosity of whole blood 9 100 100 100 8 7 90 90 90 6 80 80 80 5 4 70 70 70 3 Normal blood 2 Viscosity of plasma 60 60 60 1 Viscosity of water 50 50 50 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70
