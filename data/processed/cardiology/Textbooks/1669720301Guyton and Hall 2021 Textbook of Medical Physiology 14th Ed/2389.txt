Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate In either case, the effect is to make the internal (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) membrane potential more positive than normal, in the neuronal cell. Recall that cAMP or cGMP can which is excitatory. activate highly specific metabolic machinery in the 3.
