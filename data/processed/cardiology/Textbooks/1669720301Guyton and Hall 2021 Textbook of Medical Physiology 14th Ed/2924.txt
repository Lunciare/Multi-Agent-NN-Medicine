This time, the cupula dicts that disequilibrium is going to occur and thereby bends in the opposite direction, causing the hair cell causes the equilibrium centers to make appropriate to stop discharging entirely. After another few seconds, anticipatory preventive adjustments, which helps the the endolymph stops moving and the cupula gradually person maintain balance before the situation can be returns to its resting position, thus allowing hair cell corrected. discharge to return to its normal tonic level, as shown Removal of the flocculonodular lobes of the cerebel- at the right in Figure 56-1 2. Thus, the semicircular lum prevents normal detection of semicircular duct duct transmits a signal of one polarity when the head signals but has less effect on detecting macular signals. begins to rotate and of opposite polarity when it stops It is especially interesting that the cerebellum serves as rotating. a “predictive” organ for most rapid movements of the “Predictive” Function of the Semicircular Duct body, as well
