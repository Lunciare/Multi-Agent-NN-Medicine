This sets into motion 5. Chemotaxis. Fragment C5a initiates chemotaxis of a cascade of sequential reactions, shown in Figure 35- 6, neutrophils and macrophages, thus causing large beginning with activation of the proenzyme C1. The C1 numbers of these phagocytes to migrate into the enzymes that are formed then activate successively in- tissue area adjacent to the antigenic agent. creasing quantities of enzymes in the later stages of the 6. Activation of mast cells and basophils. Fragments system so that from a small beginning, an extremely large, C3a, C4a, and C5a activate mast cells and basophils, amplified reaction occurs. Multiple end products are causing them to release histamine, heparin, and formed, as shown at the right in the figure, and several of several other substances into the local fluids. These these have important effects that help prevent damage to substances, in turn, cause increased local blood flow, the body’s tissues caused by the invading organism or tox- increased leakage of fluid and
