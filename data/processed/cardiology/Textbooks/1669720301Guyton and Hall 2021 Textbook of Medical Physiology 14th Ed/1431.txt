pal cells depend on the activity of a Na+- K+ ATPase pump in late distal tubules and cortical collecting tubules are composed of two each cell’s basolateral membrane (Figure 28-1 2).

Type A intercalated cells reabsorb potassium and therefore, favors sodium diffusion into the cell through spe- bicarbonate ions from the lumen and secrete hydrogen ions into the cial channels.
