following way. der resting conditions is about 15 mg/dl, which is a total of only 0.45 gram of fatty acids in the entire circulatory Chylomicron Triglycerides Are Hydrolyzed by system. Even this small amount accounts for almost all the Lipoprotein Lipase, and Fat Is Stored in Adipose Tissue. transport of fatty acids from one part of the body to an- other for the following reasons: Most of the chylomicrons are removed from the circulating 1. Despite the minute amount of free fatty acid in the blood as they pass through the capillaries of various tissues, blood, its rate of “turnover” is extremely rapid: half the especially adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart. These plasma fatty acid is replaced by new fatty acid every 2 tissues synthesize the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, which is to 3 minutes. One can calculate that at this rate, almost transported to the surface of capillary endothelial cells, all the normal energy requirements of the body can where it hydrolyzes the triglycerides of chylomicrons as be provided by the oxidation of transported free fatty they come in contact with the endothelial wall, thus releas- acids, without using any carbohydrates or proteins for ing fatty acids and glycerol
