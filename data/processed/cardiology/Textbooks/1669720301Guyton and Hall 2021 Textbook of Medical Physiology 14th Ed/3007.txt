Note particularly the large number of of the cerebral cortex. In the first part of this chapter, the horizontal fibers that extend between adjacent areas of known cortical functions are discussed, and then basic the cortex, but note also the vertical fibers that extend to theories of neuronal mechanisms involved in thought and from the cortex to lower areas of the brain and some processes, memory,
