of the Myosin Cause Contraction Head. Another feature of the myosin head that is es- sential for muscle contraction is that it functions as an Inhibition of the Actin Filament by the Troponin- adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme. As explained Tropomyosin Complex. A pure actin filament without later, this property allows the head to cleave ATP and use the presence of the troponin- tropomyosin complex (but the energy derived from the ATP’s high-e nergy phosphate in the presence of magnesium ions and ATP) binds in- bond to energize the contraction process. stantly and strongly with the heads of the myosin mol- ecules. Then, if the troponin- tropomyosin complex is Actin Filaments Are Composed of Actin, T ropomyosin, added to the actin filament, the binding between myosin and Troponin. The backbone of the actin filament is a and actin does not take place. Therefore, it is believed double- stranded F- actin protein molecule, represented that the active sites on the normal actin filament of the by the two lighter-c olored strands in Figure 6-7. The two relaxed muscle are inhibited or physically covered by the strands are wound in a helix in the same manner as the troponin- tropomyosin complex. Consequently, the
