blood cells by (inactive) mechanisms that are unclear. When excess cortisol is se- creted by the adrenal glands, polycythemia often results, Liver and conversely, when the adrenal glands secrete no cortisol, Skin anemia often results. Mineralocorticoid Brain Cellular Mechanism of Cortisol Action receptor Adipose tissue Placenta Cortisol, like other steroid hormones, exerts its effects by first interacting with intracellular receptors in target Figure 78- 7. Interconversion of active cortisol and inactive cortisone cells. Because cortisol is lipid soluble, it can easily diffuse by the two 11β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoforms (11β- HSD1 through the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, cortisol and 11β- HSD2) in various tissues. binds with its protein receptor in the cytoplasm, and the hormone- receptor complex then interacts with specific Conversely, tissues such as the liver, brain, adipose tis- regulatory DNA sequences, called glucocorticoid response sue, skeletal muscle, lung, and skin express another iso- elements, to induce or repress gene transcription. Other form, 11β- HSD1, which converts inactive cortisone to ac- proteins in the cell, called transcription factors, are also tive cortisol (see Figure 78- 7). Thus, 11β- HSD1 expression necessary for the hormone- receptor complex to interact amplifies the physiological effects of glucocorticoids in tis- appropriately
