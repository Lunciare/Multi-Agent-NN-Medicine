parti- The entire process is energized by the high-e nergy com- cles that have become trapped in the mucus. In the uterine pound ATP. This is what occurs in the pseudopodium of a tubes, cilia cause slow movement of fluid from the ostium moving cell, where such a network of actin filaments forms of the uterine tube toward the uterus cavity; this movement anew inside the enlarging pseudopodium. Contraction also of fluid transports the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. occurs in the ectoplasm of the cell body, where a preexisting As shown in Figure 2-18, a cilium has the appearance actin network is already present beneath the cell membrane. of a sharp- pointed straight or curved hair that projects 2 to 4 micrometers from the surface of the cell. Often, Types of Cells That Exhibit Ameboid Locomotion. many motile cilia project from a single cell—for example, The most common cells to exhibit ameboid locomotion as many as 200 cilia on the surface of each epithelial cell in the human body are the white blood cells when they inside the respiratory passageways. The cilium is covered move out of the blood into the tissues to form tissue mac- by
