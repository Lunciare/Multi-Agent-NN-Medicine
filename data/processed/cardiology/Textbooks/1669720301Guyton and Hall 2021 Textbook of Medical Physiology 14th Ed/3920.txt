Even so, experiments have demonstrated that adult is between 1.6 and 3 ng/ml; in a child or adolescent, injection of GH directly into the epiphyseal cartilages of it is about 6 ng/ml. These values may increase to as high bones of living animals causes growth of these cartilage as 50 ng/ml after depletion of the body stores of proteins areas, and the amount of GH required for this growth to or carbohydrates during prolonged starvation. occur is minute. One possible explanation for this finding Under acute conditions, hypoglycemia is a far more is that GH can cause formation of enough IGF- 1 in the potent stimulator of GH secretion than is an acute local tissue to cause local growth. However, GH also has decrease in protein intake. Conversely, in chronic con- IGF- independent effects that stimulate growth in some ditions, GH secretion seems to correlate more with the tissues such as chondrocytes
