After the pain- of a decerebrate animal causes the limb to extend against ful stimulus is removed, the crossed extensor reflex has an the pressure applied to the foot. Indeed, this reflex is so even longer period of afterdischarge than does the flexor strong that if an animal whose spinal cord has been tran- reflex.

This reflex is called the positive supportive re- a muscle involved in a crossed extensor reflex. This myo- action. gram demonstrates the relatively long latency before the The positive supportive reaction involves a complex reflex begins and the long afterdischarge at the end of the circuit in the interneurons similar to the circuits respon- stimulus. The prolonged afterdischarge is of benefit in sible for the flexor and crossed extensor reflexes.
