Therefore, it is not possible simply to increase blood INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF PRESSURE, flow everywhere in the body when a particular tissue FLOW, AND RESISTANCE demands increased flow. Instead, the microvessels of each tissue, especially the arterioles, continuously Blood flow through a blood vessel is determined by two monitor tissue needs, such as the availability of oxy- factors: (1) pressure difference of the blood between the gen and other nutrients and the accumulation of car- two ends of the vessel, also sometimes called the pressure bon dioxide and other tissue waste products. These gradient along the vessel, which pushes the blood through microvessels, in turn, dilate or constrict to control the vessel; and (2) the impediment to blood flow through local blood flow at the level required for the tissue the vessel, which is called vascular resistance.
