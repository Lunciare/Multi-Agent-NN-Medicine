Pulmonary Artery Valves. The aortic and pulmonary artery semilunar valves function quite dif- Chordae tendineae ferently from the A- V valves. First, the high pressures in the arteries at the end of systole cause the semilunar Papillary muscles valves to snap closed, in contrast to the much softer closure of the A- V valves. Second, because of smaller openings, the velocity of blood ejection through the Cusp aortic and pulmonary valves is much greater than that through the much larger A- V valves. Also, because of the rapid closure and rapid ejection, the edges of the aortic and pulmonary valves are subjected to much AORTIC VALVE greater mechanical abrasion than the A- V valves.
