a rhythmical and harsher amount of blood must flow forward at the pulse wave quality. Then, finally, when the pressure in the cuff falls front to distend the next segment of the vessel; the greater near diastolic pressure, the sounds suddenly change to the resistance, the more difficult it is for this to occur. The a muffled quality (point C, Figure 15-7). One notes the compliance damps the pulsations because the more com- manometer pressure when the Korotkoff sounds change pliant a vessel, the greater the quantity of blood required to the muffled quality, and this pressure is about equal to at the pulse wave front to cause an increase in pressure. the diastolic pressure, although it slightly overestimates 186 Chapter 15 Vascular Distensibility and Functions of the Arterial and Venous Systems A gives values within 10% of those determined by direct 140 catheter measurement from inside the arteries. B 120 Automated Oscillometric Method. Systolic and diastol- ic arterial pressures are often measured using automated 100 oscillometric devices. These devices use a sphygmoma- nometer cuff, like the auscultatory method, but with an 80 C electronic pressure sensor to detect cuff pressure oscil- lations that occur when blood flows through an
