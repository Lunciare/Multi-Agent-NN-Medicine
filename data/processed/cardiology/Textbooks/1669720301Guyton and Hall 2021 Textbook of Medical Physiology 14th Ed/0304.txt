of polysaccharide The portion of the myofibril (or of the whole muscle material that contains numerous thin collagen fibrils. At fiber) that lies between two successive Z disks is called a each end of the muscle fiber, this surface layer of the sar- sarcomere. When the muscle fiber is contracted, as shown colemma fuses with a tendon fiber. The tendon fibers, in at the bottom of Figure 6-5, the length of the sarcomere turn, collect into bundles to form the muscle tendons that is about 2 micrometers. At this length, the actin filaments then connect the muscles to the bones. completely overlap the myosin filaments, and the tips of the actin filaments are just beginning to overlap one Myofibrils Are Composed of Actin and Myosin another. As discussed later, at this length, the muscle is Filaments. Each muscle fiber contains several hun- capable of generating its greatest force of contraction. dred to several thousand myofibrils, which are illus- trated in the cross- sectional view of Figure 6-1C.
