ridges of the myosin filament but has not yet reached the center of the A skeletal muscle contracts rapidly when it contracts myosin filament. With further shortening, the sarcomere against no load to a state of full contraction in about 0.1 maintains full tension until point B is reached, at a sar- second for the average muscle. When loads are applied, the comere length of about 2 micrometers. At this point, the velocity of contraction decreases progressively as the load ends of the two actin filaments begin to overlap each other increases, as shown in Figure 6-11. When the load has been increased to equal the maximum force that the muscle in addition to overlapping the myosin filaments. As the can exert, the velocity of contraction becomes zero, and no sarcomere length decreases from 2 micrometers to about contraction results, despite activation of the muscle fiber. 1.65 micrometers at point A, the strength of contraction This decreasing velocity of contraction with load occurs decreases rapidly. At this point, the two Z disks of the sar- because a load on a contracting muscle is a reverse force comere abut the ends of the myosin filaments. Then, as that opposes the contractile
