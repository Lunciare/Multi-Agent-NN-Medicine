Pulmonary circulation The heart and blood vessels, in turn, are controlled to 9% provide the cardiac output and arterial pressure needed to supply adequate tissue blood flow. What are the mecha- nisms for controlling blood volume and blood flow, and how does this process relate to the other functions of the circulation? These are some of the topics and questions that we discuss in this section on the circulation. Aorta Superior vena cava PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CIRCULATION Heart The circulation, shown in Figure 14-1, is divided into 7% the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation.
