It is unclear how in Chapter 34. much of this reduction results from the simple effect of Five main stages of inflammation occur: (1) release cortisol in stabilizing lysosomal and cell membranes ver- from the damaged tissue cells of chemicals such as his- sus its effect in reducing the formation of prostaglandins tamine, bradykinin, proteolytic enzymes, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in damaged cell and leukotrienes that activate the inflammation process; membranes and other effects of cortisol. (2) an increase in blood flow in the inflamed area caused by some of the released products from the tissues, an effect Cortisol Causes Resolution of Inflammation.

The immediate effect is to block clotting of the tissue fluid, thus causing a nonpitting type most of the factors that promote inflammation.
