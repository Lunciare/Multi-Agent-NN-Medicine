uptake of a different In summary, insulin promotes formation of protein selection of amino acids, all of which are required for and prevents degradation of proteins. growth. Insulin Deficiency Causes Protein Depletion and Increased Plasma Amino MECHANISMS OF INSULIN SECRETION Acids Figure 79- 7 shows the basic cellular mechanisms for Virtually all protein storage comes to a halt when insulin insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells in response is not available. Catabolism of proteins increases, protein to increased blood glucose concentration, which is the synthesis stops, and large quantities of amino acids are primary controller of insulin secretion. The beta cells dumped into the plasma. Amino acid concentration in the have a large number of glucose transporters that permit plasma rises considerably, and most of the excess amino a rate of glucose influx that is proportional to the blood acids are used either directly for energy or as substrates concentration in the physiological range. Once inside the for gluconeogenesis. This degradation of amino acids also cells, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose- 6- phosphate leads to enhanced urea excretion in the urine. The result- by glucokinase. This phosphorylation appears to be the ing protein wasting is one of the most
