These sounds are called Korotkoff sounds, named after The velocity of pressure pulse transmission is 3 to 5 m/ Nikolai Korotkoff, a Russian physician, who described sec in the normal aorta, 7 to 10 m/sec in the large arterial them in 1905. branches, and 15 to 35 m/sec in the small arteries. In gen- Korotkoff sounds are believed to be caused mainly by eral, the greater the compliance of each vascular segment, blood jetting through the partly occluded vessel and by the slower the velocity, which explains the slow trans- vibrations of the vessel wall. The jet causes turbulence in mission in the aorta and the much faster transmission the vessel beyond the cuff, and this turbulence sets up the in the much less compliant small distal arteries.
