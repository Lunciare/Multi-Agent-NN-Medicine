This is also 613 UNIT IX UNIT IX The Nervous System: A. General Principles and Sensory Physiology One of the suggested causes of pain during ischemia is accumulation of large amounts of lactic acid in the tis- sues, formed as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism (i.e., metabolism without oxygen). It is also probable that other chemical agents, such as bradykinin and proteolytic enzymes, are formed in the tissues because of cell damage and that these agents, in addition to lactic acid, stimulate the pain nerve endings. Muscle Spasm as a Cause of Pain. Muscle spasm is also a common cause of pain and is the basis of many clinical pain syndromes. This pain probably results partially from the direct effect of muscle spasm in stimulating mecha- nosensitive pain receptors, but it might also result from the indirect effect of muscle spasm to compress the blood 43 44 45 46 47 vessels and cause ischemia. The spasm also increases the Temperature ((cid:31)C) rate of metabolism in
