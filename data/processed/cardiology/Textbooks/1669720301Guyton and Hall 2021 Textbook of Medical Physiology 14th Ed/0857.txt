Large numbers of small neurons located through- the medulla and lower pons. The neurons of this out the reticular substance of the pons, mesencephalon, area receive sensory nerve signals from the circu- and diencephalon can excite or inhibit the vasomotor latory system mainly through the vagus and glos- center.
