shortly before the birth of the baby 1052 emulov doolB )sretil( noitirutraP Chapter 83 Pregnancy and Lactation is about 20% above normal, and a commensurate amount of NORMAL PREECLAMPSIA carbon dioxide is formed. These effects cause the mother’s Vein Vein minute ventilation to increase. It is also believed that the high levels of progesterone during pregnancy increase the minute Spiral artery ventilation even more because progesterone increases the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide. The Endothelial cells net result is an increase in minute ventilation of about 50% and a decrease in arterial Pco to several mm Hg below that 2 in a nonpregnant woman. Simultaneously, the growing uter- Blood us presses upward against the abdominal contents, which flow Trophoblasts press upward against the diaphragm, so the total excursion of the diaphragm is decreased. Consequently, the respiratory rate is increased to maintain the extra ventilation. Maternal Kidney Function During Pregnancy The rate of urine formation by a pregnant woman is usu- ally slightly increased because of increased fluid intake and increased load of excretory products. In addition, several special alterations of kidney function occur. First, the renal tubules’ reabsorptive capacity for so- dium, chloride, and water is increased
