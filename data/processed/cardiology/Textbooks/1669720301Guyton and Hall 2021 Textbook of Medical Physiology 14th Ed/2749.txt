The cochlea (A) and section through one of the turns bend in the direction of the round window. However, the of the cochlea (B). elastic tension that is built up in the basilar fibers as they bend toward the round window initiates a fluid wave that “travels” along the basilar membrane toward the helico- Oval Scala vestibuli trema.
