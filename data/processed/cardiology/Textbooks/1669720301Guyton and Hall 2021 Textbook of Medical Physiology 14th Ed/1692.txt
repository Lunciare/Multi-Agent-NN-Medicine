Thus, for each liter of urine formed, a maximum of only about 0.03 mEq of free H+ can be excreted. To excrete the 80 mEq of nonvolatile acid CCOO 22 CCOO 22 ++ HH 22OO HH++ formed by metabolism each day, about 2667 liters of ATP urine would have to be excreted if the H+ remained free HH CCOO 22 33 in solution.
