more complex reflex and processing mechanisms a neurotransmitter (often called a transmitter substance), of the human higher nervous system. Furthermore, as and this transmitter in turn acts on receptor proteins in computers become even more complex, it is necessary the membrane of the next neuron to excite the neuron, to add still another unit, called the central processing inhibit it, or modify its sensitivity in some other way unit, which determines the sequence of all operations. (Video 46- 1). More than 50 important neurotransmitters This unit is analogous to the control mechanisms in the have been discovered thus far. Some of the best known are brain that direct a person’s attention first to one thought acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, or sensation or motor activity, then to another, and so gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, serotonin, forth, until complex sequences of thought or action take and glutamate. place. In electrical synapses, the cytoplasms of adjacent cells Figure 46- 4 is a simple block diagram of a computer. are directly connected by clusters of ion channels called Even a rapid study of this diagram demonstrates its simi- gap junctions that allow free movement of ions from the larity to the nervous system.
