But what causes the actin filaments to slide inward the myosin head, two to each head. These light chains help among the myosin filaments? This action is caused by control the function of the head during muscle contraction. forces generated by interaction of the cross- bridges from The myosin filament is made up of 200 or more individ- the myosin filaments with the actin filaments.

The central portion of one of these resting conditions, these forces are inactive, but when an filaments is shown in Figure 6-6B, displaying the tails of action potential travels along the muscle fiber, this causes the myosin molecules bundled together to form the body the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release large quantities of of the filament, while many heads of the molecules hang calcium ions that rapidly surround the myofibrils.

The bases of the actin filaments are inserted strongly into the Z disks; the ends of the filaments protrude in both direc- tions to lie in the spaces between the
