In alkalosis, the creases the Pco of extracellular fluid. This causes an in- 2 ratio of HCO 3− to CO 2 in the extracellular fluid increases, crease in H 2CO 3 and H+ concentrations, thus resulting in causing a rise in pH (a decrease in H+ concentration), as acidosis. Because the acidosis is caused by an abnormality evident from the Henderson- Hasselbalch equation. in respiration, it is called respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis can occur from pathological condi- tions
