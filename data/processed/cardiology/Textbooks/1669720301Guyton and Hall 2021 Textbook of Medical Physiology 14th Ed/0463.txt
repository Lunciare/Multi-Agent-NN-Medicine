The additional work output of each increases, even at low ventricular volumes, and reaches a ventricle required to create kinetic energy of blood flow is maximum at a ventricular volume of 150 to 170 ml. Then, proportional to the mass of blood ejected times the square as the volume increases further, the systolic pressure actu- of velocity of ejection. ally decreases under some conditions, as demonstrated Ordinarily, the work output of the left ventricle required by the falling systolic pressure curve in Figure 9- 10.
