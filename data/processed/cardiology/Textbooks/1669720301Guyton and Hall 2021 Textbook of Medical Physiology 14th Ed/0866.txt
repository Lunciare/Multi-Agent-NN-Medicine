Almost all these are negative feedback blood flow by almost 2-fold. reflex mechanisms, described in the following sections. The increase in arterial pressure during exercise results Baroreceptor Arterial Pressure Control mainly from effects of the nervous system. At the same System—Baroreceptor Reflexes time that the motor areas of the brain become activated to cause exercise, most of the reticular activating system The best known of the nervous mechanisms for arterial of the brain stem is also activated, which includes greatly pressure control is the baroreceptor reflex. Basically, this increased stimulation of the vasoconstrictor and cardio- reflex is initiated by stretch receptors, called baroreceptors acceleratory areas of the vasomotor center. These effects or pressoreceptors, located at specific points in the walls of rapidly increase the arterial pressure to keep pace with the several large systemic arteries. A rise in arterial pressure increase in muscle activity. stretches the baroreceptors and causes them to transmit In many other types of stress besides muscle exercise, signals into the CNS. Feedback signals are then sent back a similar rise in pressure can also occur. For example, dur-
