The serotonin acts on serotonin receptors in the Memory Based on Chemical Changes in sensory terminal membrane, and these receptors Presynaptic Terminals or Postsynaptic activate the enzyme adenyl cyclase inside the mem- Neuronal Membranes brane. The adenyl cyclase then causes formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), also in- Figure 58- 9 shows a mechanism of memory studied side the sensory presynaptic terminal. especially by Eric Kandel and his colleagues that can cause 3. The cAMP activates a protein kinase that causes memories lasting from a few minutes up to 3 weeks in the phosphorylation of a protein that is part of the po- large snail Aplysia. In Figure 58- 9, there are two synaptic tassium channels in the sensory synaptic terminal terminals. One terminal, which is from a sensory input membrane; this in turn blocks the channels for neuron, terminates directly on the surface of the neuron potassium conductance. The blockage can last for that is to be stimulated and is called the sensory
