Po 2 and Pco 2 in the alveoli: (1) the rate of alveo- partial pressures when V˙ A/Q˙ equals infinity is entirely dif- lar ventilation; and (2) the rate of transfer of O 2 and CO 2 ferent from the effect when V˙ A/Q˙ equals zero because now through the respiratory membrane. This discussion made there is no capillary blood flow to carry O away or to bring 2 the assumption that all the alveoli are ventilated equally, CO to the alveoli. Therefore, instead of the alveolar gases 2 and that blood flow through the alveolar capillaries is the coming to equilibrium with the venous blood, the alveolar same for each alveolus. However, even normally to some air becomes equal to the humidified inspired air. That is, extent, and especially in many lung diseases, some areas the air that is inspired loses no O to the blood and gains 2 of the lungs are well ventilated but have almost no blood no CO from the blood. Furthermore, because normal 2 flow, whereas other areas may have excellent blood flow inspired and humidified air has a Po of 149 mm Hg and 2 but little or no ventilation. In either of
