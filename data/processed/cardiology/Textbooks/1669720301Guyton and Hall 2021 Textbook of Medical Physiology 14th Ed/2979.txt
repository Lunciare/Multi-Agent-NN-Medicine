It is important for our one hand upward and downward at a rapid rate. The patient current discussion because of the intimate association rapidly “loses” all perception of the instantaneous position between the basal ganglia and the corticospinal system of the hand during any portion of the movement.

This condition is called dysdiadochokinesia. NEURONAL CIRCUITRY OF THE BASAL Dysarthria—Failure of Progression in Talking.
