For example, sodium and/ or calcium ion channels frequently become opened and Alpha and Beta Adrenergic Receptors allow rapid influx of the respective ions into the cell, usu- ally depolarizing the cell membrane and exciting the cell. Two major classes of adrenergic receptors also exist; they At other times, potassium channels are opened, allowing are called alpha receptors and beta receptors. There are potassium ions to diffuse out of the cell, which usually in- two major types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, 767 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C.
