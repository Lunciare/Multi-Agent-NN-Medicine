Release Neural Vesicles the subneural clefts lying immediately below the dense sites membrane bar areas, where the acetylcholine is emptied into the syn- aptic space. The voltage-g ated sodium channels also line the subneural clefts. Dense bar Each acetylcholine receptor is a protein complex that Calcium channels has a total molecular weight of approximately 275,000. The fetal acetylcholine receptor complex is composed of Basal lamina and five subunit proteins, two alpha proteins and one each of acetylcholinesterase beta, delta, and gamma
