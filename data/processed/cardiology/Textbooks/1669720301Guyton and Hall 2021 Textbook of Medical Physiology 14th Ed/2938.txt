of the cerebellum does Anatomical and Functional Areas of the Cerebellum not cause any conscious sensation and rarely causes any Anatomically, the cerebellum is divided into three lobes by motor movement. Removal of the cerebellum, however, two deep fissures, as shown in Figures 57- 1 and 57- 2: (1) causes body movements to become highly abnormal. The the anterior lobe, (2) the posterior lobe, and (3) the flocculo- cerebellum is especially vital during rapid muscular activ- nodular lobe. The flocculonodular lobe is the oldest portion ities such as running, typing, playing the piano, and even of the cerebellum; it developed along with (and functions talking. Loss of this area of the brain can cause almost with) the vestibular system in controlling body equilibrium, total lack of coordination of these activities, even though as discussed in Chapter 56. its loss does not cause paralysis of any muscles. Longitudinal Functional Divisions of the Anterior and How can the cerebellum be so important when it has Posterior Lobes. From a functional point of view, the an- no direct ability to cause muscle contraction? The answer terior and posterior lobes are organized not by lobes but is that it helps sequence and monitor motor
