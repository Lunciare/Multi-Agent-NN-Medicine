Thus, because the infarct, as indicated by the chest cause of the loss of muscle mass in the anterior wall of the lead, is on the posterior wall of the heart and, as indicated left ventricle but, in a posterior infarction, a Q wave has by the injury potentials in leads II and III, it is in the apical developed at the beginning of the QRS complex in lead portion of the heart, one would suspect that this infarct III because of loss of muscle in the posterior apical part is near the apex on the posterior wall of the left ventricle. of the ventricle. These configurations are certainly not found in all Infarction in Other Parts of the Heart. Using the same cases of old myocardial infarction. Local loss of muscle procedures demonstrated in the preceding discussions of and local points of cardiac signal conduction block anterior and posterior wall infarctions, it is often possi- can cause very bizarre QRS patterns (e.g., especially ble to determine the locus of an infarcted area emitting
