the concentration of H PO − is about 2 4 0.26 mmol/L. When the total quantity of phosphate in the extracellular fluid rises, so does the quantity of each of these two types of phosphate ions. Furthermore, when the pH of the extracellular fluid becomes more acidic, there is a relative increase in H PO − and a decrease in HPO =, 2 4 4 whereas the opposite occurs when the extracellular fluid becomes alkaline. These relations were presented in the discussion of acid- base balance in Chapter 31. Because it is difficult to determine chemically the exact quantities of HPO= and HPO− in the blood, ordinarily the 4 2 4 total quantity of phosphate is expressed in terms of milligrams of phosphorus per deciliter (100 milliliters) of blood. The aver- age total quantity of inorganic phosphorus represented by both phosphate ions is about 4 mg/dl, varying between nor- mal limits of 3 to 4 mg/dl in adults and 4 to 5 mg/dl in children.
