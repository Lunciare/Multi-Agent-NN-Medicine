THE ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODE DELAYS A-V node IMPULSE CONDUCTION FROM THE ATRIA TO THE VENTRICLES (0.03) The atrial conductive system is organized so that the car- Atrioventricular diac impulse does not travel from the atria into the ven- fibrous tissue tricles too rapidly; this delay allows time for the atria to (0.12) Penetrating portion empty their blood into the ventricles before ventricular of A-V bundle contraction begins. It is primarily the A- V node and its Distal portion of adjacent conductive fibers that delay this transmission A-V bundle into the ventricles. The A- V node is located in the posterior wall of the Right bundle branch Left bundle branch right atrium, immediately behind the tricuspid valve, as (0.16) shown in Figure 10- 1. Figure 10- 3 diagrams the differ- ent parts of this node, plus its connections with the enter- ing atrial internodal pathway fibers and the exiting A- V bundle. This figure also shows the approximate intervals Ventricular of time (in fractions of a second) between the initial onset septum of the cardiac impulse in the sinus node and its subse- Figure 10- 3 Organization of the atrioventricular (A- V) node.
