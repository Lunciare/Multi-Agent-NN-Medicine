“opening shock load” of up period of weightlessness is not too long. Most of the prob- to 1200 pounds could occur on the parachute shrouds. lems that do occur are related to three effects of the weight- The usual- sized parachute slows the fall of the parachut- lessness: (1) motion sickness during the first few days of ist to about one ninth the terminal velocity. In other words, travel; (2) translocation of fluids within the body because the speed of landing is about 20 feet/sec, and the force of of failure of gravity to cause normal hydrostatic pressures; impact against the earth is 1/81, the impact force without a and (3) diminished physical activity because no strength parachute. Even so, the force of impact is still great enough of muscle contraction is required to oppose the force of to cause considerable damage to the body unless the par- gravity. achutist is properly trained in landing. Actually, the force Almost 50% of astronauts experience motion sickness, of impact with the earth is about the same as that which with nausea and sometimes vomiting, during the first 2 to would be experienced by jumping without a parachute from 5 days of space
