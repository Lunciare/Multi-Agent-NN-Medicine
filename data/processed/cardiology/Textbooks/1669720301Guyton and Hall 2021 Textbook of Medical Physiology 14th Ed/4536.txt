like protein that combines with oxygen 25 within the muscle fiber; the extra myoglobin increases 20 the rate of diffusion of oxygen throughout the fiber by 15 shuttling oxygen from one molecule of myoglobin to the next. In addition, the enzymes of the aerobic metabolic 10 system are considerably more active in slow- twitch fib- 5 ers than in fast- twitch fibers. No-load training 4.
