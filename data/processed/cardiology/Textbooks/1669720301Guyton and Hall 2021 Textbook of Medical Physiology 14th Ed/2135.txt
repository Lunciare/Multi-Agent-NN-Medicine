Rate of Gas Diffusion Through the Respiratory Membrane Referring to the earlier discussion of diffusion of gases in Capillary endothelium water, one can apply the same principles to diffusion of Interstitial space Capillary basement membrane gases through the respiratory membrane. Thus, the fac- tors that determine how rapidly a gas will pass through Figure 40- 9. Ultrastructure of the alveolar respiratory membrane, shown in cross section. the membrane are the following: (1) the thickness of the membrane; (2) the surface area of the membrane; (3) the the extensiveness of the capillary plexus, the flow diffusion coefficient of the gas in the substance of the of blood in the alveolar wall has been described as membrane; and (4) the partial pressure difference of the a sheet of flowing blood. Thus, it is obvious that gas between the two sides of the membrane. the alveolar gases are in very close proximity to the The thickness of the respiratory membrane occasionally blood of the pulmonary capillaries. Furthermore, increases—for example, as a result of edema fluid in the gas exchange between the alveolar air and pulmo- interstitial space of the membrane and in the alveoli—so nary blood occurs through the membranes of all the
