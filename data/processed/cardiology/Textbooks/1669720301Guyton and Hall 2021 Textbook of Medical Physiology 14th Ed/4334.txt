One of these follicles finally change of granulosa and theca interna cells into lutein becomes “mature” and ovulates on the 14th day of the cells depends mainly on LH secreted by the anterior pi- cycle. During growth of the follicles, estrogen is mainly tuitary gland. In fact, this function gives LH its name— secreted. “luteinizing,” for “yellowing.” Luteinization also depends After ovulation, the secretory cells of the ovulating on extrusion of the ovum from the follicle.
