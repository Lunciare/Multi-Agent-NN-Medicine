The bases of the actin filaments are inserted strongly into the Z disks; the ends of the filaments protrude in both direc- tions to lie in the spaces between the myosin molecules, as shown in Figure 6-5.

Attached to one end of each tro- pomyosin has a molecular weight of 70,000 and a length pomyosin molecule is a troponin complex that initiates contraction. of 40 nanometers. These molecules are wrapped spirally around the sides of the F-a ctin helix. In the resting state, of each myosin molecule hangs to the side along with the the tropomyosin molecules lie on top of the active sites of head, thus providing an arm that extends the head out- the actin strands so that attraction cannot occur between ward from the body, as shown in the figure.
