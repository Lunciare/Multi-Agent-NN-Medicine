In compari- son, about 8 ml oxygen/100 g are delivered to the normal resting left ventricle each minute. Therefore, if there is even 15% to 30% of normal resting coronary blood flow, Normal the muscle will not die. In the central portion of a large contraction infarct, however, where there is almost no collateral blood flow, the muscle does die. Nonfunctional Subendocardial Infarction. The subendocardial mus- muscle cle frequently becomes infarcted, even when there is no evidence of infarction in the outer surface portions of the heart. This occurs because the subendocardial muscle has a higher oxygen consumption and extra difficulty obtain- Systolic stretch ing adequate blood flow because the blood vessels in the subendocardium are intensely compressed by systolic contraction of the heart, as explained earlier. Therefore, any condition that compromises blood flow to any area of the heart usually causes damage first in the subendocardi- al regions, and the damage then spreads outward toward Figure 21- 7. Systolic stretch in an area of ischemic cardiac muscle. the epicardium. CAUSES OF DEATH AFTER ACUTE more than 40% of the left ventricle is infarcted, and death CORONARY OCCLUSION occurs in more than 70% of patients once cardiac shock develops. The
