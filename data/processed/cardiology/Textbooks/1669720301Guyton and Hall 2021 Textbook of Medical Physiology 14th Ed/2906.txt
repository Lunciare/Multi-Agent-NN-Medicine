on on the opposite side of the body (because the motor path- the anterior motor neurons. ways cross to the opposite side). This spasm results mainly 702 CHAPTER 56 Cortical and Brain Stem Control of Motor Function from damage to accessory pathways from the nonpyramidal portions of the motor cortex. These pathways normally in- hibit the vestibular and reticular brain stem motor nuclei. Pontine reticular nuclei When these nuclei cease their state of inhibition (i.e., are “disinhibited”), they become spontaneously active and cause excessive spastic tone in the involved muscles, as we discuss more fully later in this chapter. This spasticity is that which normally accompanies a “stroke” in a human being. CONTROL OF MOTOR FUNCTIONS BY Vestibular nuclei THE BRAIN STEM The brain stem consists of the medulla, pons, and mes- Medullary reticular nuclei encephalon (or midbrain). In one sense, it is an extension of the spinal cord upward into the cranial cavity because it contains motor and sensory nuclei that perform motor and sensory functions for the face and head regions in the same way that the spinal cord performs these functions from the neck down. In another sense, however, the brain stem is its own master because
