as needed so that other functions can be performed. VESTIBULAR SENSATIONS AND Role of the Vestibular Nuclei to Excite the MAINTENANCE OF EQUILIBRIUM Antigravity Muscles VESTIBULAR APPARATUS All the vestibular nuclei, shown in Figure 56- 7, function in association with the pontine reticular nuclei to control The vestibular apparatus, shown in Figure 56- 9, is the the antigravity muscles. The vestibular nuclei transmit sensory organ for detecting sensations of equilibrium. It is strong excitatory signals to the antigravity muscles via encased in a system of bony tubes and chambers located the lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts in the ante- in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, called the rior columns of the spinal cord, as shown in Figure 56- 8. bony labyrinth. Within this system are membranous Without this support of the vestibular nuclei, the pontine tubes and chambers called the membranous labyrinth. reticular system would lose much of its excitation of the The membranous labyrinth is the functional part of the axial antigravity muscles. vestibular apparatus. The specific role of the vestibular nuclei, however, is The top of Figure 56- 9 shows the membranous to selectively control the excitatory signals to the different labyrinth. It is composed mainly
