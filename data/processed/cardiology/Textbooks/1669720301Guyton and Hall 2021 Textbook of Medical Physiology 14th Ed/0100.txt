from each double tubule toward an adjacent dou- ble tubule. Given this basic information, it has been determined that the release of energy from ATP in contact with the ATPase dynein arms causes the heads of these arms to Forward stroke “crawl” rapidly along the surface of the adjacent double tubule. If the front tubules crawl outward while the back tubules remain stationary, bending occurs. Basal plate The way in which cilia contraction is controlled is not well understood. The cilia of some genetically abnormal Cell membrane cells do not have the two central single tubules, and these Backward stroke cilia fail to beat. Therefore, it is presumed that some signal, Basal body perhaps an electrochemical signal, is transmitted along these two central tubules to activate the dynein arms. Rootlet Nonmotile Primary Cilia Serve as Cell Sensory “An- tennae.” Primary cilia are nonmotile and generally occur only as a single cilium on each cell. Although the physiological functions of primary cilia are not fully un- Figure 2-18. Structure and function of the cilium.
