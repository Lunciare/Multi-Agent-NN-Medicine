Phase 2 (Plateau): Calcium Channels Open and Fast the calcium channels just noted. Regardless of the cause, Potassium Channels Close. A brief initial repolarization the decreased potassium permeability greatly decreases occurs and the action potential then plateaus as a result the efflux of positively charged potassium ions during the of increased calcium ion permeability and decreased po- action potential plateau and thereby prevents early return tassium ion permeability. The voltage-g ated calcium ion of the action potential voltage to its resting level. When the channels open slowly during phases 1 and 0, and calcium slow calcium- sodium channels do close at the end of 0.2 enters the cell. Potassium channels then close, and the to 0.3 second, and the influx of calcium and sodium ions combination of decreased potassium ion efflux and in- ceases, the membrane permeability for potassium ions also creased calcium ion influx causes the action potential to increases rapidly. This rapid loss of potassium from the plateau. fiber immediately returns the membrane potential to its Phase 3 (Rapid Repolarization): Calcium Channels resting level, thus ending the action potential.
