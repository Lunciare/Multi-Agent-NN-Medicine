This mechanism, plus the direct effect of effect is demonstrated by the two red curves in Figure stimulus intensity on impulse rate in each nerve fiber, as 48-1 0, showing complete separation of the peaks when well as several other mechanisms, make it possible for some the intensity of lateral inhibition is great. sensory systems to operate reasonably faithfully at stimulus intensity levels changing as much as millions of times.
