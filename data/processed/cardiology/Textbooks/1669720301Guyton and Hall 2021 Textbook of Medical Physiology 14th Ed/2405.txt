reaches the pr- ion concentration is shown to be high in the extracellular esynaptic terminal (Figure 46- 8A). In other cases, these fluid (142 mEq/L) but low inside the neuron (14 mEq/L). transmitters may be localized in different populations of This sodium concentration gradient is caused by a strong 579 UNIT IX UNIT IX The Nervous System: A. General Principles and Sensory Physiology Dendrite calculates to be +61 mV. However, the actual membrane potential is −65 mV, not +61 mV. Therefore, the sodium ions that leak to the interior are immediately pumped back to the exterior by the sodium pump, thus maintain- ing the −65- mV negative potential inside the neuron. Na+: 142 mEq/L 14 mEq/L For potassium ions, the concentration gradient is 120 (Pumps) mEq/L inside the neuron and 4.5 mEq/L outside. This K+: 4.5 mEq/L 120 mEq/L (cid:31)65 Axon concentration gradient calculates to be a Nernst potential mV of −86 mV inside the neuron, which is more negative than Cl- : 107 mEq/L ? 8 mEq/L the −65 that actually exists. Therefore, because of the high Pump intracellular potassium ion concentration, there is a net tendency for potassium ions to diffuse to the outside of Axon hillock the
