Thus, over about 0.15 second, the period of time Because the septum and endocardial areas of the required for the entire process to take place, the T wave of ventricular muscle depolarize first, it seems logical that the ECG is generated. these areas should repolarize first as well. However, this is not the usual case, because the septum and other ATRIAL DEPOLARIZATION—THE P WAVE endocardial areas have a longer period of contraction than most of the external surfaces of the heart.
