and 13, slow transmission does −75 millivolts rather than the normal level of −55 to −60 occur, and the pumping effectiveness of the ventricles is millivolts. Therefore, the initial rise of the sinus nodal decreased as much as 20% to 30%. Implantable cardiac membrane potential caused by inward sodium and cal- resynchronization devices are types of pacemakers using cium leakage requires much longer to reach the threshold electrical wires or leads that can be inserted into the car- potential for excitation. This requirement greatly slows diac chambers to restore appropriate timing between the the rate of rhythmicity of these nodal fibers.

In the A- V node, a state of hyperpolarization caused SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC by vagal stimulation makes it difficult for the small atrial NERVES CONTROL HEART RHYTHMICITY fibers entering the node to generate enough electricity AND IMPULSE CONDUCTION BY THE to excite the nodal fibers. Therefore, the safety factor for CARDIAC NERVES transmission of the cardiac impulse through the transi- tional fibers into
