The total quantity of O bound with hemoglobin in 2 The chemistry of hemoglobin is presented in Chapter 33, normal systemic arterial blood, which is 97% saturated, is where we pointed out that the O 2 molecule combines about 19.4 ml/100 ml of blood, as shown in Figure 41-9. loosely and reversibly with the heme portion of hemoglo- On passing through the tissue capillaries, this amount is bin. When Po 2 is high, as in the pulmonary capillaries, reduced, on average, to 14.4 ml (Po 2 of 40 mm Hg, 75% O 2 binds with hemoglobin, but when Po 2 is low, as in the saturated hemoglobin). Thus, under normal conditions, tissue capillaries, O 2 is released from hemoglobin. This is about 5 ml of O 2 are transported from the lungs to the tis- the basis for almost all O 2 transport from the lungs to the sues by each 100 ml of blood flow. tissues.
