about 100 mm only fourfold, the respective flows are 1, 16, and 256 ml/ Hg. Therefore, the resistance of the entire systemic cir- min, which is a 256-f old increase in flow. Thus, the conduct- culation, called the total peripheral resistance, is about ance of the vessel increases in proportion to the fourth pow- 100/100, or 1 PRU. er of the diameter, in accordance with the following formula: In conditions in which all the blood vessels throughout Conductance∝Diameter4 the body become strongly constricted, the total periph- eral resistance occasionally rises to as high as 4 PRU. Conversely, when the vessels become greatly dilated, the Poiseuille’s Law. The cause of this great increase in con- resistance can fall to as little as 0.2 PRU. ductance when the diameter increases can be explained In the pulmonary system, the mean pulmonary arterial by referring to Figure 14-8B, which shows cross sections pressure averages 16 mm Hg and the mean left atrial pres- of a large and small vessel. The concentric rings inside the sure averages 2 mm Hg, giving a net pressure difference of vessels indicate that the velocity of flow in each ring is 14 mm. Therefore, when the cardiac output is
