Another function of the tensor tympani and stapedius time the tympanic membrane moves inward; and (2) muscles is to decrease a person’s hearing sensitivity to his pull backward on the fluid every time the malleus moves or her own speech. This effect is activated by collateral outward. nerve signals transmitted to these muscles at the same time that the brain activates the voice mechanism. “Impedance Matching” by the Ossicular System. The amplitude of movement of the stapes faceplate with each TRANSMISSION OF SOUND THROUGH sound vibration is only three-fourths as much as the ampli- BONE tude of the handle of the malleus. Therefore, the ossicular lever system does not increase the movement distance of Because the inner ear, the cochlea, is embedded in a bony the stapes, as is commonly believed. Instead, the system ac- cavity in the temporal bone, called the bony labyrinth, vibra- tually reduces the distance but increases the force of move- tions of the entire skull can cause fluid vibrations in the ment about 1.3 times. In addition, the surface area of the cochlea. Therefore, under appropriate conditions, a tuning tympanic membrane is about 55 square millimeters, where- fork or an electronic vibrator placed on any
