the epithelium: They extrude mucus directly onto the epithelial surface to act as a lubricant that also protects the surfaces from excoriation and digestion. Second, many surface areas of the gastrointestinal tract are lined by pits that represent invaginations of the epi- thelium into the submucosa. In the small intestine, these pits, called crypts of Lieberkühn, are deep and contain specialized secretory cells. One of these cells is shown in Figure 65- 1. Third, in the stomach and upper duodenum are large numbers of deep tubular glands. A typical tubular gland Basement Mitochondria Ribosomes Zymogen can be seen in Figure 65- 4, which shows an acid- and membrane granules pepsinogen- secreting gland of the stomach (oxyntic Figure 65-1 .
