Therefore, the visual acuity of people with albinism, even This substance is a combination of the protein scotopsin with the best optical correction, is seldom better than and the carotenoid pigment retinal (also called “retinene”). 20/100 to 20/200 rather than the normal 20/20 values. Furthermore, the retinal is a particular type called 11-c is The pigment layer also stores large quantities of retinal. This cis form of retinal is important because only vitamin A. This vitamin A is exchanged back and forth this form can bind with scotopsin to synthesize rhodopsin. through the cell membranes of the outer segments of the When light energy is absorbed by rhodopsin, the rho- rods and cones, which are embedded in the pigment. We dopsin begins to decompose within a very small fraction discuss later that vitamin A is an important precursor of of a second, as shown at the top of Figure 51- 5. The cause the photosensitive chemicals of the rods and cones. of this rapid decomposition is photoactivation of elec- trons in the retinal portion of the rhodopsin, which leads Blood Supply of the Retina—The Central Retinal
