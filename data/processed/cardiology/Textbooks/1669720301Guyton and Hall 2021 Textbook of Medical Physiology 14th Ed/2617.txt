the eye in place of the removed lens. A special feature of the contact lens is that it nullifies the re- VISUAL ACUITY fraction that normally occurs at the anterior surface of the cor- nea almost entirely. The reason for this nullification is that the Theoretically, light from a distant point source, when tears between the contact lens and the cornea have a refractive focused on the retina, should be infinitely small. However, index almost equal to that of the cornea, so the anterior surface because the lens system of the eye is never perfect, such of the cornea no longer plays a significant role in the eye’s opti- a retinal spot ordinarily has a total diameter of about 11 cal system. Instead, the outer surface of the contact lens plays the major role. Thus, the refraction of this surface of the con- micrometers, even with maximal resolution of the normal tact lens substitutes for the cornea’s usual refraction. This factor eye optical system. The spot is brightest in its center and is especially important in people whose eye refractive errors shades off gradually toward the edges, as shown by the are caused by an abnormally shaped cornea, such as
