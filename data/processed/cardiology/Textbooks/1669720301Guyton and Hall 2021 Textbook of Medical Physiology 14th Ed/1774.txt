As of a pathological condition in which urine is propelled up a consequence of this low colloid osmotic pressure in the one or both of the ureters during micturition. This condi- plasma, large amounts of fluid leak from the capillaries tion is called vesicoureteral reflux and is due to failure of the all over the body into most of the tissues, causing severe bladder wall to occlude the ureter during micturition; as a edema, as discussed in Chapter 25. result, some of the urine is propelled upward toward the kidney, carrying with it bacteria that can reach the renal NEPHRON FUNCTION IN CHRONIC KIDNEY pelvis and renal medulla, where they can initiate infection DISEASE and inflammation associated with pyelonephritis.
