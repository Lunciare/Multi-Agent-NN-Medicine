CORTEX IN HEARING The projection area of auditory signals to the cerebral cor- tex is shown in Figure 53- 10, which demonstrates that Nucleus of the auditory cortex lies principally on the supratempo- Pons the lateral ral plane of the superior temporal gyrus but also extends lemniscus onto the lateral side of the temporal lobe, over much of the insular cortex, and even onto the lateral portion of the parietal operculum. Two separate subdivisions are shown in Figure 53- Pons 10—the primary auditory cortex and the auditory asso- ciation cortex (also called the secondary auditory cortex). Superior The primary auditory cortex is directly excited by projec- olivary Dorsal nucleus tions from the medial geniculate body, whereas the audi- acoustic stria tory association areas are excited secondarily by impulses Intermediate acoustic site from the primary auditory cortex, as well as by some pro- Medulla jections from thalamic association areas adjacent to the Cochlear nuclei medial geniculate body. Sound Frequency Perception in the Primary N. VIlI Trapezoid Auditory Cortex. At least six tonotopic maps have been body described in the primary auditory cortex and auditory association areas. In each of these maps, high-f requency sounds excite neurons at one end of the
