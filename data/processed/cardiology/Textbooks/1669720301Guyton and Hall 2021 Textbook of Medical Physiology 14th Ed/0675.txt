turbulent, or disorderly, rather than stream- lined (Figure 14-6C). Turbulent flow means that the blood Parabolic Velocity Profile During Laminar Flow. flows crosswise in the vessel and along the vessel, usually When laminar flow occurs, the velocity of flow in the forming whorls in the blood, called eddy currents. These center of the vessel is far greater than that toward the eddy currents are similar to the whirlpools that can be outer edges. This phenomenon is demonstrated in seen in a rapidly flowing river at a point of obstruction. Figure 14-6. In Figure 14-6A, a vessel contains two When eddy currents are present, the blood flows with fluids, the one at the left colored by a dye and the one much greater resistance than when the flow is streamlined because eddies add to the overall friction of flow in the vessel tremendously. Crystal The tendency for turbulent flow increases in direct pro- portion to the velocity of blood flow, the diameter of the blood vessel, and the density of the blood and is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the blood, in accordance with the following equation: Transmitted Reflected ν⋅d⋅ρ wave wave Re= η Figure 14-5.
