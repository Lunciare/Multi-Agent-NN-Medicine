Of special Pressure importance is that they are capable of constricting and enlarging and thereby storing small or large quantities Large veins have so little resistance to blood flow when of blood and making this blood available when required they are distended that the resistance then is almost by the remainder of the circulation. The peripheral veins zero. However, as shown in Figure 15-9, most of the can also propel blood forward by means of a so- called large veins that enter the thorax are compressed at many venous pump, and they even help regulate cardiac output, points by the surrounding tissues, so that blood flow is an exceedingly important function described in detail in impeded at these points.
