The ter is still unclear, experiments have made it possible to vasoconstrictor fibers are distributed to essentially all seg- identify certain important areas in this center: ments of the circulation, but more to some tissues than 1. A vasoconstrictor area located bilaterally in the an- to others. This sympathetic vasoconstrictor effect is espe- terolateral portions of the upper medulla. The neu- cially powerful in the kidneys, intestines, spleen, and skin rons originating in this area distribute their fibers 218 Chapter 18 Nervous Regulation of the Circulation and Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure tone throughout the body. A few minutes later, a small 150 amount of the hormone norepinephrine was injected into Total spinal the blood (norepinephrine is the principal vasoconstrictor 125 anesthesia hormonal substance secreted at the endings of the sympa- thetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers). As this injected hor- 100 mone was transported in the blood to blood vessels, the 75 vessels once again became constricted, and the arterial pressure rose to a level even greater than normal for 1 to 3 50 minutes until the norepinephrine was destroyed. 25 Injection of norepinephrine Control of Heart Activity by the Vasomotor Center. 0 At the same time that the
