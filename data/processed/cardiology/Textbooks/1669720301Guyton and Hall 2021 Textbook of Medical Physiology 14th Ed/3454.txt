This subunit stim- glucose co- transporter 1. ulates formation of excess cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which opens tremendous numbers of chloride channels, al- lowing chloride ions to flow rapidly from inside the cell into ABSORPTION OF NUTRIENTS the intestinal crypts. In turn, this action is believed to activate a sodium pump that pumps sodium ions into the crypts to Carbohydrates Are Mainly Absorbed as go along with the chloride ions. Finally, all this extra sodium Monosaccharides chloride causes extreme osmosis of water from the blood, thus providing rapid flow of fluid along with the salt. All this Essentially all the carbohydrates in food are absorbed in the excess fluid washes away most of the bacteria and is of value form of monosaccharides; only a small fraction is absorbed as in combating the disease, but too much of a good thing can disaccharides and almost none is absorbed as larger carbohy- be lethal because of serious dehydration of the whole body drate compounds. By far the most abundant of the absorbed that might ensue. In most instances, the life of a person with monosaccharides is glucose, which usually accounts for more
