an Active Transport Mechanism for Re- absorption of Proteins. Some parts of the tubule, espe- NNaa++ NNaa++ cially the proximal tubule, reabsorb large molecules such as −70 mV ATP NHE proteins via pinocytosis, a type of endocytosis. In this pro- KK++ HH++ cess, the protein attaches to the brush border of the luminal membrane, and this portion of the membrane then invagi- nates to the interior of the cell until it is completely pinched Counter-transport off and a vesicle is formed containing the protein. Once inside the cell, the protein is digested into its constituent Figure 28- 3 Mechanisms of secondary active transport. The upper cell shows the co- transport of glucose and amino acids along with amino acids, which are reabsorbed through the basolateral sodium ions through the apical side of the tubular epithelial cells, membrane into the interstitial fluid. Because pinocytosis followed by facilitated diffusion through the basolateral membranes. requires energy, it is considered a form of active transport. The lower cell shows the counter- transport of hydrogen ions from the interior of the cell across the apical membrane and into the tubu- Transport Maximum for Substances That Are A ctively lar lumen; movement of sodium ions into
