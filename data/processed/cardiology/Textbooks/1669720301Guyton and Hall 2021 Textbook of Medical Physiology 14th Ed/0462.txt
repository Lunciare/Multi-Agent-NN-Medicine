First, the major proportion is used to move Until the volume of the noncontracting ventricle the blood from the low- pressure veins to the high- pressure rises above about 150 ml, the diastolic pressure does arteries. This is called volume- pressure work or external not increase much. Therefore, up to this volume, blood work. Second, a minor proportion of the energy is used to can flow easily into the ventricle from the atrium. Above accelerate the blood to its velocity of ejection through the aortic and pulmonary valves, which is the kinetic energy of 150 ml, the ventricular diastolic pressure increases rap- blood flow component of the work output. idly, partly because of fibrous tissue in the heart that will Right ventricular external work output is normally stretch no more, and partly because the pericardium that about one-sixth the work output of the left ventricle be- surrounds the heart
