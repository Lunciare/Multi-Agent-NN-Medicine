Shown are the ventricular vectors and QRS complexes 0.01 second after onset of ventricular depolarization (A), 0.02 second after onset of depolarization (B), 0.035 second after onset of depolarization (C), 0.05 second after onset of depolarization (D), and after depolarization of the ventricles is complete, 0.06 second after onset (E). In Figure 12-7C, about 0.035 second after onset of In Figure 12-7E, about 0.06 second after onset of depo- depolarization, the heart vector is becoming shorter, and larization, the entire ventricular muscle mass is depolarized the recorded electrocardiographic voltages are lower, so that no current flows around the heart and no electrical because the outside of the heart apex is now electronega- potential is generated. The vector becomes
