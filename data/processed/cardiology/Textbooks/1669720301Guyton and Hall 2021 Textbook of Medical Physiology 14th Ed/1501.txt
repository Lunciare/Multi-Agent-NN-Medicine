ability is limited by the IN THE RENAL MEDULLA level of ADH and by the degree of hyperosmolarity of the renal medulla. We discuss the factors that control ADH The transport characteristics of the loops of Henle are secretion later, but for now, what is the process whereby summarized in Table 29- 1, along with the properties of renal medullary interstitial fluid becomes hyperosmotic? the proximal tubules, distal tubules, cortical collecting This process involves the operation of the countercurrent tubules, and inner medullary collecting ducts. multiplier mechanism. A major reason for the high medullary osmolarity is The countercurrent multiplier mechanism depends on active transport of sodium and co- transport of potas- the special anatomical arrangement of the loops of Henle sium, chloride, and other ions from the thick ascending and vasa recta, the specialized peritubular capillaries of loop of Henle into the interstitium. This pump is capable the renal medulla. In humans, about 25% of the nephrons of establishing about a 200-m Osm/L concentration gra- are juxtamedullary nephrons, with loops of Henle and dient between the tubular lumen and interstitial fluid. vasa recta that go deeply into the medulla before return- Because the thick ascending limb is virtually imperme- ing
