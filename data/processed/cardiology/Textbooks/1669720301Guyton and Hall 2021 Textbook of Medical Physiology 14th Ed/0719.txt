As the cuff pressure falls a few mm Hg further, Chapter 19 that the kidneys are primarily responsible for the artery no longer closes during diastole, which means this long- term regulation of arterial pressure; it is well that the basic factor causing the sounds (the jetting of known that the kidneys exhibit definitive changes with blood through a squeezed artery) is no longer present. age, especially after the age of 50 years. Therefore, the sounds disappear entirely. Many clinicians A slight extra increase in systolic pressure usually believe that the pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds occurs beyond the age of 60 years. This increase results completely disappear should be used as the diastolic pres- from decreasing distensibility, or hardening, of the arter- sure, except in situations in which the disappearance of ies, which is often a result of atherosclerosis. The final sounds cannot reliably be determined because sounds effect is a higher systolic pressure with considerable are audible, even after complete deflation of the cuff. For increase in pulse pressure, as previously explained. example, in patients with arteriovenous fistulas for hemo- dialysis or with aortic insufficiency, Korotkoff sounds may
