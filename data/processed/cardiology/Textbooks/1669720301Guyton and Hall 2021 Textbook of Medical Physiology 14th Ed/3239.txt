gray matter. of Monro An important structural characteristic of the brain cap- illaries is that most of them are much less “leaky” than the blood capillaries in almost any other tissue of the body. One reason for this phenomenon is that the capillaries are supported on all sides by “glial feet,” which are small pro- jections from the surrounding glial cells (e.g., astroglial Tentorium Third ventricle cells) that abut against all surfaces of the capillaries and cerebelli provide physical support to prevent overstretching of the Aqueduct of Sylvius Fourth capillaries in case of high capillary blood pressure. ventricle The walls of the small arterioles leading to the brain Foramen of Magendie capillaries become greatly thickened in people in whom high blood pressure develops, and these arterioles remain significantly constricted all the time to prevent transmis- Figure 62- 5.
