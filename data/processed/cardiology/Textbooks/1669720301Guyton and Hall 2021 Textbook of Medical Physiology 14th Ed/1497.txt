to survive in the Urine specific gravity is generally expressed in grams desert without drinking water; sufficient water can be per milliliter (g/ml) and, in humans, normally ranges obtained through the ingested food and water produced from 1.002 to 1.028 g/ml, rising by 0.001 for every 35- to in the body by metabolism of the food. Animals adapted 40- mOsm/L increase in urine osmolarity. This relation- ship between specific gravity and osmolarity is altered to freshwater environments usually have minimal urine- when there are significant amounts of large molecules in concentrating ability. Beavers, for example, can concen- the urine, such as glucose, radiocontrast media used for trate the urine only to about 500 mOsm/L. diagnostic purposes, or some antibiotics. In these cases, urine specific gravity measurements may falsely suggest Obligatory Urine Volume a highly concentrated urine, despite a normal urine os- molality. The maximal concentrating ability of the kidney dictates Dipsticks are available that measure approximate urine how much urine volume must be excreted each day to rid specific gravity, but most laboratories measure specific the body of metabolic waste products and electrolytes that gravity with a refractometer. are ingested. A normal 70-k g person must excrete about 600 milliosmoles
