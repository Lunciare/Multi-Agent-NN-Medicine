Function of the Cerebellum to Prevent Overshoot and Cerebrocerebellum—Function of the to “Damp” Movements. Almost all movements of the Large Lateral Zone of the Cerebellar body are “pendular.” For example, when an arm is moved, Hemisphere to Plan, Sequence, and Time momentum develops, and the momentum must be over- Complex Movements come before the movement can be stopped. Because of momentum, all pendular movements have a tendency to In humans the lateral zones of the
