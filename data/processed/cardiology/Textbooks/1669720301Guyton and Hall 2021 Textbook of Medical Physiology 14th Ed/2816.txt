These dendrites receive synapses from the olfactory cell neurons; the mitral and tufted cells send axons through Threshold for Smell. One of the principal characteris- the olfactory tract to transmit olfactory signals to higher tics of smell is the minute quantity of stimulating agent in levels in the central nervous system. the air that can elicit a smell sensation. For example, the Some research has suggested that different glomeruli substance methylmercaptan can be smelled when only respond to different odors. It is possible that specific one 25 trillionth of a gram is present in each milliliter of glomeruli are the real clue to the analysis of different odor air. Because of this very low threshold, this substance is signals transmitted into the central nervous system. mixed with natural gas to give the gas an odor that can be detected when even small amounts of gas leak from a Primitive and Newer Olfactory Pathways pipeline.
