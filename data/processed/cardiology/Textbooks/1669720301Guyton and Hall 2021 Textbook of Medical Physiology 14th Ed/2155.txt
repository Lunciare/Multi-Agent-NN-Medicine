alveoli exhibit serious physiological dead space. Both conditions by the flowing blood. Thus, the ventilation of these alve- tremendously decrease the effectiveness of the lungs as gas oli is said to be wasted. The ventilation of the anatomical exchange organs, sometimes reducing their effectiveness to dead space areas of the respiratory passageways is also as little as one- tenth normal. In fact, this condition is the wasted. The sum of these two types of wasted ventila- most prevalent cause of pulmonary disability today. tion is called the physiological dead space. This space is measured in the clinical pulmonary function laboratory Bibliography by making appropriate blood and expiratory gas meas- urements and by using the following equation, called the Clark A, Tawhai M: Pulmonary vascular dynamics.
