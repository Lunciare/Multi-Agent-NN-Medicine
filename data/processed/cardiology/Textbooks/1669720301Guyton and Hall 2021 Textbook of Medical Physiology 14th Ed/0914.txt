Indeed, renal function curve to a higher pressure level, as shown when the total peripheral resistance is acutely increased, in Figure 19-3 A. We will see an example of this mecha- the arterial pressure does rise immediately. Yet, if the nism later in this chapter when we discuss hypertension kidneys continue to function normally, the acute rise in caused by vasoconstrictor mechanisms. However, it is arterial pressure usually is not maintained. Instead, the the increase in renal resistance that is the culprit, not arterial pressure returns all the way to normal within the increased total peripheral resistance—an important about 1 or 2 days.

The reason for this phenomenon is that increasing vas- Increased Fluid Volume Can Elevate cular resistance everywhere else in the body besides in the Arterial Pressure by Increasing Cardiac kidneys does not change the equilibrium point for blood Output or Total Peripheral Resistance pressure control as dictated by the kidneys (see Figures 19- 1 and 19- 3).
