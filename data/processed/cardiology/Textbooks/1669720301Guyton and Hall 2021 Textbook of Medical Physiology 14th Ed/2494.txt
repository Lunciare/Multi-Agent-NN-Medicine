and then divides many times to provide ter- minals that synapse with local neurons in the intermedi- Lower medulla oblongata ate and anterior portions of the cord gray matter. These Dorsal column nuclei local neurons in turn serve three functions: 1. A major share of them give off fibers that enter the dorsal columns of the cord and then travel upward Ascending branches of dorsal root fibers to the brain. 2. Many of the fibers are very short and terminate lo- cally in the spinal cord gray matter to elicit local spinal cord reflexes, which are discussed in Chap- ter 55. 3. Others give rise to the spinocerebellar tracts, which Dorsal root we discuss in Chapter 57 in relation to the function and spinal of the cerebellum. ganglion Dorsal Column–Medial Lemniscal Pathway. Note in Figure 48- 3 that nerve fibers entering the dorsal columns pass uninterrupted up to the dorsal medulla, where they synapse in the dorsal column nuclei (the cuneate and gracile nuclei). From there, second- order neurons decussate imme- diately to the opposite side of the brain stem and continue upward through the medial lemnisci to the thalamus. In this pathway through the brain stem, each medial lemnis-
