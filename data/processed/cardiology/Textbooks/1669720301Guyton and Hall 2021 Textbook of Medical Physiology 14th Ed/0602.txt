biphasic T wave caused by digitalis toxicity. the left ventricle to become depolarized about 0.08 second after depolarization of the right ventricle, which Mild ischemia is the most common cause of short- gives a strong mean QRS vector to the left. However, ening of depolarization of cardiac muscle because this the refractory periods of the right and left ventricular condition increases current flow through the potas- muscle masses are not greatly different from each other. sium channels. When the ischemia occurs in only one Therefore, the right ventricle begins to repolarize long area of the heart, the depolarization period of this area before the left ventricle, which causes strong positivity in decreases out of proportion to that in other portions. the right ventricle and negativity in the left ventricle when As a result, changes in the T- wave morphology, such the T wave is developing. In other words, the mean axis of as inversion or biphasic waveforms, can be evidence of the T wave is now deviated to the right, which is opposite myocardial ischemia. The ischemia might result from to the mean electrical axis of the QRS complex in the chronic, progressive coronary stenosis (narrowing), same ECG. Thus, when
