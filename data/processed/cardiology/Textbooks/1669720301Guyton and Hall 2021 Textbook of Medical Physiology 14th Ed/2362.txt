Incoming signals is achieved by controlling (1) contraction of appropriate enter this neuron through synapses located mostly on the skeletal muscles throughout the body; (2) contraction of neuronal dendrites, but also on the cell body. For different smooth muscle in the internal organs; and (3) secretion types of neurons, there may be only a few hundred or as of active chemical substances by both exocrine and endo- many as 200,000 such synaptic connections from input crine glands in many parts of the body. These activities are fibers. In contrast, the output signal travels via a single collectively called motor functions of the nervous system, axon leaving the neuron. Then, this axon may have many and the muscles and glands are called effectors because separate branches to other parts of the nervous system or they are the actual anatomical structures that perform the peripheral body. functions dictated by the nerve signals. A special feature of most synapses is that the signal Figure 46- 3 shows the “skeletal” motor nerve axis of normally passes only in the forward
