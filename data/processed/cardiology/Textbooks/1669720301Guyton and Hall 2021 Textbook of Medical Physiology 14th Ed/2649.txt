The answer is that when rhodopsin decomposes, it trans retinal. decreases the rod membrane conductance for sodium ions It is the metarhodopsin II, also called activated rho- in the outer segment of the rod causing hyperpolarization. dopsin, that excites electrical changes in the rods, and the Figure 51- 6 shows movement of sodium and potas- rods then transmit the visual image into the central ner- sium ions in a complete electrical circuit through the vous system in the form of optic nerve action potentials, inner and outer segments of the rod.
