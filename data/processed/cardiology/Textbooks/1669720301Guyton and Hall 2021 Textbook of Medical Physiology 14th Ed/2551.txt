It can also block Mesencephalon many local cord reflexes that result from pain signals, Fourth ventricle Enkephalin neuron especially withdrawal reflexes described in Chapter 55. Pons THE BRAIN’S OPIATE SYSTEM— ENDORPHINS AND ENKEPHALINS Nucleus raphe magnus More than 50 years ago, it was discovered that injection of minute quantities of morphine either into the peri- ventricular nucleus around the third ventricle or into Medulla the periaqueductal gray area of the brain stem causes an extreme degree of analgesia. In subsequent studies, Serotonergic neuron from nucleus raphe magnus morphine- like agents, mainly the opiates, were found to act at many other points in the analgesia system, including the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. Because most drugs that alter excitability of neurons do so by acting on synaptic receptors, it was assumed that the Enkephalin neuron “morphine receptors” of the analgesia system must be Pain receptor receptors for some morphine- like neurotransmitter that neuron is naturally secreted in the brain. Therefore, an exten- sive search was undertaken for the natural opiate of the brain. About a dozen such opiate- like substances have now been found at different points of the nervous sys- tem. All are breakdown products of three large protein
