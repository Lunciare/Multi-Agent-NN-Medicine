Collaterals also terminate in the inferior olivary nuclei, cord. and from there, secondary olivocerebellar fibers trans- mit signals to multiple areas of the cerebellum. Motor cortex Thus, the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum all receive strong motor signals from the corticospinal system every time a signal is transmitted down the spinal cord to Corticorubral cause a motor activity. tract Incoming Sensory Fiber Pathways to the Motor Cortex The functions of the motor cortex are controlled mainly by nerve signals from the somatosensory system but also, to some degree, from other sensory systems such as hearing and vision. Once the sensory information is received, the Interpositus Red nucleus motor cortex operates in association with the basal ganglia nucleus and cerebellum to excite appropriate motor actions. The Dentate more important incoming fiber pathways to the motor cor- nucleus Reticular formation tex are the following: Cerebellum 1. Subcortical fibers from adjacent regions of the cerebral Rubrospinal tract cortex, especially from (a) the somatosensory areas of the parietal cortex, (b) the adjacent areas of the frontal cortex anterior to the motor cortex, and (c) the visual Figure 56- 5.
