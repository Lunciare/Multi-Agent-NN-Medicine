It can also increase the mean systemic filling pressure (depicted QUANTITATIVE GRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF by the point where the venous return curve crosses the CARDIAC FAILURE zero venous return axis) by several millimeters of mer- cury—in this figure, from a normal value of 7 mm Hg Although it is possible to understand most general prin- up to 10 mm Hg. This increase in mean systemic filling ciples of cardiac failure using mainly qualitative logic, pressure shifts the entire venous return curve to the right as we have done thus far in this chapter, one can grasp and upward. The new cardiac output and venous return the importance of the different factors in cardiac failure curves now equilibrate at point C—that is, at a right atrial in greater depth by using more quantitative approaches. pressure of +5 mm Hg and a cardiac output of 4 L/min. One such approach is the graphic method for analysis of cardiac output regulation introduced in Chapter 20. In Compensation During the Next Few Days Further the rest of this chapter, we will use this graphic technique Increases
