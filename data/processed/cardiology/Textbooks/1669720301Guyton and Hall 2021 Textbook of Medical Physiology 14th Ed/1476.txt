and creatinine excretion is re- established. This response will occur when the plasma creatinine level increases to approxi- mately twice normal, as shown in Figure 28-2 1. 14 If GFR falls to one-f ourth normal, plasma creatinine level would increase to about four times normal, and a decrease 12 of GFR to one-e ighth normal would raise plasma creatinine level to eight times normal. Thus, under steady- state con- 10 ditions, creatinine excretion rate equals the rate of creati- nine production, despite reductions in GFR. H owever, this 8 normal rate of creatinine excretion occurs at the expense of an elevated plasma creatinine concentration, as shown 6 in Figure 28- 22.

In other words, the amount of the substance Glomerular filtration rate delivered to the kidneys in the blood (RPF × P) would be s (ml/min) equal to the amount excreted in the urine (U × V˙ ). Thus, s Figure 28- 22 Approximate relationship between glomerular
