These signals originate from large neuronal cell bodies that lie throughout the brain stem reticular area. Their ACTIVATING—DRIVING SYSTEMS nerve endings release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, OF THE BRAIN which serves as an excitatory agent that lasts for only a few milliseconds before it is destroyed.
