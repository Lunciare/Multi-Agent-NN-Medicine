Conversely, as follows: if a solute such as sodium chloride is removed from the 3liters =5liters extracellular fluid, water diffuses from the extracellular 1–0.4 fluid through the cell membranes and into the cells. Another way to measure blood volume is to inject red Osmolality and Osmolarity. The osmolal concentration blood cells that have been labeled with radioactive mate- of a solution is called osmolality when the concentration rial into the circulation. After these mix in the circulation, is expressed as osmoles per kilogram of water; it is called the radioactivity of a mixed blood sample can be mea- osmolarity when it is expressed as osmoles per liter of
