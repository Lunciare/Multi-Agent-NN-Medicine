Effects of Hypoxia on the Body. Hypoxia, if severe In hypoxia caused by anemia, abnormal hemoglobin transport of O , circulatory deficiency, or physiological enough, can cause death of cells throughout the body, 2 shunt, O therapy is of much less value because normal but in less severe degrees, it mainly causes (1) depressed 2 O is already available in the alveoli. Instead, the problem mental activity, sometimes culminating in coma, and (2) 2 is that one or more of the mechanisms for transporting reduced work capacity of the muscles.

Even so, specifically discussed in Chapter 44 in relation to high- a small amount of extra O , between 7% and 30%, can be altitude physiology. 2 transported in
