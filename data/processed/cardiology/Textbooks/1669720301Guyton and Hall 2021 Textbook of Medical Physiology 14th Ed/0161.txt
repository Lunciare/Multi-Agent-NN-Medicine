This membrane is formed from portions the copy is missing a small section of the DNA. With each of the endoplasmic reticulum that are already present in cell division, the copied DNA loses additional nucleotides the cytoplasm. Shortly thereafter, the cell pinches in two, from the telomere region. The nucleotide sequences pro- midway between the two nuclei. This pinching is caused vided by the telomeres therefore prevent the degradation by the formation of a contractile ring of microfilaments of genes near the ends of chromosomes.
