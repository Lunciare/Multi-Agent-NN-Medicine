CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW Vascular smooth Virchow-Robin muscle Pial artery Blood flow of the brain is supplied by four large arter- space Pia mater ies—two carotid and two vertebral arteries—that merge to form the circle of Willis at the base of the brain. The Penetrating arteries arising from the circle of Willis travel along the arteriole brain surface and give rise to pial arteries, which branch out into smaller vessels called penetrating arteries and arterioles (Figure 62- 1). The penetrating vessels are sepa- rated slightly from the brain tissue by an extension of the Foot processes subarachnoid space called the Virchow- Robin space. The penetrating vessels dive down into the brain tissue, giving Excitatory neuron rise to intracerebral arterioles, which eventually branch Glutamate into capillaries where exchange among the blood and the tissues of O , nutrients, carbon dioxide (CO ), and 2 2 metabolites occurs.
