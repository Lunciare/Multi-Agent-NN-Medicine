CLINICAL METHODS FOR MEASURING SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURES Proximal aorta It is not practical to use pressure recorders that require needle insertion into an artery for making routine arte- rial pressure measurements in human patients, although these types of recorders are used on occasion when spe- Femoral artery cial studies are necessary. Instead, the clinician deter- mines systolic and diastolic pressures through indirect Radial artery means, usually by the auscultatory method. Auscultatory Method. Figure 15-7 shows the ausculta- Arteriole tory method for determining systolic and diastolic arte- rial pressures. A stethoscope is placed over the antecu- Capillary bital artery, and a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the upper arm. As long as the cuff continues to compress the arm with too little pressure to close the brachial ar- 0 1 2 tery, no sounds are heard from the antecubital artery Time (seconds) with the stethoscope.
