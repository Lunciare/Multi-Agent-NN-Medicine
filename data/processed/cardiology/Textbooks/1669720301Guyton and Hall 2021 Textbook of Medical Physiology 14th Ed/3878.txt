which activates a second enzyme, which acti- Vasopressin (V receptor, epithelial cells) vates a third, and so forth. The importance of this mech- 2 cAMP, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate. anism is that only a few molecules of activated adenylyl cyclase immediately inside the cell membrane can cause many more molecules of the next enzyme to be activated, which can cause still more molecules of the third enzyme Extracellular Hormone to be activated, and so forth. In this way, even the slightest fluid amount of hormone acting on the cell surface can initiate a powerful cascading activating force for the entire cell. If binding of the hormone to its receptors is coupled to an inhibitory G protein (denoted G protein), adeny- i lyl cyclase will be inhibited, reducing formation of cAMP and ultimately leading to an inhibitory action in the cell. Cytoplasm γ Thus, depending on the coupling of the hormone recep- β tor to an inhibitory or a stimulatory G protein, a hormone α Adenylyl can either increase or decrease the concentration of GTP cyclase cAMP and phosphorylation of key proteins inside the cell. The specific action that occurs in response to increases or decreases of cAMP in each type of
