Another or to suppress it. possible explanation of short- term memory is presynaptic facilitation or inhibition, which occurs at synapses that lie Classification of Memories. We know that some on terminal nerve fibrils immediately before these fibrils memories last for only a few seconds, whereas others synapse with a subsequent neuron. The neurotransmitter last for hours, days, months, or years. For the purpose chemicals secreted at such terminals frequently cause facil- of discussing these types of memories, we can use a itation or inhibition lasting for seconds up to several min- common classification
