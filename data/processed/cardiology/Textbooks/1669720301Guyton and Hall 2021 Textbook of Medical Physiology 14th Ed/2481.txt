can be classified into three physiologi- same types of receptors as those for touch and pressure cal types: (1) the mechanoreceptive somatic senses, which are used. include both tactile and position sensations that are stim- ulated by mechanical displacement of some tissue of the Tactile Receptors. There are at least six entirely different body; (2) the thermoreceptive senses, which detect heat types of tactile receptors, but many more similar to these and cold; and (3) the pain sense, which is activated by fac- also exist. Some were shown in Figure 47- 1 (previous tors that damage the tissues. chapter); their special characteristics are as follows. This chapter deals with the mechanoreceptive tactile First, some free nerve endings, which are found every- and position senses. In Chapter 49, the thermoreceptive where in the skin and in many other tissues, can detect and pain senses are discussed. The tactile senses include touch and pressure. For example, even light contact with touch, pressure, vibration, and tickle senses, and the position the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of senses include static position and rate of movement senses. nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations.
