Each of the processes—glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion—is regulated accord- ing to the needs of the body. For example, when there is Bibliography excess sodium in the body, the rate at which sodium is See the bibliography for Chapters 27 to 32. filtered usually increases slightly, and a smaller fraction of 330 CHAPTER 2 7 Glomerular Filtration, Renal Blood Flow, and Their Control GLOMERULAR FILTRATION—THE FIRST STEP IN URINE FORMATION GFR is about 125 ml/min, or 180 L/day. The fraction of the renal plasma flow that is filtered (the filtration frac- The first step in urine formation is filtration of large tion) averages about 0.2, which means that about 20% of amounts of fluid through the glomerular capillaries into the plasma flowing through the kidney is filtered through Bowman’s capsule—almost 180 L/day. Most of this fil- the glomerular capillaries (Figure 27- 1).
