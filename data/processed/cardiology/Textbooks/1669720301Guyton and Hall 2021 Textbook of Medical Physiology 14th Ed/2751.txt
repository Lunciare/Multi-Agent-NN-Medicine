These fibers are stiff, elastic, reedlike structures that with such ease that the energy in the wave is dissipated. are fixed at their basal ends in the central bony structure Consequently, the wave dies at this point and fails to of the cochlea (the modiolus) but are not fixed at their travel the remaining distance along the basilar membrane. 665 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B.
