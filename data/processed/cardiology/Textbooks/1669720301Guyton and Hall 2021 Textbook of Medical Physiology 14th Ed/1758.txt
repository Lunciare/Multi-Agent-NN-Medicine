Sometimes, however, many of the increase its urine output sufficiently to maintain relatively glomeruli are destroyed beyond repair and, in a small normal levels of extracellular electrolytes and solutes, as percentage of patients, progressive renal deterioration well as normal extracellular fluid volume. With this type continues indefinitely, leading to CKD, as described in a of renal injury, normal kidney function can be restored if subsequent section of this chapter. the basic cause of the problem is corrected within a few Tubular Necrosis as a Cause of Acute hours.
