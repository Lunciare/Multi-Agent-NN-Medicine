highly secre- tory cell, the vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus are mainly secretory vesicles containing proteins that are se- creted through the surface of the cell membrane. These secretory vesicles first diffuse to the cell membrane and then fuse with it and empty their substances to the exte- rior by the mechanism called exocytosis. Exocytosis, in most cases, is stimulated by entry of calcium ions into the cell. Calcium ions interact with the vesicular mem- brane and cause its fusion with the cell membrane, fol- lowed by exocytosis—opening of the membrane’s outer surface and extrusion of its contents outside the cell. Some vesicles, however, are destined for intracellular Transport use.
