the endoplasmic matrix. Lipid Synthesis by the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticu- lum. The endoplasmic reticulum also synthesizes lipids, AUTOSOME especially phospholipids and cholesterol. These lipids are FORMATION rapidly incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the endoplas- mic reticulum, thus causing the endoplasmic reticulum to Autophagosome grow more extensive. This process occurs mainly in the smooth portion of the endoplasmic reticulum. To keep the endoplasmic reticulum from growing Lysosome beyond the needs of the cell, small vesicles called ER vesicles or transport vesicles continually break away from the smooth reticulum; most of these vesicles then migrate rapidly to the Golgi apparatus. Other Functions of the Endoplasmic Reticulum. Other significant functions of the endoplasmic reticu- DOCKING AND lum, especially the smooth reticulum, include the fol- FUSION WITH Autolysosome LYSOSOME lowing: 1. It provides the enzymes that control glycogen breakdown when glycogen is to be used for energy. Lysosomal 2. It provides a vast number of enzymes that are ca- hydrolase pable of detoxifying substances, such as drugs, that might damage the cell. It achieves detoxification by processes such as coagulation, oxidation, hydroly- sis, and conjugation with glycuronic acid.
