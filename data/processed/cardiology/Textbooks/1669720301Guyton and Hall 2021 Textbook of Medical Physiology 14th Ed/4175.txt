The erize rapidly to form collagen fibers; the resultant tissue relative ratio of calcium to phosphorus can vary markedly becomes osteoid, a cartilage- like material differing from under different nutritional conditions, with the calcium cartilage in that calcium salts readily precipitate in it. As to phosphorus ratio on a weight basis varying between the osteoid is formed, some of the osteoblasts become 1.3 and 2.0. entrapped in the osteoid and become quiescent. At this Magnesium, sodium, potassium, and carbonate ions stage, they are called osteocytes. are also present among the bone salts, although x- ray Within a few days after the osteoid is formed, calcium diffraction studies fail to show definite crystals formed salts begin to precipitate on the surfaces of the collagen by them. Therefore, they are believed to be conjugated fibers. The precipitates first appear at intervals along each to the hydroxyapatite crystals rather than organized into collagen fiber, forming minute
