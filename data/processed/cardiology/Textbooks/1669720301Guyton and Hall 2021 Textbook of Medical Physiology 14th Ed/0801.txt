but not quite enough, to make up for the decreased amount of oxygen in the blood, thus almost maintaining a relatively 3 constant supply of oxygen to the tissues. Total cyanide poisoning of oxygen usage by a local tis- sue area can cause local blood flow to increase as much as 2 sevenfold, thus demonstrating the extreme effect of oxy- gen deficiency to increase blood flow. The mechanisms whereby changes in tissue metabolism or oxygen avail- 1 ability alter tissue blood flow are not fully understood, but Normal level two main theories have been proposed, the vasodilator theory and the oxygen demand theory. 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Vasodilator Theory for Acute Local Blood Flow Rate of metabolism (× normal) Regulation—Possible Special Role of Adenosine.
