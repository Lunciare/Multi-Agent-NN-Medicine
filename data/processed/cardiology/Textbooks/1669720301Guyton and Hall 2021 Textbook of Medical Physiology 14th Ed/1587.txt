sodium diet decreases plasma aldos- pump. Thus, chronic acidosis leads to a loss of potassium, terone, which tends to decrease potassium secretion by the corti- whereas acute acidosis leads to decreased potassium cal collecting tubules. However, the high- sodium diet simultaneously excretion. increases fluid delivery to the cortical collecting duct, which tends to increase potassium secretion. The opposing effects of a high- sodium Beneficial Effects of Diet High in Potassium and Low diet counterbalance each other, so there is little change in potassium in Sodium Content excretion. GFR, Glomerular filtration rate. For most of human history, the typical diet has been one that thereby reducing the driving force for potassium is low in sodium and high in potassium content, compared diffusion across the luminal membrane. With in- with the typical modern diet. In isolated populations that have creased tubular flow rate, the secreted potassium is not experienced industrialization, such as the Yanomamo tribe living in the Amazon region of Northern Brazil, sodium continuously flushed down the tubule, minimizing intake may be as low as 10 to 20 mmol/day, and potassium the rise in tubular potassium concentration and in- intake may be as high as 200 mmol/day. This intake is due
