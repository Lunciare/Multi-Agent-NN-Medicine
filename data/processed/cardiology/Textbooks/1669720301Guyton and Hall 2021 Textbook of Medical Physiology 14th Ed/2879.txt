muscle areas as mapped by Penfield and Rasmussen. This almost a direct pathway to the anterior motor neurons of mapping was done by electrically stimulating the different the cord, bypassing some motor centers on the way. This areas of the motor cortex in human beings were undergo- is especially true for control of the fine dexterous move- ing neurosurgery. Note that more than half of the entire ments of the fingers and hands. This chapter and Chapter primary motor cortex is concerned with controlling the 57 explain the interplay among the different motor areas muscles of the hands and the muscles of speech. Point of the brain and spinal cord to provide overall synthesis of stimulation in these hand and speech motor areas on voluntary motor function. rare occasion causes contraction of a single muscle, but most often, stimulation contracts a group of muscles. To MOTOR CORTEX AND express this in another way, excitation of a single motor CORTICOSPINAL TRACT cortex neuron usually excites a specific movement rather than one specific muscle. To do this, it excites a “pattern” Figure 56- 1 shows the functional areas of the cerebral of separate muscles, each of which contributes its own cortex. Anterior
