Therefore, the nerve fiber becomes highly POTENTIAL excitable, sometimes discharging repetitively without prov- ocation, rather than remaining in the resting state. In fact, In the preceding paragraphs, we discussed the action the calcium ion concentration needs to fall only 50% be- potential as though it occurs at one spot on the mem- low normal before spontaneous discharge occurs in some brane. However, an action potential elicited at any one peripheral nerves, often causing muscle “tetany.” Muscle point on an excitable membrane usually excites adjacent tetany is sometimes lethal because of tetanic contraction of portions of the membrane, resulting in propagation of the the respiratory muscles. action potential along the membrane. This mechanism is The probable way in which calcium ions affect the so- demonstrated in Figure 5- 11. dium channels is as follows. These ions appear to bind to Figure 5- 11A shows a normal resting nerve fiber, and the exterior surfaces of the sodium channel protein. The positive charges of these calcium ions, in turn, alter the Figure 5- 11B shows a nerve fiber that has been excited
