transport. Stimulation of pepsinogen secretion by the peptic cells in Another characteristic of this mucus is that it is alka- the oxyntic glands occurs in response to two main types line. Therefore, the normal underlying stomach wall is not of signals: (1) acetylcholine released from the vagus nerves directly exposed to the highly acidic, proteolytic stomach or from the gastric enteric nervous plexus, and (2) acid secretion. Even the slightest contact with food or any in the stomach. The acid probably does not stimulate the irritation of the mucosa directly stimulates the surface peptic cells directly but instead elicits additional enteric mucous cells to secrete additional quantities of this thick, nervous reflexes that support the original nervous signals alkaline, viscid mucus. to the peptic cells. Therefore, the rate of secretion of pep- sinogen, the precursor of the enzyme pepsin that causes STIMULATION OF GASTRIC ACID protein digestion, is strongly influenced by the amount of SECRETION acid in the stomach. In people who have lost the ability to secrete normal amounts of acid, secretion of pepsinogen Parietal Cells of the Oxyntic Glands Are the Only is also decreased, even though the peptic cells may other- Cells That Secrete Hydrochloric Acid.
