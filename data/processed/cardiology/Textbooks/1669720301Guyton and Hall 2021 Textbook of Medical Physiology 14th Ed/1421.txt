the concentration of the substance in the tubular fluid is the same as the concentration in the plasma. Values below 1.0 indicate that the substance is reabsorbed more avidly than water, whereas values above 1.0 indicate that the substance is reab- sorbed to a lesser extent than water or is secreted into the tubules. Figure 28- 8 Cellular ultrastructure and transport characteristics of the thin descending loop of Henle (top) and thick ascending segment of the loop of Henle (bottom). The descending part of the thin seg- ment of the loop of Henle is highly permeable to water and moder- Secretion of Organic Acids and Bases by Proximal Tu- ately permeable to most solutes but has few mitochondria and little bules. The proximal tubule is also an important site for or no active reabsorption.
