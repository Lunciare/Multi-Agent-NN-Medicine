of TSH in the plasma is measured by of both thyroxine and triiodothyronine. As a result, no hor- immunoassay. In the usual type of thyrotoxicosis, an- mone is available to inhibit production of TSH by the an- terior pituitary secretion of TSH is so completely sup- terior pituitary, which causes the pituitary to secrete exces- 951 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction sively large quantities of TSH. The TSH then stimulates the thyroid cells to secrete large amounts of thyroglobulin col- loid into the follicles, and the gland grows larger and larger. However, because of lack of iodine, thyroxine and triiodo- thyronine production does not occur in the thyroglobulin molecule and therefore does not cause the normal suppres- sion of TSH production by the anterior pituitary. The fol- licles greatly enlarge, and the thyroid gland may increase to 10 to 20 times its normal size. Idiopathic Nontoxic Colloid Goiter. Enlarged thyroid glands similar to those of endemic colloid goiter can also occur in people who do not have iodine deficiency. These goitrous glands may secrete normal quantities of thyroid hormones, but more frequently, the secretion of hormone is depressed, as in endemic colloid goiter. The exact cause of the
