and are each only 3 to 5 micrometers (μm) in diameter, in impulses to initiate rhythmical contraction of the heart contrast to a diameter of 10 to 15 μm for the surround- muscle; and (2) conducts these impulses rapidly through ing atrial muscle fibers. However, the sinus nodal fibers the heart. When this system functions normally, the atria connect directly with the atrial muscle fibers, so that any contract about one-sixth of a second ahead of ventricular action potential that begins in the sinus node spreads contraction, which allows filling of the ventricles before immediately into the atrial muscle wall. they pump blood through the lungs and peripheral circu- lation. Another especially important feature of the system AUTOMATIC ELECTRICAL RHYTHMICITY is that it allows all portions of the ventricles to contract OF THE SINUS FIBERS almost simultaneously, which is essential for the most effective pressure generation in the ventricular chambers. Some cardiac fibers have the capability of self- excitation, This rhythmical and conductive system of the heart a process that can cause automatic rhythmical discharge is susceptible to damage by heart disease, especially by and contraction. This capability is especially true of the ischemia resulting from inadequate coronary blood flow.
