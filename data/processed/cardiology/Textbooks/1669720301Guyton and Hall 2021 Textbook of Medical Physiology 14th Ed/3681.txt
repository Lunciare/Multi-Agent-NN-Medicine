However, processes that control eating behavior and the perception of POMC neurons and MCR-4 are also found in brainstem satiety. These hypothalamic nuclei also influence secretion neurons, including the NTS, where they also regulate of several hormones that are important in regulating energy food intake and energy expenditure. balance and metabolism, including those from the thyroid and adrenal glands, as well as the pancreatic islet cells. The hypothalamus receives (1) neural signals from the gastrointestinal tract that provide sensory information about stomach filling; (2) chemical signals from nutrients in the blood (glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids) that Hypothalamus signify satiety; (3) signals from gastrointestinal hormones; (4) signals from hormones released by adipose tissue; and (5) signals from the cerebral cortex (sight, smell, and taste) that influence feeding behavior. Some of these inputs to the hypothalamus are shown in Figure 72- 1. The hypothalamic feeding and satiety centers have a high density of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones
