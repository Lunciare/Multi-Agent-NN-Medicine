kidney excretes dilute or Normal kidneys have a tremendous capability to vary concentrated urine. the relative proportions of solutes and water in the urine in response to various challenges. When there is excess RENAL MECHANISMS FOR EXCRETING water in the body, and body fluid osmolarity is reduced, DILUTE URINE the kidneys can excrete urine with an osmolarity as low as 50 mOsm/L, a concentration that is only about one-sixth When there is a large excess of water in the body, the the osmolarity of normal extracellular fluid. Conversely, kidney can excrete as much as 20 L/day of dilute urine, when there is a deficit of water in the body, and extra- with a concentration as low as 50 mOsm/L. The kidney cellular fluid osmolarity is high, the kidneys can excrete performs this impressive feat by continuing to reabsorb highly concentrated urine with an osmolarity of 1200 solutes without reabsorbing large amounts of water in the to 1400 mOsm/L. Equally important, the kidneys can distal parts of the nephron, including the late distal tubule excrete a large volume of dilute urine or a small volume and collecting ducts. 365 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys Drink 1.0 L
