Leukocytes, Granulocytes, the Monocyte- Macrophage System, and Inflammation Our bodies are exposed continually to bacteria, viruses, eosinophils (polymorphonuclear), basophils (polymorpho- fungi, and parasites, all of which occur normally and to nuclear), monocytes, lymphocytes and, occasionally, plasma varying degrees in the skin, mouth, respiratory passage- cells. In addition, there are large numbers of platelets, which ways, intestinal tract, lining membranes of the eyes, and are fragments of another type of cell similar to the WBCs even the urinary tract. Many of these infectious agents found in the bone marrow, the megakaryocyte. The first three are capable of causing serious abnormal physiological types of cells, the polymorphonuclear cells, all have a granu- function or even death if they invade deeper tissues.
