so extra force is achieved mainly by contraction of the abdominal See Video 38-1. The lung is an elastic structure that col- muscles, which pushes the abdominal contents upward lapses like a balloon and expels all its air through the tra- against the bottom of the diaphragm, thereby compress- chea whenever there is no force to keep it inflated. Also, ing the lungs. there are no attachments between the lung and walls of The second method for expanding the lungs is to the chest cage, except where it is suspended at its hilum raise the rib cage. Raising the rib cage expands the lungs from the mediastinum, the middle section of the chest because, in the natural resting position, the ribs slant cavity. Instead, the lung “floats” in the thoracic cavity, downward, as shown on the left side of Figure 38- 1, thus surrounded by a thin layer of pleural fluid that lubricates 491 UNIT VII UNIT VII Respiration EXPIRATION INSPIRATION Increased vertical diameter Elevated Increased rib cage AP diameter External intercostals contracted Internal Diaphragmatic intercostals contraction relaxed Figure 38- 1 Contraction and expan- sion of the thoracic cage during expi- Abdominals ration and inspiration, demonstrating contracted diaphragmatic contraction, function
