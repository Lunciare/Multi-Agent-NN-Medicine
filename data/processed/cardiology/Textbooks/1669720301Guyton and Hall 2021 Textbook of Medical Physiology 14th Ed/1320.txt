Coursing through the pelvic nerves are both sensory nerve Most important are the skeletal motor fibers transmit- fibers and motor nerve fibers. The sensory fibers detect the ted through the pudendal nerve to the external blad- degree of stretch in the bladder wall. Stretch signals from der sphincter. These fibers are somatic nerve fibers that the posterior urethra are especially strong and are mainly innervate and control the voluntary skeletal muscle of the 326 Chapter 26 The Urinary System: Functional Anatomy and Urine Formation by the Kidneys sphincter. Also, the bladder receives sympathetic innerva- tion from the sympathetic chain through the hypogastric nerves, connecting mainly with the L2 segment of the spi- 40 nal cord. These sympathetic fibers stimulate mainly the Micturition blood vessels and have little to do with bladder contrac- contractions tion. Some sensory nerve fibers also pass via the sympa- 30 thetic nerves and may be important in the sensation of fullness and,
