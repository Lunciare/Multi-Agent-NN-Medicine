nervous system is activated mainly by cen- and pass through a white ramus into one of the ganglia of the ters located in the spinal cord, brain stem, and hypothala- sympathetic chain. The fibers then can take one of the fol- mus. In addition, portions of the cerebral cortex, especially lowing three courses: (1) they can synapse with postgangli- of the limbic cortex, can transmit signals to the lower cen- onic sympathetic neurons in the ganglion that they enter; (2) ters and in this way can influence autonomic control. they can pass upward or downward in the chain and synapse in one of the other ganglia of the chain; or (3) they can pass The autonomic nervous system also often operates for variable distances through the chain and then through through visceral reflexes. That is, subconscious sensory one of the sympathetic nerves radiating outward from the signals from visceral organs can enter the autonomic gan- chain, finally synapsing in a peripheral sympathetic ganglion. glia, the brain stem, or the hypothalamus and then return The postganglionic sympathetic neuron thus originates subconscious reflex responses directly back to the visceral either in one of the sympathetic chain ganglia or in one of organs
