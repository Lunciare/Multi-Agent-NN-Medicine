the rods and cones in Figures detailed vision. The central fovea, only 0.3 millimeter in di- 51- 3 and 51- 4, note the large numbers of discs. Each disc ameter, is composed almost entirely of cones. These cones is actually an infolded shelf of cell membrane. There are as have a special structure that aids their detection of detail in many as 1000 discs in each rod or cone. the visual image—that is, the foveal cones have especially Both rhodopsin and the color pigments are conjugated long and slender bodies, in contradistinction to the much proteins. They are incorporated into the membranes of fatter cones located more peripherally in the retina. Also, the discs in the form of transmembrane proteins. The in the foveal region, the blood vessels, ganglion cells, inner concentrations of these photosensitive pigments in the nuclear layer of cells, and plexiform layers are all displaced discs are so great that the pigments themselves constitute to one side rather than resting directly on top of the cones, about 40% of the entire mass of the outer segment. which allows light to pass unimpeded to the cones. The inner segment of the rod or cone contains the usual cytoplasm,
