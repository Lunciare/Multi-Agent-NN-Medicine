Neurological problems, such as trauma to the para- sympathetic nerves from prostate surgery, deficient levels of testosterone, and some drugs (e.g., nicotine, alcohol, and antidepressants) can also contribute to erectile dysfunction. In men older than 40 years, erectile dysfunction is most often caused by underlying vascular disease. As discussed previously, adequate blood flow and nitric oxide formation are essential for penile erection. Vascular disease, which can occur as a result of uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, reduces the ability of the body’s blood vessels, including those in the penis, to dilate. Part of this impaired vasodilation is due to decreased release of nitric oxide. Erectile dysfunction caused by vascular disease can of- ten be successfully treated with phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE- 5) inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis). These drugs increase cyclic GMP levels in the erectile tissue by inhibiting
