circuits: (1) lated. Thus, a pain stimulus on the inward side of the diverging circuits to spread the reflex to the necessary arm elicits not only contraction of the flexor muscles muscles for withdrawal; (2) circuits to inhibit the antago- of the arm but also contraction of abductor muscles to nist muscles, called reciprocal inhibition circuits; and (3) pull the arm outward.
