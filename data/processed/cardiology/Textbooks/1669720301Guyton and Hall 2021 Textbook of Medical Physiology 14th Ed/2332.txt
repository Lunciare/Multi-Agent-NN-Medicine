To keep the lungs from collapsing, air must be About four-fifths of the air is nitrogen. At sea level pressure, supplied at very high pressure to keep them inflated. This the nitrogen has no significant effect on bodily function, but maneuver exposes the blood in the lungs to extremely at high pressures, it can cause varying degrees of narcosis. high alveolar gas pressures, a condition called hyperba- When the diver remains beneath the sea for 1 hour
