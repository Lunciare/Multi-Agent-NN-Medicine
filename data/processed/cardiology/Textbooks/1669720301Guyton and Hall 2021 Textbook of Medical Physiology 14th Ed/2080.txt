arterial tree a large compliance, averaging Hg, values that are only one-fifth those for the left ventricle. almost 7 ml/mm Hg, which is similar to that of the entire systemic arterial tree. This large compliance allows the Pressures in the Pulmonary Artery. During systole, pulmonary arteries to accommodate the stroke volume the pressure in the pulmonary artery is essentially equal output of the right ventricle. to the pressure in the right ventricle, as also shown in 503 UNIT VII UNIT VII Respiration Aortic pressure curve the right atrium, then through the right side of the heart 120 and through the pulmonary artery into one of the small branches of the pulmonary artery, and finally pushing the catheter until it wedges tightly in the small branch. The pressure measured through the catheter, called the 75 “wedge pressure,” is about 5 mm Hg. Because all blood flow has been stopped in the small wedged artery, and because the blood vessels extending beyond this artery make a Right ventricular curve direct connection with the pulmonary capillaries, this Pulmonary artery curve wedge pressure is usually only 2 to 3 mm Hg higher than 25 the left atrial pressure. When the left atrial pressure rises
