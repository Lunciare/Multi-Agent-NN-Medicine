gradient is established, and the lar fluid osmolarity quickly becomes equal to the renal interstitial fluid osmolarity rises to 500 mOsm/L (step 5). medullary osmolarity. Therefore, water diffuses out of Then, once again, fluid in the descending limb reaches the descending limb of Henle’s loop into the interstitium, equilibrium with the hyperosmotic medullary interstitial and the tubular fluid osmolarity gradually rises as it flows fluid (step 6) and, as the hyperosmotic tubular fluid from toward the tip of the loop of Henle. the descending limb of the loop of Henle flows into the ascending limb, still more solute is continuously pumped Steps Involved in Causing Hyperosmotic Renal Medul- out of the tubules and deposited into the medullary lary Interstitium. Keeping in mind these characteristics of interstitium. the loop of Henle, let us now discuss how the renal medulla These steps are repeated over and over, with the net becomes hyperosmotic (Video 29-1). First, assume that the effect of adding more and more solute to the medulla in loop of Henle is filled with fluid having a concentration of excess of water. With sufficient time, this process gradu- 300 mOsm/L, the same as that leaving the proximal tu- ally traps solutes
