vessel (center) that pumps fluid from the then carried away through the pulmonary lymphatics. Thus, pulmonary interstitial spaces. under normal conditions, the alveoli are kept “dry,” except for a small amount of fluid that seeps from the epithelium ous tissue. (This pressure has been measured in onto the lining surfaces of the alveoli to keep them moist. two ways—by a micropipette inserted into the pulmonary interstitium, giving a value of about −5 Pulmonary Edema mm Hg, and by measuring the absorption pressure of fluid from the alveoli, giving a value of about −8 Pulmonary edema occurs in the same way that edema mm Hg.) occurs elsewhere in the body. Any factor that increases 3. The colloid osmotic pressure of the pulmonary inter- fluid filtration out of the pulmonary capillaries or that stitial fluid is about 14 mm Hg, in comparison with impedes pulmonary lymphatic function and causes the less than half this value in most peripheral tissues. pulmonary interstitial fluid pressure to rise from the negative range into the positive range will tend to cause 4. The alveolar walls are extremely thin, and the alveo- filling of the pulmonary interstitial spaces and alveoli lar epithelium covering the alveolar surfaces is
