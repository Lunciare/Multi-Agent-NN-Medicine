gra- + – (–90 mV) – + dients for sodium and potassium across the resting nerve + – – + (Anions)– + – (Anions)– – + membrane. These gradients are as follows: C Na+(outside):142mEq/L Figure 5- 5 Establishment of resting membrane potentials under three conditions. A, When the membrane potential is caused entirely by potassium diffusion alone. B, When the membrane potential is Na+(inside):14mEq/L caused by diffusion of both sodium and potassium ions. C, When the membrane potential is caused by diffusion of both sodium and potassium ions plus pumping of both these ions by the Na+- K+ pump. K+(outside):4mEq/L K+(inside):140mEq/L channels may also leak sodium ions slightly but are far more permeable to potassium than to sodium, normally The ratios of these two respective ions from the inside about 100 times as permeable. As discussed later, this dif- to the outside are as follows: ferential in permeability is a key factor in determining the level of the normal resting membrane potential. Na+ /Na+ =0.1 inside outside Origin of the Normal Resting Membrane Potential K+ /K+ =35.0 inside outside Figure 5- 5 shows the important factors in the establish- ment of the normal resting membrane potential. They are Leakage of
