The lower panel displays the abrupt changes in membrane valence of the ion (cation or anion) can be used to predict potential that occur at the membranes on the two sides of the fiber. the direction of ion flow across the membrane, into or out of the cell. For cations such as Na+ and K+, a positive V df is zero, which is the potential of the extracellular fluid. predicts ion movement out of the cell down its electro- Then, as the recording electrode passes through the volt- chemical gradient, and a negative V predicts ion move- df ment into the cell.
