of the posterior hypothalamus Increased Thyroxine Output as a Long-T erm Cause near the wall of the third ventricle is an area called the of Increased Heat Production. Cooling the anterior primary motor center for shivering. This area is normally hypothalamic- preoptic area also increases production inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior of the neurosecretory hormone thyrotropin- releasing hypothalamic- preoptic area but is excited by cold signals hormone by the hypothalamus. This hormone is carried from the skin and spinal cord. Therefore, as shown by the by way of the hypothalamic portal veins to the anterior sudden increase in “heat production” (see the red curve pituitary gland, where it stimulates secretion of thyroid- in Figure 74- 7), this center becomes activated when the stimulating hormone. body temperature falls even a fraction of a degree below Thyroid- stimulating hormone in turn stimulates a critical temperature level. It then transmits signals that increased output of thyroxine by the thyroid gland, as cause shivering through bilateral tracts down the brain explained in Chapter 77. The increased thyroxine acti- stem, into the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and fi- vates uncoupling protein and increases the rate of cellular nally
