bond to form between enzyme, RNA polymerase. This activation occurs by add- the end base of the DNA strand and the base of ing two extra phosphate radicals to each nucleotide to form an RNA nucleotide in the nucleoplasm. 34 Chapter 3 Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis, Cell Function, and Cell Reproduction b. Then, one at a time, the RNA polymerase breaks structures on which protein molecules are actually two of the three phosphate radicals away from each assembled. of these RNA nucleotides, liberating large amounts 6. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single- stranded RNA of energy from the broken high-e nergy phosphate molecules of 21 to 23 nucleotides that can regulate bonds. This energy is used to cause covalent linkage gene transcription and translation. of the remaining phosphate on the nucleotide with MESSENGER RNA—THE CODONS the ribose on the end of the growing RNA chain. c. When the RNA polymerase reaches the end of Messenger RNA molecules are long single RNA strands the DNA gene, it encounters a new sequence of that are suspended in the cytoplasm. These molecules are DNA nucleotides called the chain- terminating composed of several hundred to several thousand RNA sequence, which causes the polymerase and the
