Prothrombin is a plasma has the automatic capability to polymerize with other fi- protein, an α - globulin, having a molecular weight of 2 brin monomer molecules to form fibrin fibers. Therefore, 68,700. It is present in normal plasma in a concentration many fibrin monomer molecules polymerize within sec- of about 15 mg/dl. It is an unstable protein that can split onds into long fibrin fibers that constitute the reticulum of easily into smaller compounds, one of which is thrombin, the blood clot. which has a molecular weight of 33,700, almost half that In the early stages of polymerization, the fibrin mono- of prothrombin. mer molecules are held together by weak noncovalent Prothrombin is formed continually by the liver, and it hydrogen bonding, and the newly forming fibers are not is continually being used throughout the body for blood cross- linked with one another. Therefore, the resultant clotting. If the liver fails to produce prothrombin, in a day clot is weak and can be broken apart with ease. However, or so prothrombin concentration in the plasma falls too another process
