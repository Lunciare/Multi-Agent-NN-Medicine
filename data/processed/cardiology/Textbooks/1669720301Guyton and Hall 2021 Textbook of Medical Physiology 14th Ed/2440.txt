This is about the same maximum voltage recorded in action potentials and is also the change in voltage when the membrane becomes potential of the receptor. This change in potential is called maximally permeable to sodium ions. a receptor potential. Relation of the Receptor Potential to Action Po- Mechanisms of Receptor Potentials.
