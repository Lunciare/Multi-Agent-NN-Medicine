Fall in body temperature of the neonate immediately is not complete until the end of about the first month of life. after birth, and instability of body temperature during the first few For example, the kidneys of the neonate can concentrate days of life. urine to only 1.5 times the osmolality of the plasma, whereas the adult can concentrate the urine to three to four times the of the ingested amino acids is used for formation of body plasma osmolarity. Therefore, considering the immaturity of proteins, which is a much higher percentage than in adults. the kidneys, together with the marked fluid turnover in the Increased Metabolic Rate and Poor Body Temperature infant and the rapid formation of acid, one can readily under- Regulation. The normal metabolic rate of the neonate in stand that among the most important problems of infancy are relation to body weight is about twice that of the adult, acidosis, dehydration, and, more rarely, overhydration. which also accounts for the fact that cardiac output and Liver Function minute respiratory volume are twice as great in relation to body weight in the
