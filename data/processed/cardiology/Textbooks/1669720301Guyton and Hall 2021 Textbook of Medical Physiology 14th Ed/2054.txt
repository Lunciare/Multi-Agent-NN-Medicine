exchange areas but simply fills respiratory passages, such can be determined by adding the inspiratory capacity (IC) as the nose, pharynx, and trachea, where gas exchange to the FRC. That is: does not occur. This air is called dead space air because it is not useful for gas exchange. RV=FRC−ERV On expiration, the air in the dead space is expired first, and before any of the air from the alveoli reaches the atmo- TLC = FRC + IC sphere. Therefore, the dead space is very disadvantageous for removing the expiratory gases from the lungs. MINUTE RESPIRATORY VOLUME EQUALS Measurement of Dead Space Volume. A simple method RESPIRATORY RATE TIMES TIDAL for measuring dead space volume is demonstrated by the VOLUME graph in Figure 38- 7. In making this measurement, the sub- ject suddenly takes a deep breath of 100% O, which fills the 2 The minute respiratory volume is the total amount of entire dead space with pure O. Some oxygen also mixes with 2 new air moved into the respiratory passages each min- the alveolar air but does not completely replace this air. Then ute and is equal to the tidal volume times the respiratory the person expires through
