Like- (cid:29) (cid:30) wise, receptors located in or near the joints help detect (cid:31) the rates of movement of the different parts of the body. Sensory nerve classification For example, when a person is running, information from I II III IV the joint rate receptors allows the nervous system to pre- Ia dict where the feet will be during any precise fraction of Ib the next second. Therefore, appropriate motor signals Sensory functions can be transmitted to the muscles of the legs to make any Muscle spindle Muscle spindle (primary ending) (secondary ending) necessary anticipatory corrections in position so that the Muscle tendon person will not fall.
