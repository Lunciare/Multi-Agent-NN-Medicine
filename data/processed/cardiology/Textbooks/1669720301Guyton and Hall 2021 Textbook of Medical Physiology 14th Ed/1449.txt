reabsorption. The colloid (2) hydrostatic pressure in the renal interstitium (P ) out- osmotic pressure of peritubular capillaries is determined if side the capillaries, which favors reabsorption; (3) col- by the following: (1) the systemic plasma colloid osmotic loid osmotic pressure of the peritubular capillary plasma pressure (increasing the plasma protein concentration of proteins (π ), which favors reabsorption; and (4) colloid systemic blood tends to raise peritubular capillary colloid c osmotic pressure of the proteins in the renal interstitium osmotic pressure, thereby increasing reabsorption); and (π ), which opposes reabsorption. (2) the filtration fraction—the higher the filtration frac- if Figure 28- 16 shows the approximate normal forces that tion, the greater the fraction of plasma filtered through the favor and oppose peritubular reabsorption. Because the glomerulus and, consequently, the more concentrated the normal peritubular capillary pressure averages about 13 protein becomes in the plasma that remains behind. Thus, mm Hg and the renal interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure increasing the filtration fraction also tends to increase the averages 6 mm Hg, there is a positive hydrostatic pressure peritubular capillary reabsorption rate. Because filtration gradient from the peritubular capillary to the interstitial fraction is defined as the ratio of GFR/RPF, an
