gastric glands) and pyloric glands. The oxyntic (acid- forming) glands secrete hydrochloric acid, pepsino- gen, intrinsic factor, and mucus. The pyloric glands secrete Peptic (chief) mainly mucus for protection of the pyloric mucosa from cells the stomach acid. They also secrete the hormone gastrin. The oxyntic glands are located on the inside surfaces of the body and fundus of the stomach—the proximal 80% of the stomach. The pyloric glands are located in the antral portion of the stomach—the distal 20% of the stomach. Figure 65- 4. Gastric (oxyntic) gland from the body of the stomach. ECL, Enterochromaffin- like cells. Secretions From the Gastric (Oxyntic) Glands A typical stomach oxyntic gland is shown in Figure 65- 4. It is composed of three main types of cells: (1) mucous Mucous neck cells, which secrete mainly mucus; (2) peptic (or chief) neck cells cells, which secrete large quantities of pepsinogen; and (3) parietal (or oxyntic) cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor. Oxyntic glands also contain some additional cells types, including the enterochromaffin- like (ECL) cells that secrete histamine. Oxyntic Secretion of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells (parietal) Secretion cell involves special mechanisms, as follows. Basic Mechanism of Hydrochloric Acid Secretion.
