cause shifts of fluid between mOsm/L. For practical reasons, the osmotic coefficients of these two compartments. different solutes are sometimes neglected in determining the osmolarity and osmotic pressures of physiologic solutions. BASIC PRINCIPLES OF OSMOSIS AND OSMOTIC PRESSURE Osmolarity of Body Fluids. Referring back to Table 25- 2, note the approximate osmolarity of the various osmoti- The basic principles of osmosis and osmotic pressure cally active substances in plasma, interstitial fluid, and were presented in Chapter 4. Therefore, we review here intracellular fluid. About 80% of the total osmolarity of only the most important aspects of these principles as the interstitial fluid and plasma is due to sodium and chlo- they apply to volume regulation. ride ions, whereas for intracellular fluid, almost half the Because cell membranes are relatively impermeable to osmolarity is due to potassium ions, and the remainder is most solutes but are highly permeable to water (i.e., they divided among many other intracellular substances. are selectively permeable), whenever there is a higher As shown in Table 25- 2, the total osmolarity of each concentration of solute on one side of the cell membrane, of the three compartments is about 300 mOsm/L, with water diffuses across the membrane
