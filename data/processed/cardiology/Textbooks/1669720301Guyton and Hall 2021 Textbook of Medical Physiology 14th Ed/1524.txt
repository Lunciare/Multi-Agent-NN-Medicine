counter- loop tubular fluid osmolarity also becomes less concen- current mechanism. In the presence of large amounts of trated. This decrease in concentration is due partly to the ADH, these ducts are highly permeable to water, and wa- fact that less urea is absorbed into the medullary intersti- ter diffuses from the tubule into the interstitial fluid un- tium from the collecting ducts when ADH levels are low, til osmotic equilibrium is reached, with the tubular fluid and the kidney is forming a large volume of dilute urine. having about the same concentration as the renal med- ullary interstitium (1200–1400 mOsm/L). Thus, a small Thin Ascending Loop of Henle. The thin ascending volume of concentrated urine is produced when ADH limb is essentially impermeable to water but reabsorbs levels are high. Because water reabsorption increases urea some sodium chloride. Because of the high concentration concentration in the tubular fluid, and because the inner of sodium chloride in the tubular fluid as a result of wa- medullary collecting ducts have specific urea transporters ter removal from the descending loop of Henle, there is that greatly facilitate diffusion, much of the highly con- some passive diffusion of sodium chloride from the thin
