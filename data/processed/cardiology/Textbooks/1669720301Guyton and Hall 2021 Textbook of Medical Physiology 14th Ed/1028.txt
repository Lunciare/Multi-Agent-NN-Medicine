the blood flow rises rapidly to a peak during systole and then, right side of the heart, then through the blood vessels of at the end of systole, it reverses for a fraction of a second. the lungs, through the left side of the heart, and finally into This reverse flow causes the aortic valve to close and the the systemic arterial system. The concentration of the dye flow to return to zero. is recorded as the dye passes through one of the periph- eral arteries, giving a curve as shown in Figure 20- 20. In Measurement of Cardiac Output Using each of these cases, 5 milligrams of Cardiogreen dye were the Oxygen Fick Principle injected at zero time. In the top recording, none of the dye The Fick principle is explained by Figure 20- 19. This passed into the arterial tree until about 3 seconds after the figure shows that 200 ml of oxygen are being absorbed injection, but then the arterial concentration of the dye from the lungs into the pulmonary blood each minute. It also shows that the blood entering the right heart has an LUNGS 20 Oxygen used = 200 ml/min 15 10 5 0 Cardiac
