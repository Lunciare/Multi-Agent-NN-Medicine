the body. Excess energy intake is carbon dioxide by the lungs divided by the uptake of oxygen stored mainly as fat, whereas a deficit of energy intake during the same period is called the respiratory exchange causes loss of total body mass until energy expenditure ratio. During a period of 1 hour or more, the respiratory ex- eventually equals energy intake or death occurs. change ratio exactly equals the average respiratory quotient Although there is considerable variability in the amount of the metabolic reactions throughout the body. If a person of energy storage (i.e., fat mass) in different individuals, has a respiratory quotient of 1.0, he or she is metabolizing maintenance of an adequate energy supply is necessary for carbohydrates almost exclusively, because the respiratory survival. Therefore, the body is endowed with powerful quotients for both fat and protein metabolism are consider- ably less than 1.0. Likewise, when the respiratory quotient physiological control systems that help maintain adequate is about 0.70, the body is metabolizing mostly fats, to the energy intake. Deficits of energy stores, for example, rap- exclusion of carbohydrates and proteins. And, finally, if we idly activate multiple mechanisms that cause hunger and ignore the normally small amount
