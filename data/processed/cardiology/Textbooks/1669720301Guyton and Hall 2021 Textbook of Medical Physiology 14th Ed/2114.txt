gases are designated the same as the par- ber and a low concentration at the other end, as shown in tial pressures in the gas state—that is, Po 2, Pco 2, Pn 2, Phe, Figure 40- 1, net diffusion of the gas will occur from the high- and so forth. concentration area toward the low-c oncentration area. The Factors That Determine Partial Pressure of a Gas reason is obvious. There are far more molecules at end A of the Dissolved in a Fluid. The partial pressure of a gas in a so- chamber to diffuse toward end B than there are molecules to lution is determined not only by its concentration but also diffuse in the opposite direction. Therefore, the rates of diffu- by the solubility coefficient of the gas. That is, some types sion in each of the two directions are proportionately different, of molecules, especially CO 2, are physically or chemically as demonstrated by the lengths of the arrows in the figure. attracted to water molecules, whereas other types of mol- ecules are repelled. When molecules are attracted, far more Gas Pressures in a Mixture of Gases—Partial Pressures of of them can be dissolved without building up excess
