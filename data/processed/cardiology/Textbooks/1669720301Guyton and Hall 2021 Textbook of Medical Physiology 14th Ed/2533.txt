However, these areas. a person who has lost the pain sense—for example, after a spinal cord injury—fails to feel the pain and, therefore, fails Mechanical, Thermal, and Chemical Stimuli Excite to shift. This situation soon results in total breakdown and Pain Receptors. Pain can be elicited by multiple types desquamation of the skin at the areas of pressure. of stimuli, classified as mechanical, thermal, and chemical pain stimuli. In general, fast pain is elicited by the me- FAST PAIN AND SLOW PAIN AND THEIR chanical and thermal types of stimuli, whereas slow pain QUALITIES can be elicited by all three types. Some of the chemicals that excite the chemical type of Pain has been classified into two major types, fast pain pain are bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, potassium ions, and slow pain. Fast pain is felt within about 0.1 second acids, acetylcholine, and proteolytic enzymes. In
