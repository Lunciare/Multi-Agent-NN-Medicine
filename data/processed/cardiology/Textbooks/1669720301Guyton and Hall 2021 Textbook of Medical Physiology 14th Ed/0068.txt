organism, and specialized functions began to develop Instead, it is simply an accumulation of large amounts of in different parts of the virus. A membrane formed 20 Chapter 2 The Cell and Its Functions around the virus and, inside the membrane, a fluid matrix Proteins Receptors appeared. Specialized chemicals then developed inside Coated pit Clathrin the fluid to perform special functions; many protein enzymes appeared that were capable of catalyzing chemi- cal reactions, thus determining the organism’s activities. In still later stages of life, particularly in the rickett- sial and bacterial stages, organelles developed inside the A B organism. These represent physical structures of chemi- cal aggregates that perform functions in a more efficient Actin and myosin Dissolving clathrin manner than what can be achieved by dispersed chemi- cals throughout the fluid matrix. Finally, in the nucleated cell, still more complex organ- elles developed, the most important of which is the nucleus. The nucleus distinguishes this type of cell from C D all lower forms of life; it provides a control center for all cellular activities and for reproduction of new cells gen- Figure 2-11.
