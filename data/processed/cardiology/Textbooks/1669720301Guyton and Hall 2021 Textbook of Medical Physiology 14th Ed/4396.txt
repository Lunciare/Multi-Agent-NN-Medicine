tubes are lined with a rugged cryptoid cells that develop over the surface of the blastocyst. These surface that impedes passage of the ovum despite the fluid cells secrete proteolytic enzymes that digest and liquefy current. Also, the isthmus of the fallopian tube (the last the adjacent cells of the uterine endometrium. Some of 2 centimeters before the tube enters the uterus) remains the fluid and nutrients released are actively transported spastically contracted for about the first 3 days after ovu- by the same trophoblast cells into the blastocyst, adding lation. After this time, the rapidly increasing progester- more sustenance for growth.

Once increasing progesterone receptors on the fallopian tube implantation has taken place, the trophoblast cells and smooth muscle cells; then the progesterone activates the other adjacent cells (from the blastocyst and the uterine 1046 Chapter 83 Pregnancy and Lactation Endometrium Trophoblasts 100 Placental 75 diffusion Ovum 50 Trophoblastic 25 nutrition 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 Duration of pregnancy (weeks after last menstruation) Figure 83- 4.
