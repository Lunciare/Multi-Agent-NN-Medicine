renal blood flow and large amounts of meat, increases in GFR and renal blood GFR per se are not the primary variables controlled by the flow are due partly to growth of the kidneys. However, tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. The main purpose the GFR and renal blood flow also increase 20% to 30% of this feedback is to ensure a constant delivery of sodium within 1 or 2 hours after a person eats a high- protein chloride to the distal tubule, where final processing of the meal. urine takes place. Thus, disturbances that tend to increase One likely explanation for the increased GFR is the fol- the reabsorption of sodium chloride at tubular sites before lowing. A high- protein meal releases into the blood amino the macula densa tend to elicit increased renal blood flow acids, which are reabsorbed in the proximal tubules.
