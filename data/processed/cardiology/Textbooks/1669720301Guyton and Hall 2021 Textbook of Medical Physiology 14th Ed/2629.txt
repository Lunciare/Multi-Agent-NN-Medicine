Secre- tion begins with active transport of sodium ions into the Measuring Intraocular Pressure by Tonometry. spaces between the epithelial cells. The sodium ions pull Because it is impractical to pass a needle into a patient’s eye chloride and bicarbonate ions along with them to main- to measure intraocular pressure, this pressure is measured tain electrical neutrality. Then, all these ions together clinically by using a “tonometer,” the principle of which cause osmosis of water from the blood capillaries lying is shown in Figure 50- 21. The cornea of the eye is anes- below into the same epithelial intercellular spaces; the thetized with a local anesthetic, and the footplate of the resulting solution washes from the spaces of the ciliary tonometer is placed on the cornea. A small force is then processes into the anterior chamber of the eye.
