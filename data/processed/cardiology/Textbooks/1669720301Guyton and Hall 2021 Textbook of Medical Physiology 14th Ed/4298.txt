but then disappear until Behavorial effects after the age of about 10 years. However, injection of purified LH into a child at any age or secretion of LH at puberty causes testicular interstitial cells that look like fibroblasts to evolve into functioning Leydig cells. Inhibition of Anterior Pituitary Secretion of Luteiniz- ing and Follicle- Stimulating Hormones by Testoster- one—Negative Feedback Control of Testosterone Se- cretion. Testosterone secreted by the testes in response Hypothalamus to LH has the reciprocal effect of inhibiting anterior pitui- tary secretion of LH (see Figure 81- 10). Most of this inhi- bition probably results from a direct effect of testosterone on the hypothalamus to decrease secretion of GnRH. This effect in turn causes a corresponding decrease in secre- tion of LH and FSH by the anterior pituitary, and the de- GnRH crease in LH reduces secretion of testosterone by the tes- tes. Thus, whenever testosterone secretion becomes too great, this automatic negative feedback effect, operating Anterior through the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, pituitary reduces testosterone secretion back toward the desired operating level. Conversely, too little testosterone allows the hypothalamus to secrete large amounts of GnRH, LH FSH with a corresponding increase in anterior pituitary LH
