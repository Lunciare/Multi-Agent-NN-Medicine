the venous blood to increase far above normal. How- ever, this normally is not the case. Both of these values re- main nearly normal, demonstrating the extreme ability of 20 the respiratory system to provide adequate aeration of the blood, even during heavy exercise. This demonstrates another important point: The blood gases do not always have to become abnormal for respiration to be stimulated in exercise. Instead, respiration is stimu- lated mainly by neurogenic mechanisms during exercise, 0 10 16 18 as discussed in Chapter 42. Part of this stimulation results Minutes from direct stimulation of the respiratory center by the same nervous signals that are transmitted from the brain Figure 85- 9 Effects of muscle exercise on blood flow in the calf of to the muscles to cause the exercise. An additional part is a leg during strong rhythmic contractions. The blood flow was much less during contraction than between contractions.
