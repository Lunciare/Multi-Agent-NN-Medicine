Metabolic Functions of the Liver About 80% of the cholesterol synthesized in the liver is converted into bile salts, which are secreted into the bile; The liver is a large, chemically reactant pool of cells that the remainder is transported in the lipoproteins and car- have a high rate of metabolism.
