For example, a blood flow and GFR in parallel. However, because this decrease in arterial pressure to as low as 70 to 75 mm mechanism is specifically directed toward stabilizing Hg or an increase to as high as 160 to 180 mm Hg usu- sodium chloride delivery to the distal tubule, instances ally changes the GFR less than 10%. In general, renal occur when GFR is autoregulated at the expense of blood flow is autoregulated in parallel with GFR, but changes in renal blood flow, as discussed later. In other GFR is more efficiently autoregulated under certain cases, this mechanism may actually cause changes in conditions.
