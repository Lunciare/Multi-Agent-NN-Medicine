The genes in the formation of DNA. These compounds include the control cell function by determining which structures, following: (1) phosphoric acid; (2) a sugar called deoxyri- enzymes, and chemicals are synthesized within the cell. bose; and (3) four nitrogenous bases (two purines, adenine Figure 3-1 shows the general schema of genetic con- and guanine, and two pyrimidines, thymine and cytosine). trol.
