The discipline of pathophysiology seeks ENVIRONMENT to explain how the various physiological processes are al- tered in diseases or injury. In 1929, the American physiologist Walter Cannon This chapter outlines the different functional systems (1871–1945) coined the term homeostasis to describe the of the body and their contributions to homeostasis.
