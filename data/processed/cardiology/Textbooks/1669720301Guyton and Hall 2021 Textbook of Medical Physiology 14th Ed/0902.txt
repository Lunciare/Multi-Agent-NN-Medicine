Shown by the middle curve is the effect of pressure caused by increased blood volume in dogs whose nervous this increased arterial pressure on urine output, which pressure control mechanisms had been blocked. This figure shows increased 12- fold. Along with this tremendous loss of return of arterial pressure to normal after about 1 hour of fluid loss fluid in the urine, both the cardiac output and arterial into the urine.

Therefore, body fluid volume increases, blood Thus, one sees an extreme capability of the kidneys to volume increases, and the arterial pressure rises until eliminate excess fluid volume from the body in response once again it returns to the equilibrium point. This return to high arterial pressure and, in so doing, to return the of the arterial pressure always back to the equilibrium arterial pressure back to normal. point is known as the near- infinite feedback gain principle Renal–Body Fluid Mechanism Provides Nearly Infinite for control of arterial pressure by the renal–body fluid Feedback Gain for Long-t erm
