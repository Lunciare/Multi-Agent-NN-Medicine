Electron micrographs of platelets in blood clots show that Tissue factor they become attached to the fibrin fibers in such a way that they actually bond different fibers together. Furthermore, platelets entrapped in the clot continue to release proco- (2) Vll VIIa agulant substances, one of the most important of which is fibrin stabilizing factor, which causes more and more cross-l inking bonds between adjacent fibrin fibers. In addi- X Activated X (Xa) tion, the platelets contribute directly to clot contraction by activating platelet thrombosthenin, actin, and myosin Ca2+ molecules, which are all contractile proteins in the plate- V Ca2+ lets; they cause strong contraction of the platelet spicules (3) Prothrombin attached to the fibrin. This action also helps compress the activator Platelet fibrin meshwork into a smaller mass. The contraction is phospholipids activated and accelerated by thrombin and by calcium ions Prothrombin Thrombin released from calcium stores in the mitochondria, endo- plasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus of the platelets. As the clot retracts, the edges of the broken blood ves- Ca2+ sel are pulled together, thus contributing still further to Figure 37- 5. Extrinsic pathway for initiating blood clotting. hemostasis.
