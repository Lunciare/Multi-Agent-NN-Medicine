Thus, one sees the importance of perform “work” to cause inspiration but not to cause expi- surfactant in reducing alveolar surface tension and there- ration. fore also reducing the effort required by the respiratory The work of inspiration can be divided into three frac- muscles to expand the lungs. tions: (1) that required to expand the lungs against the Pressure Caused by Surface Tension Is Inversely Related lung and chest elastic forces, called compliance work or to Alveolar Radius. Note from the preceding formula that elastic work; (2) that required to overcome the viscosity of the smaller the alveolus, the greater the alveolar pressure the lung and chest wall structures, called tissue resistance caused by the surface tension. Thus, when the alveoli have work; and (3) that required to overcome airway resistance half the normal radius (50 instead of 100 micrometers), the to movement of air into the lungs, called airway resistance pressures noted earlier are doubled. This phenomenon is work. especially significant in small premature infants, many of Energy Required for Respiration.
