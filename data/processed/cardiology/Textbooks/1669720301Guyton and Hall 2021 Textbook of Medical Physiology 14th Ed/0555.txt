III II particular instant, the recording in lead I will be negative 120° 90° (below the zero line in the ECG), and the voltage recorded + aVF + will be small, about −0.3 millivolts. This figure demon- strates that when the vector in the heart is in a direction + almost perpendicular to the axis of the lead, the voltage Figure 12-3 Axes of the three bipolar and three unipolar leads. recorded in the ECG of this lead is very low. Conversely, 144 Chapter 12 Electrocardiographic Interpretation of Cardiac Muscle and Coronary Blood Flow Abnormalities equal to that in the heart and, in lead III (vector D), it is about one-third that in the heart. An identical analysis can be used to determine poten- tials recorded in augmented limb leads, except that the respective axes of the augmented leads (see Figure 12-3) are used in place of the standard bipolar limb lead axes used for Figure 12-6.
