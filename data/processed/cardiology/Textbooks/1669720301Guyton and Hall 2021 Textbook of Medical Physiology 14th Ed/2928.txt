Proprioceptive and Exteroceptive Information From Signals transmitted upward in the brain stem from both Other Parts of the Body. Proprioceptive information from the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum via the medial parts of the body other than the neck is also important in longitudinal fasciculus cause corrective movements of the the maintenance of equilibrium.
