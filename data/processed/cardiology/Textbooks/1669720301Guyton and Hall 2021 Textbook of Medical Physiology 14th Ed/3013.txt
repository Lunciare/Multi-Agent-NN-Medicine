different sources gives a more general map, as shown necessary for almost all cortical activity. in Figure 58- 4. This figure shows the major primary and Figure 58-2 shows the areas of the cerebral cortex secondary premotor and supplementary motor areas of the that connect with specific parts of the thalamus. These cortex, as well as the major primary and secondary sensory connections act in two directions, both from the thal- areas for somatic sensation, vision, and hearing, all of which amus to the cortex and then from the cortex back to are discussed in earlier chapters. The primary motor areas essentially the same area of the thalamus. Furthermore, have direct connections with specific muscles for causing when the thalamic connections are cut, the functions of discrete muscle movements. The primary sensory areas the corresponding cortical area become almost entirely detect specific sensations—visual, auditory, or somatic— lost. Therefore, the cortex operates in close association transmitted to the brain from peripheral sensory organs. with the thalamus and can almost be considered both The secondary areas make sense out of the signals in the anatomically and functionally a unit with the thalamus; primary areas. For example, the supplementary and pre- for this
