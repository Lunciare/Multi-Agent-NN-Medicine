been estimated that the total surface area surfactant layer of the respiratory membrane is about 70 square meters in Capillary healthy men, which is equivalent to the floor area of a 25 × 30- foot room. The total quantity of blood in the capillar- Alveolus ies of the lungs at any given instant is 60 to 140 ml. Now, imagine this small amount of blood spread over the entire Diffusion O 2 surface of a 25 × 30- foot floor, and it is easy to understand the rapidity of the respiratory exchange of O and CO . 2 2 Diffusion CO The average diameter of the pulmonary capillaries is 2 only about 5 micrometers, which means that red blood cells must squeeze through them. The red blood cell membrane usually touches the capillary wall, so O and 2 CO need not pass through significant amounts of plasma 2 as they diffuse between the alveolus and red blood cell. This, too, increases the rapidity of diffusion. Red blood cell Factors Affecting Rate of Gas Diffusion Through the Respiratory Membrane Referring to the earlier discussion of diffusion of gases in Capillary endothelium water, one can apply the same principles to diffusion of
