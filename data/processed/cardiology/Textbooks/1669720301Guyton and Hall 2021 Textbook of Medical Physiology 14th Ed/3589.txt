The basic structure of cholesterol is a sterol nucleus, The rate of phospholipid formation is governed to some which is synthesized entirely from multiple molecules of extent by the usual factors that control the overall rate of acetyl- CoA. In turn, the sterol nucleus can be modified by fat metabolism because, when triglycerides are deposited various side chains to form (1) cholesterol; (2) cholic acid, in the liver, the rate of phospholipid formation increases. which is the basis of the bile acids formed in the liver; and Also, specific chemical substances are needed for the for- (3) many important steroid hormones secreted by the adre- mation of some phospholipids.
