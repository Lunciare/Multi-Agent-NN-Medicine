buffer system, the pK is 6.1, and the buffer system is most effective in the central part of Equation 7 can be written as follows: pH=6.1+log HCO 3− 0 Normal 100 0.03×Pco 2 (8) operating point in body Equation 8 is the Henderson- Hasselbalch equation and, 25 75 with it, one can calculate the pH of a solution if the molar concentration of HCO − and the Pco are known. 3 2 50 50 From the Henderson- Hasselbalch equation, it is appar- pK ent that an increase in HCO − concentration causes the pH 3 to rise, shifting the acid–base balance toward alkalosis. An 75 25 increase in Pco causes the pH to decrease, shifting the 2 acid–base balance toward acidosis. The Henderson- Hasselbalch equation, in addition to 100 0 defining the determinants of normal pH regulation and 4 5 6 7 8 acid–base balance in the extracellular fluid, provides in- pH sight into the physiological control of the acid and base Figure 31- 1.

As discussed lat- the pH of extracellular fluid when the percentages of buffer in the er, the HCO 3− concentration is regulated mainly
