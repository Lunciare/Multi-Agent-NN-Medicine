secreted product is –COOH still in the form of proinsulin. 21 Cleavage The proinsulin and C peptide have virtually no insu- 1 30 Cleavage lin activity. However, C peptide binds to a membrane –NH 2 structure, most likely a G protein–coupled membrane A chain 1 receptor, and elicits activation of at least two enzyme systems, sodium- potassium adenosine triphosphatase B chain and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Although both of these enzymes have multiple physiological functions, the importance of C peptide in regulating these enzymes is still uncertain. Secretory C peptide levels can be measured by radioimmunoas- granule say in insulin- treated diabetic patients to determine how C peptide much of their own natural insulin they are still producing. Patients with type 1 diabetes who are unable to produce insulin will usually also have greatly decreased levels of C peptide. When insulin is secreted into the blood, it circulates almost entirely in an unbound form. Because it has a plasma half- life that averages only about 6 minutes, it is mainly cleared from the circulation within 10 to 15 min- utes. Except for the portion of the insulin that combines with receptors in the target cells, the insulin is degraded Insulin
