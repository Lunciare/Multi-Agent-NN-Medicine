Projection of light to the photoreceptors (cones) in the retina. Note that in the foveal region the photoreceptors are entirely in the fovea, there are no rods, and the cones are slender cones and that neuronal cells are all displaced to one side, allowing and have a diameter of only 1.5 micrometers. light to pass unimpeded to the cones. The major functional segments of either a rod or cone are shown in Figure
