Therefore, artery, then through the lungs, and finally back into the resistance to blood flow through the lungs is so great that left ventricle and aorta, passing through the lungs and left the pulmonary arterial pressure is high in the fetus. Also, side of the heart two or more times for every one time because of low resistance to blood flow from the aorta that it passes through the systemic circulation.

Indeed, in the pulmonary artery. This
