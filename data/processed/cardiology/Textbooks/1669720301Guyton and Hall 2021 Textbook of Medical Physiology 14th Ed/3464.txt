The odor is caused principally by products tions, thus allowing the large intestinal mucosa to absorb of bacterial action; these products vary from one person sodium ions far more completely—that is, against a much to another, depending on each person’s colonic bacterial higher concentration gradient—than can occur in the flora and on the type of food eaten.

This is especially true when large quan- erous products include indole, skatole, mercaptans, and tities of aldosterone are available because aldosterone hydrogen sulfide. greatly enhances sodium transport capability.
