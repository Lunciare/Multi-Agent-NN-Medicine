and only the specific type cific self- antigens from the body’s own tissues. If a T lympho- of antigen can activate it. Once the specific lymphocyte cyte reacts, it is destroyed and phagocytized instead of being is activated by its antigen, it reproduces wildly, forming released, which happens in to up to 90% of the cells. Thus, the tremendous numbers of duplicate lymphocytes (Figure only cells that are finally released are those that are nonreac- 35- 2). If it is a B lymphocyte, its progeny will eventually tive against the body’s own antigens—they react only against secrete the specific type of antibody that then circulates antigens from an outside source, such as from a bacterium, throughout the body. If it is a T lymphocyte, its progeny toxin, or even transplanted tissue from another person. are specific sensitized T cells that are released into the Most of the preprocessing of T lymphocytes in the lymph, carried to the blood, and then circulated through thymus occurs shortly before the birth of a baby and for all the tissue fluids and back into the lymph, sometimes a few months after birth. Beyond this period, removal of circulating around and around in this circuit
