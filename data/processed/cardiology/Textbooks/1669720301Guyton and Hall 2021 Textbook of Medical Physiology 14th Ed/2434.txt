Finally, sory receptors that detect such stimuli as touch, sound, pain receptors in the skin are almost never stimulated light, pain, cold, and warmth. In this chapter, we discuss by usual touch or pressure stimuli but do become highly the basic mechanisms whereby these receptors change active the moment tactile stimuli become severe enough sensory stimuli into nerve signals that are then conveyed to damage the tissues. to and processed in the central nervous system. Modality of Sensation—The “Labeled Line” Principle TYPES OF SENSORY RECEPTORS AND THE STIMULI THEY DETECT Each of the principal types of sensation that we can expe- rience—pain, touch, sight, sound, and so forth—is called a Table 47- 1 lists and classifies five basic types of sensory modality of sensation.
