From the titration rithms, to yield the following: curve in Figure 31-1 , several points are apparent. First, − HCO pH=pK+log 3 the pH of the system is the same as the pK when each (0.03×Pco 2) (7) of the components (HCO 3− and CO 2) constitutes 50% of the total concentration of the buffer system. Second, For the bicarbonate buffer system, the pK is 6.1, and the buffer system is most effective in the central part of Equation 7 can be written as follows: pH=6.1+log HCO 3− 0 Normal
