pacemaker Figure 13-10. Atrioventricular nodal premature contraction (lead III). provides continued rhythmical impulses to the ventricles. INCOMPLETE INTRAVENTRICULAR PREMATURE ATRIAL CONTRACTIONS BLOCK—ELECTRICAL ALTERNANS Figure 13-9 shows a single premature atrial contraction Most of the same factors that can cause A- V block can also (PAC). The P wave of this beat occurred too soon in the heart block impulse conduction in the peripheral ventricular Pur- cycle; the P-R interval is shortened, indicating that the ecto- kinje system. Figure 13-8 shows the condition known as pic origin of the beat is in the atria near the A- V node. Also, electrical alternans, which results from partial intraventricu- the interval between the premature contraction and the next lar block every other heartbeat. This ECG also shows tachy- succeeding contraction is slightly prolonged, which is called cardia (rapid heart rate), which is probably the reason the a compensatory pause. One of the reasons for this compensa- block has occurred. This is because when the rate of the heart tory pause is that the premature contraction originated in the is rapid, it may be impossible for some portions of the Pur- atrium some distance from the sinus node, and the impulse kinje system to
