With acidosis, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. The most important less calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Conversely, regulator of calcium reabsorption at both these sites is with alkalosis, a greater amount of calcium is bound to PTH, which regulates the plasma calcium concentration the plasma proteins. Therefore, patients with alkalosis are through three main effects: (1) by stimulating bone resorp- more susceptible to hypocalcemic tetany. tion; (2) by stimulating activation of vitamin D, which then As with other substances in the body, calcium intake increases intestinal reabsorption of calcium; and (3) by must be balanced with the net loss of calcium over the increasing renal tubular calcium reabsorption (Figure 30- long term.
