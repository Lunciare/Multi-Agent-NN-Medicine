If a microphone specially designed heart sound can sometimes be recorded in the phonocar- to detect low- frequency sound is placed on the chest, diogram, but it can almost never be heard with a stetho- the heart sounds can be amplified and recorded by scope because of its weakness and very low frequency— a high- speed recording apparatus. The recording is usually 20 cycles/sec or less. This sound occurs when called a phonocardiogram, and the heart sounds ap- the atria contract, and presumably, it is caused by the pear as waves, as shown schematically in Figure 23- inrush of blood into the ventricles, which initiates vibra- 3. Recording A is an example of normal heart sounds, tions similar to those of the third heart sound. A fourth showing the vibrations of the first, second, and third heart sound is common in persons who derive benefit heart sounds and even the very weak atrial sound.
