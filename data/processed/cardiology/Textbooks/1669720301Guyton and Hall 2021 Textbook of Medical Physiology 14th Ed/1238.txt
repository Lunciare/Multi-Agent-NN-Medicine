man, the total body water is about 60% The fluid of each cell contains its individual mixture of the body weight, or about 42 liters. This percentage of different constituents, but the concentrations of these depends on age, sex, and degree of obesity. As a person substances are similar from one cell to another. In fact, grows older, the percentage of total body weight that is the composition of cell fluids is remarkably similar, even fluid gradually decreases. This decrease is due in part to in different animals, ranging from the most primitive 306 ralullecartxE )L 0.41( diulf scitahpmyL Chapter 25 Regulation of Body Fluid Compartments: Extracellular and Intracellular Fluids; Edema microorganisms to humans. For this reason, the intracel- Cations Anions 150 lular fluid of all the different cells together is considered to be one large fluid compartment. 100 EXTRACELLULAR FLUID COMPARTMENT All the fluids outside the cells are collectively called the extracellular fluid. Together these fluids account for 50 about 20% of the body weight, or about 14 liters in a 70-k g man. The two largest compartments of the extracellular Na+ Ca2+ Cl− fluid are the interstitial fluid, which makes up more than 0 K+ Mg2+ three-fourths (11
