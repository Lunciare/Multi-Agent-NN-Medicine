E RENAL BLOOD FLOW AND OXYGEN protein concentration increases, there is a rapid nonlinear CONSUMPTION increase in colloid osmotic pressure caused by the Don- nan effect; the higher the protein concentration, the more On a per gram- weight basis, the kidneys normally con- rapidly the colloid osmotic pressure rises because of the sume oxygen at twice the rate of the brain but have almost interaction of ions bound to the plasma proteins, which seven times the blood flow of the brain. Thus, the oxygen also exert an osmotic effect, as discussed in Chapter 16. delivered to the kidneys far exceeds their metabolic needs, To summarize, constriction of afferent arterioles and the arterial- venous extraction of oxygen is relatively reduces GFR. However, the effect of efferent arteriolar low compared with that of most other
