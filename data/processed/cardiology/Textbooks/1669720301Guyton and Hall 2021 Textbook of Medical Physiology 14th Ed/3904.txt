TSH by thyrotropes Gonadotropin- releasing hormone Single chain of 10 amino acids Stimulates secretion of FSH and LH by (GnRH) gonadotropes Corticotropin- releasing hormone Single chain of 41 amino acids Stimulates secretion of ACTH by corticotropes (CRH) Growth hormone–releasing hormone Single chain of 44 amino acids Stimulates secretion of growth hormone by (GHRH) somatotropes Growth hormone inhibitory hormone Single chain of 14 amino acids Inhibits secretion of growth hormone by (somatostatin) somatotropes Prolactin- inhibiting hormone (PIH) Dopamine (a catecholamine) Inhibits synthesis and secretion of prolactin by lactotropes ACTH, Adrenocorticotropic hormone; FSH, follicle-s timulating hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; TSH, thyroid- stimulating hormone. Hypothalamic Releasing and Inhibitory Hormones are located in other discrete areas of the hypothalamus or Control Anterior Pituitary Secretion. The function in closely related areas of the basal brain. of the releasing and inhibitory hormones is to control secretion of the anterior pituitary hormones. For most PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF of the anterior pituitary hormones, it is the releasing GROWTH HORMONE hormones that are important, but for prolactin, a hypo- thalamic inhibitory hormone probably exerts more con- All the major anterior pituitary hormones, except for GH, trol. The major hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory exert their principal effects mainly by stimulating
