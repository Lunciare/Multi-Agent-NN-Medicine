be administered to silence pri-miRNA expression of specific genes. They are designed to avoid nuclear processing by the microprocessor complex and, Microprocessor after the siRNA enters the cytoplasm, it activates the RISC complex silencing complex, blocking the translation of mRNA. Because siRNAs can be tailored for any specific sequence Nucleus in the gene, they can be used to block translation of any pre-miRNA mRNA and therefore expression by any gene for which the nucleotide sequence is known. Researchers have pro- Cytoplasm posed that siRNAs may become useful therapeutic tools Transport of pre-miRNA into cytoplasm to silence genes that contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases. Dicer TRANSLATION—FORMATION OF PROTEINS ON THE RIBOSOMES Processing of pre-miRNA into small When a molecule of mRNA comes in contact with a RNA duplexes ribosome, it travels through the ribosome, beginning at a predetermined end of the RNA molecule specified by an appropriate sequence of RNA bases called the chain- RISC initiating codon. Then, as shown in Figure 3-9, while the mRNA travels through the ribosome, a protein molecule is formed, a process called translation. Thus, the ribo- some reads the codons of the mRNA in much the same mRNA way that a tape is read
