calcium ion concentration. A Calcium Pump Is Required to Cause Smooth Muscle Relaxation. To cause relaxation of smooth muscle after it Muscle has contracted, the calcium ions must be removed from relaxation the intracellular fluids. This removal is achieved by a cal- cium pump that pumps calcium ions out of the smooth Figure 8-5 Relaxation of smooth muscle occurs when the calcium muscle fiber back into the extracellular fluid, or into a ion (Ca2+) concentration decreases below a critical level as Ca2+ is sarcoplasmic reticulum, if it is present (Figure 8-5). This pumped out of the cell or into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ is pump requires ATP and is slow acting in comparison with then released from calmodulin (CaM), and myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from the myosin light chain, causing detach- the fast- acting sarcoplasmic reticulum pump in skeletal ment of the myosin head from the actin filament and relaxation of muscle.
