A pacemaker elsewhere than the sinus node is called Then, the impulse once again spreads slightly less rapidly an ectopic pacemaker. An ectopic pacemaker causes an through the ventricular muscle to the epicardial surfaces. abnormal sequence of contraction of the different parts It is important that the student learn in detail the of the heart and can cause significant weakening of heart course of the cardiac impulse through the heart and the pumping. precise times of its appearance in each separate part of the Another cause of shift of the pacemaker is blockage of heart. A thorough quantitative knowledge of this process transmission of the cardiac impulse from the sinus node is essential for understanding electrocardiography, which to the other parts of the heart. The new pacemaker then is discussed in Chapters 11 through 13. usually occurs at the A- V node or in the penetrating por- tion of the A- V bundle on the way to the ventricles.
