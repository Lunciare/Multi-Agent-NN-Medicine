color blindness is a genetic disorder that oc- cone cone cone 100 97 99 curs almost exclusively in males. That is, genes in the fe- male X chromosome code for the respective cones. Yet, 83 83 color blindness almost never occurs in females because at 75 least one of the two X chromosomes almost always has a 67 normal gene for each type of cone. Because the male has 50 42 only one X chromosome, a missing gene can lead to color 36 blindness. 31 25 Because the X chromosome in the male is always inher- ited from the mother, never from the father, color blindness 0 0 is passed from mother to son, and the mother is said to be 400 500 600 700 a color blindness carrier.
