HC COOH a derivative of the vitamin pantothenic acid, to form two mol- ecules of acetyl- CoA. In this conversion, no ATP is formed, HOC COOH but up to six molecules of ATP are formed when the four re- H leased hydrogen atoms are later oxidized, as discussed later. (Isocitric acid) 2H Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle) H C COOH 2 The next stage in the degradation of the glucose molecule HC COOH is called the citric acid cycle (also called the tricarboxylic O C COOH acid cycle or the Krebs cycle in honor of Hans Krebs for his (Oxalosuccinic acid) discovery of this cycle). The citric acid cycle is a sequence CO 2 of chemical reactions in which the acetyl portion of acetyl- H 2C COOH CoA is degraded to carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms. H C 2 These reactions all occur in the matrix of mitochondria. O C COOH The released hydrogen atoms add to the number of these ((cid:31)-Ketoglutaric acid) atoms that will subsequently be oxidized (as discussed lat- H O CO 2 2 er), releasing tremendous amounts of energy to form ATP.
