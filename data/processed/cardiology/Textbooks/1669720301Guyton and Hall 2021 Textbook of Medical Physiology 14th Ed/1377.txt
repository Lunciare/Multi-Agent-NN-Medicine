The macula densa cells sense changes in so- only a few percentage points, even with large fluctua- dium chloride delivery to the distal tubule by way of sig- tions in arterial pressure between the limits of 75 and nals that are not completely understood.

This decrease in sodium chloride when renal perfusion pressure falls below normal.
