Function of Decarboxylases in Causing Release of Then the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions combine with each Carbon Dioxide. Referring again to the chemical reactions other to form water. During this sequence of oxidative reac- of the citric acid cycle, as well as to those for the forma- tions, tremendous quantities of energy are released to form tion of acetyl-C oA from pyruvic acid, we find that there are ATP. Formation of ATP in this manner is called oxidative three stages in which carbon dioxide is released. To cause phosphorylation, which occurs entirely in the mitochon- the release of carbon dioxide, other specific protein en- dria by a highly specialized process called the chemiosmotic zymes, called decarboxylases, split the carbon dioxide away mechanism. from the substrate. The carbon dioxide is then dissolved in Chemiosmotic Mechanism of the Mitochondria to the body fluids and transported to the lungs, where it is Form ATP expired from the body (see Chapter 41).
