it is this downhill diffusion of The glucose transport system in the proximal tubule is sodium to the interior of the cell that provides the energy a good example. Normally, measurable glucose does not for the simultaneous uphill transport of glucose across the appear in the urine because essentially all the filtered glu- luminal membrane. Thus, this reabsorption of glucose is cose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. However, when referred to as secondary active transport because glucose the filtered load exceeds the capability of the tubules to itself is reabsorbed uphill against a chemical gradient, but reabsorb glucose, urinary excretion of glucose does occur. it is secondary to primary active transport of sodium. In the adult human, the transport maximum for glu- Another important point is that a substance is said to cose averages about 375 mg/min, whereas the filtered load undergo active transport when at least one of the steps of glucose is only about 125 mg/min (GFR × plasma in the reabsorption involves primary or secondary active glucose = 125 ml/min × 1 mg/ml). With large increases in transport, even though other steps in the reabsorption GFR and/or plasma glucose concentration that increase the process may be
