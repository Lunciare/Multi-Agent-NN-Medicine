Note that the channel conducts current the channels. Once in the channel, the sodium ions dif- in an all-or-none fashion. That is, the gate of the channel fuse in either direction according to the usual laws of snaps open and then snaps closed, with each open state diffusion. Thus, the sodium channel is highly selective lasting for only a fraction of a millisecond, up to sever- for passage of sodium ions. al milliseconds, demonstrating the rapidity with which changes can occur during the opening and closing of the Gating of Protein Channels.
