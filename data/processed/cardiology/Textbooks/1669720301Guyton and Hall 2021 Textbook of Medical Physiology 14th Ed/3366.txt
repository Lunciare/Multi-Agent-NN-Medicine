Parotid gland Function of Saliva for Oral Hygiene. Under basal awake Glossopharyngeal Otic ganglion conditions, about 0.5 ml of saliva, almost entirely of the mu- nerve cous type, is secreted each minute; however, during sleep, little secretion occurs. This secretion plays an exceedingly important role for maintaining healthy oral tissues. The mouth is loaded with pathogenic bacteria that can easily Tongue Taste stimuli destroy tissues and cause dental caries. Saliva helps prevent Figure 65- 3.
