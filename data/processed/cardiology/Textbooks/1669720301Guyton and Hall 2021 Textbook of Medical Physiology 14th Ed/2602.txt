this accommodation, the shape of the lens is ligaments fibers changed from that of a moderately convex lens to that of Choroid Retina a very convex lens. In a young person, the lens is composed of a strong elastic capsule filled with viscous, proteinaceous, but transparent fluid. When the lens is in a relaxed state, with Ciliary muscle no tension on its capsule, it assumes an almost spherical shape, owing mainly to the elastic retraction of the lens Suspensory capsule. However, as shown in Figure 50- 10, about 70 Lens ligaments suspensory ligaments attach radially around the lens, pull- ing the lens edges toward the outer circle of the eyeball. These ligaments are constantly tensed by their attach- ments at the anterior border of the choroid and retina. The tension on the ligaments causes the lens to remain Figure 50- 10.
