From This flow of blood through the liver, before it empties the circling arteries, still much smaller arteries penetrate into the vena cava, allows the reticuloendothelial cells into the intestinal wall and spread (1) along the muscle that line the liver sinusoids to remove bacteria and other bundles, (2) into the intestinal villi, and (3) into submuco- particulate matter that might enter the blood from the sal vessels beneath the epithelium to serve the secretory gastrointestinal tract, thus preventing direct transport of and absorptive functions of the gut. potentially harmful agents into the remainder of the body. Figure 63- 8 shows the special organization of the The nonfat, water- soluble nutrients absorbed from the blood flow through an intestinal villus, including a small gut (e.g., carbohydrates and proteins) are transported in arteriole and venule that interconnect with a system of the portal venous blood to the same liver sinusoids.
