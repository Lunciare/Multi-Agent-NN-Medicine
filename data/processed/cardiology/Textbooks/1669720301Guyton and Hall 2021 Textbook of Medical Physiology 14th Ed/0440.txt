The cium ions also diffuse into the sarcoplasm from the T velocity of conduction of the excitatory action potential tubules at the time of the action potential, which opens signal along both atrial and ventricular muscle fibers is voltage- dependent calcium channels in the membrane of about 0.3 to 0.5 m/sec, or about 1/250 the velocity in very the T tubule (Figure 9- 7). Calcium entering the cell then large nerve fibers and about 1/10 the velocity in skeletal activates calcium release channels, also called ryanodine muscle fibers. The velocity of conduction in the special- receptor channels, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum mem- ized heart conductive system—in the Purkinje fibers—is brane, triggering the release of calcium into the sarco- as high as 4 m/sec in most parts of the system, allowing plasm. Calcium ions in the sarcoplasm then interact with rapid conduction of the excitatory signal to the different troponin to initiate cross- bridge formation and contrac- parts of the heart, as explained in Chapter 10. tion by the same basic mechanism as that described for skeletal muscle in Chapter 6. Refractory Period of Cardiac Muscle. Cardiac muscle, Without the calcium from the T tubules, the like all excitable tissue, is
