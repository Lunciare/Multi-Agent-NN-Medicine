If the sum of the Starling forces is negative, there will be a net fluid absorption from the interstitial FLUID FILTRATION ACROSS spaces into the capillaries. The net filtration pressure CAPILLARIES (NFP) is calculated as follows: NFP=Pc−Pif−∏p+∏if The hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries tends to force fluid and its dissolved substances through the capillary pores into As discussed later, the NFP is slightly positive under the interstitial spaces. Conversely, osmotic pressure caused normal conditions,
