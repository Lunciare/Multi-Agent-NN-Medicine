Most importantly, located in the muscu- lungs only slightly; when the pneumotaxic signal is weak, lar portions of the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles inspiration might continue for 5 or more seconds, thus throughout the lungs are stretch receptors that transmit filling the lungs with much greater amounts of air. signals through the vagi into the dorsal respiratory group The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to of neurons when the lungs become overstretched. These limit inspiration, which has a secondary effect of increasing signals affect inspiration in much the same way as signals the rate of breathing because limitation of inspiration also from the pneumotaxic center; that is, when the lungs shortens expiration and the entire period of each respira- become overinflated, the stretch receptors activate an tion. A strong pneumotaxic signal can increase the rate of appropriate feedback response that “switches off” the breathing to 30 to 40 breaths/min, whereas a weak pneumo- inspiratory ramp and thus stops
