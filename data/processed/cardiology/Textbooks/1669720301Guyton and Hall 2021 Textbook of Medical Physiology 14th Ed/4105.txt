Among the amino acids most promotes liver conversion of some of the fatty acids into strongly transported are valine, leucine, isoleucine, phospholipids and cholesterol, two of the major products tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Thus, insulin shares of fat metabolism. These two substances, along with ex- with growth hormone the capability of increasing cess triglycerides formed at the same time in the liver, are uptake of amino acids into cells.

Insulin increases translation of messenger RNA, thus threefold in the absence of insulin, giving a total concen- forming new proteins. Insulin “turns on” the ribo- tration of plasma lipids of several percent rather than the somal machinery and, in the absence of insulin, the normal 0.6%.
