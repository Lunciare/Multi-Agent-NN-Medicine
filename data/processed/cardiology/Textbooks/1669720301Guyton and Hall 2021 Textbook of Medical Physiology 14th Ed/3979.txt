women, as in men, is likely to of TSH on the thyroid cell result from activation of the result in a greatly decreased libido. To make the picture “second messenger” cAMP system of the cell. 948 Chapter 77 Thyroid Metabolic Hormones The first event in this activation is binding of TSH with Hypothalamus (decreased temperature) specific TSH receptors on the basal membrane surfaces of the thyroid cell. This binding then activates adenylyl cyclase in the membrane, which increases formation of Thyrotropin-releasing cAMP inside the cell. Finally, cAMP acts as a second mes- hormone senger to activate protein kinase, which causes multiple phosphorylations throughout the cell. The result is both Anterior an immediate increase in secretion of thyroid hormones pituitary and prolonged growth of the thyroid glandular tissue. This method for control of thyroid cell activity is simi- lar to the function of cAMP as a “second messenger” in Thyroid- many other target tissues of the body, as discussed in stimulating Chapter 75.
