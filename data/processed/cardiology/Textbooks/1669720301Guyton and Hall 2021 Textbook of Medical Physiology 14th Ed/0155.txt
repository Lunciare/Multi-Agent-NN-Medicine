another is about 30 years, one would expect as many as mosomes, are also replicated during interphase, usually 10 or many more mutations in the passage of the genome shortly before replication of the DNA. Each centriole is from parent to offspring. As a further protection, how- a small cylindrical body about 0.4 micrometer long and ever, each human genome is represented by two separate about 0.15 micrometer in diameter, consisting mainly of sets of chromosomes, one derived from each parent, with nine parallel tubular structures arranged in the form of a almost identical genes. Therefore, one functional gene of cylinder. The two centrioles of each pair lie at right angles each pair is almost always available to the child, despite to each other. Each pair of centrioles, along with attached mutations. pericentriolar material, is called a centrosome. Shortly before mitosis takes place, the two pairs of cen- CHROMOSOMES AND THEIR REPLICATION trioles begin to move apart from each other. This move- ment is caused by polymerization of protein microtubules The DNA helixes of the nucleus are packaged in chro- growing between the respective centriole pairs and actu- mosomes. The human cell contains 46 chromosomes ally pushing them apart. At
