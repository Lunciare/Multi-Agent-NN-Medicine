FROM PULMONARY CAPILLARIES INTO ALVEOLI Effect of Tissue Metabolism and Tissue Blood Flow When O is used by the cells, virtually all of it becomes Rate on Interstitial Pco 2. Tissue capillary blood flow and 2 CO 2, and this transformation increases the intracellular tissue metabolism affect the Pco 2 in ways exactly oppo- Pco 2; because of this elevated tissue cell Pco 2, CO 2 dif- site to their effect on tissue Po 2. Figure 41-7 shows these fuses from the cells into the capillaries and is then carried effects, as follows: by the blood to the lungs. In the lungs, it diffuses from the 1.
