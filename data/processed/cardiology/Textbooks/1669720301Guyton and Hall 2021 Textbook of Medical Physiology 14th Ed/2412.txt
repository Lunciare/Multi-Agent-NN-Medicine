a neuron. A, Resting neuron, with a INHIBITION normal intraneuronal potential of −65 mV. B, Neuron in an excited state, with a less negative intraneuronal potential (−45 mV) caused by Effect of Inhibitory Synapses on the Postsynaptic sodium influx. C, Neuron in an inhibited state, with a more negative Membrane—Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential. The intraneuronal membrane potential (−70 mV) caused by potassium ion efflux, chloride ion influx, or both. inhibitory synapses mainly open chloride channels, allow- ing for easier passage of chloride ions. To understand how the inhibitory synapses inhibit the postsynaptic neuron, membrane potential has increased in the positive direc- we must recall what we learned about the Nernst poten- tion from −65 to −45 mV. This positive increase in voltage tial for chloride ions. We calculated the Nernst potential above the normal resting neuronal potential—that is, to for chloride ions to be about −70 mV. This potential is a less negative value—is called the excitatory postsynap- more negative than the −65 mV normally present inside tic potential (EPSP), because if this potential rises high the resting neuronal membrane. Therefore, opening the enough in the positive direction, it will elicit an action chloride channels will allow negatively charged chloride potential
