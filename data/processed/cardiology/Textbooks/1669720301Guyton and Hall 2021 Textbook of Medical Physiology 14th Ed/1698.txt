2CO 3 NaH 2PO 4 2HCO 3– 2NH 4+ Carbonic anhydrase H O NH + NH ++ Cl– 2 4 4 CO ++ 2 CO Na+ Na+ 2 Figure 31- 7. Buffering of secreted H+ by filtered phosphate (NaH- Figure 31- 8. Production and secretion of ammonium ion (NH +) by 4 PO ). Note that a new HCO − is returned to the blood for each NaH- proximal tubular cells. Glutamine is metabolized in the cell, yielding 4 3 PO that reacts with a secreted H+. NH + and HCO −. The NH + is secreted into the lumen by a Na+- NH + 4 4 3 4 4 exchanger. For each glutamine molecule metabolized, two NH + are 4 produced and secreted, and two HCO − are returned to the blood. 3 There is one important difference in this sequence of H+ excretion from that discussed previously. In this Renal Tubular case, the HCO 3− that is generated in the tubular cell and interstitial Collecting lumen tubular cells enters the peritubular blood represents a net gain of fluid HCO − by the blood, rather than merely a replacement 3 of filtered HCO −. Therefore, whenever an H+ secreted
