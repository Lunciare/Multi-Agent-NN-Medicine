lists the effect of molecular size on filter- ability of different molecules. A filterability of 1.0 means that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas Proximal tubule a filterability of 0.75 means that the substance is filtered only 75% as rapidly as water. Note that electrolytes such Podocytes as sodium and small organic compounds such as glucose are freely filtered. As the molecular weight of the mol- Capillary loops ecule approaches that of albumin, the filterability rapidly decreases, approaching zero. Bowman's space Afferent arteriole Negatively Charged Large Molecules Are Filtered Bowman's capsule Efferent arteriole Less Easily Than Positively Charged Molecules of A Equal Molecular Size. The molecular diameter of the Slit pores plasma protein albumin is only about 6 nanometers, whereas the pores of the glomerular membrane are thought to be about 8 nanometers (80 angstroms [Å]). Albumin is restricted from filtration, however, because Epithelium of its negative charge and the electrostatic repulsion exerted by negative charges of the glomerular capillary wall proteoglycans. Basement Figure 27-3 shows how electrical charge affects the membrane filtration of different molecular weight dextrans by the glomerulus. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be Endothelium manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative B Fenestrations
