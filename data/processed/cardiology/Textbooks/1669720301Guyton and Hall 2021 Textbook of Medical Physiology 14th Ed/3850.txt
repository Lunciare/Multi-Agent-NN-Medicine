in the body are polypeptides and proteins. These hor- is stored in large follicles within the thyroid gland. Hor- mones range in size from small peptides with as few as mone secretion occurs when the amines are split from 916 Chapter 75 Introduction to Endocrinology Table 75- 1 Endocrine Glands, Hormones, and Their Functions and Structure Gland/Tissue Hormones Major Functions Chemical Structure Hypothalamus Thyrotropin- releasing Stimulates secretion of thyroid- stimulating Peptide (Chapter 76) hormone hormone and prolactin Corticotropin- releasing Causes release of adrenocorticotropic Peptide hormone hormone Growth hormone–releasing Causes release of growth hormone Peptide hormone Growth hormone inhibitory Inhibits release of growth hormone Peptide hormone (somatostatin) Gonadotropin- releasing Causes release of luteinizing hormone and Peptide hormone follicle- stimulating hormone Dopamine or prolactin- Inhibits release of prolactin Amine inhibiting factor Anterior pituitary Growth hormone Stimulates protein synthesis and overall Peptide (Chapter 76) growth of most cells and tissues Thyroid- stimulating Stimulates synthesis and secretion of thyroid Peptide hormone hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) Adrenocorticotropic Stimulates synthesis and secretion of Peptide hormone adrenocortical hormones (cortisol, androgens, and aldosterone) Prolactin Promotes development of the female Peptide breasts and secretion of milk Follicle- stimulating Causes growth of follicles in the ovaries and Peptide hormone sperm
