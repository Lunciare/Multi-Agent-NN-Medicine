not stopped within 1 to 3 minutes, the record (lead I). is almost invariably fatal. Ventricular fibrillation results from cardiac impulses that have gone berserk within the Ventricular ventricular muscle mass, stimulating first one portion tachycardia of the ventricular muscle, then another portion, then another, and eventually feeding back onto itself to re- excite the same ventricular muscle over and over, never stopping. When this phenomenon occurs, many small portions of the ventricular muscle will be contracting at the same time, while equally as many other portions will Figure 13-14. Ventricular paroxysmal tachycardia (lead III). be relaxing. Thus, there is never a coordinated contraction of all the ventricular muscle at once, which is required for A- V Nodal Paroxysmal Tachycardia. Paroxysmal tachy- a pumping cycle of the heart. Despite massive movement cardia often results from an aberrant rhythm involving of stimulatory signals throughout the ventricles, the ven- the A- V node that usually causes almost normal QRS- T tricular chambers neither enlarge nor contract but remain complexes but totally missing or obscured P waves. in an indeterminate stage of partial contraction, pumping Atrial or A- V nodal paroxysmal tachycardia, both of either no blood or negligible amounts. Therefore, after which
