Without this timing capability, the person becomes essential for cerebellar timing of movement termination. unable to determine when the next sequential movement Past Pointing needs to begin. As a result, the succeeding movement Past pointing means that in the absence of the cerebellum, may begin too early or, more likely, too late. Therefore, le- a person ordinarily moves the hand or some other moving sions in the lateral zones of the cerebellum cause complex part of the body considerably beyond the point of inten- movements (e.g., those required for writing, running, or tion. This movement results from the fact that normally the even talking) to become incoordinate and lacking ability cerebellum initiates most of the motor signal that turns off to progress in orderly sequence from one movement to a movement after it is begun; if the cerebellum is not avail- the next. Such cerebellar lesions are said to cause failure able to initiate this motor signal, the movement ordinarily of smooth progression of movements. goes beyond the intended mark. Therefore, past pointing is actually a manifestation of dysmetria. Extramotor Predictive Functions of the Cerebrocer- Failure of
