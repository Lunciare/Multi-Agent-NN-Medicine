vasopressin (AVP). (Modified from Dunn FL, Bren- nan TJ, Nelson AE, et al: The role of blood osmolality and volume in decreases in blood volume, the cardiovascular reflexes regulating vasopressin secretion in the rat. J Clin Invest 52[12]:3212, play a major role in stimulating ADH secretion. The usual 1973.) daily regulation of ADH secretion during simple dehydra- tion is effected mainly by changes in plasma osmolarity. STIMULATION OF ADH RELEASE BY Decreases in blood volume and blood pressure, however, DECREASED ARTERIAL PRESSURE AND/ greatly enhance the ADH response to increased osmolarity. OR DECREASED BLOOD VOLUME OTHER STIMULI FOR ADH SECRETION ADH release is also controlled by cardiovascular reflexes that respond to decreases in blood pressure and/or blood ADH secretion can also be increased or decreased by volume, including the following: (1) the arterial barorecep- other stimuli to the central nervous system, as well as by tor reflexes; and (2) the cardiopulmonary reflexes, both of various drugs and hormones, as shown in Table 29- 2. For which are discussed in Chapter 18. These reflex pathways example, nausea is a potent stimulus for ADH release, originate in high- pressure regions of the circulation, such which may increase to as much as 100
