Cardiac Muscle and Coronary Blood Flow Abnormalities The vector of this current of injury, as shown in the the end of the QRS complex. At exactly this point, all first heart in Figure 12-17, is in a direction of about 125 parts of the ventricles have become depolarized, includ- degrees, with the base of the vector, the negative end, ing both the damaged parts and the normal parts, so no toward the injured muscle. As shown in the lower por- current is flowing around the heart. Even the current of tions of the figure, even before the QRS complex begins, injury disappears at this point. Therefore, the potential this vector causes an initial record in lead I below the zero of the electrocardiogram at this instant is at zero voltage. potential line, because the projected vector of the current This point is known as the J point in the ECG, as shown of injury in lead I points toward the negative end of the in Figure 12-18. lead I axis. In lead II, the record is above the line because Then, for analysis of the electrical axis of the injury the projected vector points more toward the positive ter- potential
