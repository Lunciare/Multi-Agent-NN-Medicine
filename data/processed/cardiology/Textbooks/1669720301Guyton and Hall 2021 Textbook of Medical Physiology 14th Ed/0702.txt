The walls of the arteries are thicker and far venous system, showing that when the arterial system of the stronger than those of the veins. Consequently, the veins, average adult person (including all the large arteries, small on average, are about eight times more distensible than arteries, and arterioles) is filled with about 700 ml of blood, the arteries. That is, a given increase
