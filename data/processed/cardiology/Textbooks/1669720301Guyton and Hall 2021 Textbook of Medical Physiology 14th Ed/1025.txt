tuptuo caidraC UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation reduced the kidney output of urine, causing salt oxygen concentration of 160 ml/L of blood, whereas that and water retention. The Psf has now risen to +12 leaving the left heart has an oxygen concentration of 200 mm Hg, shifting the venous return curve another 3 ml/L of blood. From these data, one can calculate that mm Hg to the right. Also, the prolonged increased each liter of blood passing through the lungs absorbs 40 ml workload on the heart has caused the heart muscle of oxygen. to hypertrophy slightly, raising the level of the car- Because the total quantity of oxygen absorbed into the diac output curve still further. Therefore, point D blood from the lungs each minute is 200 ml, dividing 200 shows a cardiac output that is now almost 20 L/min by 40 calculates to a total of 5 liters of blood that must and a right atrial pressure of about 6 mm Hg. pass through the pulmonary circulation each minute to absorb this amount of oxygen. Therefore, the quantity of Other Analyses of Cardiac Output Regulation. blood flowing through the lungs each minute is 5 liters, In Chapter
