result in net secretion of H+ because HH CCOO 3 22 33 CCaarrbboonniicc the secreted H+ combines with the filtered HCO 3− and is aannhhyyddrraassee therefore not excreted. HH OO 22 CCOO + 22 CCOO 22 CCOO 22 (cid:31)(cid:31) HH 22OO HCO 3− Is Titrated Against H+ in the Tubules. Under nor- mal conditions, the rate of tubular H+ secretion is about Figure 31- 5. Shown are the cellular mechanisms for the following: (1) 4400 mEq/day, and the rate of filtration by HCO − is about 3 active secretion of H+ into the renal tubule; (2) tubular reabsorption 4320 mEq/day. Thus, the quantities of these two ions enter- of HCO − by combination with H+ to form H CO , which dissociates 3 2 3 ing the tubules are almost equal, and they combine with to form CO and H O; and (3) Na+ reabsorption in exchange for H+ 2 2 secreted. This pattern of H+ secretion occurs in the proximal tubule, each other to form CO 2 and H 2O. Therefore, it is said that thick ascending segment of the loop of Henle, and early distal tubule. HCO 3− and H+ normally “titrate” each other in the tubules. The
