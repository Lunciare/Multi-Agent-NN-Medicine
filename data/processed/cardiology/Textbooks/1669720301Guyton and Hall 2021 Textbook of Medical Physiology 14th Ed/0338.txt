of limb movement for run- Motor unit ning and jumping, and the soleus muscle is concerned principally with slow contraction for continual, long- term support of the body against gravity. Muscle Somatic motor neuron Fast Versus Slow Muscle Fibers. As will be discussed more fully in Chapter 85 on sports physiology, every mus- cle of the body is composed of a mixture of so-c alled fast Motor unit and slow muscle fibers, with still other fibers gradated between these two extremes. Muscles that react rapidly, including the anterior tibialis, are composed mainly of fast fibers, with only small numbers of the slow variety. Somatic Conversely, muscles such as soleus that respond slowly motor axon but with prolonged contraction are composed mainly of Motor unit slow fibers. The differences between these two types of fibers are described in the following sections. Neuromuscular junctions Slow Fibers (Type 1, Red Muscle). The following are Skeletal muscle fibers characteristics of slow fibers: 1. Slow fibers are smaller than fast fibers. Figure 6-14 A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the group of skeletal muscle fibers it innervates. A single motor axon may 2. Slow fibers are also innervated by smaller nerve fibers.
