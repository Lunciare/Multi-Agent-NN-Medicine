accumulation of ammonia is extremely toxic, especially protein must be about the same as the ratios in the body to the brain, and can lead to a state called hepatic coma. tissues if the entire dietary protein is to be fully usable to The stages in the formation of urea are essentially the form new tissue proteins. If one particular type of essen- following: tial amino acid is low in concentration, the others become Ornithine + CO + NH unusable because cells synthesize either whole proteins or 2 3 Citrulline none at all, as explained in Chapter 3 in relation to protein −H O 2 synthesis. The unusable amino acids are deaminated and NH 3 oxidized. A protein that has a ratio of amino acids differ- −H 2O ent from that of the average body protein is called a partial protein or an incomplete protein, and such a protein is less Arginine valuable for nutrition than is a complete protein.

Except for +H 2O the 20 to 30 grams of obligatory protein degradation each Urea day, the body uses almost entirely carbohydrates or fats for energy, as long as they are available. However,
