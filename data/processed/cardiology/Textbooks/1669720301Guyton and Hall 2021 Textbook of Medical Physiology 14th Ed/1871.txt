released by sensitized T cells (part of the immune system; also discussed in Chapter 35). Several of these substances strongly activate the macrophage system, Pulp and within a few hours, the macrophages begin to devour Capillaries the destroyed tissues. At times, however, the macrophages may also further injure the still-l iving tissue cells. Venous sinuses Walling- Off Effect of Inflammation. One of the first re- Vein sults of inflammation is to wall off the area of injury from Artery the remaining tissues. The tissue spaces and the lymphat- ics in the inflamed area are blocked by fibrinogen clots so that after a while, fluid barely flows through the spaces. This walling- off process delays the spread of bacteria or Figure 34-6. Functional structures of the spleen. toxic products. The intensity of the inflammatory process is usually The spleen is similar to the lymph nodes, except that proportional to the degree of tissue injury. For example, blood, instead of lymph, flows through the tissue spaces of when staphylococci invade tissues, they release extremely the spleen. Figure 34- 6 shows a small peripheral segment lethal cellular toxins. As a result, inflammation develops of spleen tissue. Note that a small artery penetrates from
