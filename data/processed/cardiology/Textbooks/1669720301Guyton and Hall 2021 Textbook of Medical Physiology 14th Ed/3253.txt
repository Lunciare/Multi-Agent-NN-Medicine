For example, whenever infection occurs usual procedure for measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the brain, dead white blood cells and other infectious is simple. First, the person lies exactly horizontally on his or debris are carried away through the perivascular spaces. her side so that the fluid pressure in the spinal canal is equal Scientists have long believed that the brain lacks true to the pressure in the cranial vault.
