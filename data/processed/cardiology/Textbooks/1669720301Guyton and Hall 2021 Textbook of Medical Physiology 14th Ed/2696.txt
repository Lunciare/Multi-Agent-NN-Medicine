physiological changes GENICULATE NUCLEUS OF THE of the body with night and day; (2) into the pretectal nuclei THALAMUS in the midbrain to elicit reflex movements of the eyes to focus on objects of importance and activate the pupillary The optic nerve fibers of the new visual system terminate in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, located at the dor- sal end of the thalamus and also called the lateral genic- Lateral geniculate body ulate body, as shown in Figure 52- 1. The dorsal lateral Optic tract geniculate nucleus serves two principal functions. First, it Optic radiation Optic chiasm relays visual information from the optic tract to the visual cortex by way of the optic radiation. This relay function is Optic nerve so accurate that there is exact point to point transmission Left eye with a high degree of spatial fidelity all the way from the retina to the visual cortex. After passing the optic chiasm, half the fibers in each optic tract are derived from one eye and half are derived from the other eye, representing corresponding points on Visual Superior cortex colliculus the two retinas. However, the signals from the two eyes are kept apart in the dorsal lateral
