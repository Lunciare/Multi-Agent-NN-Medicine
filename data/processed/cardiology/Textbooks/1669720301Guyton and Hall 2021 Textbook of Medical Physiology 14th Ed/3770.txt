and thus the chemical The Calorie. To discuss the metabolic rate of the body reactions that depend on ADP as one of the substrates are and related subjects quantitatively, it is necessary to use quite slow. They include all the oxidative metabolic path- some unit for expressing the quantity of energy released ways that release energy from food, as well as essentially all from different foods or expended by different functional other pathways for the release of energy in the body. Thus, processes of the body. Most often, the Calorie is the unit ADP is a major rate-l imiting factor for almost all energy used for this purpose. Recall that 1 calorie—spelled with metabolism of the body. a small “c” and often called a gram calorie—is the quantity When the cells become active, regardless of the type of of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of wa- activity, ATP is converted into ADP, increasing the concen- ter 1°C. The calorie is much too small a unit to use when tration of ADP in direct proportion to the degree of activity referring to energy in the body. Consequently, the Calo- of the cell. This ADP then automatically increases
