an enzyme SECONDARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT— ATPase, with the same capability to cleave ATP as the CO- TRANSPORT AND COUNTER- TRANSPORT ATPase of the sodium carrier protein. The difference is that this protein has a highly specific binding site for When sodium ions are transported out of cells by pri- calcium instead of for sodium. mary active transport, a large concentration gradient of 60 Chapter 4 Transport of Substances Through Cell Membranes sodium ions across the cell membrane usually develops, Na+ Glucose with a high concentration outside the cell and a low con- centration inside. This gradient represents a storehouse Na-binding Glucose-binding of energy, because the excess sodium outside the cell site site membrane is always attempting to diffuse to the interior. Under appropriate conditions, this diffusion energy of sodium can pull other substances along with the sodium through the cell membrane. This phenomenon, called co- transport, is one form of secondary active transport. For sodium to pull another substance along with it, a coupling mechanism is required; this is achieved by Na+ Glucose means of still another carrier protein in the cell mem- brane. The carrier in this case serves as an attachment Figure 4-13 Postulated mechanism for sodium co-
