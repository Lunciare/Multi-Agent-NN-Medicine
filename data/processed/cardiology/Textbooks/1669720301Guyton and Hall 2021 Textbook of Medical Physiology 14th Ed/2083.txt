Failure of the human being, the diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure is left side of the heart, or increased resistance to blood flow about 8 mm Hg, and the mean pulmonary arterial pres- through the mitral valve as a result of mitral stenosis or sure is 15 mm Hg. mitral regurgitation, causes blood to dam up in the pul- monary circulation, sometimes increasing the pulmonary Pulmonary Capillary Pressure. The mean pulmonary blood volume as much as 100% and causing large increas- capillary pressure, as diagrammed in Figure 39- 2, is about es in the pulmonary vascular pressures.
