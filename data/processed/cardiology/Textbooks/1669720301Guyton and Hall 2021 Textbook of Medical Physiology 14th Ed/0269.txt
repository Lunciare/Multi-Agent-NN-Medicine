for sodium and potassium ions. During potential onset. Then, the sodium channels begin to close, the resting state, before the action potential begins, the and the potassium channels begin to open; thus, the ratio conductance for potassium ions is 50 to 100 times as of conductance shifts far in favor of high potassium con- great as the conductance for sodium ions. This dispar- ductance but low sodium conductance. This shift allows ity is caused by much greater leakage of potassium ions for a very rapid loss of potassium ions to the exterior but than sodium ions through the leak channels. However, virtually zero flow of sodium ions to the interior.

The inactivation process then closes the sodium channels Roles of Other Ions During the Action Potential Thus far, we have considered only the roles of sodium and potassium ions in generating the action potential. At least Overshoot two other types of ions must be considered, negative anions +40 +20 and calcium ions. Action
