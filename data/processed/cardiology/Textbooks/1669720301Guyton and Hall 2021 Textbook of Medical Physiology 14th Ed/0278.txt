Membrane Physiology, Nerve, and Muscle Direction of Propagation. As demonstrated in Figure 5- repolarization. For a single action potential, this effect is 11, an excitable membrane has no single direction of prop- so minute that it cannot be measured. Indeed, 100,000 agation, but the action potential travels in all directions to 50 million impulses can be transmitted by large nerve away from the stimulus—even along all branches of a nerve fibers before the concentration differences reach the point fiber—until the entire membrane has become depolarized. that action potential conduction ceases. With time, how- ever, it becomes necessary to re- establish the sodium and All- or- Nothing Principle. Once an action potential has potassium membrane concentration differences, which is been elicited at any point on the membrane of a normal achieved by action of the Na+- K+ pump in the same way fiber, the depolarization process travels over the entire as described previously for the original establishment of membrane if conditions are right, but it does not travel at the resting potential. That is, sodium ions that have dif- all if conditions are not right. This principle is called the all- fused to the interior of the cell during the action
