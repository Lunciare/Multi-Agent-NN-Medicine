fluid calcium concentration rises to a higher effects: (1) an effect of PTH to increase calcium and phos- level and calcium phosphate salts are redeposited in the phate absorption from the bone, and (2) a rapid effect of matrix. 1000 )L/lomm( muiclaC Phosphate (mmol/L) Chapter 80 Parathyroid Hormone, Calcitonin, Calcium and Phosphate Metabolism, Vitamin D, Bone, and Teeth Where does PTH fit into this picture? First, the cell reabsorption (see Chapter 30). Moreover, it increases membranes of both the osteoblasts and the osteocytes reabsorption of magnesium ions and hydrogen ions while have PTH receptors. PTH activates the calcium pump it decreases reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and strongly, thereby causing rapid removal of calcium phos- amino acid ions in much the same way that it affects phos- phate salts from the amorphous bone crystals that lie phate. The increased calcium reabsorption occurs mainly near the cells. PTH is believed to stimulate this pump by in the thick ascending loop of Henle and distal tubules. increasing the calcium permeability of the bone fluid side Were it not for the effect of PTH on the kidneys to of the osteocytic membrane, thus allowing calcium ions increase calcium reabsorption, continual loss of calcium to
