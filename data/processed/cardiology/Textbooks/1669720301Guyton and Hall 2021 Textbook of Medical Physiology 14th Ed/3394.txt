secretion occur at once, K+ K+ the total secretion is far greater than the sum of the se- cretions caused by each one separately. Therefore, the Na+, H O Na+, H O various stimuli are said to “multiply,” or “potentiate,” one 2 2 another. Thus, pancreatic secretion normally results from the combined effects of the multiple basic stimuli, not Figure 65- 8.

Phases of Pancreatic Secretion Pancreatic secretion, as with gastric secretion, occurs in border of the cell into the lumen of the duct. The three phases: the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and Cl− that enters the cell is recycled back into the lu- the intestinal phase. Their characteristics are described in men by special chloride channels. the following sections. 2.
