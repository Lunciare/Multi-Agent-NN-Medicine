This reticulum has a special organization that is extremely important in regulating calcium stor- age, release, reuptake and therefore muscle contraction, as discussed in Chapter 7. The rapidly contracting types of muscle fibers have especially extensive sarcoplasmic Actin (thin filament) Z disk reticula. Figure 6-3 Organization of proteins in a sarcomere.
