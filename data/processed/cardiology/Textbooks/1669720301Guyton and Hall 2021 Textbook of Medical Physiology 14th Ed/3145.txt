Most often, focal epilepsy results from some localized organic lesion or functional abnormality, such as (1) scar tissue Thalamus in the brain that pulls on the adjacent neuronal tissue, (2) a tumor that compresses an area of the brain, (3) a de- stroyed area of brain tissue, or (4) congenitally deranged B local circuitry. These lesions can promote extremely rapid discharges in the local neurons; when the discharge rate rises above several hundred per second, synchronous waves begin to spread over adjacent cortical regions. These waves presum- ably result from localized reverberating circuits that may Primary gradually recruit adjacent areas of the cortex into
