That is, any rise in blood glucose increases 90 mg/100 ml, the rate of insulin secretion is minimal— insulin secretion, and the insulin in turn increases the on the order of 25 ng/min/kg of body weight, a level that rate of transport of glucose into liver, muscle, and other has only slight physiological activity.
