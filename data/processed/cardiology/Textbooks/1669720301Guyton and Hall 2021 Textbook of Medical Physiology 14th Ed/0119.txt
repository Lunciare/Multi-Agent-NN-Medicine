that are suspended in the cytoplasm. These molecules are DNA nucleotides called the chain- terminating composed of several hundred to several thousand RNA sequence, which causes the polymerase and the nucleotides in unpaired strands, and they contain codons newly formed RNA chain to break away from the that are exactly complementary to the code triplets of the DNA strand. The polymerase then can be used DNA genes. Figure 3-8 shows a small segment of mRNA. again and again to form more new RNA chains. Its codons are CCG, UCU, and GAA, which are the d. As the new RNA strand is formed, its weak hy- codons for the amino acids proline, serine, and glutamic drogen bonds with the DNA template break acid. The transcription of these codons from the DNA away because the DNA has a high affinity for molecule to the RNA molecule is shown in Figure 3-7. rebonding with its own complementary DNA strand. Thus, the RNA chain is forced away from RNA Codons for the Different Amino Acids. Table 3-1 the DNA and is released into the nucleoplasm. lists the RNA codons for the 20 common amino acids Therefore, the code that is present in the DNA
