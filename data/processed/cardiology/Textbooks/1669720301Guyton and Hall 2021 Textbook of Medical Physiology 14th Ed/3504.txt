Release of Energy From Foods and “Free Energy” ATP is a labile chemical compound that is present in all cells. ATP is a combination of adenine, ribose, and three Many of the chemical reactions in the cells are aimed phosphate radicals, as shown in Figure 68-2 . The last two at making the energy in foods available to the various phosphate radicals are connected with the remainder of the physiological systems of the cell. For example, energy molecule by high- energy bonds, which are indicated by the is required for muscle activity, secretion by the glands, symbol ∼. maintenance of membrane potentials by the nerve and The amount of free energy in each of these high- muscle fibers, synthesis of substances in the cells, ab- energy bonds per mole of ATP is about 7300 calories sorption of foods from the gastrointestinal tract, and under standard conditions and about 12,000 calories many other functions.
