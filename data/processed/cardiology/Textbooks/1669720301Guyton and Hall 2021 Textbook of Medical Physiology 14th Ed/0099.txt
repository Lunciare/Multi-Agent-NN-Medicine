The flagellum, however, is of origin to new areas during the development of special much longer and moves in quasisinusoidal waves instead structures. of whiplike movements. 27 UNIT I UNIT I Introduction to Physiology: The Cell and General Physiology the cilium can still beat under appropriate conditions. Tip Third, two conditions are necessary for continued beating of the axoneme after removal of the other structures of the cilium: (1) the availability of ATP; and (2) appropriate ionic conditions, especially appropriate concentrations of magnesium and calcium. Fourth, during forward motion of the cilium, the double tubules on the front edge of the Membrane cilium slide outward toward the tip of the cilium, whereas Cross section those on the back edge remain in place. Fifth, multiple protein arms composed of the protein dynein, which has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzymatic activity, Filament project from each double tubule toward an adjacent dou- ble tubule. Given this basic information, it has been determined that the release of energy from ATP in contact with the ATPase
