that this way, the respective amino acids are lined up one after are primordial subunits of ribosomes. These subunits are another along the mRNA chain, thus establishing the then released from the nucleolus and transported through the large pores of the nuclear envelope to almost all parts Alanine of the cytoplasm. After the subunits enter the cytoplasm, Cysteine they are assembled to form mature functional ribosomes. Forming protein Histidine Therefore, proteins are formed in the cytoplasm of the Alanine cell, but not in the cell nucleus, because the nucleus does Phenylalanine not contain mature ribosomes. Serine Proline Transfer RNA miRNA AND SMALL INTERFERING RNA Start codon Anticodon A fourth type of RNA in the cell is microRNA (miRNA); Codon miRNA are short (21 to 23 nucleotides) single- stranded GGG RNA fragments that regulate gene expression (Figure AUG GCC UGU CAU GCC UUU UCC CCC AAA CAG GAC UAU 3-10). The miRNAs are encoded from the transcribed Ribosome Ribosome DNA of genes, but they are not translated into pro- Messenger teins and are therefore often called noncoding RNA. The RNA movement miRNAs are processed by the cell into molecules that Figure 3-9. A messenger RNA strand is moving through two ribo-
