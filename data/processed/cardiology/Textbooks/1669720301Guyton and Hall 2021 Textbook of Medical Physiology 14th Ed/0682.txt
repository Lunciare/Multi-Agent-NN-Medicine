In an adult human, this averages approx- pressure difference of 100 mm Hg between the two ends of imately 100 ml/sec. The pressure difference from the the vessels. Although the diameters of these vessels increase systemic arteries to the systemic veins is about 100 mm only fourfold, the respective flows are 1, 16, and 256 ml/ Hg. Therefore, the resistance of the entire systemic cir- min, which is a 256-f old increase
