by an increase in total peripheral resistance due to tissue blood flow autoregu- Increased venous return of blood to the heart lation or other factors that cause vasoconstriction. The slight increase in cardiac output is often not measurable. Importance of Salt (NaCl) in the Renal– Increased cardiac output Body Fluid Schema for Arterial Pressure Regulation Autoregulation Although the discussions thus far have emphasized the importance of volume in regulation of arterial pressure, Increased total experimental studies have shown that an increase in peripheral resistance salt intake is far more likely to elevate the arterial pres- sure, especially in people who are salt- sensitive, than is Increased arterial pressure an increase in water intake. The reason for this finding is that pure water is normally excreted by the kidneys almost as rapidly as it is ingested, but salt is not excreted Increased urine output so easily. As salt accumulates in the body, it also indi- rectly increases the extracellular fluid volume for two basic reasons: Figure 19- 6. Sequential steps whereby increased extracellular fluid volume increases the arterial pressure. Note especially that increased 1. Although some additional sodium may be stored in cardiac output has both a direct effect to increase
