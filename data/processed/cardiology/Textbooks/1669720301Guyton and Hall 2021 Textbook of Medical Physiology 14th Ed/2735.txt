The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses Pupillary Light Reflex. When light is shone into the eyes, clinical condition called Horner syndrome. This syndrome the pupils constrict, a reaction called the pupillary light consists of the following effects: reflex. The neuronal pathway for this reflex is illustrated 1. Because of interruption of sympathetic nerve fibers to the pupillary dilator muscle, the pupil remains persis- by the upper two black arrows in Figure 52- 11.
