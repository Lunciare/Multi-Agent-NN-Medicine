glucose can does pass to the interior of the cells with a reasonable degree 844 Chapter 68 Metabolism of Carbohydrates and Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate of freedom by facilitated diffusion. The principles of this type Glycogen Is Stored in the Liver and Muscle of transport are discussed in Chapter 4. Penetrating through After absorption into a cell, glucose can be used im- the lipid matrix of the cell membrane are large numbers of mediately for release of energy to the cell, or it can be protein carrier molecules that can bind with glucose. In this stored in the form of glycogen, which is a large polymer bound form, the glucose can be transported by the carrier of glucose. from one side of the membrane to the other side and then Almost all cells of the body are capable of storing at least released. Therefore, if the concentration of glucose is greater some glycogen, but certain cells can store large amounts, on one side of the membrane than on the other side, more especially liver cells, which can store up to 5% to 8% of their glucose will be transported from the high-c oncentration area weight as glycogen, and muscle cells,
