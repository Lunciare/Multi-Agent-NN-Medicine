1 to 2 millimeters. However, on someone’s back, the needles CHARACTERISTICS OF DORSAL usually must be as far apart as 30 to 70 millimeters before COLUMN–MEDIAL LEMNISCAL SIGNAL two separate points can be detected. The reason for this TRANSMISSION AND ANALYSIS difference is the different numbers of specialized tactile receptors in the two areas. Basic Neuronal Circuit in the Dorsal Column–Medial Lemniscal System. The lower part of Figure 48- 9 shows Figure 48- 10 shows the mechanism whereby the dor- sal column pathway (as well as all other sensory path- the basic organization of the neuronal circuit of the spinal ways) transmits two- point discriminatory information. cord dorsal column pathway, demonstrating that at each This figure shows two adjacent points on the skin that are synaptic stage, divergence occurs. The upper curves of the strongly stimulated, as well as the areas of the somatosen- figure show that the cortical neurons that discharge to the sory cortex (greatly enlarged) that are excited by signals greatest extent are those in a central part of the cortical from the two stimulated points. The blue curve shows “field” for each respective receptor. Thus, a weak stimulus the spatial pattern of cortical excitation when both
