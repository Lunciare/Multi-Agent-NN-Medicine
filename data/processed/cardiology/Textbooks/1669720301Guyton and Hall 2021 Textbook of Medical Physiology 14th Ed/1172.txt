This new state of backward blood flow causes the ductus arteriosus to be- come occluded within a few hours to a few days in most Head and upper babies, so blood flow through the ductus does not persist. extremities The ductus is believed to close because the oxygen concen- tration of the aortic blood now flowing through it is about Pulmonary Left twice as high as that of the blood flowing from the pulmo- artery pulmonary nary artery into the ductus during fetal life. The oxygen artery presumably constricts the muscle in the ductus wall. This Right phenomenon is discussed further in Chapter 84. Left lung lung Unfortunately, in about 1 of every 5500 babies, the ductus does not close, causing the condition
