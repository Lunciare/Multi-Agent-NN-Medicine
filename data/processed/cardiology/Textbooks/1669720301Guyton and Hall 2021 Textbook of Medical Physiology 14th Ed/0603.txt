which is opposite myocardial ischemia. The ischemia might result from to the mean electrical axis of the QRS complex in the chronic, progressive coronary stenosis (narrowing), same ECG. Thus, when conduction of the depolarization acute coronary occlusion, coronary artery spasm, or rel- impulse through the ventricles is greatly delayed, the T ative coronary insufficiency that occurs during exercise wave is almost always of opposite polarity to that of the or severe anemia. QRS complex. SHORTENED DEPOLARIZATION IN Effect of Digitalis on the T Wave. As discussed in PORTIONS OF THE VENTRICULAR MUSCLE Chapter 22, digitalis is a drug that can be used during CAN CAUSE T-WAVE ABNORMALITIES heart failure to increase the strength of cardiac muscle contraction. However, when an overdose of digitalis is If the base of the ventricles should exhibit an abnormally given, depolarization duration in one part of the ventri- short period of depolarization—that is, a shortened action cles may be increased out of proportion to that of other potential—repolarization of the ventricles would not begin parts. As a result, nonspecific changes, such as T- wave in- at the apex, as it normally does. Instead, the base of the ven- version or biphasic T waves, may occur
