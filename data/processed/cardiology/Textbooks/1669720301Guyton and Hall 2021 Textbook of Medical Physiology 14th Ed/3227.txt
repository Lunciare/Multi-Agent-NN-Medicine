REGULATION OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW MV ea ts ao ba oc lit ti ev se Normal blood flow through the brain of the adult person averages 50 to 65 ml/100 g of brain tissue/min. For the Capillary Ca2+ entire brain, this amounts to 750 to 900 ml/min. Thus, the Pericyte brain constitutes only about 2% of the body weight but receives 15% of the resting cardiac output.
