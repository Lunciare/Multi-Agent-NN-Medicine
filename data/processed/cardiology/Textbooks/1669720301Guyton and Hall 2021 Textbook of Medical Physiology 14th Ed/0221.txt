the renal tubular fluid for the purpose the Na+- K+ pump performs a continual surveillance role of eliminating excess hydrogen ions from the body fluids. in maintaining normal cell volume. The hydrogen ions can be secreted into the renal tubular fluid against a concentration gradient of about 900- fold. Electrogenic Nature of the Na+- K+ Pump. The fact Yet, as discussed in Chapter 31, most of these hydrogen that the Na+- K+ pump moves three Na+ ions to the exte- ions combine with tubular fluid buffers before they are rior for every two K+ ions that are moved to the interior eliminated in the urine means that a net of one positive charge is moved from Energetics of Primary Active Transport the interior of the cell to the exterior of the cell for each cycle of the pump. This action creates positivity outside The amount of energy required to transport a substance the cell but results in a deficit of positive ions inside the actively through a membrane is determined by how much cell; that is, it causes negativity on the inside. Therefore, the substance is concentrated during transport. Com- the Na+- K+ pump is said to be electrogenic because
