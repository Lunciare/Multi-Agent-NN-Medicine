urea transporters, As fluid flows into the cortical collecting tubule, the UT- A1 and UT- A3. These urea transporters are activated amount of water reabsorbed is critically dependent on the by ADH, increasing transport of urea out of the inner plasma concentration of ADH. In the absence of ADH, medullary collecting duct even more when ADH levels this segment is almost impermeable to water and fails to are elevated. The simultaneous movement of water and reabsorb water but continues to reabsorb solutes and fur- urea out of the inner medullary collecting ducts maintains ther dilutes the urine. When there is a high concentration a high concentration of urea in the tubular fluid and, even- of ADH, the cortical collecting tubule becomes highly tually, in the urine, even though urea is being reabsorbed. permeable to water, so large amounts of water are now The fundamental role of urea in contributing to urine- reabsorbed from the tubule into the cortex interstitium, concentrating ability is evidenced by the fact that people where it is swept away by the rapidly flowing peritubu- who ingest a high- protein diet, yielding large amounts of lar capillaries.
