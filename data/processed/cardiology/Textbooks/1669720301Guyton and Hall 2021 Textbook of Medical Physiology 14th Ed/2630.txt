applied to a central plunger, causing the part of the cornea tion, several nutrients are transported across the epithe- beneath the plunger to be displaced inward. The amount lium by active transport or facilitated diffusion, including of displacement is recorded on the scale of the tonometer, amino acids, ascorbic acid, and glucose. and this is calibrated in terms of intraocular pressure. 636 CHAPTER 50 The Eye: I. Optics of Vision Pressure applied maintained for long periods. Extremely high pressures can cause blindness within days or even hours. As the pressure rises, the axons of the optic nerve are compressed where they leave the eyeball at the optic disc. This compression is believed to block axonal flow of cytoplasm from the retinal Central plunger neuronal cell bodies into the optic nerve fibers leading to the brain. The result is lack of appropriate nutrition of the fibers, which eventually causes death of the involved fibers. It is possible that compression of the retinal artery, which enters the eyeball at the optic disc, also adds to the neu- ronal damage by reducing nutrition to the retina. In most cases of glaucoma, the abnormally high pressure results from increased resistance to fluid outflow through
