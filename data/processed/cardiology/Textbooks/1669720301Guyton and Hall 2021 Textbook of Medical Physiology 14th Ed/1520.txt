in arterial pressure may also increase the blood flow of fluid and solutes into the blood through the usual flow of the renal medulla to a greater extent than in other colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressures that favor reab- regions of the kidney and tend to wash out the hyperos- sorption in these capillaries. Under steady- state condi- motic interstitium, thereby reducing urine-c oncentrating tions, the vasa recta carry away only as much solute and ability. As discussed earlier, maximum concentrating abil- water as is absorbed from the medullary tubules, and the ity of the kidney is determined not only by the level of ADH but also by the osmolarity of the renal medulla in- terstitial fluid. Even with maximal ADH levels, the urine- Vasa recta Interstitium mOsm/L mOsm/L concentrating ability will be reduced if medullary blood flow increases enough to reduce the hyperosmolarity in 300 350 300 the renal medulla.
