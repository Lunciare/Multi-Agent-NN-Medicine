Most storage occurs in the cerebral cortex, but to the periphery of the body, but by sending signals to even the basal regions of the brain and the spinal cord can the control centers of the cord, simply “commanding” the store small amounts of information. cord centers to perform their functions. The storage of information is the process we call mem- ory, which is also a function of the synapses.
