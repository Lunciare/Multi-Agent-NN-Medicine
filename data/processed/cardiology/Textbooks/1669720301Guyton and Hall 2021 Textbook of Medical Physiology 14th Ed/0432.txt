subepicardial muscle fibers are wrapped in a left- handed helix and subendocardial fibers are arranged in a right- handed helix.

Intercalated discs fibers several millimeters in diameter that is discussed in Chapter 10. This division of the muscle of the heart into two func- tional syncytia allows the atria to contract a short time ahead of ventricular contraction, which is important for the effectiveness of heart pumping.
