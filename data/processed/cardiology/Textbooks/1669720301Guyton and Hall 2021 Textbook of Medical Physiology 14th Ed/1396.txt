On the 344 Chapter 28 Renal Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion Peritubular Tubular Tubular Thus, the net reabsorption of sodium ions from the capillary epithelial cells lumen tubular lumen back into the blood involves at least three steps: 1. Sodium diffuses across the luminal membrane (also Na+ called the apical membrane) into the cell down an electrochemical gradient established by the Na+- K+ ATP Na+ ATPase pump on the basolateral side of the mem- Na+ ATP K+ (–3 mV) brane.
