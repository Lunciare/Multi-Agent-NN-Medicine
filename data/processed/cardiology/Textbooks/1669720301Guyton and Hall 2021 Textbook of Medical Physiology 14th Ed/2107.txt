as negative as −4 mm Hg to keep the lungs expanded. Actual measurements have shown When the lungs expand and contract during normal that the pressure is usually about –7 mm Hg, which is breathing, they slide back and forth within the pleural a few millimeters of mercury more negative than the cavity. To facilitate this movement, a thin layer of mucoid collapse pressure of the lungs. Thus, the negativity of fluid lies between the parietal and visceral pleurae. the pleural fluid pressure keeps the normal lungs pulled Figure 39- 9 shows the dynamics of fluid exchange against the parietal pleura of the chest cavity, except for in the pleural space. The pleural membrane is a porous, an extremely thin layer of mucoid fluid that acts as a mesenchymal, serous membrane through which small lubricant. 509 ruoh rep diulf amedE = noitamrof amede fo etaR gnul fo thgiew yrD UNIT VII UNIT VII Respiration Pleural Effusion—Collection of Large Amounts of Free Guyton AC, Lindsey AW: Effect of elevated left atrial pressure and Fluid in the Pleural Space.
