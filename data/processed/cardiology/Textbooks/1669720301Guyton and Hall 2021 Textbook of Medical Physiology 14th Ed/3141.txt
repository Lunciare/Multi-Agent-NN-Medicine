also shows the EEG during REM sleep. It is trical waves in the thalamocortical system at a frequency often difficult to tell the difference between this brain wave between 8 and 13/sec, which is the natural frequency of pattern and that of an awake, active person. The waves are the alpha waves. Therefore, alpha waves are thought to re- irregular and of high frequency, which are normally sug- sult from spontaneous feedback oscillation in this diffuse gestive of desynchronized nervous activity as found in the thalamocortical system, possibly including the reticular ac- awake state. Therefore, REM sleep is frequently called de- tivating system in the brain stem as well. This oscillation synchronized sleep because there is lack of synchrony in the presumably causes the periodicity of the alpha waves and firing of the neurons despite significant brain activity. the synchronous activation of literally millions of cortical Seizures and Epilepsy neurons during each wave.
