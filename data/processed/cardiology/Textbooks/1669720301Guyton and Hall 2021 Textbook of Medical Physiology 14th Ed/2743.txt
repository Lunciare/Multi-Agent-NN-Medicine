In addition, the surface area of the cochlea. Therefore, under appropriate conditions, a tuning tympanic membrane is about 55 square millimeters, where- fork or an electronic vibrator placed on any bony protuber- as the surface area of the stapes averages 3.2 square millim- ance of the skull, but especially on the mastoid process near eters. This 17-f old difference times the 1.3-f old ratio of the the ear, causes the person to hear the sound. However, the lever system causes about 22 times as much total force to be energy available even in loud sound in the air is not sufficient exerted on the fluid of the cochlea as is exerted by the sound to cause hearing via bone conduction unless a special electro- waves against the tympanic membrane. Because fluid has mechanical sound-a mplifying device is applied to the bone. far greater inertia than air does, increased amounts of force are necessary to cause vibration in the fluid. Therefore, the COCHLEA tympanic membrane and ossicular system provide imped- ance matching between the sound waves in air and the FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE sound vibrations in the fluid of the cochlea. The impedance COCHLEA matching is about 50% to 75%
