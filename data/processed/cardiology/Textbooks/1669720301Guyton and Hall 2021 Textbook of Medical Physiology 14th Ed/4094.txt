The lack of insulin (along with increased glucagon, ing that the glucose concentration remained almost zero which is discussed later) activates the enzyme phos- despite increased extracellular glucose concentration up phorylase, which causes the splitting of glycogen to as high as 750 mg/100 ml. In contrast, the curve labeled into glucose phosphate. “insulin” demonstrates that the intracellular glucose con- 4.

Thus, it is clear that insulin can increase the lack of insulin and causes the phosphate radical to rate of transport of glucose into the resting muscle cell by split away from the glucose, allowing the free glu- at least 15-f old. cose to diffuse back into the blood. Thus, the liver removes glucose from the blood when it Insulin Promotes Liver Uptake, Storage, is present in excess after a meal and returns it to the blood and Use of Glucose when the blood glucose concentration falls between One of the most important effects of insulin is to cause meals. Ordinarily, about 60% of the glucose in the meal most of the
