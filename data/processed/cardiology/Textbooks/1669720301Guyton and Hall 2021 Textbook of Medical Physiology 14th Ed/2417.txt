many presynaptic terminals are usually stim- nerve fibers often mutually inhibit one another, which ulated at the same time. Even though these terminals are minimizes sideways spread and mixing of signals in sen- spread over wide areas of the neuron, their effects can sory tracts. We discuss the importance of this phenom- still summate; that is, they can add to one another until enon more fully in subsequent chapters. neuronal excitation occurs. We pointed out earlier that a change in potential at any single point within the soma Time Course of Postsynaptic Potentials will cause the potential to change almost equally every- When an excitatory synapse excites the anterior motor where inside the soma. Therefore, for each excitatory syn- neuron, the neuronal membrane becomes highly perme- apse that discharges simultaneously, the total intrasomal able to sodium ions for 1 to 2 milliseconds. During this potential becomes more positive by 0.5 to 1.0 mV. When short time, enough sodium ions diffuse to the interior of the EPSP becomes great enough, the threshold for firing the postsynaptic motor neuron to increase its intraneu- will be reached, and an action potential will develop spon- ronal potential by a few millivolts, thus creating the
