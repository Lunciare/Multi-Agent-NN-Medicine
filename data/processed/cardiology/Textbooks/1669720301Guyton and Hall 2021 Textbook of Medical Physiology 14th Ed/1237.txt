This compartment in most people. includes fluid in the synovial, peritoneal, pericardial, and intraocular spaces, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid; it is INTRACELLULAR FLUID COMPARTMENT usually considered to be a specialized type of extracellular fluid, although in some cases its composition may differ About 28 of the 42 liters of fluid in the body are inside the markedly from that of the plasma or interstitial fluid. All trillions of cells and is collectively called the intracellular the transcellular fluids together constitute about 1 to 2 fluid. Thus, the intracellular fluid constitutes about 40% of liters. the total body weight in an “average” person. In a 70- kg adult man, the total body water is about 60% The fluid of each cell contains its individual mixture of the body weight, or about 42 liters. This percentage of different constituents,
