reticulum, a network tion of cell membrane receptors with specific ligands that of tubular structures called cisternae and flat vesicular bind to the receptor causes conformational changes in structures in the cytoplasm. This organelle helps pro- the receptor protein. This process, in turn, enzymatically cess molecules made by the cell and transports them to activates the intracellular part of the protein or induces their specific destinations inside or outside the cell. The interactions between the receptor and proteins in the tubules and vesicles interconnect. Also, their walls are cytoplasm that act as second messengers, relaying the sig- constructed of lipid bilayer membranes that contain large nal from the extracellular part of the receptor to the inte- amounts of proteins, similar to the cell membrane. The rior of the cell. In this way, integral proteins spanning the total surface area of this structure in some cells—the liver cell membrane provide a means of conveying information cells, for example—can be as much as 30 to 40 times the about the environment to the cell interior. cell membrane area. Peripheral protein molecules are often attached to The detailed structure of a small portion of endoplas- integral proteins. These peripheral proteins function mic reticulum
