the adrenergic blockers or surgical implantation of a cardiac heart rate from about 95 to about 150 beats/min in the defibrillator for long- term LQTS. middle of the record. On close study of the ECG, an inverted P wave is seen during the rapid heartbeat before PAROXYSMAL TACHYCARDIA each QRS- T complex, and this P wave is partially super- imposed onto the normal T wave of the preceding beat. Some abnormalities in different portions of the heart, This finding indicates that the origin of this paroxysmal including the atria, Purkinje system, or ventricles, can tachycardia is in the atrium but, because the P wave is occasionally cause rapid rhythmical discharge of impulses abnormal in shape, the origin is not near the sinus node. 162 Chapter 13 Cardiac Arrhythmias and Their Electrocardiographic Interpretation Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia shock to the heart is needed for restoration of normal heart rhythm. VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION The most serious of all cardiac arrhythmias is ventricular Figure 13-13. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia—onset in the middle of fibrillation, which, if not stopped within 1 to 3 minutes, the record (lead I). is almost invariably fatal. Ventricular fibrillation results from cardiac impulses that have gone berserk within the Ventricular ventricular muscle
