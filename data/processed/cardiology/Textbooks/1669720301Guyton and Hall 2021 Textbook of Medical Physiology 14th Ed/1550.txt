no change in plasma 2 mEq/L above normal, the thirst mechanism is activated, osmolarity. This stimulation probably occurs because of causing a desire to drink water. This is called the thresh- neural input from cardiopulmonary and systemic arterial old for drinking. Thus, even small increases in plasma baroreceptors in the circulation. osmolarity are normally followed by water intake, which 3. A third important stimulus for thirst is angiotensin II. restores extracellular fluid osmolarity and volume toward 378 Chapter 29 Urine Concentration and Dilution normal. In this way, the extracellular fluid osmolarity and 152 sodium concentration are precisely controlled. Disorders of Thirst and Water Intake. As discussed pre- viously, increased thirst occurs in various medical disorders ADH and 148 associated with increased urine volume and reductions in thirst extracellular fluid volume, such as poorly controlled diabetes systems blocked mellitus or diabetes insipidus. In these cases, increased water intake serves as a compensatory response for increased plas- ma osmolarity and/or extracellular fluid volume depletion. 144 Polydipsia, or excessive thirst, occasionally occurs in the ab- sence of known physiological stimuli for thirst. Psychogenic Normal polydipsia, for example, may be caused by mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or obsessive-c ompulsive disorders 140 and can
