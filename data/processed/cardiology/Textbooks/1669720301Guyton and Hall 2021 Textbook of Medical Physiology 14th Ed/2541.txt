Pain, Headache, and Thermal Sensations CAd Slow-chronic I (lamina marginalis) of the dorsal horns, as shown in Spinal pain fibers Fast-sharp Figure 49- 2, and there they excite second-o rder neurons nerve pain fibers of the neospinothalamic tract. These second-o rder neu- rons give rise to long fibers that cross immediately to the Tract of I opposite side of the cord through the anterior commis- Lissauer II IIIIV sure and then turn upward, passing to the brain in the V anterolateral columns. VI Termination of the Neospinothalamic Tract in the VII Brain Stem and Thalamus. A few fibers of the neospi- VIII IX nothalamic tract terminate in the reticular areas of the Lamina brain stem, but most pass all the way to the thalamus marginalis without interruption, terminating in the ventrobasal com- Substantia Anterolateral plex along with the dorsal column–medial lemniscal tract gelatinosa pathway for tactile sensations, as was discussed in Chapter 48.
