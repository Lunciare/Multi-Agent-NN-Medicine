to alternate versions of the protein. The total number of Plasma Nuclear different proteins produced by the various cell types in membrane envelope humans is estimated to be at least 100,000. Some of the cellular proteins are structural proteins, Nucleus which, in association with various lipids and carbohy- drates, form structures of the various intracellular organ- DNA Gene (DNA) elles discussed in Chapter 2. However, most of the proteins DNA Transcription transcription are enzymes that catalyze different chemical reactions in the cells. For example, enzymes promote all the oxidative RNA RNA formation reactions that supply energy to the cell, along with synthe- sis of all the cell chemicals, such as lipids, glycogen, and RNA splicing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). mRNA Translation Ribosomes RNA transport CELL NUCLEUS GENES CONTROL PROTEIN SYNTHESIS mRNA Protein formation In the cell nucleus, large numbers of genes are attached end Translation of mRNA Cell Cell on end in extremely long, double- stranded helical molecules structure enzymes of DNA having molecular weights measured in the billions. Protein A very short segment of such a molecule is shown in Figure Cytosol 3-2. This molecule is composed of several simple chemical Cell function compounds bound together in a regular pattern,
