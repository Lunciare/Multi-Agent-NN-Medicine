Most importantly, under resting conditions, sedentary lifestyle, or who have high blood pressure and cardiac muscle normally consumes more fatty acids than damage to the endothelial cells of the coronary blood ves- carbohydrates to supply its energy (≈ 70% of the energy is sels, large quantities of cholesterol gradually become de- derived from fatty acids). However, as is also true of other posited beneath the endothelium at many points in arter- tissues, under anaerobic or ischemic conditions, cardiac ies throughout the body.

However, glycolysis consumes large quantities fied. The net result is the development of atherosclerotic of the blood glucose and, at the same time, forms large plaques, which actually protrude into the vessel lumens 264 Chapter 21 Muscle Blood Flow and Cardiac Output During Exercise and
