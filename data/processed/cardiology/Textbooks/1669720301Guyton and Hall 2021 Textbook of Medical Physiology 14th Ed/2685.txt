cells are generally sensitive to the color of a Excitation stimulus, whereas M cells are not sensitive to color stimuli. 2 5. The M cells are much more sensitive than are P cells Lateral inhibition to low-c ontrast, black and white stimuli. Figure 51- 14. Responses of a ganglion cell to light in (1) an area The main functions of M and P cells are obvious from excited by a spot of light and (2) an area adjacent to the excited their differences: The P cells are highly sensitive to visual spot. The ganglion cell in this area is inhibited by the mechanism signals that relate to fine details and to different colors but of lateral inhibition. (Modified from Granit R: Receptors and Sensory Perception: A Discussion of Aims, Means, and Results of Electrophysi- are relatively insensitive to low-c ontrast signals, whereas ological Research into the Process of Reception.

A third type of photosensitive retinal ganglion cell has been described that contains its own photopigment, Conversely, the same gnat sitting quietly remains below melanopsin. Much less is
