The in- charges provide selectivity that permits only certain mole- teraction of the potassium ions with carbonyl oxygens causes the potas- cules to pass through. For example, aquaporins permit rapid sium ions to shed their bound water molecules, permitting the dehy- drated potassium ions to pass through the pore. passage of water through cell membranes but exclude other molecules. Aquaporins have a narrow pore that permits water molecules to diffuse through the membrane in single molecular diameters of the ions because potassium ions file. The pore is too narrow to permit passage of any hydrated are slightly larger than sodium ions. Using x-r ay crys- ions.
