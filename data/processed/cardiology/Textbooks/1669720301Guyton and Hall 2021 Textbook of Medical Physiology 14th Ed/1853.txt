Finally, the function in two ways to prevent disease: (1) by actually destroying of platelets is specifically to activate the blood-c lotting invading bacteria or viruses by phagocytosis; and (2) by mechanism, discussed in Chapter 37. forming antibodies and sensitized lymphocytes that may destroy or inactivate the invader. This chapter discusses the first of these methods, and Chapter 35 discusses the second. Concentrations of Different White Blood Cells in Blood.

They are formed the following: partially in the bone marrow (granulocytes and monocytes • Neutrophils: 62.0% and a few lymphocytes) and partially in the lymph tissue • Eosinophils: 2.3% (lymphocytes and plasma cells). After formation, they are • Basophils: 0.4% transported in the blood to different parts of the body • Monocytes: 5.3% where they are needed. • Lymphocytes: 30.0% The real value of WBCs is that most of them
