For instance, such a signal. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 55- 6. if the muscle spindle did not contract and relax along In part A, the muscle spindle reflex of the excited muscle with the large muscle fibers, the receptor portion of the is intact. Note that the contraction is relatively smooth, spindle would sometimes be flail and sometimes be over- even though the motor nerve to the muscle is excited at stretched, in neither instance operating under optimal a slow frequency of only eight signals per second.
