Substances move through cell membrane including contractile filaments of actin and myosin. Once pores or, in the case of lipid- soluble substances, through the protein molecules have bound with the receptors, the the lipid matrix of the membrane. surface properties of the local membrane change in such Active transport involves actually carrying a substance a way that the entire pit invaginates inward, and fibrillar through the membrane by a physical protein structure proteins surrounding the invaginating pit cause its bor- that penetrates all the way through the membrane.
