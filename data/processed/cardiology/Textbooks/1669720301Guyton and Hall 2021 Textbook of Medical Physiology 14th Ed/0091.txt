These uses dria, which is why the mitochondria are called the power- of ATP are illustrated by the examples in Figure 2-16: houses of the cell. (1) to supply energy for the transport of sodium through the cell membrane; (2) to promote protein synthesis by LOCOMOTION OF CELLS the ribosomes; and (3) to supply the energy needed dur- ing muscle contraction. The most obvious type of movement in the body is that In addition to the membrane transport of sodium, which occurs in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, energy from ATP is required for the membrane transport which constitute almost 50% of the entire body mass. The of potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, chloride, specialized functions of these cells are discussed in Chapters urate, and hydrogen ions and many other ions, as well 6 through 9. Two other types of movement—ameboid loco- as various organic substances. Membrane transport is motion and ciliary movement—occur in other cells. so important to cell
