in accord with the body’s need for certain specific substances. The following experiments demonstrate this abil- ity of animals to choose food in accord with the needs of their bodies. First, adrenalectomized, salt- depleted Ventral posterior medial nucleus of animals automatically select drinking water with a high thalamus concentration of sodium chloride in preference to pure Geniculate water, and the amount of sodium chloride in the water Chorda ganglion Tongue tympani is often sufficient to supply the needs of the body and prevent death due to salt depletion. Second, an animal N. VII given injections of excessive amounts of insulin develops Nucleus of a depleted blood sugar level, and the animal automatically Glossopharyngeal N. IX solitary tract Petrosal chooses the sweetest food from among many samples. Gustatory ganglion area Third, calcium- depleted, parathyroidectomized animals N. X automatically choose drinking water with a high concen- tration of calcium chloride. Pharynx Nodose The same phenomena are also observed in everyday ganglion life. For example, the “salt licks” of desert regions are known to attract animals from far and wide. Also, human beings reject food that has an unpleasant affective sensa- Figure 54-2 .
