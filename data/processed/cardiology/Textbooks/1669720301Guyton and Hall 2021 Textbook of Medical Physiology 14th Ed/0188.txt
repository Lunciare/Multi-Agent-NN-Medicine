molecule is only 20% greater than that of water, yet its penetration through the cell membrane pores is about 1000 times less than that of water. Even so, given the astonishing rate of water pen- etration, this amount of urea penetration still allows rapid Potassium transport of urea through the membrane within minutes. ion DIFFUSION THROUGH PROTEIN PORES AND CHANNELS—SELECTIVE PERMEABILITY AND “GATING” OF CHANNELS Inside Computerized three- dimensional reconstructions of pro- Pore helix tein pores and channels have demonstrated tubular path- ways all the way from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid. Therefore, substances can move by simple diffusion directly along these pores and channels from one side of the membrane to the other. Figure 4-4. The structure of a potassium channel. The channel is com- posed of four subunits (only two of which are shown), each with two Pores are composed of integral cell membrane proteins transmembrane helices. A narrow selectivity filter is formed from the that form open tubes through the membrane and are always pore loops, and carbonyl oxygens line the walls of the selectivity filter, open. However, the diameter of a pore and its electrical forming sites for transiently binding dehydrated potassium ions. The in-
