equilibrium level. Even when determinants of the long- term arterial pressure level are the arterial pressure is only a few mm Hg greater than the as follows: equilibrium level, there still is slightly more loss of water 1. The degree of pressure shift of the renal output and salt than intake, so the pressure continues to fall that curve for water and salt last few mm Hg until the pressure eventually returns to the 2. The level of the water and salt intake equilibrium point. Operation of these two determinants in the control of If the arterial pressure falls below the equilibrium arterial pressure is demonstrated in Figure 19- 3. In Fig- point, the intake of water and salt is greater than the ure 19- 3A, some abnormality of the kidneys has caused 230 )lamron x( tuptuo dna ekatnI tuptuo caidraC tuptuo yranirU erusserp lairetrA )nim/lm( )nim/lm( )gH mm( Chapter 19 Role of the Kidneys in Long-T erm Control of Arterial Pressure and in Hypertension 8 8 Chronic Acute 6 High intake 6 B 4 4 Normal Elevated 2 pressure 2 Normal intake 0 A 0 50 100 150 200 250 A 0 0 50 100 150 200 Arterial pressure
