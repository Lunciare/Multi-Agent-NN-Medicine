The importance of all these areas is that vari- lateral geniculate nucleus. These signals remain separat- ous aspects of the visual image are progressively dissected ed from each other when they arrive in layer IV of the and analyzed. primary visual cortex. In fact, layer IV is interlaced with THE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX HAS SIX stripes of neuronal columns, with each stripe about 0.5 MAJOR LAYERS millimeter wide; the signals from one eye enter the col- umns of every other stripe, alternating with signals from Like almost all other portions of the cerebral cortex, the the second eye. This cortical area deciphers whether the primary visual cortex has six distinct layers, as shown in respective areas of the two visual images from the two Figure 52- 4. Also, as is true for the other sensory systems, separate eyes are “in register” with each other—that is, the geniculocalcarine fibers terminate mainly in layer IV, whether corresponding points from the two retinas fit but this layer is also organized into subdivisions.
