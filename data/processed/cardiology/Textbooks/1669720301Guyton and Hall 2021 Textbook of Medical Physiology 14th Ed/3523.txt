During the suc- O C COOH cessive stages of the citric acid cycle, several molecules of H C COOH water are added, as shown on the left in Figure 68-6 , and (Oxa2 loacetic acid) carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms are released at other Net reaction per molecule of glucose: stages in the cycle, as shown on the right in the figure. 2 Acetyl-CoA + 6H O + 2ADP 2 4CO + 16H + 2CoA + 2ATP The net results of the entire citric acid cycle are provided 2 in the explanation at the bottom of Figure 68- 6, demonstrat- Figure 68- 6. Chemical reactions of the citric acid cycle, showing the ing that for each molecule of glucose originally metabolized, 2 release of carbon dioxide and a number of hydrogen atoms during acetyl-C oA molecules enter into the citric acid cycle, along with the cycle. ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate. 6 molecules of water. These molecules are then degraded into 4 carbon dioxide molecules, 16 hydrogen atoms, and 2 molecules of coenzyme A. Two molecules of ATP are formed, as follows. of glucose metabolized, two acetyl-C oA molecules
