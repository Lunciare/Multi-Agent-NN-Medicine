pres- Molecular Basis of Gas Diffusion sure that each gas contributes to the total pressure in direct All the gases of concern in respiratory physiology are sim- proportion to its concentration. Therefore, 79% of the 760 ple molecules that are free to move among one another by mm Hg is caused by nitrogen (600 mm Hg) and 21% by diffusion. This is also true of gases dissolved in the fluids O 2 (160 mm Hg). Thus, the partial pressure of nitrogen in and tissues of the body. the mixture is 600 mm Hg, and the partial pressure of O 2 For diffusion to occur, there must be a source of energy. is 160 mm Hg; the total pressure is 760 mm Hg, the sum This source of energy is provided by the kinetic motion of the individual partial pressures.
