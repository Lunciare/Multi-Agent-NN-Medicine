This increased level of pumping is one of the most important factors in determining the runner’s running time. Factors That Cause a Hypereffective Heart Factors That Cause a Hypoeffective Heart Two general types of factors that can make the heart a stronger pump than normal are nervous stimulation and Any factor that decreases the heart’s ability to pump hypertrophy of the heart muscle. blood causes hypoeffectivity.
