that the others are not essen- tial in the diet because they can be synthesized in the body. Synthesis of the nonessential amino acids depends + NAD+ + H O mainly on the formation of appropriate α- keto acids, which 2 are the precursors of the respective amino acids. For ex- ample, pyruvic acid, which is formed in large quantities NADH + H+ + NH 3 during the glycolytic breakdown of glucose, is the keto acid precursor of the amino acid alanine. Then, by the process of transamination, an amino radical is transferred to the Note from this illustration that the amino group from α- keto acid, and the keto oxygen is transferred to the do- the amino acid is transferred to α- ketoglutaric acid, which nor of the amino radical. This reaction is shown in Figure then becomes glutamic acid. The glutamic acid can then 70- 3. Note that alanine is formed after the amino radical is transfer the amino group to other substances or release transferred to the pyruvic acid from glutamic acid. Amino it in the form of ammonia (NH ). In the process of losing 3 radicals can be transferred from asparagine, aspartic acid, the amino
