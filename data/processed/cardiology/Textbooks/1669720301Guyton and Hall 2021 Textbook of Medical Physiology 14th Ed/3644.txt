This impedance results in portal hypertension, with the hepatocytes are estimated to replicate once or twice, and capillary pressure in the intestinal wall increasing to 15 to after the original size and volume of the liver are achieved, 20 mm Hg above normal. If the obstruction is not relieved, the hepatocytes revert to their usual quiescent state. the patient may die within a few hours because of excessive Control of this rapid regeneration of the liver is not well loss of fluid from the capillaries into the lumens and walls understood, but hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) appears to of the intestines. be important in causing liver cell division and growth.

Because the is produced by mesenchymal cells in the liver and in other liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of blood can tissues, but not by hepatocytes.
