PRIMARY ACTIVE SECRETION OF H+ Instead, HCO 3− is reabsorbed by a special process in which IN THE INTERCALATED CELLS OF LATE it first combines with H+ to form H 2CO 3, which eventually DISTAL AND COLLECTING TUBULES becomes CO 2 and H 2O, as shown in Figure 31- 5. This reabsorption of HCO − is initiated by a reaction Beginning in the late distal tubules and continuing 3 in the tubules between HCO − filtered at the glomerulus through the remainder of the tubular system, the tubular 3 and H+ secreted by the tubular cells. The H CO formed epithelium secretes H+ by primary active transport. The 2 3 then dissociates into CO and H O. The CO can move characteristics of this transport are different from those 2 2 2 easily across the tubular membrane; therefore, it instantly
