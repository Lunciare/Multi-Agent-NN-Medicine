In the case of bacteria, chemicals, or any other factor—induces lysosomes to each bacterium is usually already attached to a specific rupture.

This is slight, only a portion of the cell is removed, and the cell intermediation of antibodies is called opsonization, which is then repaired. If the damage is severe, the entire cell is is discussed in Chapters 34 and 35. digested, a process called autolysis.
