with large increases in Changes in ANP levels help minimize changes in blood sodium intake, especially in salt- sensitive individu- volume during various disturbances, such as increased als; this mechanism raises sodium excretion through salt and water intake. However, excessive production pressure natriuresis. As discussed previously, if the of ANP or even complete lack of ANP does not cause nervous, hormonal, and intrarenal mechanisms are major changes in blood volume because these effects can operating effectively, measurable increases in blood be overcome by small changes in blood pressure, acting pressure may not occur, even with large increases through pressure natriuresis. For example, infusions of in sodium intake over several days. However, when large amounts of ANP initially raise urine output of salt high sodium intake is sustained for months or years, and water and cause slight decreases in blood volume. the kidneys may become damaged and less effective In less than 24 hours, this effect is overcome by a slight in excreting sodium, necessitating increased blood decrease in blood pressure that returns urine output pressure to maintain sodium balance through the toward normal, despite continued excess of ANP. pressure natriuresis mechanism. 399 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and
