Other types of cells can also move by ameboid ported by 11 microtubules—nine double tubules located locomotion under certain circumstances. For example, around the periphery of the cilium and two single tubules fibroblasts move into a damaged area to help repair the down the center, as demonstrated in the cross section damage, and even the germinal cells of the skin, although shown in Figure 2-18. Each cilium is an outgrowth of ordinarily completely sessile cells, move toward a cut area a structure that lies immediately beneath the cell mem- to repair the opening. Cell locomotion is also especially brane, called the basal body of the cilium. important in the development of the embryo and fetus The flagellum of a sperm is similar to a motile cilium; after fertilization of an ovum. For example, embryonic in fact, it has much the same type of structure and same cells often must migrate long distances from their sites type of contractile mechanism.
