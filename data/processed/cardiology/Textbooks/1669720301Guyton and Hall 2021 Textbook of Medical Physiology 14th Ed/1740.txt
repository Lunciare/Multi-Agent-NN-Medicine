The water reabsorption. Because renal tubular reabsorption of osmotic pressure of these solutes then reduces water many solutes, such as potassium, chloride, magnesium, reabsorption, flushing large amounts of tubular fluid into and calcium, is also influenced secondarily by sodium the urine. reabsorption, many diuretics raise the renal excretion of Large volumes of urine are also formed in certain these solutes as well. diseases associated with excess solutes that fail to be The most common clinical use of diuretics is to reduce reabsorbed from the tubular fluid. For example, when extracellular fluid volume, especially in diseases associated blood glucose concentration rises to high levels in diabe- with edema and in hypertension.
