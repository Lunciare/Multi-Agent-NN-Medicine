and the root, which is the portion The calcium salts in dentin make it extremely resistant within the bony socket of the jaw. The collar between the to compressional forces, and the collagen fibers make it 1006 Chapter 80 Parathyroid Hormone, Calcitonin, Calcium and Phosphate Metabolism, Vitamin D, Bone, and Teeth tough and resistant to tensional forces that might result when the teeth are struck by solid objects. Enamel organ of milk tooth Primordium of Cementum. Cementum is a bony substance secreted by enamel organ of cells of the periodontal membrane, which lines the tooth permanent tooth socket. Many collagen fibers pass directly from the bone of the jaw, through the periodontal membrane, and then into the cementum. These collagen fibers and the cemen- tum hold the tooth in place. When the teeth are exposed to excessive strain, the layer of cementum becomes thicker A Mesenchymal primordium of pulp and stronger. Also, it increases in thickness and strength with age, causing the teeth to become more firmly seated in the jaws by adulthood and later. Enamel Dentin Pulp. The pulp cavity of each tooth is filled with pulp, Oral epithelium which is composed of connective tissue with an abundant supply
