significant part 2 of the resistance to blood flow is in the upstream small Endothelial cells arteries. Soluble guanylate cyclase NO synthesis and release from endothelial cells are also stimulated by some vasoconstrictors, such as angio- cGTP cGMP tensin II, which bind to specific receptors on endothelial Relaxation cells. The increased NO release protects against excessive Vascular smooth muscle vasoconstriction. Figure 17- 6.
