The flow through the vessel can be calculated by the The overall blood flow in the total circulation of an following formula, which is called Ohm’s law: adult person at rest is about 5000 ml/min. This is called ∆P the cardiac output because it is the amount of blood F= R pumped into the aorta by the heart each minute. in which F is blood flow, ΔP is the pressure difference (P 1 Methods for Measuring Blood Flow.
