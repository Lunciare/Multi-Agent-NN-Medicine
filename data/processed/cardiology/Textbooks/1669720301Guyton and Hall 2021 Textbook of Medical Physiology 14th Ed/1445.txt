bances that would otherwise upset sodium and volume that two-thirds of the filtered water has been reabsorbed homeostasis. as the fluid passes through the proximal tubule. At the end of the collecting ducts, the tubular fluid/plasma inulin PERITUBULAR CAPILLARY AND RENAL concentration ratio rises to about 125 (see Figure 28-1 5), INTERSTITIAL FLUID PHYSICAL FORCES indicating that only 1/125 of the filtered water remains in the tubule and that more than 99% has been reabsorbed. Hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces govern the rate of reabsorption across the peritubular capillaries, just as they control filtration in the glomerular capillaries. Changes in REGULATION OF TUBULAR peritubular capillary reabsorption can in turn influence REABSORPTION the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures of the renal Because it is essential to maintain a precise balance interstitium and, ultimately, reabsorption of water and between tubular reabsorption and glomerular filtration, solutes from the renal tubules. there are multiple nervous, hormonal, and local control Normal Values for Physical Forces and Reabsorption mechanisms that regulate tubular reabsorption, just as Rate. As the glomerular filtrate passes through the renal there are for control of glomerular filtration. An impor- tubules, more than 99% of the water and most of the sol- tant
