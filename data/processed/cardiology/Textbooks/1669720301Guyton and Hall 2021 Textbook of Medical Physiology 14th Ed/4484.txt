Ordinarily, the infant’s weight de- creases 5% to 10% and sometimes as much as 20% within 2 2 the first 2 to 3 days of life. Most of this weight loss is loss of fluid rather than of body solids. 1 1 Bilirubin 0 0 Special Functional Problems in the Neonate 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 An important characteristic of the neonate is instability of Age (weeks) the various hormonal and neurogenic control systems.
