For each NH 4+ GENERATION OF NEW HCO − BY excreted, a new HCO 3− is formed in the tubular cells and returned 3 to the blood. AMMONIA BUFFER SYSTEM A second buffer system in the tubular fluid that is even urine and two HCO − are reabsorbed into the blood. The 3 more important quantitatively than the phosphate buffer HCO − generated by this process constitutes new HCO −. 3 3 system is composed of ammonia (NH ) and the ammo- In the collecting tubules, the addition of NH + to the 3 4 nium ion (NH 4+). Ammonium ion is synthesized from tubular fluids occurs through a different mechanism (Fig- glutamine, which comes mainly from metabolism of ure 31- 9). Here, H+ is actively secreted by the tubular amino acids in the liver. The glutamine delivered to the membrane into the lumen, where it combines with NH 3 kidneys is transported into epithelial cells of the proximal to form NH +, which is then excreted.
