to the concept called expiratory airflow of more than 400 L/min. However, maximum expiratory flow, which can be defined as fol- regardless of how much additional expiratory effort the lows. When a person expires with great force, the expi- person exerts, this is still the maximum flow rate that he ratory airflow reaches a maximum flow beyond which or she can achieve. the flow cannot be increased any more, even with greatly Note also that as the lung volume becomes smaller, increased additional force. This is the maximum expira- the maximum expiratory flow rate also becomes less. The tory flow. The maximum expiratory flow is much greater main reason for this phenomenon is that in the enlarged when the lungs are filled with a large volume of air than lung, the bronchi and bronchioles are held open partially when they are almost empty. These principles can be by way of elastic pull on their outsides by lung structural understood by referring to Figure 43- 1. elements. However, as the lung becomes smaller, these Figure 43- 1A shows the effect of increased pressure structures are relaxed so that the bronchi and bronchioles applied to the outsides of the alveoli and air
