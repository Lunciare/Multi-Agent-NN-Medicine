Neck Osteoporosis—Decreased Bone Matrix Pulp chamber Osteoporosis is the most common of all bone diseases in adults, especially in old age. It is different from osteomala- cia and rickets because it results from diminished organic bone matrix rather than from poor bone calcification. In Dentin persons with osteoporosis the osteoblastic activity in the Root bone is usually less than normal, and consequently the rate of bone osteoid deposition is depressed. Occasionally, however, as in hyperparathyroidism, the cause of the di- Cementum minished bone is excess osteoclastic activity. The many common causes of osteoporosis are the following: (1) lack of physical stress on the bones because of inactivity; (2) malnutrition to the extent that suffi- cient protein matrix cannot be formed; (3) lack of vita- min C, which is necessary for secretion of intercellular Figure 80- 15.
