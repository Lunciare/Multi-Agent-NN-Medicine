Fast pain fibers fibers Glutamate, the Probable Neurotransmitter of the Reticular Type Aδ Fast Pain Fibers. It is believed that glutamate formation is the neurotransmitter substance secreted in the spinal cord at the type Aδ pain nerve fiber endings. Glutamate is one of the most widely used excitatory transmitters in the central nervous system, usually having a duration of action lasting for only a few milliseconds.
