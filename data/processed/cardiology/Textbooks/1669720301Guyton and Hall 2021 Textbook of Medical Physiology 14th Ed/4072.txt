pituitary adenoma Effects of Cushing’s Syndrome on Carbohydrate and or to hypothalamic- pituitary dysfunction, low doses of Protein Metabolism. The abundance of cortisol secreted dexamethasone usually do not suppress ACTH secretion in Cushing’s syndrome can increase blood glucose con- normally. By increasing the dose of dexamethasone to centration, sometimes to values as high as 200 mg/dl af- very high levels, ACTH eventually can be suppressed in ter meals—as much as twice normal. This increase results most patients with Cushing’s disease. In contrast, patients mainly from enhanced gluconeogenesis and decreased glu- with primary adrenal overproduction of cortisol (ACTH- cose utilization by the tissues. 970 Chapter 78 Adrenocortical Hormones The effects of glucocorticoids on protein catabolism are of- ten profound in Cushing’s syndrome, causing greatly decreased tissue proteins almost everywhere in the body with the excep- tion of the liver; the plasma proteins also remain unaffected. The loss of protein from the muscles in particular causes severe weakness. The loss of protein synthesis in the lymphoid tissues leads to a suppressed immune system, and thus these patients are highly susceptible to infections. Even the protein collagen fibers in the subcutaneous tissue are diminished so that the subcutaneous tissues tear easily, resulting in
