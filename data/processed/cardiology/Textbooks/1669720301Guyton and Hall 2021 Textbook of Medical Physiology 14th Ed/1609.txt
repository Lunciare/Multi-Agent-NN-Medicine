This mechanism is the same increases in arterial pressure cause much greater increases in sodium mechanism discussed in Chapter 19 for arterial pressure output than those measured during acute increases in arterial pres- control. The extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, sure. cardiac output, arterial pressure, and urine output are all controlled at the same time as separate parts of this basic water excretion. When
