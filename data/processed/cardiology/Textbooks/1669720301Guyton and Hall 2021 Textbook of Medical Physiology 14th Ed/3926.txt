It is known in turn, promotes synthesis of new proteins while at the same that GH secretion is controlled by two factors secreted time conserving the proteins already present in the cells. in the hypothalamus and then transported to the anterior pituitary gland through the hypothalamic- hypophysial Abnormalities of Growth Hormone Secretion portal vessels. They are growth hormone–releasing hor- mone (GHRH) and growth hormone inhibitory hormone Panhypopituitarism—Decreased Secretion of All Ante- (also called somatostatin). Both of these are polypeptides; rior Pituitary Hormones. Decreased secretion of all anterior GHRH is composed of 44 amino acids, and somatostatin pituitary hormones in patients with panhypopituitarism is composed of 14 amino acids. may be congenital (present from birth), or it may occur sud- denly or slowly at any time during life, most often resulting Neurons in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei of from a pituitary tumor that destroys the pituitary gland. the hypothalamus secrete GHRH; this is the same area Panhypopituitarism in the Adult. Panhypopituitarism of the hypothalamus that is sensitive to blood glucose first occurring in adulthood generally results from one concentration, causing satiety in hyperglycemic states of three abnormalities.
