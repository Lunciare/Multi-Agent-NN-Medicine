B, After The short time that the acetylcholine remains in the acetylcholine (Ach) has become attached and a conformational change synaptic space—a few milliseconds at most—normally has opened the channel, allowing sodium ions to enter the muscle fiber and excite contraction. Note the negative charges at the channel is sufficient to excite the muscle fiber. Then the rapid mouth that prevent passage of negative ions such as chloride ions. removal of the acetylcholine prevents continued muscle re- excitation after the muscle fiber has recovered from its In practice, far more sodium ions flow through the initial action potential. acetylcholine- gated channels than any other ions for two reasons.
