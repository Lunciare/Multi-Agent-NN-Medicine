area of permanent depolarization I in the injured base of the left ventricle. Thus, repolariza- +− 0 0 tion causes a return of the current of injury in each lead, as noted at the far right in Figure 12-17. J point J point THE J POINT IS THE ZERO REFERENCE III POTENTIAL FOR ANALYZING CURRENT OF INJURY 0 +− 0 One might think that the ECG machines could determine when no current is flowing around the heart. However, III − many stray currents exist in the body, such as currents resulting from skin potentials and from differences in ionic concentrations in different fluids of the body. There- fore, when two electrodes are connected between the I− +I arms or between an arm and a leg, these stray currents make it impossible to predetermine the exact zero refer- ence level in the ECG. + For these reasons, the following procedure must be III used to determine the zero potential level: First, one notes Figure 12-18 J point as the zero reference potential of the electro- the exact point at which the wave of depolarization just cardiograms for leads I and III. Also, the method for plotting the axis completes its passage
