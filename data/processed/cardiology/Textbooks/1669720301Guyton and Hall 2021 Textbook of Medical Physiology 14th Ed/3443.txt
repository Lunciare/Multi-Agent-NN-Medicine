B, Cross section showing a basement membrane beneath the epithelial cells and a brush border at the other ends of these cells. 827 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology this; each day as much as several kilograms of carbohy- drates, 500 grams of fat, 500 to 700 grams of proteins, and 20 or more liters of water can be absorbed. The large Brush border intestine can absorb still more water and ions, although it can absorb very few nutrients. Pinocytic ISOSMOTIC ABSORPTION OF WATER vesicles Endoplasmic Water is transported through the intestinal membrane reticulum entirely by diffusion. Furthermore, this diffusion obeys the usual laws of osmosis. Therefore, when the chyme is dilute Mitochondria enough, water is absorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the blood of the villi almost entirely by osmosis. Figure 66- 7. Brush border of a gastrointestinal epithelial cell, also Conversely, water can also be transported in the oppo- showing absorbed pinocytic vesicles, mitochondria, and endoplasmic site direction—from plasma into the chyme. This type of reticulum lying immediately beneath the brush border. (Courtesy Dr. transport occurs especially when hyperosmotic solutions William Lockwood.) are discharged from the stomach into the duodenum. Within minutes, sufficient water usually will be transferred
