Rapid reaction of the adrenal cortex of a rat to stress caused by fracture of the tibia and fibula at time zero. (In the rat, discuss in Chapter 79. Nevertheless, the increased use of corticosterone is secreted in place of cortisol.) fatty acids for metabolic energy is an important factor for long- term conservation of body glucose and glycogen. Even though cortisol secretion often increases greatly Excess Cortisol Causes Obesity. Although cortisol can in stressful situations, we are not sure why this is of signif- cause a moderate degree of fatty acid mobilization from icant benefit to the animal. One possibility is that the glu- adipose tissue, a peculiar type of obesity develops in many cocorticoids cause rapid mobilization of amino acids and people with excess cortisol secretion, with excess deposi-
