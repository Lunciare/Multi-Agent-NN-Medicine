The maculae do not operate for the detection of linear velocity. When runners first begin to run, they must lean far forward to keep from falling backward because of initial acceleration, but once they have achieved running speed, if they were running in a vacuum, they would not have to lean forward. When running in air, they lean forward to maintain equilibrium only because of air resistance against their bodies; in this case, it is not the maculae that make them lean but air pressure acting on pressure end-o rgans Cupula in the skin, which initiate appropriate equilibrium adjust- Cristae ments to prevent falling. Ampulla ampullaris DETECTION OF HEAD ROTATION BY THE SEMICIRCULAR DUCTS When the head suddenly begins to rotate in any direc- tion (called angular acceleration), the endolymph in the semicircular ducts, because of its inertia, tends to remain Hair cells stationary while the semicircular ducts turn. This mecha- Nerve nism causes relative fluid flow in the ducts in the direction opposite to head rotation.
