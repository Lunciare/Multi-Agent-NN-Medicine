Any circula- ally is defined as faster than 100 beats/min in an adult. An tory reflex that stimulates the vagus nerves causes release electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded from a patient with of acetylcholine at the vagal endings in the heart, resulting tachycardia is shown in Figure 13-1. This ECG is normal in a parasympathetic effect.

In these patients, the pressure receptors min instead of the normal 72 beats/min. Some causes of (baroreceptors) in the carotid sinus region of the carotid tachycardia include increased body temperature, dehy- artery walls are excessively sensitive.
