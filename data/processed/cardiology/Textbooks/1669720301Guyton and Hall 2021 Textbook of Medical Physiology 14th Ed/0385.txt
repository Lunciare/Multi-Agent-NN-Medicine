Excitation- contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. The top panel shows an action potential in the transverse tubule that causes a conformational change in the voltage- sensing dihydropyridine (DHP) receptors, opening the ryanodine (RyR) Ca2+ release channels in the ter- minal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and permitting Ca2+ to diffuse rapidly into the sarcoplasm and initiate muscle contraction. During repolarization (bottom panel), the conformational change in the DHP receptor closes the Ca2+ release channels, and
