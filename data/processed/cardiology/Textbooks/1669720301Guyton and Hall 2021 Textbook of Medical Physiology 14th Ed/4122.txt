been exhausted that is opposite to that of insulin. under the influence of glucagon, continued infusion of Like insulin, glucagon is a large polypeptide. It has a this hormone still causes continued hyperglycemia. This molecular weight of 3485 and is composed of a chain of hyperglycemia results from the effect of glucagon to 29 amino acids. Upon injection of purified glucagon into increase the rate of amino acid uptake by the liver cells an animal, a profound hyperglycemic effect occurs. Only and then the conversion of many of the amino acids to 1 μg/kg of glucagon can elevate the blood glucose con- glucose by gluconeogenesis. This effect is achieved by centration approximately 20 mg/100 ml of blood (a 25% activating multiple enzymes that are required for amino increase) in about 20 minutes. For this reason, glucagon is acid transport and gluconeogenesis, especially activation also called the hyperglycemic hormone. of the enzyme system for converting pyruvate to phos- phoenolpyruvate, a rate- limiting step in gluconeogenesis. EFFECTS ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM Other Effects of Glucagon The major effects of glucagon on glucose metabolism Most other effects of glucagon occur only when its con- are (1) breakdown of liver glycogen (glycogenolysis) and centration rises
