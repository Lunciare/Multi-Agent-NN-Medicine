different types of enteric neurons, including mainly with controlling muscle activity along the length the following: (1) acetylcholine, (2) norepinephrine, (3) of the gut. When this plexus is stimulated, its principal adenosine triphosphate, (4) serotonin, (5) dopamine, (6) effects are as follows: (1) increased tonic contraction, or cholecystokinin, (7) substance P, (8) vasoactive intestinal “tone,” of the gut wall; (2) increased intensity of the rhyth- polypeptide, (9) somatostatin, (10) leu- enkephalin, (11) mic contractions; (3) slightly increased rate of the rhythm met- enkephalin, (12) bombesin, (13) neuropeptide Y, and of contraction; and (4) increased velocity of conduction (14) nitric oxide. The specific functions of many of these of excitatory waves along the gut wall, causing more rapid substances are not known well enough to justify discussion movement of the gut peristaltic waves. here other than to point out the following characteristics. The myenteric plexus should not be considered entirely Acetylcholine most often excites gastrointestinal activ- excitatory because some of its neurons are inhibitory; their ity. Norepinephrine almost always inhibits gastrointestinal fiber endings secrete an inhibitory transmitter, possibly activity, as does epinephrine, which reaches the gastro- vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or some other inhibitory intestinal tract mainly via the blood after it
