way. Although the rate of simple dif- fusion through an open channel increases proportionately with the concentration of the diffusing substance, in facili- tated diffusion the rate of diffusion approaches a maximum, called V , as the concentration of the diffusing substance max increases. This difference between simple diffusion and facil- itated diffusion is demonstrated in Figure 4-7. The figure shows that as the concentration of the diffusing substance increases, the rate of simple diffusion continues to increase Membrane proportionately but, in the case of facilitated diffusion, the “patch” rate of diffusion cannot rise higher than the V level. max What is it that limits the rate of facilitated diffusion? A B probable answer is the mechanism illustrated in Figure Figure 4-6. A, Recording of current flow through a single voltage- 4-8.
