Although the mechanisms responsible for their principal sites of action on the renal tubule, and their this effect are not fully understood, they include a cascade effects on solute and water excretion. Some of these hor- of physical factors, as well as paracrine and hormonal mones are discussed in more detail in Chapters 29 and effects.
