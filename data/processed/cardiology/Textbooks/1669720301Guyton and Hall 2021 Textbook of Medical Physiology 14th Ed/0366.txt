weight of approximately 275,000. The fetal acetylcholine receptor complex is composed of Basal lamina and five subunit proteins, two alpha proteins and one each of acetylcholinesterase beta, delta, and gamma proteins. In the adult, an epsilon protein substitutes for the gamma protein in this recep- Acetylcholine receptors tor complex. These protein molecules penetrate all the way through the membrane, lying side by side in a circle to form a tubular channel, illustrated in Figure 7-3. The Subneural cleft channel remains constricted, as shown in part A of the Voltage-activated Na+ channels figure, until two acetylcholine molecules attach respec- tively to the two alpha subunit proteins. This attachment causes a conformational change that opens the channel, Muscle as shown in part B of the figure. membrane The acetylcholine-g ated channel has a diameter of Figure 7-2. Release of acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles at the about 0.65 nanometer, which is large enough to allow the neural membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Note the proximity of the release sites in the neural membrane to the acetylcholine recep- important positive ions—sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), tors in the muscle membrane at the mouths of the subneural clefts. and calcium (Ca2+)—to move easily through the opening.
