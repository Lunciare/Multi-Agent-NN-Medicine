in many tissues with mainly by venous contraction. These effects, working consequent stimulatory effects on the circulation; (2) together, almost always increase the arterial pressure dur- increase in arterial pressure; and (3) increase in cardiac ing exercise. This increase can be as little as 20 mm Hg output. or as much as 80 mm Hg, depending on the conditions 260 Chapter 21 Muscle Blood Flow and Cardiac Output During Exercise under which the exercise is performed. When a person 25 performs exercise under tense conditions but uses only B 20 a few muscles, the sympathetic nervous response still occurs. In the few active muscles, vasodilation occurs, but 15 elsewhere in the body the effect is mainly vasoconstric- tion, often increasing the mean arterial pressure to as high 10 as 170 mm Hg. Such a condition might occur in a person standing on a ladder and nailing with a hammer on the 5 A ceiling above. The tenseness of the situation is obvious. Conversely, when a person performs massive whole-b ody 0 exercise, such as running or swimming, the increase in arte- (cid:31)4 0 +4 +8 +12 +16 +20 +24 rial pressure is often only 20 to 40 mm Hg.
