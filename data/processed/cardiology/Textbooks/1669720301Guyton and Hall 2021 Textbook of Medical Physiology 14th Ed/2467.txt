involved. As long as this potential lasts, it can continue to excite the neuron, causing it to transmit a continuous train of output impulses, as was explained in Chapter 46. Thus, as a result of this synaptic afterdischarge mecha- nism alone, it is possible for a single instantaneous input signal to cause a sustained signal output (a series of re- Inhibition petitive discharges) lasting for many milliseconds. D Reverberatory (Oscillatory) Circuit as a Cause of Input Output Signal Prolongation. One of the most important of all circuits in the entire nervous system is the reverberatory or oscillatory circuit. Such circuits are caused by positive feedback within the neuronal circuit that feeds back to re- excite the input of the same circuit. Consequently, once stimulated, the circuit may discharge repetitively for a long time. Several possible varieties of reverberatory circuits are shown in Figure 47- 14. The simplest, shown in Figure Figure 47- 14 A–D, Reverberatory circuits of increasing complexity. 47- 14A, involves only a single neuron. In this case, the output neuron sends a collateral nerve fiber back to its own dendrites or soma to restimulate itself. Although the importance of this type of circuit is not clear, theo- retically,
