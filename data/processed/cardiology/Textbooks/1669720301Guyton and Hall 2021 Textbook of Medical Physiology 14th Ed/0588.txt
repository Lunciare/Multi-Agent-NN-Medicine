In lead II, the record is above the line because Then, for analysis of the electrical axis of the injury the projected vector points more toward the positive ter- potential caused by a current of injury, a horizontal line minal of the lead. In lead III, the projected vector points is drawn in the ECG for each lead at the level of the J in the same direction as the positive terminal of lead III so point. This horizontal line is then the zero potential level that the record is positive. Furthermore, because the vec- in the ECG from which all potentials caused by currents tor lies almost exactly in the direction of the axis of lead of injury must be measured. III, the voltage of the current of injury in lead III is much greater than in either lead I or lead II. Use of the J Point in Plotting Axis of Injury Potential. As the heart then proceeds through its normal process Figure 12-18 shows ECGs (leads I and III) from an in- of depolarization, the septum first becomes depolarized; jured heart. Both records show injury potentials. In other then the depolarization spreads down to the apex and
