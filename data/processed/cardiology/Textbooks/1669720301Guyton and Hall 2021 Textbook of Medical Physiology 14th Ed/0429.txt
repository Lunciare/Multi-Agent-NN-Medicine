In this pulling the base downward toward the apex during sys- chapter, we explain how the heart operates as a pump, tole (contraction). At the end of systole, the left ventricle beginning with the special features of cardiac muscle is similar to a loaded spring and recoils or untwists during (Video 9- 1). diastole (relaxation) to allow blood to enter the pumping chambers rapidly.
