Brown fat heat loss from the body and on heat production caused primarily by is richly supplied with sympathetic nerves that release muscle activity and shivering (in °C). This figure demonstrates the ex- tremely critical temperature level at which increased heat loss begins norepinephrine, which stimulates tissue expression of and heat production reaches a minimum stable level. mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1, also called thermogenin) and increases thermogenesis. pili muscles attached to the hair follicles to contract, Acclimatization greatly affects the intensity of chemi- which brings the hairs to an upright stance and pro- cal thermogenesis; some animals, such as rats, that have duces “goose bumps” on the skin at the base of the been exposed to a cold environment for several weeks hairs.
