Each branch spreads downward toward the apex of the .03 .16 ventricle, progressively dividing into smaller branches. These .05 branches, in turn, course sidewise around each ventricular .18 .21 chamber and back toward the base of the heart. The ends of .07 .17 the Purkinje fibers penetrate about one-third of the way into .19 .17 the muscle mass and finally become continuous with the car- diac muscle fibers. .18 The total elapsed time averages only 0.03 second from .21 the time the cardiac impulse enters the bundle branches in the ventricular septum until it reaches the termina- .20 tions of the Purkinje fibers. Therefore, once the cardiac Figure 10- 4 Transmission of the cardiac impulse through the heart, impulse enters the ventricular Purkinje conductive sys- showing the time of appearance (in fractions of a second after initial tem, it spreads almost immediately to the entire ventricu- appearance at the sinoatrial node) in different parts of the heart.
