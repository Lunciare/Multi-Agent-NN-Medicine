the renal tubules, where CO reacts with H O to form 2 2 H 2CO 3. All acids, including H 2CO 3, are ionized to some extent. H 2CO 3 ionizes weakly to form small amounts of H+ From mass balance considerations, the concentrations of and HCO 3−: H+ and HCO 3− are proportional to the concentration of H 2CO 3← → H++HCO 3− H 2CO 3: H 2CO 3← → H++HCO 3− The second component of the system, bicarbonate salt, occurs predominantly as NaHCO in the extracellular For any acid, the concentration of the acid relative to its 3 fluid. NaHCO ionizes almost completely to form HCO − dissociated ions is defined by the dissociation constant, K′. 3 3 and Na+, as follows: H+×HCO − K′= 3 NaHCO 3 ←→Na++HCO 3− H 2CO 3 (1) Now, putting the entire system together, we have the This equation indicates that in an H CO solution, the 2 3 following: amount of free H+ is equal to HCO CO 2+H 2O←  →H 2CO 3← → H++HCO 3− H+ =K′× HC2 O 33 − (2) + Na+ The concentration of undissociated H CO cannot 2 3 be measured in solution because it
