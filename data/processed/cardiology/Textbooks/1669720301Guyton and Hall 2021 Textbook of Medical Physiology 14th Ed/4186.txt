The continual PTH binds to receptors on the adjacent osteoblasts, deposition and resorption of bone have several impor- stimulating synthesis of RANKL, which is also called tant functions. First, bone ordinarily adjusts its strength osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL). RANKL binds to its in proportion to the degree of bone stress. Consequently, receptors (RANK) on preosteoclast cells, causing them bones thicken when subjected to heavy loads.
