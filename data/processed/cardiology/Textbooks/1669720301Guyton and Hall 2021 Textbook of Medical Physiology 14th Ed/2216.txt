The neurons of the ventral respiratory group re- main almost totally inactive during normal quiet Up to this point, we have discussed the basic mechanisms respiration. Therefore, normal quiet breathing is for causing inspiration and expiration, but it is also impor- caused only by repetitive inspiratory signals from tant to know how the intensity of the respiratory control the dorsal respiratory group transmitted mainly to signals is increased or decreased to match the ventilatory the diaphragm, and expiration results from elastic needs of the body. For example, during heavy exercise, recoil of the lungs and thoracic cage. the rates of oxygen (O ) usage and carbon dioxide (CO ) 2 2 532 Chapter 42 Regulation of Respiration formation are often increased to as much as 20 times normal, requiring commensurate increases in pulmonary ventilation. The major purpose of the rest of this chapter Chemosensitive area is to discuss this control of ventilation in accord with the respiratory needs of the body.
