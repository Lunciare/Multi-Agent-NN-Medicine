For instance, the dorsal spi- to the muscle tension (the static response). Thus, Golgi nocerebellar tracts carry instantaneous information from tendon organs provide the nervous system with instanta- the muscle spindles and the Golgi tendon organs directly neous information on the degree of tension in each small to the cerebellum at conduction velocities approaching segment of each muscle. 120 m/sec, the most rapid conduction anywhere in the Transmission of Impulses From the Tendon Organ brain or spinal cord. Additional pathways transmit similar Into the Central Nervous System. Signals from the information into the reticular regions of the brain stem tendon organ are transmitted through large, rapidly con- and, to a lesser extent, all the way to the motor areas of the ducting type Ib nerve fibers that average 16 micrometers cerebral cortex.
