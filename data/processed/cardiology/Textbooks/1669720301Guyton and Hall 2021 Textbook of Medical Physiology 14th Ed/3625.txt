protein. With- Acids. Deamination occurs mainly by transamination, in a few days, or sometimes within hours, the amino acids which means transfer of the amino group to some accep- of administered protein are distributed throughout the cells tor substance. This process is the reverse of the process for of the body to form new proteins as needed. Essential and Nonessential Amino Acids. Ten of the synthesis of amino acids, which was previously explained. The greatest amount of deamination occurs according amino acids normally present in animal proteins can be to the following transamination schema: synthesized in the cells, whereas the other 10 either cannot be synthesized or are synthesized in quantities too small to (cid:31)-Ketoglutaric acid + Amino acid supply the body’s needs. This second group of amino ac- ids that cannot be synthesized is called the essential amino acids. Use of the word “essential” does not mean that the other 10 “nonessential” amino acids are not required for the Glutamic acid + (cid:31)-Keto acid formation of proteins but only that the others are not essen- tial in the diet because they can be synthesized in the body. Synthesis of the nonessential amino acids depends + NAD+ + H O
