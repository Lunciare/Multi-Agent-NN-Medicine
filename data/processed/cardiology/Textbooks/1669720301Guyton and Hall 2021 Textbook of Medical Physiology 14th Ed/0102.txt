As a bular epithelial cells are thought to contribute to various result, the fluid is continually propelled in the direction of disorders, including the development of large fluid-fi lled the fast-f orward stroke. Because most motile ciliated cells cysts, a condition called polycystic kidney disease. have large numbers of cilia on their surfaces, and because all the cilia are oriented in the same direction, this is an Bibliography effective means for moving fluids from one part of the surface to another.
