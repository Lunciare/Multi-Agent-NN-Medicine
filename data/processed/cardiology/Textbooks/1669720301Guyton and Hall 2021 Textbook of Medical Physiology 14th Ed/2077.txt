Bronchial Vessels. Blood also flows to the lungs through terminal bronchioles), supporting tissues of the lung, and small bronchial arteries that originate from the systemic outer coats (adventitia) of the pulmonary arteries and circulation, amounting to 1% to 2% of the total cardiac veins. The bronchial arteries, which are branches of the output. This bronchial arterial blood is oxygenated blood, thoracic aorta, supply most of this systemic arterial blood in contrast to the partially deoxygenated blood in the pul- at a pressure that is only slightly lower than the aortic monary arteries. It supplies the supporting tissues of the pressure. lungs, including the connective tissue, septa, and large The low- pressure, high- flow circulation supplies venous and small bronchi. After this bronchial and arterial blood blood from all parts of the body to the alveolar capillar- passes through the supporting tissues, it empties into the ies where oxygen (O ) is added and carbon dioxide (CO ) 2 2 pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium, rather than is removed.
