monoglycerides; (2) cho- The basic steps in the cellular mechanism for secreting lesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol sodium bicarbonate solution into the pancreatic ductules esters; and (3) phospholipase, which splits fatty acids from and ducts, shown in Figure 65- 8, are as follows: phospholipids. 1. Carbon dioxide diffuses to the interior of the cell When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the from the blood and, under the influence of carbonic proteolytic digestive enzymes are in their enzymatically anhydrase, combines with water to form carbonic inactive forms—trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and pro- acid (H CO ). The carbonic acid dissociates into 2 3 carboxypolypeptidase. They become activated only after HCO − and H+. Additional HCO − enters the cell 3 3 they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen through the basolateral membrane by co- transport is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is with Na+. The HCO − is then exchanged for Cl− by 3 secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in secondary active transport through the luminal 815 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Blood Interstitial Pancreatic duct cell Lumen 3.
