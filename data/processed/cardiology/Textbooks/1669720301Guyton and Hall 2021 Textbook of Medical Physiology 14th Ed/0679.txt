recording systems, pres- BLOOD PRESSURE sure cycles up to 500 cycles/sec have been recorded accu- Standard Units of Pressure. Blood pressure almost al- rately. In common use are recorders capable of registering pressure changes that occur as rapidly as 20 to 100 cycles/ ways is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) sec in the manner shown on the recorder in Figure 14-7C. because the mercury manometer has been used as the standard reference for measuring pressure since its inven- tion in 1846 by Poiseuille. Actually, blood pressure means the force exerted by the blood against any unit area of the vessel wall. If the pressure in a vessel is 100 mm Hg, this A means that the force exerted is sufficient to push a col- umn of mercury against gravity up to a level 50 millim- eters high. Occasionally, pressure is measured in centimeters of water (cm H 2O). A pressure of 10 cm H 2O means a pres- B sure sufficient to raise a column of water against gravity to a height of 10 centimeters. One millimeter of mercury pressure equals 1.36 centimeters of water pressure because the specific gravity of mercury is 13.6 times that of water,
