ASSOCIATION AREAS Parieto- Occipitotemporal Association Area Figure 58-4 also shows several large areas of the cerebral cortex that do not fit into the rigid categories of primary The parieto-o ccipitotemporal association area lies in the and secondary motor and sensory areas. These areas are large parietal and occipital cortical space bounded by the called association areas because they receive and analyze somatosensory cortex anteriorly, the visual cortex posteri- signals simultaneously from multiple regions of both the orly, and the auditory cortex laterally. As would be expected, motor and sensory cortices, as well as from subcortical it provides a high level of interpretative meaning for signals from all the surrounding sensory areas. However, even the parieto-o ccipitotemporal association area has its own Supplemental Primary motor Primary somatic and premotor Secondary somatic functional subareas, which are shown in Figure 58- 5.
