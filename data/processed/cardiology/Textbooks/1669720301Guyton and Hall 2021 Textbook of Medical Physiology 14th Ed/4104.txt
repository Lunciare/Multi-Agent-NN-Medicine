These METABOLISM AND GROWTH free fatty acids then become the main energy substrate used Insulin Promotes Protein Synthesis and by essentially all tissues of the body except the brain. Storage Figure 79- 5 shows the effect of a lack of insulin on the plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, glucose, Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are stored in the tissues and acetoacetic acid. Note that almost immediately after during the few hours after a meal when excess quantities removal of the pancreas, the free fatty acid concentration of nutrients are available in the circulating blood; insulin in the plasma begins to rise, more rapidly even than the is required for this storage to occur. The manner in which concentration of glucose. insulin causes protein storage is not as well understood as the mechanisms for both glucose and fat storage. Here are Insulin Deficiency Increases Plasma Cholesterol and some of the facts: Phospholipid Concentrations. The excess of fatty ac- 1.
