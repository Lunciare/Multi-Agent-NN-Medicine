The functions of insulin and its control of carbohydrate metabolism are discussed in detail in Chapter 79. Cell membrane Phosphorylation of Glucose Glycogen Immediately upon entry into the cells, glucose combines Uridine diphosphate glucose (phosphorylase) with a phosphate radical in accordance with the following reaction: GlucoseGlucokinaseorhexokinase→Glucose-6-phossphate +ATP Glucose-1-phosphate This phosphorylation is promoted mainly by the enzyme glucokinase in the liver and by hexokinase in most other (glucokinase) cells. The phosphorylation of glucose is almost completely Blood Glucose-6-phosphate glucose irreversible except in liver cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, (phosphatase) and intestinal epithelial cells; in these cells, another enzyme, glucose phosphatase, is also available, and when activated, it can reverse the reaction. In most tissues of the body, phos- Glycolysis phorylation serves to capture the glucose in the cell. That is, Figure 68- 4.
