30%, as occurs in skeletal muscle. dense bodies; the ends of these filaments overlap a myosin Comparison of Smooth Muscle filament located midway between the dense bodies. This Contraction and Skeletal Muscle contractile unit is similar to the contractile unit of skeletal Contraction muscle, but without the regularity of the skeletal muscle structure. In fact, the dense bodies of smooth muscle Although most skeletal muscles contract and relax rap- serve the same role as the Z disks in skeletal muscle. idly, most smooth muscle contraction is prolonged tonic Another difference is that most of the myosin filaments contraction, sometimes lasting hours or even days. have “side polar” cross-b ridges arranged so that the bridges Therefore, it is to be expected that both the physical and on one side hinge in one direction, and those on the other chemical characteristics of smooth muscle versus skeletal side hinge in the opposite direction. This configuration muscle contraction would differ. Some of the differences allows the myosin to pull an actin filament in one direction are noted in the following sections. 102 Chapter 8 Excitation and Contraction of Smooth Muscle Slow Cycling of the Myosin Cross-B ridges. The rapid- longed period of attachment of
