This ratio of carbon dioxide output to oxygen a person’s diet contains an abundance of carbohydrates and usage is called the respiratory quotient, so the respiratory fats, almost all the body’s energy is derived from these two quotient for carbohydrates is 1.0. substances, and little is derived from proteins. Therefore, When fat is oxidized in the body’s cells, an average of 70 carbohydrates and fats are said to be protein sparers. Con- carbon dioxide molecules are formed for each 100 mole- versely, in the state of starvation, after the carbohydrates cules of oxygen consumed. The respiratory quotient for the and fats have been depleted, the body’s protein stores are metabolism of fat therefore averages 0.70. When proteins consumed rapidly for energy, sometimes at rates approach- are oxidized by the cells, the average respiratory quotient ing several hundred grams per day rather than the normal is 0.80.
