Furthermore, the rate of current flow ance. The following simple and rapid methods have been through the electrode will be directly proportional to developed to make these measurements within minutes, the concentration of O (and therefore to PO as well). 2 2 using no more than a few drops of blood. In practice, a negative platinum electrode with a sur- face area of about 1 square millimeter is used, and this Determination of Blood pH. Blood pH is measured us- electrode is separated from the blood by a thin plastic ing a glass pH electrode of the type commonly used in membrane that allows diffusion of O but not diffusion 2 chemical laboratories. However, the electrodes used for of proteins or other substances that will “poison” the this purpose are miniaturized. The voltage generated by electrode. the glass electrode is a direct measure of pH and is gener- Often, all three of the measuring devices for pH, CO , 2 ally read directly from a voltmeter scale, or it is recorded and Po are built into the same apparatus, and all these 2 on a chart. measurements can be made within a minute or so using a single droplet- sized
