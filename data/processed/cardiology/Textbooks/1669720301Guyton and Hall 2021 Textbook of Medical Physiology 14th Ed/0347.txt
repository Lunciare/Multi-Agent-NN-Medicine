all body movements are caused by simultaneous contrac- tion of agonist and antagonist muscles on opposite sides of joints. This process is called coactivation of the agonist and antagonist muscles, and it is controlled by the motor control centers of the brain and spinal cord. The position of each separate part of the body, such as Biceps muscle an arm or a leg, is determined by the relative degrees of con- traction of the agonist and antagonist sets of muscles. For example, let us assume that an arm or a leg is to be placed in Lever a midrange position. To achieve this position, agonist and antagonist muscles are excited to about an equal degree. Remember that an elongated muscle contracts with more force than does a shortened muscle, which was illustrated in Figure 6-10, showing maximum strength of contraction at full functional muscle length and almost no strength of contraction at half- normal length. Therefore, the elongated Fulcrum Load muscle on one side of a joint can contract with far greater Figure 6-16 Lever system activated by the biceps muscle. force than the shorter muscle on the opposite side. As an arm or leg moves toward its midposition, the
