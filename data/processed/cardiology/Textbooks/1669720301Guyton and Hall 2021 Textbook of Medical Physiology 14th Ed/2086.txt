vasoconstriction is, if some alveoli are poorly ventilated and have a low O of adjacent arterioles and diverts blood flow to alveoli that are well 2 ventilated (bottom panel). concentration, the local vessels constrict. This constric- tion causes the blood to flow through other areas of the lungs that are better aerated, thus providing an automatic with decreasing pressure. For adequate aeration of the control system for distributing blood flow to the pulmo- blood to occur, the blood must be distributed to the seg- nary areas in proportion to their alveolar O pressures. ments of the lungs where the alveoli are best oxygenated. 2 This distribution is achieved by the following mechanism. EFFECT OF HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE Decreased Alveolar Oxygen Reduces Local Alveolar GRADIENTS IN THE LUNGS ON Blood Flow and Regulates Pulmonary Blood Flow REGIONAL PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW Distribution. When the concentration of O in the air 2 of the alveoli decreases below normal, especially when it In Chapter 15, we pointed out that the blood pressure in falls below 70% of normal (i.e., <73 mm Hg Po ), the ad- the foot of a standing person can be as much as 90 mm Hg 2 jacent blood vessels constrict
