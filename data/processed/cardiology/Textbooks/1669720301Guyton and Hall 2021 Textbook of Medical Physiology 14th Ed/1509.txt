contributes about 40% to 50% of the osmolarity (500–600 mOsm/L) of the renal medullary interstitium when the kidney is forming a maximally concentrated urine. Unlike sodium chloride, urea is passively reab- sorbed from the tubule. When there is a water deficit and 600 600 600 600 blood concentration of ADH is high, large amounts of NaCl H O urea are passively reabsorbed from the inner medullary H O 2 2 NaCl collecting ducts into the interstitium. Urea The mechanism for reabsorption of urea into the renal 1200 1200 1200 1200 medulla is as follows. As water flows up the ascending loop of Henle and into the distal and cortical collecting Figure 29-5. Formation of a concentrated urine when antidiuretic tubules, little urea is reabsorbed because these segments hormone (ADH) levels are high. Note that the fluid leaving the loop are impermeable to urea (see Table 29- 1). In the pres- of Henle is dilute but becomes concentrated as water is absorbed ence of high concentrations of ADH, water is reabsorbed from the distal tubules and collecting tubules. With high ADH levels, rapidly from the cortical collecting tubule, and the urea the osmolarity of the urine is about the same as
