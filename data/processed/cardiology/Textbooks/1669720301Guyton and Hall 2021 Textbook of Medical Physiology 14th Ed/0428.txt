composed of an atrium and a ventricle. traction in the same manner as occurs in skeletal muscle Each atrium is a weak primer pump for the ventricle, (see Chapter 6). In other ways, however, cardiac muscle is helping to move blood into the ventricle. The ventricles quite different from skeletal muscle, as we shall see. then supply the main pumping force that propels the Left Ventricular Rotation (Twist) Aids Left Ventricular blood either (1) through the pulmonary circulation by the Ejection and Relaxation. The left ventricle is organized right ventricle or (2) through the systemic circulation by into complex muscle fiber layers that run in different di- the left ventricle. The heart is surrounded by a two- layer rections and allow the heart to contract in a twisting mo- sac called the pericardium, which protects the heart and tion during systole. The subepicardial (outer) layer spirals holds it in place. in a leftward direction, and the subendocardial (inner) Special mechanisms in the heart cause a continuing layer spirals in the opposite direction (rightward), causing succession of contractions called cardiac rhythmicity, clockwise rotation of the apex of the heart and counter- transmitting action potentials throughout the cardiac clockwise rotation of the
