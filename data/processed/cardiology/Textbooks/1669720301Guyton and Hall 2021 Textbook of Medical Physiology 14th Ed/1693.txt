H+ with buffers in the tubular 33 fluid. The most important buffers are phosphate buffer CCll–– HH++ ATP and ammonia buffer. Other weak buffer systems, such as KK++ KK++ urate and citrate, are much less important. When H+ is titrated in the tubular fluid with HCO −, 3 this leads to reabsorption of one HCO − for each H+ 3 Figure 31- 6. Active secretion of H+ through the luminal membrane secreted, as discussed earlier. However, when there is of the type A intercalated epithelial cells of the late distal and collect- excess H+ in the tubular fluid, it combines with buffers ing tubules. Type A cells contain hydrogen–adenosine triphosphatase other than HCO −, and this leads to generation of new (ATPase) and hydrogen- potassium- ATPase in the luminal membrane 3 and secrete H+ while reabsorbing HCO 3− and K+ in acidosis. Note HCO 3− that can also enter the blood. Thus, when there that one HCO − is reabsorbed for each H+ secreted, and one Cl- is is excess H+ in the extracellular fluid, the kidneys not 3 passively secreted along with H+. only reabsorb all the filtered HCO − but also generate 3 new HCO −, thereby helping
