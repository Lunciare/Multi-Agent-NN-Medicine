Considering that the two kidneys constitute sumption reflects the basic metabolic needs of the renal only about 0.4% of the total body weight, one can readily cells. see that they receive extremely high blood flow compared DETERMINANTS OF RENAL BLOOD FLOW with other organs. As with other tissues, blood flow supplies the kidneys Renal blood flow (RBF) is determined by the pressure gra- with nutrients and removes waste products. However, dient across the renal vasculature (the difference between the high blood flow to the kidneys greatly exceeds this renal artery and renal vein hydrostatic pressures), divided need. The purpose of this additional flow is to supply by the total renal vascular resistance: enough plasma for the high rates of glomerular filtration (Renalarterypressure −Renalveinpressure) that are necessary for precise regulation of body fluid vol- RBF = Totalrenalvascularresistance umes and solute concentrations. As might be expected, the mechanisms that regulate renal blood flow are closely Renal artery pressure is about equal to systemic arte- linked to control of GFR and excretory
