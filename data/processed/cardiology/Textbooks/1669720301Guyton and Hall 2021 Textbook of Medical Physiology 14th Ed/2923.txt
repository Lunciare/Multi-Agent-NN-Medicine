However, the maculae of the within the first few seconds of rotation, back resistance utricle and saccule cannot detect that the person is off to the flow of fluid in the semicircular duct and past the balance until after the loss of balance has occurred. The bent cupula causes the endolymph to begin rotating as semicircular ducts, however, will have already detected rapidly as the semicircular canal itself.
