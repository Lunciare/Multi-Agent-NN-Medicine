visual signals. A third type of photosensitive retinal ganglion cell has been described that contains its own photopigment, Conversely, the same gnat sitting quietly remains below melanopsin. Much less is known about this cell type, but the threshold of visual detection. these cells appear to send signals mainly to nonvisual areas Transmission of Signals Depicting of the brain, particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Contrasts in the Visual Scene—The Role the hypothalamus, the master circadian pacemaker. Pre- of Lateral Inhibition sumably, these signals help control circadian rhythms that synchronize physiological changes with night and day. Many ganglion cells respond mainly to contrast borders in the scene, which seems to be the major means whereby the pattern of a scene is transmitted to the brain. When EXCITATION OF THE GANGLION CELLS flat light is applied to the entire retina, and all the photo- receptors are stimulated equally by the incident light, the Spontaneous, Continuous Action Potentials in the contrast type of ganglion cell is neither stimulated nor Ganglion Cells. It is from the ganglion cells that the long inhibited. The reason for this is that signals transmitted fibers of the optic nerve lead into the brain. Because of the directly from the
