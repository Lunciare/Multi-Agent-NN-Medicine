flow usually is adjusted only about three quarters of the way to the exact additional requirements of the tissues. For example, when the arte- rial pressure suddenly increases from 100 to 150 mm A 50 µm Hg, the blood flow increases almost instantaneously, by about 100%. Then, within 30 seconds to 2 minutes, the flow decreases back to about 10% to 15% above the origi- nal control value. This example illustrates the rapidity of the acute mechanisms for local blood flow regulation, but also demonstrates that the regulation is still incomplete because a 10% to 15% excess blood flow remains in some tissues. However, over a period of hours, days, and weeks, a long- term type of local blood flow regulation develops in addition to the acute control. This long- term regula- tion gives far more complete control of blood flow. In the aforementioned example, if the arterial pressure remains at 150 mm Hg indefinitely, the blood flow through the tissues gradually approaches almost exactly the normal flow level within a few weeks. Figure 17- 5 shows (dashed B green curve) the extreme effectiveness of this long- term Figure 17- 7. A large increase in the number of capillaries (white
