If tubular reabsorption 8 remained constant at 178.5 L/day, the urine flow would increase to 46.5 L/day (the difference between GFR and 6 tubular reabsorption)—a total increase in urine of more 4 than 30- fold. Because the total plasma volume is only about 3 liters, such a change would quickly deplete the 2 blood volume. In reality, changes in arterial pressure usually exert 0 much less of an effect on urine volume for two reasons: 50 100
