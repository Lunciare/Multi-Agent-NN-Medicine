three reasons: (1) it has only about one-fifth the narcotic effect of nitrogen; (2) only about one-half as much Demand valve First-stage volume of helium dissolves in the body tissues as nitrogen, valve and the volume that does dissolve diffuses out of the tissues during decompression several times as rapidly as does ni- trogen, thus reducing the problem of decompression sick- ness; and (3) the low density of helium (one-seventh the density of nitrogen) keeps the airway resistance for breath- ing at a minimum, which is very important because highly compressed nitrogen is so dense that airway resistance can become extreme, sometimes making the work of breathing beyond endurance. Finally, in very deep dives, it is important to reduce the O concentration in the gaseous mixture because other- 2 wise O toxicity would result. For example, at a depth of 2 Air cylinders 700 feet (22 atm pressure), a 1% O mixture will provide all 2 the O required by the diver, whereas a 21% mixture of O 2 2 (the percentage in air) delivers a Po to the lungs of more 2 than 4 atm, a level very likely to cause seizures in as little as 30 minutes.
