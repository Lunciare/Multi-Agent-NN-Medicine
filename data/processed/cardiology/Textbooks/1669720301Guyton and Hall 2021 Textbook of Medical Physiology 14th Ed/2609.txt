old age, at close range, the eye must contract its ciliary muscle and when the lens becomes “presbyopic,” a farsighted person is thereby provide an appropriate degree of accommodation. often unable to accommodate the lens sufficiently to focus Hyperopia (Farsightedness). Hyperopia, also known as even on distant objects, much less on near objects. “farsightedness,” is usually due to either an eyeball that is too Myopia (Nearsightedness). In myopia, or “nearsight- short or, occasionally, to a lens system that is too weak.
