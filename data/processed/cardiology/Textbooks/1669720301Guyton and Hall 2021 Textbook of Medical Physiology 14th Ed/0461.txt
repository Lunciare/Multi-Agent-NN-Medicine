The vibration pitch is 100 contraction low and relatively long-l asting and is known as the first heart EW sound (S1). When the aortic and pulmonary valves close at 50 IV II Diastolic the end of systole, one hears a rapid snap because these valves PE I pressure close rapidly, and the surroundings vibrate for a short period. 0 This sound is called the second heart sound (S2).
