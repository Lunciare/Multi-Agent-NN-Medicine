the fol- of tubular reabsorption. Assume the following laboratory lowing example. Assume that the plasma concentration values for a patient were obtained: of PAH is 0.01 mg/ml, urine concentration is 5.85 mg/ml, • Urine flow rate = 1 ml/min and urine flow rate is 1 ml/min. PAH clearance can be • Urine concentration of sodium (U ) = 70 mEq/L = Na calculated from the rate of urinary PAH excretion (5.85 70 μEq/ml [mg/ml] × 1 [ml/min]) divided by the plasma PAH con- • Plasma sodium concentration = 140 mEq/L = 140 centration (0.01 mg/ml). Thus, the clearance of PAH is μEq/ml calculated to be 585 ml/min. • GFR (inulin clearance) = 100 ml/min If the extraction ratio for PAH is 90%, the actual RPF In this example, the filtered sodium load is GFR × P , Na can be calculated by dividing 585 ml/min by 0.9, yielding or 100 ml/min × 140 μEq/ml = 14,000 μEq/min. Urinary a value of 650 ml/min. Thus, total RPF can be calculated sodium excretion (U × urine flow rate) is 70 μEq/min. Na as follows: Therefore, tubular reabsorption of sodium is the differ- PAHclearance Totalrenalplasmaflow= ence between the filtered load and urinary excretion,
