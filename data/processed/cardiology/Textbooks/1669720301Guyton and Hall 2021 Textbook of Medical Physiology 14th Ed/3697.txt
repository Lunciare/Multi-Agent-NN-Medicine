Another explanation for the failure of leptin to prevent Temperature Regulation and Food Intake. When an increasing adiposity in obese individuals is that there are animal is exposed to cold, it tends to increase feeding; many redundant systems that control feeding behavior, as when it is exposed to heat, it tends to decrease its caloric well as social and cultural factors that can cause contin- intake.
