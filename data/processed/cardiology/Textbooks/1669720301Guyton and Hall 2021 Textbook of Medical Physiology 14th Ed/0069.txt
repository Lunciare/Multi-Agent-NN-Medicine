Pinocytosis is the only means whereby most large macromolecules, such as most proteins, can enter cells.

Figure 2-11 demonstrates the successive steps of pinocytosis (A–D), showing three molecules of protein ENDOCYTOSIS—INGESTION BY THE CELL attaching to the membrane. These molecules usually attach to specialized protein receptors on the surface of If a cell is to live and grow and reproduce, it must obtain the membrane that are specific for the type of protein nutrients and other substances from the surrounding flu- that is to be absorbed.
