Therefore, if the sagittal sinus is opened during surgery, air can be sucked immediately into the venous system; the air may even pass downward to cause air embolism in the heart Figure 15-11.

The gravitational factor also affects which may lead to fainting, as sometimes occurs when a pressures in the peripheral arteries and capillaries. For soldier is made to stand at attention. This situation can be example, a standing person who has a mean arterial pres- avoided by simply flexing the leg muscles periodically and sure of 100 mm Hg at the level of the heart has an arterial slightly bending the knees, thus permitting the venous pressure in the feet of about 190 mm Hg. Therefore, when pump to work. the arterial
