with free iron and also with certain During the next few hours to days, the macrophages release iron compounds, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin iron from the hemoglobin and pass it back into the blood from meat, two of the most important sources of iron in to be carried by transferrin either to the bone marrow for the diet. This combination is called transferrin. In turn, it production of new RBCs or to the liver and other tissues is attracted to and binds with receptors in the membranes for storage in the form of ferritin. The porphyrin portion of of intestinal epithelial cells. Then, by pinocytosis, the the hemoglobin molecule is converted by the macrophages, transferrin molecule, carrying its iron store, is absorbed through a series of stages, into the bile pigment bilirubin, into the epithelial cells and later released into the blood which is released into the blood and later removed from the capillaries beneath these cells in the form of plasma body by secretion through the liver into the bile. This process transferrin. is discussed in relation to liver function in Chapter 71. 445 UNIT VI UNIT VI Blood Cells, Immunity, and Blood Coagulation ANEMIAS the number of
