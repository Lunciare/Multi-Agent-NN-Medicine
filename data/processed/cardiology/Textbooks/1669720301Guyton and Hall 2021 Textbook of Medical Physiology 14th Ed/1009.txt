circulatory filling pressure. Strong sympathetic fects on the venous return curve caused by increasing or stimulation constricts all the systemic blood vessels, as decreasing Psf. Note that the normal Psf is about 7 mm well as the larger pulmonary blood vessels and even the Hg. Then, for the uppermost curve in the figure, Psf has been increased to 14 mm Hg and, for the lowermost curve, it has decreased to 3.5 mm Hg. These curves demonstrate Strong sympathetic stimulation that the higher the Psf (which also means the greater the 14 Normal circulatory “tightness” with which the circulatory system is filled with system blood), the more the venous return curve shifts upward 12 Complete sympathetic and to the right. Conversely, the lower the Psf, the more inhibition 10 the curve shifts downward and to the left.
