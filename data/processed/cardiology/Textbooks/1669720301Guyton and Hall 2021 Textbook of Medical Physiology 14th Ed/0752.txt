Although only 1/1000 occur more often, and the duration of each period of flow of the surface area of the capillaries is represented by lasts longer, thereby allowing the capillary blood to carry the intercellular clefts between the endothelial cells, the increased quantities of oxygen (as well as other nutrients) velocity of thermal molecular motion in the clefts is so to the tissues.
