Figure 46- 9 shows the soma of a spinal motor neuron, in- dicating a resting membrane potential of about −65 milli- volts (mV). This resting membrane potential is somewhat less negative than that found in large peripheral nerve fibers and in skeletal muscle fibers; the lower voltage is Figure 46- 8.
