becomes cold, it drives system (the baroreceptor arterial pressure control system, the hypothalamic centers to the shivering threshold even by comparison, has a feedback gain of <2). when the hypothalamic temperature is still on the hot side of normal. Here again, one can understand the value of Skin Temperature Can Slightly Alter the the control system because a cold skin temperature would Set Point for Core Temperature Control soon lead to a deeply depressed body temperature unless The critical temperature set point in the hypothalamus heat production were increased. Thus, a cold skin tem- above which sweating begins and below which shivering perature actually “anticipates” a fall in internal body tem- begins is determined mainly by the degree of activity of the perature and prevents it. 908 )dnoces/seirolac( ssol taeh evitaropavE Chapter 74 Body Temperature Regulation and Fever Skin temperature (20°C) °F °C 90 Temperature 114 Upper limit regulation of survival? 20° seriously 110 44 Heatstroke 80 impaired 42 Brain lesions 22° 106 Fever therapy Temperature 40 70 24° regulation 102 Febrile disease Shivering efficient in 38 and hard exercise 60 26° febrile disease, 98 36 Usual range 28° health, and work 94 34 of normal 50 Temperature 90 32
