second; sure caused by clamping both common carotids (after the two vagus ΔP, change in arterial blood pressure (in mm Hg). nerves have been cut). Figure 18- 5 shows that signals from the carotid baro- the vasoconstrictor center of the medulla and excite the va- receptors are transmitted through small Hering’s nerves to gal parasympathetic center. The net effects are as follows: the glossopharyngeal nerves in the high neck and then to (1) vasodilation of the veins and arterioles throughout the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medullary area of the the peripheral circulatory system; and (2) decreased heart brain stem. Signals from the aortic baroreceptors in the rate and strength of heart contraction. Therefore, excita- arch of the aorta are transmitted through the vagus nerves tion of the baroreceptors by high pressure in the arteries to the same nucleus tractus solitarius of the medulla. reflexly causes the arterial pressure to decrease because of a decrease in peripheral resistance and a decrease in Response of the Baroreceptors to Changes in Arte- cardiac output. Conversely, low pressure has the opposite rial Pressure. Figure 18- 6 shows the effects of different effects, reflexly causing the pressure to rise back toward arterial pressure levels
