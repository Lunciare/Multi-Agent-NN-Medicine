but most laboratories measure specific the body of metabolic waste products and electrolytes that gravity with a refractometer. are ingested. A normal 70-k g person must excrete about 600 milliosmoles of solute each day. If the maximal urine concentrating ability is 1200 mOsm/L, the minimal volume of urine that must be excreted, called the obligatory urine 1400 volume, can be calculated as follows: 600mOsm/day =0.5L/day 1200 1200mOsm/L This minimal loss of volume in the urine contributes 1000 to dehydration, along with water loss from the skin, res- piratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract, when water is not Urine available to drink. 800 Osmolarity The limited ability of the human kidney to concentrate (mOsm/L) the urine to only about 1200 mOsm/L explains why severe 600 dehydration occurs if one attempts to drink seawater. So- dium chloride concentration in the ocean averages about 400 3.0% to 3.5%, with an osmolarity between about 1000 and 1200 mOsm/L. Drinking 1 liter of seawater with a con- centration of 1200 mOsm/L would provide a total sodium 200 chloride intake of 1200 milliosmoles. If the maximal urine concentrating ability is 1200 mOsm/L, the amount of urine volume needed to excrete 1200 milliosmoles would be 1.0 1.010 1.020
