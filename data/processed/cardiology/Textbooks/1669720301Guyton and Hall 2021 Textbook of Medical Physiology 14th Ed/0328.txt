Z disks of the sar- because a load on a contracting muscle is a reverse force comere abut the ends of the myosin filaments. Then, as that opposes the contractile force caused by muscle con- contraction proceeds to still shorter sarcomere lengths, the traction. Therefore, the net force that is available to cause ends of the myosin filaments are crumpled and, as shown in the velocity of shortening is correspondingly reduced. the figure, the strength of contraction approaches zero, but the sarcomere has now contracted to its shortest length. ENERGETICS OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION Effect of Muscle Length on Force of Contraction in the Whole Intact Muscle. The top curve of Figure Work Output During Muscle Contraction 6-10 is similar to that in Figure 6-9, but the curve in Figure 6-10 depicts tension of the intact whole muscle When a muscle contracts against a load, it performs work. rather than of a single muscle fiber.
