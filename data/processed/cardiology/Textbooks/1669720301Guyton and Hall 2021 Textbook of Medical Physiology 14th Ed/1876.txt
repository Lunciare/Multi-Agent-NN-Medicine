This is called neutrophilia, which cells in the capillaries and venules. These adhesion means an increase in the number of neutrophils in the molecules, reacting with complementary integrin blood. Neutrophilia is caused by products of inflamma- molecules on the neutrophils, cause the neutro- tion that enter the blood stream, are transported to the phils to stick to the capillary and venule walls in bone marrow, and act there on the stored neutrophils of the inflamed area. This effect is called margination the marrow to mobilize these into the circulating blood. and is shown in Figure 34-2 and in more detail in This makes even more neutrophils available to the in- Figure 34-7 . flamed tissue area. 2.
