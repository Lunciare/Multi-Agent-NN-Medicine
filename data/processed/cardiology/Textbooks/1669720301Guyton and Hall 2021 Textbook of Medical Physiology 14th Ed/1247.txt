as follows: Measurement of Extracellular Fluid Volume. The vol- VolumeA×ConcentrationA ume of extracellular fluid can be estimated using any of VolumeB= ConcentrationB several substances that disperse in the plasma and in- terstitial fluid but do not readily permeate the cell mem- For this calculation, one needs to know the following: brane. These include radioactive sodium, radioactive (1) the total amount of substance injected into the cham- chloride, radioactive iothalamate, thiosulfate ion, and ber (the numerator of the equation); and (2) the concen- inulin. When any one of these substances is injected into tration of the fluid in the chamber after the substance has the blood, it usually disperses almost completely through- been dispersed (the denominator). out the extracellular fluid within 30 to 60 minutes. Some For example, if 1 milliliter of a solution containing 10 of these substances, however, such as radioactive sodium, mg/ml of dye is dispersed into chamber B, and the final may diffuse into the cells in small amounts. Therefore, concentration in the chamber is 0.01 mg/ml of fluid, the one frequently speaks of the sodium space or inulin space unknown volume of the chamber can be calculated as instead of calling the measurement the true extracellular
