This intervention raises the days after the acute fall of the cardiac output curve to this cardiac output curve to the level shown in Figure 22- 7, but low level. At point A, the curve at time zero equates with there is no immediate change in the venous return curve. the normal venous return curve to give a cardiac output Therefore, the new cardiac output curve equates with the of about 3 L/min.
