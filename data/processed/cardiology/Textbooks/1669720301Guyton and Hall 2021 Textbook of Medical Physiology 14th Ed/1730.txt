HCO 3− concentrations. The normal value for Pco 2 is about For example, a patient with a low pH would be categorized 40 mm Hg, and for HCO 3− it is 24 mEq/L. If the disorder as acidotic. If the disorder was metabolically mediated, has been characterized as acidosis and the plasma Pco 2 is this would also be accompanied by a low plasma HCO 3− increased, there must be a respiratory component to the concentration and, after appropriate respiratory compen- acidosis. After renal compensation, the plasma HCO 3− sation, a low Pco 2. However, if the low plasma pH and concentration in respiratory acidosis would tend to in- low HCO − concentration are associated with an elevated 3 crease above normal. Therefore, the expected values for a Pco , one would suspect a respiratory component to the 2 simple respiratory acidosis would be reduced plasma pH, acidosis, as well as a metabolic component. Therefore, this increased Pco2, and increased plasma HCO 3− concentra- disorder would be categorized as a mixed acidosis.
