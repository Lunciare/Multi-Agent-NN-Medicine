The rapidity of rise and decay of radioactivity in each tissue segment is a direct measure of the rate of blood flow Flow. Except during periods of intense brain activity, the through that segment. rate of O utilization by the brain tissue remains within 2 Using this technique, it has become clear that blood flow narrow limits—almost exactly 3.5 (±0.2) ml of O /100 g of 2 in each individual segment of the brain changes as much brain tissue/min.
