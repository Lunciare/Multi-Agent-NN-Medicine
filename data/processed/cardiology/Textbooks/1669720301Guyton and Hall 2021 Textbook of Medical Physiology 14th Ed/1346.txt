A value of 1.0 (10 mm Hg) (60 mm Hg) (18 mm Hg) (32 mm Hg) indicates that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas a value of 0 indicates that it is not filtered. Dextrans are polysaccharides Figure 27- 4. Summary of forces causing filtration by the glomerular that can be manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative or capillaries. The values shown are estimates for healthy humans. positive charges and with varying molecular weights. the GFR equals the product of K and the net filtration f pressure: reason for these differences in filterability is that the GFR= K f × Net filtration pressure negative charges of the basement membrane and podo- The net filtration pressure represents the sum of cytes provide an important means for restricting large the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor or negatively charged molecules, including the plasma oppose filtration across the glomerular capillaries (Figure proteins. 27- 4).
