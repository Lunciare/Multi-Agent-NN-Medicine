FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT Direction of movement Two types of movements occur in the gastrointestinal tract: (1) propulsive movements, which cause food to move forward along the tract at an appropriate rate to accommodate digestion and absorption, and (2) mix- ing movements, which keep the intestinal contents thor- oughly mixed at all times. PROPULSIVE MOVEMENTS—PERISTALSIS B. Segmentation contractions (small and large intestines) The basic propulsive movement of the gastrointestinal tract is peristalsis, which is illustrated in Figure 63- 5A. A contractile ring
