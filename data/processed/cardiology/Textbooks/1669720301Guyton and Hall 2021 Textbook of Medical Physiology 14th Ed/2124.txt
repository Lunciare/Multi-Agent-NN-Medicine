Yet only 350 ml of new air is brought into the alveoli with each normal inspiration, and this same Air Is Humidified in the Respiratory amount of old alveolar air is expired. Therefore, the volume Passages of alveolar air replaced by new atmospheric air with each Table 40- 1 shows that atmospheric air is composed almost breath is only one-seventh of the total, so multiple breaths entirely of nitrogen and O 2; it normally contains almost no are required to exchange most of the alveolar air.

In the first spheric air enters the respiratory passages, it is exposed to alveolus of the figure, excess gas is present in the alveoli, but the fluids that cover the respiratory surfaces. Even before the note that even at the end of 16 breaths, the excess gas still has air enters the alveoli,
