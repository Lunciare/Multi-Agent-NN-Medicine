deficiency. These goitrous glands may secrete normal quantities of thyroid hormones, but more frequently, the secretion of hormone is depressed, as in endemic colloid goiter. The exact cause of the enlarged thyroid gland in pa- tients with idiopathic colloid goiter is not known, but most of these patients show signs of mild thyroiditis; therefore, it has been suggested that the thyroiditis causes slight hy- pothyroidism, which then leads to increased TSH secretion and progressive growth of the noninflamed portions of the gland. This theory could explain why these glands are usu- ally nodular, with some portions of the gland growing while other portions are being destroyed by thyroiditis. In some persons with colloid goiter, the thyroid gland has an abnormality of the enzyme system required for for- mation of thyroid hormones. The following abnormalities are often encountered: Figure 77- 9 A patient with myxedema. (Courtesy Dr. Herbert Lang- 1.
