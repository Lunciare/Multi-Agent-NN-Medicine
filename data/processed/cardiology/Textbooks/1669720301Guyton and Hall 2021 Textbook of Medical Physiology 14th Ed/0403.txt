Head. In place of troponin, smooth muscle only slightly developed in most smooth muscle. Instead, cells contain a large amount of another regulatory protein most of the calcium ions that cause contraction enter the called calmodulin (Figure 8-3). Although this protein is muscle cell from the extracellular fluid at the time of the similar to troponin, it is different in the manner in which it action potential or other stimulus. That is, the concentra- initiates contraction. Calmodulin initiates contraction by tion of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid is greater activating the myosin cross-b ridges. This activation and than 10−3 molar, in comparison with less than 10−7 molar subsequent contraction occur in the following sequence: inside the smooth muscle cell; this causes rapid diffusion 1.
