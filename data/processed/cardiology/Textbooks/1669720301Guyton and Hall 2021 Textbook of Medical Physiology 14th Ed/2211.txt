The dorsal respiratory group of neurons plays a fundamen- the inspiratory signal is a ramp signal. The obvious ad- tal role in the control of respiration and extends most of the vantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in length of the medulla. Most of its neurons are located in the the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), although additional inspiratory gasps. neurons in the adjacent reticular substance of the medulla Two qualities of the inspiratory ramp are controlled, also play important roles in respiratory control. The NTS is as follows: the sensory termination of both the vagal and the glosso- 1.
