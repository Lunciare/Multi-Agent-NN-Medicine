One of these bands, called the anterior IMPULSE IN THE VENTRICULAR PURKINJE interatrial band (also called Bachman’s bundle), passes SYSTEM through the anterior walls of the atria to the left atrium. In addition, three other small bands curve through the ante- Special Purkinje fibers lead from the A- V node through rior, lateral, and posterior atrial walls and terminate in the the A- V bundle into the ventricles. Except for the initial A- V node, shown in Figure 10- 1 and Figure 10- 3; these portion of these fibers, where they penetrate the A- V are called, respectively, the anterior, middle, and posterior fibrous
