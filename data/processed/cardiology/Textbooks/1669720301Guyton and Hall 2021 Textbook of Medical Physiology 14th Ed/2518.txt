Left to intuitive judgment of light intensity, a per- son almost always overexposes the film on bright days and 200 greatly underexposes the film at twilight. Yet, that person’s own eyes are capable of discriminating visual objects in 100 bright sunlight or at twilight with great detail; the camera cannot perform this discrimination without very special 50 manipulation because of the narrow critical range of light intensity required for proper exposure of film. 20 Judgment of Stimulus Intensity Weber- Fechner Principle—Detection of “Ratio” of Stim- 10 ulus Strength.
