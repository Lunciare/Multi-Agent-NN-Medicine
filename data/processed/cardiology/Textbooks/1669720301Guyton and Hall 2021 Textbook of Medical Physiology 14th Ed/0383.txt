and, deep in the muscle fiber, each T tubule lies adjacent to the ends of longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum tubules that surround all sides of the actual myofibrils that contract. This illustration was drawn from frog muscle, which has one T tubule per sarcomere, located at the Z disk. A similar arrangement is found in mammalian heart muscle, but mammalian skeletal muscle has two T tubules per sarcomere, located at the A- I band junctions. pumps calcium ions away from the myofibrils back into ions again. The total duration of this calcium pulse in the the sarcoplasmic tubules (see Figure 7-6). This pump, usual skeletal muscle fiber lasts about 1/20 of a second, called SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-A TPase), although it may last several times as long in some fibers can concentrate the calcium ions about 10,000-f old inside and several times less in others. In heart muscle, the cal- the tubules. In addition, inside the reticulum is a calcium- cium pulse lasts about one- third of a second because of binding protein called calsequestrin, which can bind up to the long duration of the cardiac action potential. 40 calcium ions for each molecule of calsequestrin. During this calcium pulse, muscle
