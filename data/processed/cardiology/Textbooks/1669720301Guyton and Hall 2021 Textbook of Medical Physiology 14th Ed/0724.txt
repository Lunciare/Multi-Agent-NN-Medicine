blood flow is an exceedingly important function described in detail in impeded at these points. For example, the veins from Chapter 20. the arms are compressed by their sharp angulations over the first rib. Also, the pressure in the neck veins often VENOUS PRESSURES—RIGHT ATRIAL falls so low that the atmospheric pressure on the outside PRESSURE (CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE) of the neck causes these veins to collapse. Finally, veins AND PERIPHERAL VENOUS PRESSURES coursing through the abdomen are often compressed by different organs and by the intra- abdominal pressure, so Blood from all the systemic veins flows into the right they usually are at least partially collapsed to an ovoid or atrium of the heart. Therefore, the pressure in the right slitlike state. For these reasons, the large veins do usu- atrium is called the central venous pressure. ally offer some resistance to blood flow, and thus the pres- Right atrial pressure is regulated by a balance between sure in the more peripheral small veins in a person lying (1) the ability of the heart to pump blood out of the right down is usually +4 to +6 mm Hg greater than the right atrium and ventricle into the lungs
