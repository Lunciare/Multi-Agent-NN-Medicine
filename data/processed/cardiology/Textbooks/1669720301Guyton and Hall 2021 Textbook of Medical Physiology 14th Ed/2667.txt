of stimulation of the dif- ferent color-s ensitive cones by monochromatic lights of four colors— cally inherited condition called blue weakness. blue, green, yellow, and orange. Color Test Charts. A rapid method for determining color blindness is based on the use of spot charts such as those shown in Figure 51-1 1. These charts are arranged stimulated at all. Thus, the ratios of stimulation of the with a mixture of spots of several different colors. In the three types of cones in this case are 99:42:0. The nerv- top chart, a person with normal color vision reads “74,” ous system interprets this set of ratios as the sensation whereas a red- green color- blind person reads “21.” In the of orange. Conversely, a monochromatic blue light with a bottom chart, a person with normal color vision reads wavelength of 450 nanometers stimulates the red cones to “42,” whereas a red- blind person reads “2,” and a green- blind person reads “4.” a stimulus value of 0, the green cones to a value of 0, and the blue cones to a value of 97. This set of ratios—0:0:97— NEURAL FUNCTION OF THE RETINA is interpreted by the nervous system as blue.
