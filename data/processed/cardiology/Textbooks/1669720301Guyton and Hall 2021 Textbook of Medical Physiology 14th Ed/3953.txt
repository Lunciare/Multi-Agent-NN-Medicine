The first essential step in TRIIODOTHYRONINE FROM THE THYROID thyroid hormone formation is conversion of iodide ions GLAND to an oxidized form of iodine, either nascent iodine (I0) or I 3−, which is then capable of combining directly with the Most of the thyroglobulin is not released into the circu- amino acid tyrosine. This oxidation of iodine is promoted lating blood; instead, thyroxine and triiodothyronine are by the enzyme peroxidase and its accompanying hydro- cleaved from the thyroglobulin molecule, and then these gen peroxide, which provide a potent system capable of free hormones are released. This process occurs as fol- oxidizing iodides. The peroxidase
