Note that the numbers represent the interval of time from the origin of the impulse impulse, after traveling through the internodal pathways, in the sinus node. The values have been extrapolated to humans. reaches the A- V node about 0.03 second after its origin in the sinus node. Then, there is a delay of another 0.09 sec- upward once more, finally reaching the threshold level ond in the A- V node itself before the impulse enters the for discharge at a potential of about –40 millivolts.
