Therefore, the lymph draining from the liver usually Sinusoids has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only Central vein slightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. In addition, the high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithe- lium allows large quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of all the lymph formed in the body under rest- ing conditions arises in the liver. High Hepatic Vascular Pressures Can Cause Fluid Tran- sudation Into the Abdominal Cavity From the Liver and Portal Capillaries—Ascites.
