to develop in the first place, as explained in Chapter 35. many areas of fibrosis throughout the lungs, as well as by In persons with asthma, these antibodies are mainly reduced total amount of functional lung tissue. These effects attached to mast cells that are present in the lung intersti- cause the following: (1) increased “work” on the part of the tium in close association with the bronchioles and small respiratory muscles to cause pulmonary ventilation and bronchi. When an asthmatic person breathes in pollen reduced vital capacity and breathing capacity; (2) reduced to which he or she is sensitive (i.e., to which the person total respiratory membrane surface area and increased thick- has developed IgE antibodies), the pollen reacts with the ness of the respiratory membrane, causing progressively mast cell–attached antibodies and causes the mast cells diminished pulmonary diffusing capacity; and (3) abnormal to release several different substances. Among them are ventilation- perfusion ratio in the lungs, further reducing the following: (1) histamine; (2) slow- reacting substance overall pulmonary diffusion of O and CO . 2 2 of anaphylaxis (which is a mixture of leukotrienes); (3) eosinophilic chemotactic factor; and (4) bradykinin.
