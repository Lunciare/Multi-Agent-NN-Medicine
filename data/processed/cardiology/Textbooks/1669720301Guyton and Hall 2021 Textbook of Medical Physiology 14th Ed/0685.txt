ml/sec that is near the wall of the vessel flows slowly, whereas per mm Hg pressure, but it can also be expressed in terms that in the middle of the vessel flows much more rapidly. of L/sec per mm Hg or in any other units of blood flow In the small vessel, essentially all the blood is near the and pressure. wall, so the extremely rapidly flowing central stream of It is evident that conductance is the exact reciprocal of blood simply does not exist. By integrating the velocities resistance in accord with the following equation: of all the concentric rings of flowing blood and multiply- ing them by the areas of the rings, one can derive the fol- lowing formula, known as Poiseuille’s law: 1 Conductance= Resistance F= π∆Pr4 8ηl 177 UNIT XIV UNIT IV The Circulation in which F is the rate of blood flow, ΔP is the pressure dif- R 1 R 2 ference between the ends of the vessel, r is the radius of the vessel, l is length of the vessel, and η is viscosity of the blood. A Note particularly in this equation that the rate of blood flow is directly proportional to the
