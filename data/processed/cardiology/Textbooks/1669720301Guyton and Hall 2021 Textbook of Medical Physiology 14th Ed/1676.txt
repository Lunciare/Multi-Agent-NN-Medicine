2 off from the lungs, and the Pco in the extracellular fluid in the ventilation rate. The change in ventilation rate per 2 decreases. Therefore, changes in pulmonary ventilation or unit pH change is much greater at reduced levels of pH the rate of CO formation by the tissues can change the (corresponding to elevated H+ concentration) compared 2 extracellular fluid Pco . with increased levels of pH. The reason for this is that as the 2 408 sdiulf ydob ni egnahc Hp Chapter 31 Acid–Base Regulation tracellular fluid, and the pH falls from 7.4 to 7.0, the res- 4 piratory system can return the pH to a value of about 7.2 to 7.3. This response occurs within 3 to 12 minutes. As 3 discussed previously, the respiratory responses to meta- bolic alkalosis are limited by hypoxemia associated with reduced alveolar ventilation. 2 Buffering Power of the Respiratory System.
