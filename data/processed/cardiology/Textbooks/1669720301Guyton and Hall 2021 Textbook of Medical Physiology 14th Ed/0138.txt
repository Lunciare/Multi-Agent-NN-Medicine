of gene expression provides all living organisms of a gene (Figure 3-13). In eukaryotes, which includes all with the ability to respond to changes in their environment. mammals, the basal promoter consists of a sequence of In animals that have many different types of cells, tissues, bases (TATAAA) called the TATA box, the binding site and organs, differential regulation of gene expression also for the TATA- binding protein and several other impor- permits the different cell types in the body to each perform tant transcription factors that are collectively referred to their specialized functions. Although a cardiac myocyte as the transcription factor IID complex. In addition to the contains the same genetic code as a renal tubular epithelial transcription factor IID complex, this region is where cell, many genes are expressed in cardiac cells that are not transcription factor IIB binds to both the DNA and RNA expressed in renal tubular cells. The ultimate measure of polymerase 2 to facilitate transcription of the DNA into gene “expression” is whether (and how much) of the gene RNA. This basal promoter is found in all protein- coding products (proteins) are produced because proteins carry genes, and the polymerase must bind with this
