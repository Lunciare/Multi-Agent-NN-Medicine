2 2 changed into ATP by the energy released during this con- Mitochondrion version, but this amount accounts for less than 5% of the Cell membrane Cytoplasm overall energy metabolism of the cell. About 95% of the cell’s ATP formation occurs in the Figure 2-15. Formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell mitochondria. The pyruvic acid derived from carbo- showing that most of the ATP is formed in the mitochondria. (ADP, hydrates, fatty acids from lipids, and amino acids from Adenosine diphosphate; CoA, coenzyme A.) proteins is eventually converted into the compound acetyl- coenzyme A (CoA) in the matrix of mitochondria. Functional Characteristics of Adenosine This substance, in turn, is further dissolved (for the pur- Triphosphate pose of extracting its energy) by another series of enzymes NH in the mitochondrion matrix, undergoing dissolution in a 2 sequence of chemical reactions called the citric acid cycle, N C or Krebs cycle. These chemical reactions are so important C N HC Adenine that they are explained in detail in Chapter 68.
