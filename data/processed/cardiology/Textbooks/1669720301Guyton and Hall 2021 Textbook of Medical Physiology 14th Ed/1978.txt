Von Willebrand factor (vWF) serves as an adhesion bridge between sub- Endothelium vWF endothelial collagen and the glycoprotein Basement Damaged blood Ib (GpIb) platelet receptor. membrane vessel wall come in contact with a damaged vascular surface, especially with collagen fibers in the vascular wall, the platelets rapidly change their own characteristics dras- tically (Figure 37-1 ). They begin to swell, they assume irregular forms with numerous irradiating pseudo- 1. Severed vessel 2. Platelets agglutinate pods protruding from their surfaces, their contractile proteins contract forcefully and cause the release of granules that contain multiple active factors, and they become sticky so that they adhere to collagen in the tissues and to a protein called von Willebrand factor 3. Fibrin appears 4. Fibrin clot forms (vWF), which leaks into the traumatized tissue from the plasma. The platelet surface glycoproteins bind to vWF in the exposed matrix below the damaged endo- thelium. The platelets then secrete increased quanti- ties of ADP and platelet-a ctivating factor (PAF), and their enzymes form thromboxane A . Thromboxane is 5. Clot retraction occurs 2 a vasoconstrictor and, along with ADP and PAF, acts on Figure 37- 2. Clotting process in a traumatized
