cases, particularly in the multi- unit type of smooth muscle, the varicosities are separated from the muscle cell membrane by as little as 20 to 30 nanome- ters—the same width as the synaptic cleft that is found Autonomic neuron in the skeletal muscle junction. These are called contact varicosity junctions, and they function in much the same way as Figure 8-6 Innervation of smooth muscle by autonomic nerve fib- the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction. The rapidity ers that branch diffusely and secrete neurotransmitter from multiple of contraction of these smooth muscle fibers is consid- varicosities. Unitary (visceral) smooth muscle cells are connected by erably faster than that of fibers stimulated by the diffuse gap junctions so that depolarization can rapidly spread from one cell to another, permitting the muscle cells to contract as a single unit. In junctions. multi- unit smooth muscle, each cell is stimulated independently by a neurotransmitter released from closely associated autonomic nerve Excitatory and Inhibitory Transmitter Substances Se- varicosities. creted at the Smooth Muscle Neuromuscular Junc- tion.
