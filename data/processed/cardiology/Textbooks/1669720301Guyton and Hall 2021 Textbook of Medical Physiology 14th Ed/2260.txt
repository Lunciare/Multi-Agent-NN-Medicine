of bronchiolar Note that the constricted lungs have both reduced total collapse and airway resistance by an equal amount, thus lung capacity (TLC) and reduced residual volume (RV). preventing further increase in flow. Therefore, beyond a Furthermore, because the lung cannot expand to a nor- critical degree of expiratory force, a maximum expiratory mal maximum volume, even with the greatest possible ex- flow has been reached. piratory effort, the maximal expiratory flow cannot rise to Figure 43- 1B shows the effect of different degrees of equal that of the normal curve. Constricted lung diseases lung collapse (and therefore also of bronchiolar collapse) include fibrotic diseases of the lung, such as tuberculosis and silicosis, and diseases that constrict the chest cage, such as kyphosis, scoliosis, and fibrotic pleurisy. In diseases with airway obstruction, it is usually much A more difficult to expire than to inspire because the closing tendency of the airways is greatly increased by the extra positive pressure required in the chest to cause expiration. 500 By contrast, the extra negative pleural pressure that occurs during inspiration actually “pulls” the airways open at the 400 M axi 500 m u 300 m Airway ex pir 400 obstruction at 200
