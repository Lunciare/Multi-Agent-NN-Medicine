−94 millivolts because the logarithm of 35 is 1.54, and this, multiplied by −61 millivolts, is −94 mil- livolts. Therefore, if potassium ions were the only factor K CI Silver–silver causing the resting potential, the resting potential inside chloride the fiber would be equal to −94 millivolts, as shown in + + + + – – – – + + + + + electrode – – – – + + + + – – – – – the figure. + + + + – – – – – – – – – – Contribution of Sodium Diffusion Through the + + + + – – – – + + + + + + Nerve Membrane. Figure 5-5 B shows the addition of slight permeability of the nerve membrane to sodium Overshoot ions, caused by the minute diffusion of sodium ions through the K+-N a+ leak channels. The ratio of sodium +35 ions from inside to outside the membrane is 0.1, which gives a calculated Nernst potential for the inside of the 0 membrane of +61 millivolts. Also shown in Figure 5-5 B on R is the Nernst potential for potassium diffusion of −94 zati e p o millivolts. How do
