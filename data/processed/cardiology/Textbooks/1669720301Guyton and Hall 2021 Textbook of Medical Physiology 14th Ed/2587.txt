fronts Glass B traveling forward in a beam (as shown in Figure 50- 1A) strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam, the rays enter the second medium without deviating from their course. The only effect that occurs is decreased velocity of transmission and shorter wavelength, as shown in the fig- ure by the shorter distances between wave fronts. If the light rays pass through an angulated interface, as shown in Figure 50- 1B, the rays bend if the refractive in- Figure 50- 1. Light rays entering a glass surface perpendicular to the dices of the two media are different from each other. In this light rays (A) and a glass surface angulated to the light rays (B).
