into the ter 25, loss of sodium from the body mainly decreases tubules exceeds their capacity to reabsorb glucose (i.e., extracellular fluid volume; therefore, diuretics are usually exceeds their transport maximum for glucose). Above a administered in clinical conditions in which extracellular plasma glucose concentration of about 250 mg/dl, little of fluid volume is expanded. the extra glucose is reabsorbed by the tubules; instead, the Some diuretics can increase urine output more than excess glucose remains in the tubules, acts as an osmotic 20-f old within a few minutes after they are administered. diuretic, and increases urine flow rate. Therefore, one of However, the effect of most diuretics on renal output of the hallmarks of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is poly- salt and water subsides within a few days due to activa- uria (frequent urination), which is balanced by a high tion of compensatory mechanisms initiated by decreased level of fluid intake (polydipsia) secondary to dehydration, extracellular fluid volume (Figure 32- 1). For example, a increased extracellular fluid osmolarity, and activation of decrease in extracellular fluid volume may reduce arte- the thirst mechanism. rial pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and Loop Diuretics Decrease Sodium- Chloride- increase renin secretion and angiotensin
