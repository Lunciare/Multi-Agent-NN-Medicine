Descending of cells of the spinal cord, including diverging, converging, Intermediate zone fibers repetitive- discharge, and other types of circuits. In this chapter, we examine many applications of these different circuits in the performance of specific reflex actions by the spinal cord. Anterior horn Only a few incoming sensory signals from the spinal nerves or signals from the brain terminate directly on the Gamma motor neuron 1a fiber anterior motor neurons. Instead, almost all these signals Alpha motor neuron 1b fiber are transmitted first through interneurons, where they are appropriately processed. Thus, in Figure 55- 1, the Motor end plate corticospinal tract from the brain is shown to terminate almost entirely on spinal interneurons, where the signals from this tract are combined with signals from other spi- nal tracts or spinal nerves before finally converging on the Skeletal muscle Muscle spindle Golgi tendon organ anterior motor neurons to control muscle function.
