Conversely, many other PVCs result from stray impulses or re-e ntrant signals that originate around the borders of infarcted or ischemic areas of the heart. The presence of such PVCs is not to be taken lightly. People with significant numbers of PVCs often have a much higher than normal risk of developing spontaneous lethal ventricular fibrillation, presumably initiated by one of the PVCs. This development is especially true when the PVCs + + occur during the vulnerable period for causing fibrillation, III II just at the end of the T wave, when the ventricles are com- Figure 13-11.
