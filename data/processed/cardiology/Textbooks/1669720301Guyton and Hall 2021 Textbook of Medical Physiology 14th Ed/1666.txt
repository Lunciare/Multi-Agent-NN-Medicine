pH unit on either fluid is low, at only about 8% of the concentration of the side of the pK, which, for the bicarbonate buffer system, bicarbonate buffer. Therefore, the total buffering power of extends from a pH of about 5.1 to 7.1 units. Beyond these the phosphate system in the extracellular fluid is much limits, the buffering power rapidly diminishes. And, when all the CO has been converted into HCO −, or when all less than that of the bicarbonate buffering system. 2 3 the HCO − has been converted into CO , the system has In contrast to its minor role as an extracellular buffer, 3 2 no more buffering power. the phosphate buffer is especially important in the tubu- The absolute concentration of the buffers is also an lar fluids of the kidneys for two reasons: (1) phosphate important factor in determining the buffer power of a sys- usually becomes greatly concentrated in the tubules, tem.
