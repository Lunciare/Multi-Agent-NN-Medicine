2. Syncytial interconnecting nature of cardiac muscle fibers. ACTION POTENTIALS IN CARDIAC MUSCLE atria; and the ventricular syncytium, which constitutes the walls of the two ventricles. The atria are separated The action potential recorded in a ventricular muscle from the ventricles by fibrous tissue that surrounds the fiber, shown in Figure 9- 4, averages about 105 millivolts, atrioventricular (A- V) valvular openings between the which means that the intracellular potential rises from a atria and ventricles. Normally, potentials are not con- very negative value between beats, about −85 millivolts, ducted from the atrial syncytium into the ventricular to a slightly positive value, about +20 millivolts, during syncytium directly through this fibrous tissue. Instead, each beat. After the initial spike, the membrane remains they are only conducted by way of a specialized conduc- depolarized for about 0.2 second, exhibiting a plateau, fol- tive system called the A-V bundle, a bundle of conductive lowed at the end of the plateau by abrupt repolarization. 114 stlovilliM Chapter 9 Cardiac Muscle: The Heart as a Pump and Function of the Heart Valves The presence of this plateau in the action potential causes ventricular contraction to last as much as 15 times longer 20 1
