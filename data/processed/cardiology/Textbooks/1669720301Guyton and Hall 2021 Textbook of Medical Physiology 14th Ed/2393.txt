Endorphin Class III: Amino Acids α–Melanocyte- stimulating hormone Gamma- aminobutyric acid Glycine Prolactin Glutamate Luteinizing hormone Aspartate Thyrotropin Class IV Growth hormone ATP Arachidonic acid Vasopressin Nitric oxide Oxytocin Carbon monoxide Peptides That Act on Gut and Brain Leucine enkephalin Methionine enkephalin signals back to the muscles. The neuropeptides, in con- Substance P trast, usually cause more prolonged actions, such as Gastrin long- term changes in numbers of neuronal receptors, Cholecystokinin long- term opening or closure of certain ion channels, and possibly even long- term changes in numbers of synapses Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or sizes of synapses. Nerve growth factor Small- Molecule, Rapidly Acting Brain- derived neurotropic factor Transmitters Neurotensin Insulin In most cases, the small- molecule types of transmitters Glucagon are synthesized in the cytosol of the presynaptic termi- Peptides from Other Tissues nal and are absorbed via active transport into the many Angiotensin II transmitter vesicles in the terminal. Then, each time an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, a Bradykinin few vesicles at a time release their transmitter into the Carnosine synaptic cleft. This action usually occurs within a mil- Sleep peptides lisecond or less by the mechanism described earlier. The Calcitonin subsequent action of the small-
