in the well- trained athlete. diffusing capacity is a measure of the rate at which oxygen Limits of Pulmonary Ventilation. How severely do we can diffuse from the pulmonary alveoli into the blood. This stress our respiratory systems during exercise? This ques- capacity is expressed in terms of milliliters of oxygen that tion can be answered by the following comparison for a will diffuse each minute for each millimeter of mercury dif- normal young man: ference between alveolar partial pressure of oxygen and pul- monary blood oxygen pressure. That is, if the partial pres- L/min sure of oxygen in the alveoli is 91 mm Hg and the oxygen Pulmonary ventilation at 100–110 pressure in the blood is 90 mm Hg, the amount of oxygen maximal exercise that diffuses through the respiratory membrane each min- Maximal breathing capacity 150–170 ute is equal to the diffusing capacity. The following values are measured values for different diffusing capacities: Thus, the maximal breathing capacity is about 50% greater ml/min than the actual pulmonary ventilation during maximal exer- cise. This difference provides an element of safety for athletes, Nonathlete at rest 23 giving them extra ventilation that can be called on in such con- Nonathlete
