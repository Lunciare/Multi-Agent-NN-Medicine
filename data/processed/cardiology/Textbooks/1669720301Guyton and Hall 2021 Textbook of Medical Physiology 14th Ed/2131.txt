(A, Alveolar sacs From Maloney JE, Castle BL: Pressure-d iameter relations of capillar- ies and small blood vessels in frog lung. Respir Physiol 7:150, 1969.) alveolar air is expired at the end of expiration. Therefore, the method of collecting alveolar air for study is simply to collect a sample of the last portion of the expired air after forceful expiration has removed all the dead space air. Normal expired air, containing both dead space air and alveolar air, has gas concentrations and
