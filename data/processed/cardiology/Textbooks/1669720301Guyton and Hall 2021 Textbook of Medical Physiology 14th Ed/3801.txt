Clothing entraps air next to the skin in the weave of objects (3%) the cloth, thereby increasing the thickness of the so- called Figure 74- 4.

Consequently, the rate of heat loss from the body by conduction and convection is greatly depressed. A usual suit of clothes decreases the rate of heat loss to about half that from the nude body, but arctic- type clothing can decrease this heat loss to as little as one sixth. About half the heat transmitted from the skin to the clothing is radiated to the clothing instead of being con- Duct ducted across the small intervening space. Therefore, coating the inside of clothing with a thin layer of metal, Absorption, mainly sodium and chloride ions such as silver or gold, which reflects radiant heat back to the body, makes the insulating properties of
