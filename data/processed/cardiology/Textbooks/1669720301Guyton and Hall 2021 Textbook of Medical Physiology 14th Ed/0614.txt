the rate of rhythm of the atria in this ECG is about A- V bundle is slowed enough to increase the P- R interval 100 beats/min, whereas the rate of ventricular beat is less to 0.25 to 0.45 second, the action potential is sometimes than 40 beats/min. Furthermore, there is no relationship strong enough to pass through the bundle into the ven- between the rhythm of the P waves and that of the QRS- tricles and sometimes not strong enough to do so. In this T complexes because the ventricles have “escaped” from case, there will be an atrial P wave but no QRS- T wave, control by the atria and are beating at their own natural and it is said that there are “dropped beats” of the ven- rate, controlled most often by rhythmical signals generat- tricles.
