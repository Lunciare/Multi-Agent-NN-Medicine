It is now clear that further retention of phosphatase in cardiac cell membranes. Inhibition of fluid will be more detrimental than beneficial to the cir- the sodium- potassium pump increases the intracellular culation. Yet, the cardiac output still is not high enough sodium concentration and slows the sodium-c alcium to bring about normal renal function, so fluid retention exchange pump, which extrudes calcium from the cell not only continues but accelerates because of the falling in exchange for sodium. Because the sodium- calcium cardiac output (and the falling arterial pressure that also exchange pump relies on a high sodium gradient across occurs). Consequently, within a few days, the state of the the cell membrane, accumulation of sodium inside the circulation has reached point F on the curve, with the car- cell reduces its activity. diac output now less than 2.5 L/min and the right atrial In the failing heart muscle, the sarcoplasmic reticu- pressure 16 mm Hg.
