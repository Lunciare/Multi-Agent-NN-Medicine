cesses that lead to acidemia and alkalemia, respectively. BUFFERING OF H+ IN THE BODY FLUIDS The pH of urine can range from 4.5 to 8.0, depend- ing on the acid–base status of the extracellular fluid. As A buffer is any substance that can reversibly bind H+. The discussed later, the kidneys play a major role in correcting general form of the buffering reaction is as follows: abnormalities of extracellular fluid H+ concentration by Buffer+H+←  →HBuffer excreting acids or bases at variable rates. In this example, a free H+ combines with the buffer to Table 31- 1 pH and H+ Concentration of Body Fluids form a weak acid (H buffer) that can either remain as an unassociated molecule or dissociate back to the buffer and H+ Concentration (mEq/L) pH H+. When the H+ concentration increases, the reaction is Extracellular Fluid forced to the right, and more H+ binds to the buffer, as • Arterial blood • 4.0 × 10−5 • 7.40 long as buffer is available. Conversely, when the H+ con- • Venous blood • 4.5 × 10−5 • 7.35 centration decreases, the reaction shifts toward the left, • Interstitial fluid • 4.5 × 10−5 • 7.35 and H+ is
