Thus, the low concentration of sodium inside the of these digestive end products first become dissolved in the cell literally “drags” sodium to the interior of the cell, and central lipid portions of bile micelles. Because the molecular glucose is dragged along with it. Once inside the epithe- dimensions of these micelles are only 3 to 6 nanometers in lial cell, another transport protein, glucose transporter 2 diameter, and because of their highly charged exterior, they (GLUT2) facilitates diffusion of the glucose through the are soluble in chyme. In this form, the monoglycerides and cell’s basolateral membrane into the paracellular space and free fatty acids are carried to the surfaces of the microvilli from there into the blood (see Figure 66- 9). of the intestinal cell brush border and then penetrate into To summarize, it is the initial active transport of the recesses among the moving, agitating microvilli.
