Thus, the inner layers of the retina have their own blood supply, independent of the other structures of the eye. However, the outermost layer of the retina is adherent to the choroid, which is also a highly vascular tissue lying between the retina and the sclera. The outer layers of the retina, especially the outer segments of the rods and cones, depend
