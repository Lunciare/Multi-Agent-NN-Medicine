The lipid solubility of a substance is an gradient, such as from a low-c oncentration state to a high- important factor for determining how rapidly it diffuses concentration state. This movement requires an additional through the lipid bilayer. For example, the lipid solubili- source of energy besides kinetic energy.

The rate of diffusion of each of these sub- stances through the membrane is directly proportional to All molecules and ions in the body fluids, including water its lipid solubility.
