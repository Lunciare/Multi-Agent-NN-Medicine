Sometimes, the left ventricular the ventricle, necessitating increased coronary blood flow muscle mass increases fourfold to fivefold, creating a tre- to deliver this oxygen. The high wall tension of the ventricle, mendously large left side of the heart. however, causes marked decreases in coronary flow during When the aortic valve is seriously stenosed, the hyper- systole, particularly in the subendocardial vessels.

This type of concentric hypertrophy is asso- compression of the inner layers of the heart muscle and re- ciated with thickened ventricular walls and a smaller duced coronary blood flow.
