Lever Systems of the Body. Muscles operate by applying tension to their points of insertion into bones, and the REMODELING OF MUSCLE TO MATCH bones in turn form various types of lever systems. Fig- FUNCTION ure 6-16 shows the lever system activated by the biceps muscle to lift the forearm against a load. If we assume The muscles of the body continually remodel to match that a large biceps muscle has a cross- sectional area of 6 the functions required of them. Their diameters, lengths, square inches, the maximum force of contraction would strengths, and vascular supplies are altered, and even the be about 300 pounds. When the forearm is at right an- types of muscle fibers are altered, at least slightly. This gles with the upper arm, the tendon attachment of the remodeling process is often quite rapid, occurring within biceps is about 2 inches anterior to the fulcrum at the a few weeks. Experiments in animals have shown that elbow, and the total length of the forearm lever is about 14 inches. Therefore, the amount of lifting power of the muscle contractile proteins in some smaller, more active biceps at the hand would be only one- seventh of
