Finally, another cause Acrosome Enzymes, the “Acrosome of sterility, usually temporary, is excessive temperature of Reaction,” and Penetration of the Ovum the testes. Stored in the acrosome of the sperm are large quantities Effect of Temperature on Spermatogenesis. Increasing the temperature of the testes can prevent spermatogenesis of hyaluronidase and proteolytic enzymes. Hyaluroni- by causing degeneration of most cells of the seminiferous dase depolymerizes the hyaluronic acid polymers in the tubules besides the spermatogonia. It has often been stated intercellular cement that holds the ovarian granulosa cells that the reason the testes are located in the dangling scro- together. The proteolytic enzymes digest proteins in the tum is to maintain the temperature of these glands below structural elements of tissue cells that still adhere to the the internal temperature of the body, although usually only ovum. about 2°C below the internal temperature. On cold days, When the ovum is expelled from the ovarian follicle scrotal reflexes cause the musculature of the scrotum to into the fallopian tube, it still carries with it multiple contract, pulling
