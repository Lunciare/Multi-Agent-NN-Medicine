Some of these cavities and pressure mea- than atmospheric pressure; that is, the values are called surements are as follows: negative interstitial fluid pressure. In other tissues that are • Intrapleural space: −8 mm Hg surrounded by capsules, such as the kidneys, the intersti- • Joint synovial spaces: −4 to −6 mm Hg tial pressure is generally positive (i.e., greater than atmo- • Epidural space: −4 to −6 mm Hg spheric pressure).
