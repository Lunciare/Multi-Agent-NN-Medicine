the rate at which it is secreted from the peritubular capillary blood into the tubules. Urine Urine URINE FORMATION RESULTS FROM Figure 26- 10. Renal handling of four hypothetical substances. A, The substance is freely filtered but not reabsorbed. B, The substance GLOMERULAR FILTRATION, TUBULAR is freely filtered, but part of the filtered load is reabsorbed back in REABSORPTION, AND TUBULAR the blood. C, The substance is freely filtered but is not excreted in SECRETION the urine because all the filtered substance is reabsorbed from the tubules into the blood. D, The substance is freely filtered and is not The rates at which different substances are excreted in the reabsorbed but is secreted from the peritubular capillary blood into urine represent the sum of three renal processes, shown the renal tubules. in Figure 26- 9: (1) glomerular filtration of substances in the blood; (2) reabsorption of substances from the renal equal to the rate at which it was filtered. Certain waste tubules into the blood; and (3) secretion of substances products in the body, such as creatinine, are handled by from the blood into the renal tubules as follows: the kidneys in this manner, allowing excretion of essen- tially all
