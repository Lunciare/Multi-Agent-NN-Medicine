figure) from the apices of leads I and III, respectively. The point of intersection of these two perpendicular (dashed) lines represents, by vectorial analysis, the apex of the mean QRS vector in the ventri- cles, and the point of intersection of the lead I and lead I – +I III axes represents the negative end of the mean vector. Therefore, the mean QRS vector is drawn between these two points. The approximate average potential generated + by the ventricles during depolarization is represented by III the length of this mean QRS vector, and the mean electri- Figure 12-12 Left axis deviation in a hypertensive heart (hypertroph- cal axis is represented by the direction of the mean vec- ic left ventricle).

Thus, the orientation of the mean electrical axis of the normal ventricles, as determined in Figure 12-11, is 59 through the hypertrophied ventricle than through the degrees positive (+59 degrees). normal ventricle.
