the buffering power of the phosphate amount of acid or base added to the solution changes the system; and (2) the tubular fluid usually has a consider- pH considerably. ably lower pH than the extracellular fluid, bringing the Bicarbonate Buffer System Is the Most Important operating range of the buffer closer to the pK (6.8) of the Extracellular Buffer. From the titration curve shown in system. Figure 31- 1, one would not expect the bicarbonate buffer The phosphate buffer system is also important in system to be powerful, for two reasons. First, the pH of the buffering intracellular fluid because the concentration extracellular fluid is about 7.4, whereas the pK of the bicar- of phosphate in this fluid is many times higher than in bonate buffer system is 6.1, which means that there is about 20 times as much of the bicarbonate buffer system in the the extracellular fluid. Also, the pH of intracellular fluid form of HCO − as in the form of dissolved CO . For this is lower than that of extracellular fluid and, therefore, is 3 2 reason, this system operates on the portion of the buffering usually closer to the pK of the phosphate buffer
