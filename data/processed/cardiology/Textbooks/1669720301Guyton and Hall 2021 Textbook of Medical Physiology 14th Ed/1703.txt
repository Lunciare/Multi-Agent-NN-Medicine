In acidosis, the net acid excretion increases markedly, Under normal conditions, the amount of H+ eliminated especially because of increased NH + excretion, thereby 4 by the ammonia buffer system accounts for about 50% of removing acid from the blood. The net acid excretion also the acid excreted and 50% of the new HCO − generated equals the rate of net HCO − addition to the blood. There- 3 3 by the kidneys.
