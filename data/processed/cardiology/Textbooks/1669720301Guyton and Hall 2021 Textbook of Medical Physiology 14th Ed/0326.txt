length of are different degrees of overlap of the myosin and actin about 2 micrometers, it contracts on activation with the filaments at different sarcomere lengths. At point D on the approximate maximum force of contraction. However, diagram, the actin filament has pulled all the way out to the increase in tension that occurs during contraction, the end of the myosin filament, with no actin-m yosin over- called active tension, decreases as the muscle is stretched lap. At this point, the tension developed by the activated beyond its normal length—that is, to a sarcomere length muscle is zero. Then, as the sarcomere shortens, and the greater than about 2.2 micrometers. This phenomenon is actin filament begins to overlap the myosin filament, the demonstrated by the decreased length of the arrow in the tension increases progressively until the sarcomere length figure at greater than normal muscle length. decreases to about 2.2 micrometers. At this point, the actin Relation of Velocity of Contraction to Load filament has already overlapped all the cross-b ridges of the myosin filament but has not yet reached the center of the A skeletal muscle contracts rapidly when it contracts myosin filament. With further shortening, the sarcomere against
