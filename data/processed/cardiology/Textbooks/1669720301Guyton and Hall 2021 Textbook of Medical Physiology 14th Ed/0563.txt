Figure 12-8 Generation of the T wave during repolarization of the ventricles, also showing vectorial analysis of the first stage of repolari- zation. The total time from the beginning of the T wave to its end is of repolarization. Finally, the vector becomes weaker approximately 0.15 second. again because the areas of depolarization still persisting become so slight that the total quantity of current flow ELECTROCARDIOGRAM DURING VENTRI- decreases. These changes also demonstrate that the vec- CULAR REPOLARIZATION—THE T WAVE tor is greatest when about half the heart is in the polarized state and about half is depolarized.
