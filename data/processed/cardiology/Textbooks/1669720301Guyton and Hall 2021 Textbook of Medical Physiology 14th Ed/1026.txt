Therefore, the quantity of Other Analyses of Cardiac Output Regulation. blood flowing through the lungs each minute is 5 liters, In Chapter 21, analysis of cardiac output regulation dur- which is also a measure of the cardiac output. Thus, the ing exercise is presented. In Chapter 22, analyses of cardi- cardiac output can be calculated by the following formula: ac output regulation at various stages of congestive heart failure are discussed. Cardiac output(L min) O absorbed per minute by the lungs(mlmmin) = 2 Arteriovenous Od ifferenc e(mlL of blood) METHODS FOR MEASURING CARDIAC 2 OUTPUT In applying this Fick procedure for measuring cardiac Accurate assessment of cardiac output is vitally impor- output in humans, mixed venous blood is usually obtained tant in modern medical practice, especially in critically through a catheter inserted up the brachial vein of the ill patients or in high-r isk patients undergoing surgery. In forearm, through the subclavian vein, down to the right animal experiments, one can measure the cardiac output atrium and, finally, into the right ventricle or pulmonary using an electromagnetic or ultrasonic flowmeter placed artery. Systemic arterial blood can then be obtained from on the
