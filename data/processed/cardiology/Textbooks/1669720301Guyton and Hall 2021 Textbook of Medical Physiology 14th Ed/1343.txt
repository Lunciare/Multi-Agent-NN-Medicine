of plasma proteins. Thus, all layers of the glomerular capillary wall provide a barrier to the Renal filtration of plasma proteins but permit rapid filtration of vein water and most solutes in the plasma. Urinary excretion (1 ml/min) Filterability of Solutes Inversely Related to Their Figure 27- 1. Average values for total renal plasma flow (RPF), glo- Size. The glomerular capillary membrane is thicker than merular filtration rate (GFR), tubular reabsorption (REAB), and urine most other capillaries, but it is also much more porous flow rate. RPF is equal to renal blood flow × (1 − hematocrit). Note and therefore filters fluid at a high rate. Despite the high that the GFR averages about 20% of the RPF, whereas urine flow filtration rate, the glomerular filtration barrier is selective rate is less than 1% of the GFR. Therefore, more than 99% of the fluid filtered is normally reabsorbed. The filtration fraction is GFR/RPF. in determining which molecules will be filtered, based on their size and electrical charge. Table 27- 1 lists the effect of molecular size on filter- ability of different molecules. A filterability of 1.0 means that the substance is filtered as freely as water, whereas Proximal tubule a
