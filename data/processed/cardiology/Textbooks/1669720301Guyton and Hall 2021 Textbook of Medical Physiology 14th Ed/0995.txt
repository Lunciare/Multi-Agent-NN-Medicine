This shift occurs because filling the car- riods of physical inactivity, a reduction in the size of the diac chambers with blood requires an extra 2 mm Hg skeletal muscles usually occurs.

Likewise, an increase in needs of the muscles, resulting in decreases in skeletal intrapleural pressure to +2 mm Hg requires a 6 mm Hg muscle blood flow and cardiac output. increase in right atrial pressure from the normal −4 mm 5.
