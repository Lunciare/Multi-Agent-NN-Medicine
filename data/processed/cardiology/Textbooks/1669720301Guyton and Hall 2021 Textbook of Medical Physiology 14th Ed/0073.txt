such as amino acids, glucose, and phosphates that can diffuse through the membrane of the vesicle into the cytoplasm. What is left of the digestive vesicle, called Pinocytotic or the residual body, represents indigestible substances. In phagocytic most cases, the residual body is finally excreted through vesicle the cell membrane by a process called exocytosis, which is Digestive vesicle essentially the opposite of endocytosis. Thus, the pinocy- totic and phagocytic vesicles containing lysosomes can be called the digestive organs of the cells. Residual body Lysosomes and Regression of Tissues and Autolysis of Damaged Cells. Tissues of the body often regress to Excretion a smaller size. For example, this regression occurs in the uterus after pregnancy, in muscles during long periods of Figure 2-12.

Lysosomes are responsible for much of this regression. Another special role of the lysosomes is the removal Phagocytosis is initiated when a particle such as a bac- of damaged cells or damaged portions of cells from tis- terium, dead cell, or tissue debris binds with receptors sues.
