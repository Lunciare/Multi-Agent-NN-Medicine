A few sensory nerve 140 endings have been described in the alveolar walls in jux- taposition to the pulmonary capillaries—hence, the name Exercise J receptors. They are stimulated especially when the pul- 120 monary capillaries become engorged with blood or when pulmonary edema occurs in conditions such as congestive 100 heart failure. Although the functional role of the J receptors is not clear, their excitation may give the person a feeling of 80 dyspnea. Brain Edema Depresses the Respiratory Center. The 60 activity of the respiratory center may be depressed or even inactivated by acute brain edema resulting from a brain Resting concussion. For example, the head might be struck against 40 some solid object, after which the damaged brain tissues swell, compressing the cerebral arteries against the cranial Normal 20 vault and thus partially blocking the cerebral blood supply. Occasionally, respiratory depression resulting from 0 brain edema can be relieved temporarily by intravenous 20 30 40 50 60 80 100 injection of a hypertonic solution, such as a highly concen- Arterial PCO (mm Hg) trated mannitol solution. These solutions
