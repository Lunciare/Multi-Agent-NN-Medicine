To reconstitute the cellular ATP as it is used up, energy Glucose Gl 36 ADP derived from the cellular nutrients causes ADP and phos- Fatty acids FA phoric acid to recombine to form new ATP, and the entire Amino acids AA Pyruvic acid process is repeated over and over. For these reasons, ATP Acetoacetic has been called the energy currency of the cell because it acid can be spent and reformed continually, having a turnover Acetyl-CoA time of only a few minutes.
