The smooth muscle cell membrane has far more voltage-g ated calcium chan- nels than skeletal muscle but few voltage- gated sodium –60 Slow waves channels. Therefore, sodium does not participate much in the generation of the action potential in most smooth muscle. Instead, the flow of calcium ions to the interior 0 50 100 0 10 20 30 A Milliseconds B Seconds of the fiber is mainly responsible for the action potential. This flow occurs in the same self-r egenerative way as oc- curs for the sodium channels in nerve fibers and in skel- 0 etal muscle fibers. However, the calcium channels open many times more slowly than sodium channels, and they –25 also remain open much longer. These characteristics largely account for the prolonged plateau action poten- –50 tials of some smooth muscle fibers.
