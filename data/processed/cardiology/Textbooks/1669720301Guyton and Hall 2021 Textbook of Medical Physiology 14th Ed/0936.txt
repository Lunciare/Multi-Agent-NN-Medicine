Angio- Rapidity and Intensity of the tensin has several direct renal effects that make the kid- Vasoconstrictor Pressure Response to the neys retain salt and water. One major effect is to constrict Renin- Angiotensin System the renal arterioles, especially the glomerular efferent ar- terioles, thereby diminishing blood flow through the kid- Figure 19- 10 shows an experiment demonstrating the neys. The slow flow of blood reduces the pressure in the effect of hemorrhage on the arterial pressure under two peritubular capillaries, which increases reabsorption of separate conditions: (1) with the renin-a ngiotensin sys- fluid from the tubules.
