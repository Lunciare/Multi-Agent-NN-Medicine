or weaker lens until the one that gives the best visual acuity Point source is found. of light Astigmatism. Astigmatism is a refractive error of the eye that causes the visual image in one plane to focus at A B a different distance from that of the plane at right angles. Astigmatism usually results from too great a curvature of the cornea in one plane of the eye. An example of an astig- C matic lens would be a lens surface like that of an egg lying D sidewise to the incoming light. The degree of curvature in Focal line Plane AC the plane through the long axis of the egg is not nearly as for plane BD Plane BD (less refractive (more refractive power) great as the degree of curvature in the plane through the power) short axis. Focal line Because the curvature of the astigmatic lens along one for plane AC plane is less than the curvature along the other plane, light rays striking the peripheral portions of the lens in one plane are not bent nearly as much as the rays striking the periph- Figure 50- 14.
