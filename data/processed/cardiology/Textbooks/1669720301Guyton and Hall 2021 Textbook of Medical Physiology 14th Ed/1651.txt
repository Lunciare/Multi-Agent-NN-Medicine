Therefore, the normal pH is as follows: of the body fluids, which immediately combine with an acid or a base to prevent excessive changes in H+ con- pH=−log[0.00000004] centration; (2) the respiratory center, which regulates the pH=7.4 removal of CO (and, therefore, H CO ) from the extra- 2 2 3 From this formula, one can see that pH is inversely cellular fluid; and (3) the kidneys, which can excrete acidic related to the H+ concentration; therefore, a low pH cor- or alkaline urine, thereby readjusting the extracellular responds to a high H+ concentration, and a high pH cor- fluid H+ concentration toward normal during acidosis or responds to a low H+ concentration. alkalosis.
