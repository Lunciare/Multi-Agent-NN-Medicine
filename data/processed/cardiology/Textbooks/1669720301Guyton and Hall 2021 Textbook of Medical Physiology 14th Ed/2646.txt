of the rods and cones. of this rapid decomposition is photoactivation of elec- trons in the retinal portion of the rhodopsin, which leads Blood Supply of the Retina—The Central Retinal Artery to instantaneous change of the cis form of retinal into an and the Choroid. The nutrient blood supply for the internal all-t rans form that has the same chemical structure as the layers of the retina is derived from the central retinal artery, cis form but a different physical structure—it is a straight which enters the eyeball through the center of the optic molecule rather than an angulated molecule. Because the nerve and then divides to supply the entire inside retinal three- dimensional orientation of the reactive sites of the 641 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses Vitamin A is present both in the cytoplasm of the rods Light energy and in the pigment layer of the retina. Therefore, vitamin Rhodopsin Bathorhodopsin A is normally always available to form new retinal when (psec) (nsec) needed. Conversely, when there is excess retinal in the Lumirhodopsin retina, it is converted back into vitamin A, thus reducing (µsec) the amount of light- sensitive pigment in the retina.
