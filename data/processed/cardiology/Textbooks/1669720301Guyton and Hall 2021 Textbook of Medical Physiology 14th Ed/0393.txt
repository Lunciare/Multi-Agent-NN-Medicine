Physical Basis for Smooth Muscle Contraction Cell membrane Smooth muscle does not have the same striated arrange- ment of actin and myosin filaments as is found in skeletal muscle. Instead, electron micrographic techniques sug- gest the physical organization shown in Figure 8-2, which illustrates large numbers of actin filaments attached to dense bodies. Some of these bodies are attached to the cell membrane, and others are dispersed inside the cell. Some of the membrane-d ense bodies of adjacent cells are bonded together by intercellular protein bridges. It is mainly through these bonds that the force of contraction Figure 8-2 Physical structure of smooth muscle.
