and permitting Ca2+ to diffuse rapidly into the sarcoplasm and initiate muscle contraction. During repolarization (bottom panel), the conformational change in the DHP receptor closes the Ca2+ release channels, and Ca2+ is transported from the sarcoplasm into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by an adenosine triphosphate–dependent calcium pump, called SERCA (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-A TPase).
