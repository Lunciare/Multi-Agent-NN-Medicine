This phenomenon it allows half the bipolar cells to transmit positive signals is demonstrated in Figure 51- 13, which shows a min- and the other half to transmit negative signals.

In other Another important aspect of this reciprocal relation words, instead of the excitatory signal spreading widely in between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells the retina because of spreading dendritic and axonal trees is that it provides a second mechanism for lateral inhi- in the plexiform layers, transmission through the hori- bition, in addition to the horizontal cell mechanism. zontal cells puts a stop to this spread by providing lateral Because depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells inhibition in the surrounding areas.
