of triglycerides, the result is hydrolysis of triglycerides. Second, a hormone- sensitive cellular lipase can be activated by several hormones from the endocrine glands, and this also promotes rapid hy- drolysis of triglycerides. This topic is discussed later in the chapter. Embedded Upon leaving fat cells, fatty acids ionize strongly in apolipoproteins the plasma and the ionic portion combines immediate- Figure 69-1 . Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles that consist of ly with albumin molecules of the plasma proteins. Fatty phospholipids and apolipoproteins on the outer surface and triglycer- acids bound in this manner are called free fatty acids ides and cholesterol inside. or nonesterified fatty acids, to distinguish them from other fatty acids in the plasma that exist in the form of (1) esters of glycerol, (2) cholesterol, or (3) other sub- half- life of less than 1 hour, so the plasma becomes clear stances. again within a few hours. The fat of the chylomicrons is The concentration of free fatty acids in the plasma un- removed mainly in the following way. der resting conditions is about 15 mg/dl, which is a total of only 0.45 gram of fatty acids in the entire circulatory Chylomicron Triglycerides Are Hydrolyzed by system.
