About 80% to 90% of the HCO 3− reabsorption (and Figure 31- 5 shows how the process of H+ secretion H+ secretion) occurs in the proximal tubule, so only a achieves HCO − reabsorption. The secretory process 3 small amount of HCO − flows into the distal tubules and begins when CO either diffuses into the tubular cells or 3 2 collecting ducts.
