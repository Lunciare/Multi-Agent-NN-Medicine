Currently, sodium intake is 130 almost always greater than necessary for homeostasis. In fact, the average sodium intake for persons in industrial- 120 ized cultures who eat processed foods usually ranges be- tween 100 and 200 mEq/day, even though humans can sur- 110 vive and function normally while ingesting only 10 to 20 mEq/day. Thus, most people eat far more sodium than is 100 necessary for homeostasis, and evidence indicates that our 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 usual high sodium intake may contribute to cardiovascular Sodium intake (mEq/L) disorders such as hypertension.
