Receptors I. Mechanoreceptors Skin tactile sensibilities (epidermis and dermis) • Free nerve endings • Expanded tip endings Merkel’s discs Plus several other variants • Spray endings Free nerve Expanded tip Tactile hair • Ruffini’s endings endings receptor • Encapsulated endings Meissner’s corpuscles Krause’s corpuscles • Hair end- organs Deep tissue sensibilities • Free nerve endings • Expanded tip endings • Spray endings Ruffini’s endings • Encapsulated endings Pacinian Meissner’s Krause’s corpuscle corpuscle corpuscle Pacinian corpuscles Plus a few other variants • Muscle endings Muscle spindles Golgi tendon receptors Hearing • Sound receptors of cochlea Equilibrium • Vestibular receptors Arterial pressure Ruffini’s Golgi tendon Muscle • Baroreceptors of carotid sinuses and aorta endings apparatus spindle II. Thermoreceptors Figure 47- 1 Several types of somatic sensory nerve endings. Cold • Cold receptors Warmth receptor, which stretches the receptor membrane and • Warm receptors opens ion channels; (2) by application of a chemical to III. Nociceptors the membrane, which also opens ion channels; (3) by Pain change of the temperature of the membrane, which alters • Free nerve endings the permeability of the membrane; or (4) by the effects of IV. Electromagnetic Receptors electromagnetic radiation, such as light on a retinal visual Vision
