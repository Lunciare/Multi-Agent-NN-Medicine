EXERCISE CONTROL OF SKELETAL MUSCLE BLOOD Strenuous exercise is one of the most stressful conditions FLOW that the normal circulatory system faces because there is such a large mass of skeletal muscle in the body, all of it Decreased Oxygen in Muscle Greatly Enhances Flow. requiring large amounts of blood flow. Also, the cardiac The large increase in muscle blood flow that occurs dur- output often must increase to four to five times normal ing skeletal muscle activity is caused mainly by chemicals in the nonathlete or to six to seven times normal in the released locally that act directly on the muscle arterioles well- trained athlete to satisfy the metabolic needs of the to cause dilation. One of the most important chemical ef- exercising muscles. fects is reduction of the oxygen level in the muscle tissues. When muscles are active, they use oxygen rapidly, thereby SKELETAL MUSCLE BLOOD FLOW RATE decreasing the oxygen concentration in the tissue fluids. This in turn causes local arteriolar vasodilation because During rest, skeletal muscle blood flow averages 3 to 4 ml/ min/100 g of muscle. During extreme exercise in the well- Rhythmic exercise conditioned athlete, this blood flow can increase 25- to 40
