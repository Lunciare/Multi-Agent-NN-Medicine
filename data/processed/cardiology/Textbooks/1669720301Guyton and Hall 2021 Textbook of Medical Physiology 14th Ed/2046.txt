4600 3100 When the person breathes into and out of the chamber, the drum rises and falls, and an appropriate recording is Total lung capacity 5800 4200 made. Figure 38- 6 shows a spirogram indicating changes in lung volume under different conditions of breathing. For ease in describing the events of pulmonary ventilation, Pulmonary Volumes the air in the lungs has been subdivided in this diagram Figure 38-6 lists four pulmonary lung volumes that when into four volumes and four capacities, which are the aver- added together, equal the maximum volume to which the ages for a young adult man. Table 38- 1 summarizes the lungs can be expanded. The lung volumes shown are for average pulmonary volumes and capacities for healthy average adult males, but lung volumes vary considerably men and women. depending on physical fitness, age, height, sex, and other factors, such as the altitude at which a person resides. The significance of each of these lung volumes is the following: 1. The tidal volume is the volume of air inspired or ex- Floating drum pired with each normal breath; it amounts to about 500 ml in the average healthy man. Oxygen Recording 2. The inspiratory reserve volume
