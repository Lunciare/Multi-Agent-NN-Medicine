The genes determine the char- acteristics of the cell’s proteins, including the structural RNA and proteins of the types found in ribosomes. The proteins, as well as the intracellular enzymes that control nucleolus enlarges considerably when the cell is actively cytoplasmic and nuclear activities. synthesizing proteins. The genes also control and promote cell reproduction. Formation of the nucleoli (and of the ribosomes in The genes first reproduce to create two identical sets of the cytoplasm outside the nucleus) begins in the nucleus. genes; then the cell splits by a special process called mito- First, specific DNA genes in the chromosomes cause sis to form two daughter cells, each of which receives one RNA to be synthesized. Some of this synthesized RNA is of the two sets of DNA genes.
