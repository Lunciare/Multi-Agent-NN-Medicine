Therefore, the local The walls of the capillaries are thin and constructed of conditions of the tissues—such as the concentrations of single- layer, highly permeable endothelial cells. Therefore, nutrients, end products of metabolism, and hydrogen water, cell nutrients, and cell excreta can all interchange ions—can cause direct effects on the vessels to control quickly and easily between the tissues and circulating local blood flow in each small tissue area. blood. The peripheral circulation of the entire body has about Structure of the Capillary Wall. Figure 16-2 shows the 10 billion capillaries, with a total surface area estimated to ultramicroscopic structure of typical endothelial cells in be 500 to 700 square meters (about one eighth the surface the capillary wall as found in most organs of the body, area of a football field). It is rare that any single functional especially in muscles and connective tissue. Note that cell of the body is more than 20 to 30 micrometers away the wall is composed of a unicellular layer of endothelial from a capillary. cells
