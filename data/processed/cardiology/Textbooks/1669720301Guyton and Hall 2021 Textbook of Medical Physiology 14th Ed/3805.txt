This process reduces the osmotic pressure of true of so many other glands, the secretory portion of the the sweat fluid to such a low level that most of the water sweat gland secretes a fluid called the primary secretion is also reabsorbed, which concentrates most of the other or precursor secretion; the concentrations of constituents constituents. Therefore, at low rates of sweating, such in the fluid are then modified as the fluid flows through constituents as urea, lactic acid, and potassium ions are the duct. usually very concentrated. 904 simredipE simreD Chapter 74 Body Temperature Regulation and Fever Conversely, when the sweat glands are strongly stimulated passage mucosa as a result of water evaporation from the by the sympathetic nervous system, large amounts of precur- mucosal surfaces, especially evaporation of saliva from the sor secretion are formed, and the duct may reabsorb only tongue.
