ion (OH−). The base portion of these PRECISELY REGULATED molecules reacts quickly with H+ to remove it from solu- tion and are, therefore, typical bases. For similar reasons, Precise H+ regulation is essential because the activities of the term alkalosis refers to the excess removal of H+ from almost all enzyme systems in the body are influenced by the body fluids, in contrast to the excess addition of H+, H+ concentration. Therefore, changes in H+ concentra- which is referred to as acidosis. tion alter virtually all cell and body functions. Compared with other ions, the H+ concentration Strong and Weak Acids and Bases. A strong acid, such of the body fluids normally is kept at a low level. For as HCl, rapidly dissociates and releases especially large example, the concentration of sodium in extracellular amounts of H+ in solution. Weak acids such as H CO are 2 3 fluid (142 mEq/L) is about 3.5 million times as great as less likely to dissociate their ions and, therefore, release the normal concentration of H+, which averages only H+ with less vigor. A strong base is one that reacts rap- 0.00004 mEq/L. Equally important, the normal variation idly and strongly with H+
