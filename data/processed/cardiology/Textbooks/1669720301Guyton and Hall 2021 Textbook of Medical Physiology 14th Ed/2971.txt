momentum must be over- Complex Movements come before the movement can be stopped. Because of momentum, all pendular movements have a tendency to In humans the lateral zones of the two cerebellar hemi- overshoot. If overshooting occurs in a person whose cer- spheres are highly developed and greatly enlarged. This ebellum has been destroyed, the conscious centers of the characteristic goes along with human abilities to plan and cerebrum eventually recognize this error and initiate a perform intricate sequential patterns of movement, espe- movement in the reverse direction to attempt to bring the cially with the hands and fingers, and to speak. Yet, the arm to its intended position. However, the arm, by virtue large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres have no of its momentum, overshoots once more in the opposite direct input of information from the peripheral parts of direction, and appropriate corrective signals must again the body. In addition, almost all communication between be instituted. Thus, the arm oscillates back and forth past these lateral cerebellar areas and the cerebral cortex is not its intended point for several cycles before it finally fixes with the primary cerebral motor cortex but instead with on its mark. This effect
