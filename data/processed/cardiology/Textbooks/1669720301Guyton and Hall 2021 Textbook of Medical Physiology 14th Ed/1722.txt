as common as metabolic acidosis, but some of the causes of are described in the following sections. metabolic alkalosis are described in the following sections. Renal Tubular Acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis results Administration of Diuretics (Except Carbonic Anhy- from a defect in renal secretion of H+, reabsorption of drase Inhibitors). All diuretics cause increased flow of fluid HCO −, or both. These disorders are generally of two types: 3 along the tubules, usually increasing flow in the distal and (1) impairment of renal tubular HCO − reabsorption, caus- 3 collecting tubules. This effect leads to increased reabsorp- ing loss of HCO − in the urine; or (2) inability of the renal 3 tion of Na+ from these parts of the nephrons. Because the tubular H+ secretory mechanism to establish normal acid- sodium reabsorption here is coupled with H+ secretion, the ic urine, causing the excretion of alkaline urine. In these enhanced sodium reabsorption also leads to an increase in cases, inadequate amounts of titratable acid and NH + are 4 H+ secretion and increase in bicarbonate reabsorption. Re- excreted, so there is net accumulation of acid in the body ductions in extracellular fluid volume associated with the fluids. Some causes
