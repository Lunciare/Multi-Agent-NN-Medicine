Also, much chemical intermediary processing of these nutrients EFFECT OF GUT ACTIVITY AND occurs in the liver cells. These nutritional functions of the METABOLIC FACTORS ON liver are discussed in Chapters 68 through 72. Almost all GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW of the fats absorbed from the intestinal tract are not car- ried in the portal blood but instead are absorbed into the Under normal conditions, the blood flow in each area of intestinal lymphatics and then conducted to the systemic the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in each layer of the circulating blood by way of the thoracic duct, bypassing gut wall, is directly related to the level of local activity. For the liver. example, during active absorption of nutrients, blood flow in the villi and adjacent regions of the submucosa increases ANATOMY OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL as much as eightfold. Likewise, blood flow in the muscle BLOOD SUPPLY layers of the intestinal wall increases with increased motor activity in the gut. After a meal, the motor activity, secre- Figure 63-
