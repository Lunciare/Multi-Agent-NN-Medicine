piratory Control. The slow replacement of alveolar air is 175 of particular importance in preventing sudden changes in gas concentrations in the blood. This makes the respira- 150 tory control mechanism much more stable than it would 125 be otherwise, and it helps prevent excessive increases and 800 ml CO /min decreases in tissue oxygenation, tissue CO concentration, 2 2 100 and tissue pH when respiration is temporarily interrupted. 75 Oxygen Concentration and Partial Pressure in Alveoli 50 Normal alveolar PCO 2 A Oxygen is continually being absorbed from the alveoli into 25 200 ml CO /min 2 the blood of the lungs, and new O is continually being 2 0 breathed into the alveoli from the atmosphere.
