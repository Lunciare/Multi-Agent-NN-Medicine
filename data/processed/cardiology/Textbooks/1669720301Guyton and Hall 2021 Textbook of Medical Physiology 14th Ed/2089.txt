For example, when a person is in the upright position, the pulmonary arterial pressure at the lung apex is about 15 mm Hg less ZONE 2 than the pressure at the level of the heart. Therefore, the Artery PALV Vein apical systolic pressure is only 10 mm Hg (25 mm Hg at heart level minus 15 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure differ- ence). This 10 mm Hg apical blood pressure is greater Ppc than the 0 alveolar air pressure, so blood flows through the pulmonary apical capillaries during cardiac systole. ZONE 3 Conversely, during diastole, the 8 mm Hg diastolic pres- sure at the level of the heart is not sufficient to push Artery PALV
