Blockade of Ang II formation may, in these cases, relieve some of the ROLE OF ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE IN sodium and water retention and attenuate the large expan- CONTROLLING RENAL WATER EXCRETION sion of extracellular fluid volume associated with heart fail- ure. As discussed in Chapter 29, ADH plays an important role in allowing the kidneys to form a small volume of concentrated urine while excreting normal amounts of salt. This effect is especially important during water ROLE OF ALDOSTERONE IN CONTROLLING deprivation, which strongly elevates plasma levels of RENAL EXCRETION ADH that, in turn, increase water reabsorption by the Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption, especially in kidneys and help minimize the decreases in extracellular the collecting tubules and collecting ducts.
