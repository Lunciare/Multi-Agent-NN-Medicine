replacement of this muscle by scar tissue; and (2) multiple small local blocks in the conduction of In Figure 12-17, a small area in the base of the left ven- impulses at many points in the Purkinje system. As a tricle is newly infarcted (i.e., there is loss of coronary result, cardiac impulse conduction becomes irregular, blood flow). Therefore, during the T- P interval—that is, causing rapid shifts in voltages and axis deviations. when the normal ventricular muscle is totally polarized— This irregularity often causes double or even triple abnormal negative current still flows from the infarcted peaks in some of the electrocardiographic leads, such area at the base of the left ventricle and spreads toward as those shown in Figure 12-14. the rest of the ventricles.
