these amino acids into protein. In addition, it inhibits breakdown of proteins that are already in the cells. To initiate its effects on target cells, insulin must first bind with and activate a membrane receptor protein that has a INSULIN CHEMISTRY AND SYNTHESIS molecular weight of about 300,000 (Figure 79- 3). The insulin receptor is a combination of four subunits Human insulin, which has a molecular weight of 5808, is held together by disulfide linkages: two alpha subunits that composed of two amino acid chains, shown in Figure 79- 2, lie entirely outside the cell membrane and two beta sub- that are connected to each other by disulfide linkages. units that penetrate through the membrane, protruding When the two amino acid chains are split apart, insulin’s into the cell cytoplasm.
