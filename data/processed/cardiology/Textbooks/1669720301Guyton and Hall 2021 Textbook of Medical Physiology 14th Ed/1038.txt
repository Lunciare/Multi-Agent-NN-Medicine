muscle blood flow averages 3 to 4 ml/ min/100 g of muscle. During extreme exercise in the well- Rhythmic exercise conditioned athlete, this blood flow can increase 25- to 40 50-f old, rising to 100 to 200 ml/min/100 g of muscle. Peak blood flows as high as 400 ml/min/100 g of muscle have been reported for thigh muscles of endurance- trained athletes. 20 Blood Flow During Muscle Contractions. Figure 21- 1 shows a record of blood flow changes in a calf muscle of a leg during strong rhythmic muscular exercise.
