The pituicytes do not secrete hormones; they the neurophysin and the hormone are secreted together, act simply as a supporting structure for large numbers but because they are only loosely bound to each other, the of terminal nerve fibers and terminal nerve endings from hormone separates almost immediately.

These tracts pass to the neurohypophysis Chemical Structures of Antidiuretic Hormone through the pituitary stalk (hypophysial stalk). The nerve and Oxytocin endings are bulbous knobs that contain many secretory granules. These endings lie on the surfaces of capillaries, Both oxytocin and ADH (vasopressin) are polypeptides, where they secrete two posterior pituitary hormones: (1) each containing nine amino acids.
