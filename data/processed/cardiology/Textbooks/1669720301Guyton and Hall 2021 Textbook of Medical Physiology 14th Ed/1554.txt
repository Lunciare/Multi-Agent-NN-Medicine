Thus, when sodium intake is increased intake more than sixfold under two conditions: (1) under after blocking the total ADH- thirst system, relatively normal conditions; and (2) after the aldosterone feedback system was blocked by removing the adrenal glands and large changes in plasma sodium concentration occur. In infusing the animals with aldosterone at a constant rate so the absence of the ADH- thirst mechanisms, no other that plasma levels could not increase or decrease. Note that feedback mechanism is capable of adequately regulating when sodium intake was increased sixfold, plasma concen- plasma sodium concentration and osmolarity. tration changed only about 1% to 2% in either case.
