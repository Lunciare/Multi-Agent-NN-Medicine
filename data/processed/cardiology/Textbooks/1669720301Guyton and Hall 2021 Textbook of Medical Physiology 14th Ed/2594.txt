the same distance beyond a lens, provided that the lens changes its convexity. Formation of an Image by a Convex Lens Figure 50- 7A shows a convex lens with two point sources of light to the left. Because light rays pass through the center of a convex lens without being refracted in either direction, the light rays from each point source of light are shown to Point source of light come to a point focus on the opposite side of the lens di- rectly in line with the point source and the center of the lens. Any object in front of the lens is, in reality, a mosaic of point sources of light. Some of these points are very bright and some are very weak, and they vary in color. Each point source of light on the object comes to a separate point focus on the opposite side of the lens in line with the lens center. If a white sheet of paper is placed at the focus distance from the lens, one can see an image of the object, as demonstrat- ed in Figure 50- 7B. However, this image is upside down B with respect to the original object,
