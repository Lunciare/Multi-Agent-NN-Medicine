Sensory Physiology the velocities of transmission are only a third to half those in the dorsal column–medial lemniscal system, ranging C2 from 8 to 40 m/sec; (2) the degree of spatial localization of signals is poor; (3) the gradations of intensities are also C2 far less accurate, with most of the sensations being rec- C3 ognized in 10 to 20 gradations of strength, rather than C4 C3 C6 C4 C5 C8 as many as 100 gradations for the dorsal column system; C5 C7 T2 and (4) the ability to transmit rapidly changing or rapidly T2 T1 T3 repetitive signals is poor. T3 T4 T T4 5 T4 T5 Thus, it is evident that the anterolateral system is a T5 T6 cruder type of transmission system than the dorsal col- T1 T7 T6 T7 T8 umn–medial lemniscal system. Even so, certain modali- T8 T9 T9 ties of sensation are transmitted only in this system and not at all in the dorsal column–medial lemniscal system. T10 T12 T10 L3 T11 These are pain, temperature, tickle, itch, and sexual sensa- T11 L5 tions, in addition to crude touch and pressure.
