Cholecystokinin (CCK), which is secreted by the du- denum and jejunum. When acid chyme with a pH less odenal and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters than 4.5 to 5.0 enters the duodenum from the stomach, it the small intestine causes duodenal mucosal release and activation of secre- 816 Chapter 65 Secretory Functions of the Alimentary Tract tin, which is then absorbed into the blood. The one truly Water and potent constituent of chyme that causes secretin release is NaHCO 3 hydrochloric acid from the stomach. Enzymes Secretin in turn causes the pancreas to secrete large quantities of fluid containing a high concentration of HCO − (up to 145 mEq/L) but a low concentration of 3 Cl−. The secretin mechanism is especially important for two reasons. First, secretin begins to be released from the mucosa of the small intestine when the pH of the duode- nal contents falls below 4.5 to 5.0, and its release increases greatly as the pH falls to 3.0. This mechanism immediately causes copious secretion of pancreatic juice that contains abundant amounts of sodium bicarbonate. The net result is then the following reaction in the duodenum: HCI Soap Peptone HCl+NaHCO 3→NaCl+H 2CO 3 Figure 65- 9.
