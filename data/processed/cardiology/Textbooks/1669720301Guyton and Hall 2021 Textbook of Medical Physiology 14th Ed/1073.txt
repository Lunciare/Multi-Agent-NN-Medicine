Then, there is a short period of relative safety, followed by a second period of cardiac irritability begin- Non- Non- ning 1 hour or so later and lasting for another few hours. functional functional Fibrillation can also occur many days after the infarct but Dead fibers is less likely to occur then. At least four factors are involved in the tendency for Nonfunctional the heart to fibrillate, as follows: 1. Acute loss of blood supply to the cardiac muscle causes rapid depletion of potassium from the ischem- ic musculature. This also increases the potassium concentration in the extracellular fluids surrounding Dead fibers Fibrous tissue the cardiac muscle fibers. Experiments in which po- Figure 21- 8.
