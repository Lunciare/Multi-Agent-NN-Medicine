Blood trauma causes (1) activation of factor XII and Within a few seconds, in the presence of Ca2+, pro- (2) release of platelet phospholipids. Trauma to the thrombin is split to form thrombin, and the clot- blood or exposure of the blood to vascular wall col- ting process proceeds as already explained. At first, lagen alters two important clotting factors in the the factor V in the prothrombin activator complex blood: factor XII and the platelets. When factor XII is inactive, but once clotting begins and thrombin is disturbed, such as by coming into contact with begins to form, the proteolytic action of thrombin collagen or with a wettable surface such as glass, it activates factor V. This activation then becomes an takes on a new molecular configuration that con- additional strong accelerator of prothrombin ac- verts it into a proteolytic enzyme called activated tivation. Thus, in the final prothrombin activator factor XII. Simultaneously, the blood trauma also complex, activated factor X is the actual protease damages the platelets because of adherence to col- that causes splitting of prothrombin to form throm- lagen or to a wettable surface (or by damage in other bin. Activated factor V greatly accelerates this
