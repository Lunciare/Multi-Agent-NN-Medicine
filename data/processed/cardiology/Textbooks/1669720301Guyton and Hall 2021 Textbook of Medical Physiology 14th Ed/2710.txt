the Visual NEURONAL PATTERNS OF Field. As the visual signal progresses farther away from STIMULATION DURING ANALYSIS OF layer IV, some neurons respond to lines that are oriented VISUAL IMAGES in the same direction but are not position- specific. That is, even if a line is displaced moderate distances laterally Analysis of Contrasts in Visual Images. If a person or vertically in the field, the same few neurons will still be looks at a blank wall, only a few neurons in the primary stimulated if the line has the same direction. These cells visual cortex will be stimulated, regardless of whether the are called complex cells. illumination of the wall is bright or weak. Therefore, what does the primary visual cortex detect? To answer this Detection of Lines of Specific Lengths, Angles, or question, let us now place on the wall a large solid cross, Other Shapes. Some neurons in the outer layers of the as shown to the left in Figure 52- 5. To the right is shown primary visual columns, as well as neurons in some sec- the spatial pattern of the most excited neurons in the ondary visual areas, are stimulated only by lines or bor- visual
