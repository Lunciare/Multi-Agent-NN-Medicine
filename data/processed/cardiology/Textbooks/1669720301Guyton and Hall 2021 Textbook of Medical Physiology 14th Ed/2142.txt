This increase Measurement of Diffusing Capacity—Carbon Monox- is caused by several factors, including the following: (1) ide Method. The O diffusing capacity can be calculated opening up of many previously dormant pulmonary capil- 2 from measurements of the following: (1) alveolar Po ; (2) laries or extra dilation of already open capillaries, thereby 2 Po in the pulmonary capillary blood; and (3) the rate of increasing the surface area of the blood into which the O 2 2 O uptake by the blood. However, measuring the Po in the 2 2 can diffuse; and (2) a better match between the ventilation pulmonary capillary blood is so difficult and imprecise that of the alveoli and perfusion of the alveolar capillaries with 517 )gHmm/nim/lm( yticapac gnisuffiD UNIT VII UNIT VII Respiration it is not practical to measure oxygen
