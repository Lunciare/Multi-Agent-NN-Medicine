After the hormone binds to the receptor in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, the hormone-r eceptor complex binds to the hormone response element (promoter) on the DNA. This action either activates or inhibits gene transcription, formation of messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein synthesis. 923 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction Table 75- 3 Hormones That Use the Adenylyl Cyclase– Table 75- 4 Hormones That Use the Phospholipase C cAMP Second Messenger System Second Messenger System Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Angiotensin II (vascular smooth muscle) Angiotensin II (epithelial cells) Catecholamines (α receptors) Calcitonin Gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) Catecholamines (beta receptors) Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) Corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) Follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) Oxytocin Glucagon Thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH) Growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) Vasopressin (V receptor, vascular smooth muscle) 1 Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Luteinizing hormone (LH) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) Once cAMP is formed inside the cell, it usually acti- Secretin vates a cascade of enzymes.
