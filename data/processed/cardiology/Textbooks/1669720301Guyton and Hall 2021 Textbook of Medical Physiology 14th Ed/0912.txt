AV, Arteriovenous. (Modified from For example, surgical reduction of kidney mass or Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: WB injury to the kidney due to hypertension, diabetes, or Saunders, 1980.) various kidney diseases all cause blood pressure to be more sensitive to changes in salt intake. In these cases, greater than normal increases in arterial pressure are amounts of salt and water are lost from the body; this pro- required to raise renal output sufficiently to maintain cess continues until the arterial pressure returns to the a balance between the intake and output of salt and equilibrium pressure level.
