At the end of this time, the osteoclasts disap- of preosteoclasts into mature osteoclasts by binding to RANKL and pear, the tunnel is invaded by osteoblasts, and new bone preventing it from interacting with its receptor on preosteoclasts. The mature osteoclasts develop a ruffled border and release enzymes begins to develop. Bone deposition continues for several from lysosomes, as well as acids that promote bone resorption. Os- months, with the new bone being laid down in successive teocytes are osteoblasts that have become encased in bone matrix layers of concentric circles (lamellae) on the inner sur- during bone tissue production; the osteocytes form a system of inter- faces of the cavity until the tunnel is filled. Deposition of connected cells that spreads throughout the bone. new bone ceases when the bone begins to encroach on the blood vessels supplying the area. The canal through cells do not have PTH receptors. Instead, the osteoblasts which these vessels run, called the haversian canal, is signal osteoclast precursors to form mature osteoclasts. all that remains of the original cavity. Each new area of Two osteoblast proteins responsible for this signaling are bone deposited in this way is called an osteon, as shown in
