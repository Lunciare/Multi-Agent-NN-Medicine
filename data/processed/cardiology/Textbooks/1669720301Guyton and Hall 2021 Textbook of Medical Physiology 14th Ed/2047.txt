The residual volume is the volume of air remaining 6000 in the lungs after the most forceful expiration; this volume averages about 1200 ml. 5000 Pulmonary Capacities Inspiratory Inspiratory Vital Total lung reserve capacity capacity capacity In describing events in the pulmonary cycle, it is some- 4000 volume times useful to consider two or more of the volumes together.
