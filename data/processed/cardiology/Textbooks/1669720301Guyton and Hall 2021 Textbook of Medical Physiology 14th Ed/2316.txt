This vasoconstriction immobilized standing position, the pressure in the veins of results from the hypoxic vascular constrictor effect the feet becomes greatly increased (to ≈450 mm Hg). In the that normally operates to divert blood flow from sitting position, the pressure becomes nearly 300 mm Hg. In low- O to high-O alveoli, as explained in Chapter 2 2 addition, as pressure in the vessels of the lower body increas- 39. However, because all the alveoli are now in the es, these vessels passively dilate so that a major portion of low- O 2 state, all the arterioles become constricted, the blood from the upper body is translocated into the lower the pulmonary arterial pressure rises excessively, vessels. Because the heart cannot pump unless blood returns and the right side of the heart fails. to it, the greater the quantity of blood “pooled” in this way 3. The alveolar arteriolar spasm diverts much of the in the lower body, the less is available for the cardiac output. blood flow through nonalveolar pulmonary vessels, Figure 44- 3 shows the changes in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (top
