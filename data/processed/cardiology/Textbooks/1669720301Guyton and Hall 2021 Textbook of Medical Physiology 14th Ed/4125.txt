Somatostatin acts locally within the islets of Langer- hans themselves to depress secretion of both insulin and glucagon. 2 2. Somatostatin decreases motility of the stomach, duode- num, and gallbladder. 1 3. Somatostatin decreases both secretion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. 0 In putting all this information together, it has been sug- 60 80 100 120 gested that the principal role of somatostatin is to extend Blood glucose the period over which the food nutrients are assimilated (mg/100 ml) into the blood.
