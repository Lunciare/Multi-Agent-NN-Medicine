This topographical organization is stem, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These lower centers, demonstrated even more graphically in Figure 56- 2, in turn, send specific control signals to the muscles. which shows the degrees of representation of the different For a few types of movements, however, the cortex has muscle areas as mapped by Penfield and Rasmussen.
