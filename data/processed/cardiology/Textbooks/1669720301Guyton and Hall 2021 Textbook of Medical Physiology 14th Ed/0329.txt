However, the total amount 30 of phosphocreatine in the muscle fiber is also small, only about 5 times as great as the ATP. Therefore, the com- bined energy of both the stored ATP and the phosphocre- 20 atine in the muscle is capable of causing maximal muscle contraction for only 5 to 8 seconds. The second important source of energy, which is 10 used to reconstitute both ATP and phosphocreatine, is a process called glycolysis—the breakdown of glycogen previously stored in the muscle cells. Rapid enzymatic 0 breakdown of the glycogen to pyruvic acid and lactic 0 1 2 3 4 acid liberates energy that is used to convert ADP to ATP; Load-opposing contraction (kg) the ATP can then be used directly to energize additional Figure 6-11 Relationship of load to velocity of contraction in a skel- muscle contraction and also to re- form the stores of etal muscle with a cross section of 1 square centimeter and a length phosphocreatine. of 8 centimeters. The importance of this glycolysis mechanism is twofold. First, glycolytic reactions can occur even in the absence of the
