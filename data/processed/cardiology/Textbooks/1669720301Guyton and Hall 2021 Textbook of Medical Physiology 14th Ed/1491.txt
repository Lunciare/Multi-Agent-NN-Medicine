Note that after water ingestion, urine volume increases and ues are in milliosmoles per liter.) urine osmolarity decreases, causing excretion of a large volume of dilute urine; however, the total amount of solute excreted by the Tubular Fluid Is Diluted in the Ascending Loop of kidneys remains relatively constant. These responses of the kidneys prevent plasma osmolarity from decreasing markedly during excess Henle. In the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, es- water ingestion. pecially in the thick segment, sodium, potassium, and chloride are avidly reabsorbed. However, this portion of Figure 29-1 shows the approximate renal responses in the tubular segment is impermeable to water, even in the a human after ingestion of 1 liter of water. Note that urine presence of large amounts of ADH. Therefore, the tubular volume increased to about six times normal within 45 min- fluid becomes more dilute as it flows up the ascending utes after the water had been ingested. However, the total loop of Henle into the early distal tubule, with the osmo- amount of solute excreted remained relatively constant larity decreasing progressively to about 100 mOsm/L by because the urine formed became dilute, and urine osmo- the time the fluid enters
