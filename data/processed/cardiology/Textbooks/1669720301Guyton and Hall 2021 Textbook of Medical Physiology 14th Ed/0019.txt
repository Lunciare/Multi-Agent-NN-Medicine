This subject is discussed in Chapter 3. Sensor Controlled variable Many other control systems operate within the organs Figure 1-3. Negative feedback control of arterial pressure by the ar- to regulate functions of the individual parts of the organs; terial baroreceptors. Signals from the sensor (baroreceptors) are sent others operate throughout the entire body to control the to the medulla of the brain, where they are compared with a refer- ence set point. When arterial pressure increases above normal, this interrelationships between the organs. For example, the abnormal pressure increases nerve impulses from the baroreceptors respiratory system, operating in association with the to the medulla of the brain, where the input signals are compared nervous system, regulates the concentration of carbon with the set point, generating an error signal that leads to decreased dioxide in the extracellular fluid. The liver and pancreas sympathetic nervous system activity. Decreased sympathetic activity control glucose concentration in the extracellular fluid, causes dilation of blood vessels and reduced pumping activity of the heart, which return arterial pressure toward normal. and the kidneys regulate concentrations of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphate, and other ions in the extracellular fluid. Regulation of Arterial Blood Pressure. Several systems contribute to
