Located in the middle of brain, the activation of each of which plays its own role in all these structures is the extremely small hypothalamus, controlling a different quality of brain function. which from a physiological point of view is one of the cen- tral elements of the limbic system. Figure 59- 5 illustrates LIMBIC SYSTEM schematically this key position of the hypothalamus in the limbic system and shows other subcortical structures of The word “limbic” means “border.” Originally, the term the limbic system surrounding it, including the septum, “limbic” was used to describe the border structures paraolfactory area, anterior nucleus of the thalamus, por- around the basal regions of
