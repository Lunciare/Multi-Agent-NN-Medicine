Thus, the fol- pulses cause the medullae to secrete epinephrine and nor- lowing three major changes occur simultaneously, each of epinephrine into the circulating blood. These two hormones which helps increase arterial pressure: are carried in the blood stream to all parts of the body, 1. Most arterioles of the systemic circulation are con- where they act directly on all blood vessels and usually stricted, which greatly increases the total peripheral cause vasoconstriction. In a few tissues, epinephrine causes resistance, thereby increasing the arterial pressure. vasodilation because it also stimulates beta- adrenergic re- 2. The veins especially (but the other large vessels of ceptors, which dilates rather than constricts certain vessels, the circulation as well) are strongly constricted. This as discussed in Chapter 61. constriction displaces blood out of the large periph- eral blood vessels toward the heart, thus increasing Sympathetic Vasodilator System and Its Control by the the volume of blood in the heart chambers.
