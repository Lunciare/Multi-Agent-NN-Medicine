Action by Altering Intracellular “Second After secretion of norepinephrine by the terminal Messenger” Enzymes. Another way a receptor often nerve endings, it is removed from the secretory site in functions is to activate or inactivate an enzyme (or other three ways: (1) reuptake into the adrenergic nerve endings intracellular chemical) inside the cell. The enzyme often by an active transport process, accounting for removal of is attached to the receptor protein where the receptor 50% to 80% of the secreted norepinephrine; (2) diffusion protrudes into the interior of the cell. For example, bind- away from the nerve endings into the surrounding body ing of norepinephrine with its receptor on the outside of fluids and then into the blood, accounting for removal of many cells increases the activity of the enzyme adenylyl most of the remaining norepinephrine; and (3) destruc- cyclase on the inside of the cell, which causes formation tion of small amounts by tissue enzymes. One of these of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP enzymes is monoamine oxidase, which is found in the in turn can initiate any one of many different intracellular nerve endings, and another is catechol- O- methyl transfer- actions, with the exact effect depending
