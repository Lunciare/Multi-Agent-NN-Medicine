Activation of renin- angiotensin system and in- creased reabsorption of water and salt by renal 80 tubules. The reduced blood flow to the kidneys causes a marked increase in renin secretion by the 60 kidneys, which in turn increases the formation of angiotensin II, as described in Chapter 19. Angio- 40 13 mm Hg tensin II, in turn, has a direct effect on the arteri- oles of the kidneys to decrease blood flow through 20 the kidneys further, which reduces the pressure in the peritubular capillaries surrounding the renal tu- 0 Normal 1/2 Normal Zero bules, promoting greatly increased reabsorption of Cardiac output water and salt from the tubules.
