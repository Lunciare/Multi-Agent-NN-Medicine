OF VITAMIN D 1,25-d ihydroxycholecalciferol. This latter substance is by far the most active form of vitamin D because the The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-d ihydroxycholecalciferol, previous products in the scheme of Figure 80-8 have has several effects on the intestines, kidneys, and bones less than 1/1000 of the vitamin D effect. Therefore, in that increase absorption of calcium and phosphate into the absence of the kidneys, vitamin D loses almost all its the extracellular fluid and contribute to feedback regula- effectiveness. tion of these substances.
