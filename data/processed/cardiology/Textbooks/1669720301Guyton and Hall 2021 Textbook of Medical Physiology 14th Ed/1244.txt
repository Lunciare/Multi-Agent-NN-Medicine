Because of the Donnan effect, the concentration of positively charged ions (cations) is slightly greater (∼2%) in MEASUREMENT OF BODY FLUID plasma than in interstitial fluid. Plasma proteins have a net COMPARTMENT VOLUMES— negative charge and therefore tend to bind cations such as INDICATOR- DILUTION PRINCIPLE sodium and potassium ions, thus holding extra amounts of these cations in the plasma, along with the plasma proteins.
