The EPSP that will elicit an ac- Excitatory tion potential in the axon initial segment is between +10 and +20 mV, in contrast to the +30 or +40 mV or more (cid:31)45 mV required on the soma. Once the action potential begins, it travels peripherally Na+ along the axon and usually also backward over the soma. influx In some cases, it travels backward into the dendrites but Excited neuron Spread of action potential not into all of them because they, like the neuronal soma, C have very few voltage-g ated sodium channels and there- Cl(cid:31) influx fore frequently cannot generate action potentials at all. Inhibitory Thus, in Figure 46- 10B, the threshold for excitation of the (cid:31)70 mV neuron is shown to be about −45 mV, which represents an EPSP of +20 mV—that is, 20 mV more positive than the normal resting neuronal potential of −65 mV.
