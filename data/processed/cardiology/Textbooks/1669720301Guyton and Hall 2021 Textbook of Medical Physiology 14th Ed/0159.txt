This phenomenon occurs when cells are up to form the equatorial plate of the mitotic spindle. grown in tissue culture; the cells grow until they contact a solid object, and then growth stops. Third, cells grown in Anaphase. During the anaphase stage (see Figure tissue culture often stop growing when minute amounts 3-14 F), the two chromatids of each chromosome are of their own secretions are allowed to collect in the culture pulled apart at the centromere.
