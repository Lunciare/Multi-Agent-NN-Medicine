This hormone, also called corticotropin or netic mutations or excessive licorice ingestion, or when adrenocorticotropin, also enhances the production of ad- circulating cortisol concentrations are extremely high, renal androgens. as in Cushing’s syndrome, this mechanism for cortisol metabolism may be overwhelmed. As a result, the high Chemistry of ACTH. ACTH has been isolated in pure levels of cortisol strongly activate the mineralocorticoid form from the anterior pituitary. It is a large polypep- receptor and cause sodium retention, hypertension, and tide, having a chain length of 39 amino acids. A smaller hypokalemia. polypeptide, a digested product of ACTH having a chain 966 Chapter 78 Adrenocortical Hormones length of 24 amino acids, has all the effects of the total Hypothalamus Excites molecule. Stress ACTH Secretion Is Controlled by Corticotropin- Releasing Factor From the Hypothalamus. In the same way that other pituitary hormones are controlled by releas- Portal Median ing factors from the hypothalamus, an important releasing vessel eminence (CRF) factor also controls ACTH secretion. This factor is called corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF).
