cytochrome oxidase to cause the formation of water mol- atoms are oxidized in conjunction with the chemi- ecules. During the transport of these electrons through the osmotic mechanism shown in Figure 68- 7, with the electron transport chain, energy is released that is used to release of 3 ATP molecules per 2 atoms of hydrogen cause the synthesis of ATP, as follows. metabolized. This process gives an additional 30 ATP Electron Transport Chain Releases Energy Used to molecules. Pump Hydrogen Ions Into the Outer Chamber of the 4. The remaining 4 hydrogen atoms are released by their Mitochondrion. As the electrons pass through the electron dehydrogenase into the chemiosmotic oxidative schema transport chain, large amounts of energy are released. This in the mitochondrion beyond the first stage of Figure energy is used to pump hydrogen ions from the inner ma- 68- 7. Two ATP molecules are usually released for every trix of the mitochondrion (to the right in Figure 68-7 ) into 2 hydrogen atoms oxidized, thus giving a total of 4 more the outer chamber between the inner and outer mitochon- ATP molecules. drial membranes (to the left). This process creates a high Now, adding all the ATP molecules
