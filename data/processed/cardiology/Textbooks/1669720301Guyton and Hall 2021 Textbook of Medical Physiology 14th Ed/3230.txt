Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow and Effect of neuronal activity. Therefore, it is fortunate that increased H+ concentration also elicits increased blood flow, which Brain Activity on Flow. A method has been developed in turn carries H+, CO , and other acid-f orming substanc- to record blood flow in as many as 256 isolated segments 2 of the human cerebral cortex simultaneously. To record es away from the brain tissues. Loss of CO removes car- 2 blood flow in these segments, a radioactive substance, such bonic acid from the tissues; this action, along with removal as radioactive xenon (Xe), is injected into the carotid ar- of other acids, reduces the H+ concentration back toward tery; then the radioactivity of each segment of the cortex normal. Thus, this mechanism helps maintain a constant is recorded as the radioactive substance passes through the H+ concentration in the cerebral fluids and thereby helps brain tissue. For this purpose, 256 small radioactive scintil- to maintain a normal, constant level of neuronal activity. lation detectors are pressed against the surface of the cor- Oxygen Deficiency
