At other times, rhythms of 3:2 or 3:1 may do not start their own beating until after a delay of 5 to 30 develop. In contrast to type I block, with type II block the seconds. This delay results from the phenomenon called P- R interval does not change before the dropped beat; overdrive suppression. Overdrive suppression means that it remains fixed. Type II block is generally caused by an ventricular excitability is at first suppressed because the abnormality of the bundle of His–Purkinje system and ventricles have been driven by the atria at a rate greater may require implantation of a pacemaker to prevent pro- than their natural rate of rhythm.
