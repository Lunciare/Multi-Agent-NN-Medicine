However, when the calcium Receptor ion concentration rises to 10−6 to 10−5 mol/L, enough binding occurs to cause all the intracellular actions of calmodulin. This is almost exactly the same amount of calcium ion change in skeletal muscle that is required to G protein activate troponin C, which causes skeletal muscle con- Cell membrane traction, as explained in Chapter 7. It is interesting that troponin C is similar to calmodulin in both function and Phospholipase C protein structure.
