(mmHg) can bind with a maximum of 1.34 ml of O (1.39 ml when 2 Figure 41-8 Oxygen- hemoglobin dissociation curve. the hemoglobin is chemically pure, but impurities such as methemoglobin reduce this). Therefore, 15 times 1.34 ROLE OF HEMOGLOBIN IN OXYGEN equals 20.1, which means that on average, the 15 grams of TRANSPORT hemoglobin in 100 ml of blood can combine with a total of about 20 ml of O if the hemoglobin is 100% saturated. 2 Normally, about 97% of the oxygen transported from the This is usually expressed as 20 volume percent. The O - 2 lungs to the tissues is carried in chemical combination with hemoglobin dissociation curve for the normal person can hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The remaining 3% is also be expressed in terms of volume percent of O , as 2 transported in the dissolved state in the water of the plasma shown by the far right scale in Figure 41-8, instead of per- and blood cells. Thus, under normal conditions, oxygen is cent saturation of hemoglobin. carried to the tissues almost entirely by hemoglobin.
