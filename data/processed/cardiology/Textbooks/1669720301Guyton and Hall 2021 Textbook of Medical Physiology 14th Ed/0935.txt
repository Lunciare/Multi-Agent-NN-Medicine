Angiotensin II acts directly on the kidneys to cause The second principal means whereby angiotensin II salt and water retention. increases the arterial pressure is decreased excretion of salt 2. Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete and water by the kidneys due to stimulation of aldoste- aldosterone, and the aldosterone in turn increases salt rone secretion, as well as direct effects on the kidneys.
