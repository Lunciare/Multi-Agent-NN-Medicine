When blood flows forms: through the vessel, an electrical voltage proportional to the rate of blood flow is generated between the two electrodes, ∆P=F×R and this voltage is recorded using an appropriate voltmeter ∆P or electronic recording apparatus. Figure 14-4C shows an R= actual probe that is placed on a large blood vessel to record F its blood flow. The probe contains both the strong magnet and the electrodes. BLOOD FLOW A special advantage of the electromagnetic flowmeter is that it can record changes in flow in less than 1/100 of Blood flow rate means the quantity of blood that passes a second, allowing for the accurate recording of pulsatile a given point in the circulation in a given period of time. changes in flow, as well as steady flow. 174 Chapter 14
