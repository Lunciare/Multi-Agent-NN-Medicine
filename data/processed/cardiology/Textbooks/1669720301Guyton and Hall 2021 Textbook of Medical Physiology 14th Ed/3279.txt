my- enteric and submucosal plexuses (black Submucosal fibers); (2) extrinsic control of these plex- plexus uses by the sympathetic and parasympa- thetic nervous systems (red fibers); and Sensory (3) sensory fibers passing from the lumi- neurons nal epithelium and gut wall to the enteric plexuses, then to the prevertebral ganglia Epithelium of the spinal cord and directly to the spi- nal cord and brain stem (green fibers). DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MYENTERIC AND SUBMUCOSAL PLEXUSES that causes various degrees of infolding of the gastrointes- tinal mucosa. The myenteric plexus consists mostly of a linear chain of many interconnecting neurons that extends the entire TYPES OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS length of the gastrointestinal tract. A section of this chain SECRETED BY ENTERIC NEURONS is shown in Figure 63- 4. Because the myenteric plexus extends all the way along Researchers have identified more than 25 potential neu- the intestinal wall and lies between the longitudinal and rotransmitter substances that are released by the nerve circular layers of intestinal smooth muscle, it is concerned endings of different types of enteric neurons, including mainly with controlling muscle activity along the length the following: (1) acetylcholine, (2) norepinephrine, (3) of the gut. When this plexus is stimulated, its
