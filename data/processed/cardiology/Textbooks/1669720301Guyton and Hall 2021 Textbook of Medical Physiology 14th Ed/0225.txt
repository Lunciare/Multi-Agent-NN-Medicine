Once they are both attached, the energy gradient of the sodium ion causes the sodium ion and the Na+ Na+ other substance to be transported together to the interior Outside of the cell. In counter- transport, sodium ions again attempt to dif- fuse to the interior of the cell because of their large con- centration gradient. However, this time, the substance to be transported is on the inside of the cell and is trans- Inside Ca2+ H+ ported to the outside.
