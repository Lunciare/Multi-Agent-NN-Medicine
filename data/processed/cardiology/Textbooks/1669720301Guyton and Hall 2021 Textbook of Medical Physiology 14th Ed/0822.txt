Drugs that block endothelin receptors have been used to treat pulmonary hyperten- sion but generally have not been used for lowering blood pressure in patients with systemic arterial hypertension. LONG- TERM BLOOD FLOW REGULATION Thus far, most of the mechanisms for local blood flow regulation that we have discussed act within a few sec- onds to a few minutes after the local tissue conditions have changed. Yet, even after full activation of these acute mechanisms, the blood flow usually is adjusted only about three quarters of the way to the exact additional requirements of the tissues. For example, when the arte- rial pressure suddenly increases from 100
