High concentrations of low-m olecular- weight soluble special cells, especially those epithelial cells that are specifi- monosaccharides would play havoc with the osmotic rela- cally adapted for active absorption of glucose. At other cell tions between intracellular and extracellular fluids. membranes, glucose is transported only from higher concen- tration toward lower concentration by facilitated diffusion, Glycogenesis—Formation of Glycogen made possible by the special binding properties of membrane The chemical reactions for glycogenesis are illustrated in glucose carrier protein.

Several specific enzymes are required to cause The rate of glucose transport, as well as transport of some these conversions, and any monosaccharide that can be other monosaccharides, is greatly increased in most cells converted into glucose can enter into the reactions.
