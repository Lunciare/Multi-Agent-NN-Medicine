eyes, the less the degree of register. This degree of nonregister pro- vides the neural mechanism for stereopsis, an important mechanism for judging the distances of visual objects up to about 200 feet (61 meters). Horizontal Torsional Vertical The neuronal cellular mechanism for stereopsis is strabismus strabismus strabismus based on the fact that some of the fiber pathways from the Figure 52- 10. Basic types of strabismus. retinas to the visual cortex stray 1 to 2 degrees on each 660 CHAPTER 52 The Eye: III. Central Neurophysiology of Vision refractive power. How does a person adjust accommoda- tion to keep the eyes in focus all the time? Accommodation of the lens is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that automatically adjusts the refrac- Edinger- tive power of the lens to achieve the highest degree of Pretectal Westphal Ciliary visual acuity. When the eyes have been focused on some far region nucleus ganglion object and must then suddenly focus on a near object, the N. III lens usually accommodates for best acuity of vision within less than 1 second. Although the precise control mecha- N. II nism that causes this rapid and accurate focusing of the eye is not fully understood,
