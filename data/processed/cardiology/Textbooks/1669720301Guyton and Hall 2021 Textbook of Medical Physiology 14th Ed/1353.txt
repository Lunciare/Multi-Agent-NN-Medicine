Increasing the hydrostatic pressure in Bow- of plasma filtered by the glomerular capillaries (filtration man’s capsule reduces GFR, whereas decreasing this pres- fraction). Increasing the arterial plasma colloid osmotic sure raises GFR. However, changes in Bowman’s capsule pressure raises the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure normally do not serve as a primary means for pressure, which in turn tends to decrease the GFR. regulating GFR. Increasing the filtration fraction also concentrates the In certain pathological states associated with obstruc- plasma proteins and raises the glomerular colloid osmotic tion of the urinary tract, Bowman’s capsule pressure can pressure (see Figure 27- 5). Because the filtration fraction increase markedly, causing serious
