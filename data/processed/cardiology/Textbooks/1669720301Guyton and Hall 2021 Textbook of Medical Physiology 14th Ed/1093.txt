and blood volume is an important factor in helping to com- pensate for the diminished pumping ability of the heart by increasing the venous return. The increased blood vol- 10 ume increases venous return in two ways. First, it increas- es the mean systemic filling pressure, which increases the pressure gradient for causing venous flow of blood toward A D the heart. Second, it distends the veins, which reduces the 5 venous resistance and allows even more ease of flow of C blood to the heart. If the heart is not damaged too much, this increased B venous return can almost fully compensate for the heart’s 0 −4 −2 0+2 +4 +6 +8 +10 +12 +14 diminished pumping ability—enough so that even when Right atrial pressure (mm Hg) the heart’s pumping ability is reduced to as low as 40% to 50% of normal, the increased venous return can often Figure 22- 1 Progressive changes in the cardiac output curve after acute myocardial infarction.
