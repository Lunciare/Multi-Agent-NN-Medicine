hormones (cortisol, androgens, and aldosterone) Prolactin Promotes development of the female Peptide breasts and secretion of milk Follicle- stimulating Causes growth of follicles in the ovaries and Peptide hormone sperm maturation in Sertoli cells of testes Luteinizing hormone Stimulates testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells Peptide of testes; stimulates ovulation, formation of corpus luteum, and estrogen and progesterone synthesis in ovaries Posterior pituitary Antidiuretic hormone Increases water reabsorption by the kidneys and Peptide (Chapter 76) (also called vasopressin) causes vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure Oxytocin Stimulates milk ejection from breasts and Peptide uterine contractions Thyroid Thyroxine (T ) and Increases the rates of chemical reactions in most Amine 4 (Chapter 77) triiodothyronine (T ) cells, thus increasing body metabolic rate 3 Calcitonin Promotes deposition of calcium in the bones Peptide and decreases extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration Adrenal cortex Cortisol Has multiple metabolic functions for controlling Steroid (Chapter 78) metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats; also has anti- inflammatory effects Aldosterone Increases renal sodium reabsorption, potassium Steroid secretion, and hydrogen ion secretion Adrenal medulla Norepinephrine, Same effects as sympathetic stimulation Amine (Chapter 61) epinephrine Pancreas Insulin (beta cells) Promotes glucose entry in many cells, and in Peptide (Chapter 79) this way
