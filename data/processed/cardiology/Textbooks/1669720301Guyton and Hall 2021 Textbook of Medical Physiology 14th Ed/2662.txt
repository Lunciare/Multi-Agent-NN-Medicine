At sensitivity of the retina is usually so slight that even the the end of 20 minutes, the sensitivity has increased about light spots in the image cannot excite the retina. After 6000- fold and, at the end of 40 minutes, it has increased dark adaptation, the light spots begin to register. As an about 25,000- fold. example of the extremes of light and dark adaptation, the The resulting curve of Figure 51- 9 is called the dark intensity of sunlight is about 10 billion times that of star- adaptation curve. Note the inflection in the curve. The light, yet the eye can function both in bright sunlight after early portion of the curve is caused by adaptation of the light adaptation and in starlight after dark adaptation. cones because all the chemical events of vision, includ- ing adaptation, occur about four times as rapidly in cones COLOR VISION as in rods. However, the cones do not achieve anywhere near the same degree of sensitivity change in darkness as From the preceding sections, we learned that different the rods. Therefore, despite rapid adaptation, the cones cones
