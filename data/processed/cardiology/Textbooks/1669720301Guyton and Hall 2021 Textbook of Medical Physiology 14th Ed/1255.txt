2, the total osmolarity of each concentration of solute on one side of the cell membrane, of the three compartments is about 300 mOsm/L, with water diffuses across the membrane toward the region the plasma being about 1 mOsm/L greater than that of of higher solute concentration. Thus, if a solute such as the interstitial and intracellular fluids. The slight differ- sodium chloride is added to the extracellular fluid, water ence between plasma and interstitial fluid is caused by the rapidly diffuses from the cells through the cell membranes osmotic effects of the plasma proteins, which maintain 310 Chapter 25 Regulation of Body Fluid Compartments: Extracellular and Intracellular Fluids; Edema about 20 mm Hg greater pressure in the capillaries than shrink or swell because the water concentration in the in- in the surrounding interstitial spaces, as discussed in tracellular and extracellular fluids is equal, and the solutes Chapter 16. cannot enter or leave the cell.
