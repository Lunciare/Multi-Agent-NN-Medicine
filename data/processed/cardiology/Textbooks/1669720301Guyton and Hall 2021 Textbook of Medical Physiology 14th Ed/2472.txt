many neurons, even normally, are high Rhythmical Signal Output enough to cause them to emit impulses continually. This Many neuronal circuits emit rhythmical output signals— phenomenon occurs especially in many of the neurons of for example, a rhythmical respiratory signal originates the cerebellum, as well as in most of the interneurons of in the respiratory centers of the medulla and pons. This the spinal cord. The rates at which these cells emit im- respiratory rhythmical signal continues throughout life. pulses can be increased by excitatory signals or decreased Other rhythmical signals, such as those that cause scratch- by inhibitory signals; inhibitory signals often can decrease ing movements by the hind leg of a dog or the walking the rate of firing to zero. movements of any animal, require input stimuli into the Continuous Signals Emitted From Reverberating Cir- respective circuits to initiate the rhythmical signals. cuits as a Means for Transmitting Information.
