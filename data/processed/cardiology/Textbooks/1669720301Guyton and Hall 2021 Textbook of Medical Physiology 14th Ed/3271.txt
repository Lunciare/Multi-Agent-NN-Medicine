which are believed to act as electrical pacemakers for smooth Figure 63- 1. Alimentary tract. muscle cells. These interstitial cells form a network with each other and are interposed between the smooth mus- Serosa cle layers, with synaptic- like contacts to smooth muscle Longitudinal muscle cells. The interstitial cells of Cajal undergo cyclic changes Circular muscle in membrane potential due to unique ion channels that periodically open and produce inward (pacemaker) cur- Submucosa rents that may generate slow wave activity. Mucosal The slow waves usually do not by themselves cause muscle muscle contraction in most parts of the gastrointestinal Mucosa tract, except perhaps in the stomach. Instead, they mainly Epithelial excite the appearance of intermittent spike potentials, lining and the spike potentials in turn actually excite the muscle Mucosal gland contraction. Myenteric nerve Spike Potentials. The spike potentials are true action plexus potentials. They occur automatically when the resting Meissner's membrane potential of the gastrointestinal smooth mus- nerve plexus Submucosal gland cle becomes more positive than about −40 millivolts (the normal resting membrane potential in the smooth mus- Mesentery cle fibers of the gut is between −50 and −60 millivolts).
