Electrical stimulation of a few of the neurons in the Respiratory motor ventral group causes inspiration, whereas stimula- Vagus and pathways tion of others causes expiration. Therefore, these glossopharyngeal neurons contribute to both inspiration and expira- tion. They are especially important in providing the powerful expiratory signals to the abdominal mus- Figure 42- 1. Organization of the respiratory center. cles during very heavy expiration.
