by how much cell; that is, it causes negativity on the inside. Therefore, the substance is concentrated during transport. Com- the Na+- K+ pump is said to be electrogenic because it cre- pared with the energy required to concentrate a sub- ates an electrical potential across the cell membrane. As stance 10- fold, concentrating it 100-f old requires twice discussed in Chapter 5, this electrical potential is a basic as much energy, and concentrating it 1000- fold requires requirement in nerve and muscle fibers for transmitting three times as much energy. In other words, the energy nerve and muscle signals. required is proportional to the logarithm of the degree that the substance is concentrated, as expressed by the Primary Active Transport of Calcium Ions following formula: Another important primary active transport mecha- C Energy(in calories per osmole)=1400log 1 nism is the calcium pump. Calcium ions are normally C 2 maintained at an extremely low concentration in the intracellular cytosol of virtually all cells in the body, Thus, in terms of calories, the amount of energy required at a concentration about 10,000 times less than that to concentrate 1 osmole of a substance 10-f old is about in the extracellular fluid.
