ensures diffusion of almost any substance from the capillary to the cell within a few Kidneys seconds. Thus, the extracellular fluid everywhere in the body—both that of the plasma and that of the interstitial fluid—is continually being mixed, thereby maintaining homogeneity of extracellular fluid throughout the body. Regulation ORIGIN OF NUTRIENTS IN THE of Excretion EXTRACELLULAR FLUID electrolytes Respiratory System. Figure 1-1 shows that each time blood passes through the body, it also flows through the Venous end Arterial end lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in alveoli, thus acquiring the oxygen needed by cells. The membrane between the alveoli and the lumen of the pulmonary capillaries, the alveolar membrane, is only 0.4 to 2.0 micrometers thick, and oxygen rapidly diffuses by molecular motion through Capillaries this membrane into the blood.
