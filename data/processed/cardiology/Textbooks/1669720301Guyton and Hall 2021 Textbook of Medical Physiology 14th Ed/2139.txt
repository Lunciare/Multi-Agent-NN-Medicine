Therefore, the difference between these two pressures is a measure of the net tendency for the 200 gas molecules to move through the membrane. 100 When the partial pressure of a gas in the alveoli is 0 greater than the pressure of the gas in the blood, as is true for O 2, net diffusion from the alveoli into the blood occurs.
