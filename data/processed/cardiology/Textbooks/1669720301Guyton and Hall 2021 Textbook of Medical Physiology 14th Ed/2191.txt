of Hemoglobin With Carbon Monoxide—Displacement of O 2 Effect of Blood Flow on Metabolic Use of Oxygen. Carbon monoxide (CO) combines with hemoglobin at the The total amount of O 2 available each minute for use in same point on the hemoglobin molecule as O 2; it can therefore any given tissue is determined by (1) the quantity of O 2 displace O 2 from the hemoglobin and decrease the O 2 carrying that can be transported to the tissue in each 100 ml of capacity of blood. Furthermore, it binds with about 250 times blood, and (2) the rate of blood flow. If blood flow rate as much tenacity as O 2, which is demonstrated by the CO- falls to zero, the amount of available O also falls to zero. hemoglobin dissociation curve in Figure 41-12. This curve 2 is almost identical to the O-h emoglobin dissociation curve Thus, there are times when blood flow rate through a tis- 2 except that the CO partial pressures, shown on the abscissa, sue can be so low that tissue Po falls below the critical 1 mm Hg required for intracellu2 lar metabolism.
