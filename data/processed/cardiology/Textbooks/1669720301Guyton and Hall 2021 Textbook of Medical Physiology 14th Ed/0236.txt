As they do so, they carry positive electri- prevent additional net diffusion. The following equation, cal charges to the outside, thus creating electropositivity called the Nernst equation, can be used to calculate the outside the membrane and electronegativity inside the Nernst potential for any univalent ion at the normal body membrane because of negative anions that remain behind temperature of 98.6°F (37°C): and do not diffuse outward with the potassium.
