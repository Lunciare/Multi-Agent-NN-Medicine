high as 250 times. The rate of iodide trapping by the thyroid is influenced by several factors, the most important being the concentration of TSH; TSH stimulates and hypoph- ysectomy greatly diminishes the activity of the iodide pump in thyroid cells. Iodide is transported out of the thyroid cells across Larynx the apical membrane into the follicle by a chloride- iodide ion counter- transporter molecule called pendrin. The thyroid epithelial cells also secrete into the fol- licle thyroglobulin that contains tyrosine amino acids Thyroid gland to which the iodine will bind, as discussed in the next section. THYROGLOBULIN AND FORMATION OF THYROXINE AND TRIIODOTHYRONINE Trachea Formation and Secretion of Thyroglobulin by the Capillary Thyroid Cells. The thyroid cells are typical protein- secreting glandular cells, as shown in Figure 77- 2. The C cell endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus synthesize and secrete into the follicles a large glycoprotein molecule Follicle Cuboidal called thyroglobulin, with a molecular weight of about epithelial cells 335,000. Each molecule of thyroglobulin contains about 70 tyrosine amino acids, and they are the major substrates that combine with iodine to form the thyroid hormones. Red Colloid Thus, the thyroid hormones form within the thyroglobu- blood cells lin molecule.
