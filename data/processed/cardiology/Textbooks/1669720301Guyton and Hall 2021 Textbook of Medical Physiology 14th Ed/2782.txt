This instrument is an earphone connected to an electronic oscillator capable of neuron is highly sensitive to a specific time lag between emitting pure tones ranging from low frequencies to high the two acoustical signals from the two ears. The neurons frequencies, and it is calibrated so that zero- intensity- level near one border of the nucleus respond maximally to a sound at each frequency is the loudness that can barely be short time lag, whereas those near the opposite border heard by the normal ear. A calibrated volume control can respond to a long time lag; those in between respond to increase the loudness above the zero level. If the loudness intermediate time lags. must be increased to 30 decibels above normal before it Thus, a spatial pattern of neuronal stimulation develops can be heard, the person is said to have a hearing loss of 30 in the medial superior olivary nucleus, with sound from decibels at that particular frequency. directly in front of the head stimulating one set of olivary In performing a hearing test using an audiometer, one
