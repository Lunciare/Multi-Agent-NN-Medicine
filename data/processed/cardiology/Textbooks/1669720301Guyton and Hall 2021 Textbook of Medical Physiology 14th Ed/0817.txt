Metabolic skin blood flow decreases, falling to barely above factors appear to override the myogenic mechanism in zero at very low temperatures. Even with severe circumstances in which the metabolic demands of the tis- vasoconstriction, skin blood flow is usually great sues are significantly increased, such as during vigorous enough to meet the basic metabolic demands of muscle exercise, which causes dramatic increases in skel- the skin. etal muscle blood flow. 209 UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation larger vessels as a result of increased flow and shear Blood stress in these vessels. The released NO increases the Receptor-dependent Shear stress activation diameters of the larger upstream blood vessels whenever microvascular blood flow increases downstream. With- eNOS out such a response, the effectiveness of local blood flow O + L-Arginine NO + L-Citrulline control would be decreased because a significant part 2 of the resistance to blood flow is in the upstream small Endothelial cells arteries. Soluble guanylate cyclase NO synthesis and release from endothelial cells are also stimulated
