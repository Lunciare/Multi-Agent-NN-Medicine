The reason for this is that increased intake is increased, sodium output initially lags slightly water reabsorption by the kidneys dilutes the extracellular behind intake. The time delay results in a small increase in sodium and, at the same time, the small increase in blood the cumulative sodium balance, which causes a slight in- pressure that does occur causes loss of sodium from the crease in extracellular fluid volume.
