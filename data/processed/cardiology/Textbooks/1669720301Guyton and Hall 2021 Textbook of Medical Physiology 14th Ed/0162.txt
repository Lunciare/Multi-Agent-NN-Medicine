buffers that help maintain stability of the genes but are CONTROL OF CELL GROWTH AND CELL gradually consumed during repeated cell divisions. REPRODUCTION Some cells grow and reproduce all the time, such as the blood- forming cells of the bone marrow, the germinal Telomere layers of the skin, and the epithelium of the gut. Many Nonreplicating Normal DNA other cells, however, such as smooth muscle cells, may cell not reproduce for many years. A few cells, such as the neurons and most striated muscle cells, do not reproduce during the entire life of a person, except during the origi- nal period of fetal life. In certain tissues, an insufficiency of some types of cells causes them to grow and reproduce rapidly until appropriate numbers of these cells are again available. For example, in some young animals, seven-eighths of Cancerous cells the liver can be removed surgically, and the cells of the remaining one-eighth will grow and divide until the liver mass returns to almost normal. The same phenomenon Cancerous DNA occurs for many glandular cells and most cells of the bone marrow, subcutaneous tissue, intestinal epithelium, and almost any other tissue except highly differentiated cells Telomerase enzyme such as nerve
