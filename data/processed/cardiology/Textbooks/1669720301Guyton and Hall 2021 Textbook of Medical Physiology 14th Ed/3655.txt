For example, Formation of bile by the liver and the function of bile salts the so- called nonessential amino acids can all be synthe- in the digestive and absorptive processes of the intestinal sized in the liver. To perform this function, a keto acid hav- tract are discussed in Chapters 65 and 66. In addition, many ing the same chemical composition (except at the keto oxy- substances are excreted in the bile and then eliminated in gen) as that of the amino acid to be formed is synthesized. the feces. One of these substances is the greenish- yellow An amino radical is then transferred through several stages pigment bilirubin, which is a major end product of hemo- of transamination from an available amino acid to the keto globin degradation, as pointed out in Chapter 33. However, acid to take the place of the keto oxygen. bilirubin also provides an exceedingly valuable tool
