intake was raised in steps from a low 50 level of 5 mmol/day to 80, 240, and 500 mmol/day for 8 days at each level. (Modified from Hall JE, Guyton AC, Smith MJ Jr, et al: Blood pressure and renal function during chronic changes in sodium intake: 7 role of angiotensin. Am J Physiol 239:F271, 1980.) Renin secretion formation is blocked with an ACE inhibitor, blood pres- sure decreases markedly as salt intake is reduced (see 1 Figure 19-1 3).
