rather than large type A alpha motor fibers. The Muscle Spindle System Stabilizes Body Position Whenever signals are transmitted from the motor cortex During Tense Action. One of the most important func- or from any other area of the brain to the alpha motor tions of the muscle spindle system is to stabilize body posi- neurons, in most instances the gamma motor neurons are tion during tense motor action. To perform this function, 689 noitcartnoc fo ecroF UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C. Motor and Integrative Neurophysiology the bulboreticular facilitatory region and its allied areas Patellar tendon struck of the brain stem transmit excitatory signals through the Knee jerk gamma nerve fibers to the intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindles. This action shortens the ends of the spin- dles and stretches the central receptor regions, thus in- creasing their signal output. However, if the spindles on both sides of each joint are activated at the same time, reflex excitation of the skeletal muscles on both sides of the joint also increases, producing tight, tense muscles Ankle clonus opposing each other at the joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized, and
