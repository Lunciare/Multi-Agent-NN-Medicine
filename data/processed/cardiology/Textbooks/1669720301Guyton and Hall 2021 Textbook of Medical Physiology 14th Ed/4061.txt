Therefore, measurements of blood corti- pituitary, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the sol levels are meaningful only when expressed in terms of hypothalamus, cells of the dermis, and lymphoid tissue. the time in the cycle at which the measurements are made. In all of these cell types, POMC is processed to form a series of smaller peptides. The precise type of POMC- 20 derived products from a particular tissue depends on the type of processing enzymes present in the tissue. Thus, pituitary corticotroph cells express prohormone conver- 15 tase 1 (PC1), resulting in the production of N- terminal peptide, joining peptide, ACTH, and β- lipotropin. In the 10 hypothalamus, the expression of PC2 leads to production of α-M SH, β-M SH, γ-M SH, and β- endorphin, but not 5 ACTH. As discussed in Chapter 72, α- MSH formed by neurons of the hypothalamus plays a major role in appe- 0 tite regulation. 12:00 4:00 8:00 12:00 4:00 8:00 12:00 In melanocytes located in abundance between the der- AM PM Noon mis and epidermis of the skin, MSH stimulates formation of the black pigment melanin and disperses
