the pulmonary capillaries, this Pulmonary artery curve wedge pressure is usually only 2 to 3 mm Hg higher than 25 the left atrial pressure. When the left atrial pressure rises 8 to high values, the pulmonary wedge pressure also rises. 0 Therefore, wedge pressure measurements can be used to 0 1 2 estimate changes in pulmonary capillary pressure and left Seconds atrial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure.

BLOOD VOLUME OF THE LUNGS 25 S The blood volume of the lungs is about 450 ml, about 9% of the total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. Approximately 70 ml of this pulmonary blood volume Pulmonary 15 M capillaries Left is in the pulmonary capillaries; the remainder is divided atrium about equally between the pulmonary arteries and veins. 8 D 7 Lungs Serve as a Blood Reservoir. Under various physi- 2 ological and pathological conditions, the quantity of blood 0 in the lungs can vary from as little as half-n ormal up to Pulmonary Pulmonary Left artery capillaries atrium twice normal.
