Whereas the red curves lation in healthy humans at sea level. were measured at a blood pH of 7.4, the green curves were measured at a pH of 7.3.

This phenom- enon is called acclimatization. REGULATION OF RESPIRATION DURING The reason for acclimatization is that within 2 to 3 days, EXERCISE the respiratory center in the brain stem loses about 80% of its sensitivity to changes in Pco and H+.
