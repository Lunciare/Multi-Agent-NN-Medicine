1, the mean arte- A). Let us see what happens if the arterial pressure increases rial pressure level will eventually readjust to 100 mm Hg, above or decreases below the equilibrium point. which is the pressure level depicted by the equilibrium First, assume that the arterial pressure rises to 150 mm point of this figure. Furthermore, there are only two ways Hg (point B). At this level, the renal output of water and in which the pressure of this equilibrium point can be salt is almost three times as great as intake. Therefore, changed from the 100 mm Hg level. One is by shifting the the body loses fluid, the blood volume decreases, and the pressure level of the renal output curve for salt and water, arterial pressure decreases. Furthermore, this negative and the other is by changing the level of the water and salt balance of fluid will not cease until the pressure falls all intake line. Therefore, expressed simply, the two primary the way back exactly to the equilibrium level. Even when determinants of the long- term arterial pressure level are the arterial pressure is only a few mm Hg greater than the as follows: equilibrium level, there
