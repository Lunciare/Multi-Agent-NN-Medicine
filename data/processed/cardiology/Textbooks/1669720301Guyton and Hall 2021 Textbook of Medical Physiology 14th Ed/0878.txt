These low- pressure Experimental studies and clinical trials have shown receptors play an important role, especially in minimizing that chronic electrical stimulation of carotid sinus afferent arterial pressure changes in response to changes in blood nerve fibers can cause sustained reductions in sympathetic volume. For example, if 300 milliliters of blood suddenly nervous system activity and arterial pressure of at least 15 are infused into a dog with all receptors intact, the arte- to 20 mm Hg. These observations suggest that most, if rial pressure rises only about 15 mm Hg. With the arterial not all, the baroreceptor reflex resetting that occurs when baroreceptors denervated, the pressure rises about 40 mm increases in arterial pressure are sustained, as in chronic Hg. If the low- pressure receptors also are denervated, the hypertension, is due to resetting of the carotid sinus nerve arterial pressure rises about 100 mm Hg. mechanoreceptors themselves rather than resetting in Thus, one can see that even though the low- pressure central nervous system vasomotor centers. receptors in the pulmonary artery and in the atria cannot detect the systemic arterial pressure, they do detect simul- Control of Arterial Pressure by the
