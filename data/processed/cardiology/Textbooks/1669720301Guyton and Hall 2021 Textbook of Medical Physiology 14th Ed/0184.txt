The energy that causes diffusion is (2) through watery channels that penetrate all the way the energy of the normal kinetic motion of matter. through some of the large transport proteins, as shown to In contrast, active transport means movement of ions the left in Figure 4-2. or other substances across the membrane in combina- tion with a carrier protein in such a way that the carrier Diffusion of Lipid- Soluble Substances Through the protein causes the substance to move against an energy Lipid Bilayer. The lipid solubility of a substance is an gradient, such as from a low-c oncentration state to a high- important factor for determining how
