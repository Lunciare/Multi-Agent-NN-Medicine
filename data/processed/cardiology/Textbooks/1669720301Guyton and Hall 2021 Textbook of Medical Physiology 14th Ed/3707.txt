Parents who are over- that overnutrition of children—especially in infancy and, weight or obese may also increase the risk for obesity and to a lesser extent, during the later years of childhood—can associated disorders in their offspring through “epigenetic” lead to a lifetime of obesity. In fact, studies have shown that mechanisms that alter gene expression in the absence of approximately 80% of obese children become obese adults. a change in the DNA sequence (Figure 72- 3).
