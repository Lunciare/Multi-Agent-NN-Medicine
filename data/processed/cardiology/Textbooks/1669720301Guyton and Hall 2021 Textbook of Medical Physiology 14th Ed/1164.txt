Thus, severe aortic valve steno- ventricular chamber (see Figure 23- 4) and also occurs sis often causes ischemia of the heart muscle. in other circumstances where afterload of the heart is With aortic regurgitation, the intraventricular diastolic increased, such as in chronic hypertension. pressure also increases, compressing the inner layer of the In persons with severe aortic regurgitation, sometimes heart muscle and decreasing coronary blood flow. Aortic the enlarged left ventricle can pump a stroke volume out- diastolic pressure decreases during aortic regurgitation, put as great as 250 milliliters, although as much as 75% which can also decrease coronary blood flow and cause of this blood returns to the ventricle during diastole, and ischemia of the heart muscle. only 25% flows through the aorta to the body. Eventual Failure of Left Ventricle and Development Increase in Blood Volume. Another effect that helps of Pulmonary Edema. In the early stages of aortic steno- compensate for the diminished net pumping by the left sis or aortic regurgitation, the intrinsic ability of the left ventricle is increased blood volume. This increased volume ventricle to adapt to increasing loads prevents significant results from the following: (1) an initial slight decrease in abnormalities in
