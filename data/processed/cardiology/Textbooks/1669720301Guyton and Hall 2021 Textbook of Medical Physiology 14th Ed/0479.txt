Control of the Heart by the Sympathetic of the parasympathetic nerve fibers in the vagus nerves and Parasympathetic Nerves to the heart can stop the heartbeat for a few seconds, but The pumping effectiveness of the heart also is controlled then the heart usually “escapes” and beats at a rate of 20 by the sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagus) nerves, to 40 beats/min as long as the parasympathetic stimula- which abundantly supply the heart, as shown in Figure tion continues.
