of sensory and motor information into usable thought patterns. Prefrontal After the signals pass from the cerebral cortex to the caudate nucleus, they are transmitted to the inter- nal globus pallidus, then to the relay nuclei of the ventroanterior and ventrolateral thalamus, and finally back to the prefrontal, premotor, and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex, but with almost none of the returning signals passing directly to the Ventroanterior and primary motor cortex. Instead, the returning signals ventrolateral nuclei of thalamus go to the accessory motor regions in the premotor and Caudate supplementary motor areas that are concerned with building sequential patterns of movement lasting 5 Putamen seconds or more instead of exciting individual muscle Subthalamus Globus pallidus movements. internal/external A good example of this phenomenon would be Substantia nigra a person seeing a lion approach and then respond- ing instantaneously and automatically by (1) turning Figure 57- 12 Caudate circuit through the basal ganglia for cognitive away from the lion, (2) beginning to run, and (3) even planning of sequential and parallel motor patterns to achieve specific attempting to climb a tree.
