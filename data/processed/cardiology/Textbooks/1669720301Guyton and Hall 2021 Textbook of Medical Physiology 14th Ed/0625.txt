at the base of the heart and its positive end toward the apex. Thus, the first portion of the heart to PREMATURE VENTRICULAR become depolarized during this premature contraction is CONTRACTIONS near the base of the ventricles, which therefore is the ori- gin of the ectopic focus. The ECG in Figure 13-11 shows a series of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) alternating with normal Disorders of Cardiac Repolarization—the Long QT contractions in a pattern known as bigeminy. PVCs cause Syndromes. Recall that the Q wave corresponds to ven- specific effects in the ECG, as follows: tricular depolarization, whereas the T wave corresponds 1. The QRS complex is usually considerably prolonged. to ventricular repolarization. The Q- T interval is the time The reason for this prolongation is that the impulse from the Q point to the end of the T wave. Disorders that is conducted mainly through slowly conducting delay repolarization of ventricular muscle after the action muscle of the ventricles rather than through the potential cause prolonged ventricular action potentials Purkinje system. and therefore excessively long Q- T intervals on the ECG, 2. The QRS complex has a high voltage. When the a condition called long QT syndrome (LQTS). normal impulse
