It is not the purpose of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an essential link between this text to present the chemical details of all the vari- energy- utilizing and energy- producing functions of the ous cellular reactions, which lie in the discipline of bio- body (Figure 68-1 ). For this reason, ATP has been called chemistry. Instead, these chapters are devoted to (1) a the “energy currency” of the body, and it can be gained and review of the principal chemical processes of the cell spent repeatedly. Energy derived from the oxidation of carbohydrates, and (2) an analysis of their physiological implications, proteins, and fats is used to convert adenosine diphosphate especially the manner in which they fit into overall body (ADP) to ATP, which is then consumed by the various reac- homeostasis. tions of the body that are necessary to maintain and propa- gate life.
