As an arm or leg moves toward its midposition, the strength of the longer muscle decreases, but the strength of the shorter junction, discussed in Chapter 7, can diminish at least muscle increases until the two strengths equal each other. a small amount after intense prolonged muscle activity, At this point, movement of the arm or leg stops.
