lower than that of extracellular fluid and, therefore, is 3 2 reason, this system operates on the portion of the buffering usually closer to the pK of the phosphate buffer system curve where the slope is low, and the buffering power is compared with the extracellular fluid. poor. Second, the concentrations of the two elements of the bicarbonate system, CO and HCO −, are not high. 2 3 PROTEINS ARE IMPORTANT Despite these characteristics, the bicarbonate buffer INTRACELLULAR BUFFERS system is the most powerful extracellular buffer in the body. This apparent paradox is due mainly to the fact that Proteins are among the most plentiful buffers in the body the two elements of the buffer system, HCO − and CO , 3 2 because of their high concentrations, especially in the are regulated, respectively, by the kidneys and lungs, as dis- cells. The pH of the cells, although slightly lower than cussed later. As a result of this regulation, the pH of the extracellular fluid can be precisely controlled by the relative in the extracellular fluid, nevertheless changes approxi- rate of removal and addition of HCO − by the kidneys and mately in proportion to extracellular fluid pH changes. 3
