For free molecules that are not physically attached to oth- Pressures of Gases Dissolved in Water and Tissues ers, this means linear movement at high velocity until they strike other molecules. They then bounce away in new di- Gases dissolved in water or in body tissues also exert pres- rections and continue moving until they strike other mol- sure because the dissolved gas molecules are moving ran- ecules again. In this way, the molecules move rapidly and domly and have kinetic energy. Furthermore, when the gas randomly among one another. dissolved in fluid encounters a surface, such as the mem- Net Diffusion of a Gas in One Direction—Effect of a brane of a cell, it exerts its own partial pressure in the same Concentration Gradient. If a gas chamber or solution has a way as a gas in the gas phase. The partial pressures of the high concentration of a particular gas at one end of the cham- separate dissolved gases are designated the same as the par- ber and a low concentration at the other end, as shown in tial pressures in the gas state—that is, Po 2, Pco
