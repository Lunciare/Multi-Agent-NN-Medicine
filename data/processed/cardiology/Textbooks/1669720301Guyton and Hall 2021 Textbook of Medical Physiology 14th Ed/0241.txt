In some cells, such as the cardiac pacemaker cells discussed Several key points become evident from the Goldman in Chapter 10, the membrane potential is continuously equation. First, sodium, potassium, and chloride ions are changing, and the cells are never “resting”. In many other the most important ions involved in the development of cells, even excitable cells, there is a quiescent period in which membrane potentials in nerve and muscle fibers, as well a resting membrane potential can be measured. Table 5- 1 as in the neuronal cells. The concentration gradient of shows the approximate resting membrane potentials of some each of these ions across the membrane helps determine different types of cells. The membrane potential is obviously the voltage of the membrane potential. very dynamic in excitable cells such as neurons, in which Second, the quantitative importance of each of the ions action potentials occur. However, even in nonexcitable cells, in determining the voltage is proportional to the membrane the membrane potential
