transport in the early distal tubule. Sodium and chloride are transported from the tubular lumen into the cell by a co- transporter that is inhibited by thiazide (+ADH) H O K+ 2 diuretics. Sodium is pumped out of the cell by Na+- K+ ATPase adeno- sine triphosphatase, and chloride diffuses into the interstitial fluid via H+ chloride channels. (Figure 28-1 1). The principal cells reabsorb sodium and HCO – Type A 3 water from the lumen and secrete potassium ions into the intercalated cells K+ lumen. The type A intercalated cells reabsorb potassium Figure 28- 11 Cellular ultrastructure and transport characteristics of ions and secrete hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen. the early distal tubule and late distal tubule and collecting tubule. The Principal Cells Reabsorb Sodium and Secrete Potassium. early distal tubule has many of the same characteristics as the thick ascending loop of Henle and reabsorbs sodium, chloride, calcium, Sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion by the princi- and magnesium but is virtually impermeable to water and urea. The pal cells depend on the activity of a Na+- K+ ATPase pump in late distal tubules and cortical collecting tubules are composed of two each cell’s basolateral membrane (Figure 28-1
