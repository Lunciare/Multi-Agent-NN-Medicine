Growth Adipose tissue hormone Glucose uptake GROWTH HORMONE HAS SEVERAL Lipolysis METABOLIC EFFECTS Liver Aside from its general effect in causing growth, GH has IGF-1 multiple specific metabolic effects (Figure 76- 6), includ- Bone ing the following: (1) increased rate of protein synthesis in most cells of the body; (2) increased mobilization of fatty Osteogenic and acids from adipose tissue, increased free fatty acids in the Muscle chondrocytic cells blood, and increased use of fatty acids for energy; and (3) Glucose uptake Amino acid uptake decreased rate of glucose utilization throughout the body.
