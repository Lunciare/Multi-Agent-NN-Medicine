That is, the T wave becomes abnormal when the Figure 12-23 An inverted T wave resulting from mild ischemia at the normal sequence of repolarization does not occur. Several base of the ventricles. factors, including myocardial ischemia, can change this sequence of repolarization. EFFECT OF SLOW CONDUCTION OF THE DEPOLARIZATION WAVE ON THE T T CHARACTERISTICS OF THE T WAVE Referring to Figure 12-14, note that the QRS complex is considerably prolonged. The reason for this prolongation is delayed conduction in the left ventricle resulting from left bundle branch block. This delayed conduction causes Figure 12-24 A biphasic T wave caused by digitalis toxicity. the left ventricle to become depolarized about 0.08 second after depolarization of the right ventricle, which Mild ischemia is the most common cause
