1 liter of fluid to be fraction is calculated as follows: excreted each day, although the renal fluid excretion rate Filtration fr action = GFR /Renal plasma flow is highly variable, depending on fluid intake. The high rate of glomerular filtration depends on a high rate of kidney GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY MEMBRANE blood flow, as well as the special properties of the glo- merular capillary membranes. In this chapter, we discuss The glomerular capillary membrane is similar to that of the physical forces that determine the glomerular filtra- other capillaries, except that it has three (instead of the tion rate (GFR), as well as the physiological mechanisms usual two) major layers: (1) the endothelium of the capil- that regulate GFR and renal blood flow. lary; (2) a basement membrane; and (3) a layer of epithe- COMPOSITION OF THE GLOMERULAR lial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the FILTRATE capillary basement membrane (Figure 27- 2). Together, these layers make up the filtration barrier, which, despite Like most capillaries, the glomerular capillaries are rela- the three layers, filters several hundred times as much tively impermeable to proteins, so the filtered fluid (called water and solutes as the usual capillary membrane.
