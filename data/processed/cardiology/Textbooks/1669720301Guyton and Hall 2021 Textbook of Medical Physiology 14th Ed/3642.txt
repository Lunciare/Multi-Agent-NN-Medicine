This fluid is almost pure plasma, Endothelial cell containing 80% to 90% as much protein as normal plasma. Bile canaliculi At vena caval pressures of 10 to 15 mm Hg, hepatic lymph flow increases to as much as 20 times normal, and the “sweating” from the surface of the liver can be so great that Lymphatic duct it causes large amounts of free fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is called ascites.
