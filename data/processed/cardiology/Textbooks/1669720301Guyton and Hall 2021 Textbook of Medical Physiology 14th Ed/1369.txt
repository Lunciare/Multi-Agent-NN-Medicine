However, the preglomerular blood vessels, Filtration Rate. Prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) and especially the afferent arterioles, appear to be relatively bradykinin serve as hormones and autacoids that cause protected from angiotensin II–mediated constriction in vasodilation, increased renal blood flow, and increased most physiological conditions associated with activation GFR. These substances are discussed in Chapter 17. Al- of the renin-a ngiotensin system, such as during a low- though these vasodilators do not appear to be of major sodium diet or reduced renal perfusion pressure due to importance in regulating renal blood flow or the GFR in renal artery stenosis. This protection is due to release of normal conditions, they may dampen the renal vasocon- vasodilators, especially nitric oxide and prostaglandins, strictor effects of the sympathetic nerves or angiotensin which counteract the vasoconstrictor effects of angioten- II, especially their effects to constrict the afferent arteri- sin II in these blood vessels. oles. The efferent arterioles, however, are highly sensitive By opposing vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, the to angiotensin II. Because angiotensin II preferentially prostaglandins help prevent excessive reductions
