The because the temperature regulatory mechanisms are not temperature of the deep tissues of the body—the “core” perfect. When excessive heat is produced in the body by of the body—usually remains very constant, within ±1°F strenuous exercise, the temperature can rise temporarily (±0.6°C), except when a person has a febrile illness.

The mechanisms for regulating body temperature represent a beautifully BODY TEMPERATURE IS CONTROLLED designed control system. In this chapter we discuss this BY BALANCING HEAT PRODUCTION system as it operates in health and in disease. AND HEAT LOSS The skin temperature, in contrast to the
