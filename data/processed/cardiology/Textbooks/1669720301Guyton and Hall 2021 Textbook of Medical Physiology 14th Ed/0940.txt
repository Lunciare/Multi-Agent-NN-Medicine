Note the shift of the renal output curve toward functions normally, the pressure usually rises no more higher pressure levels under the influence of angiotensin II. than 4 to 6 mm Hg in response to as much as a 100- fold This shift is caused by the direct effects of angiotensin II on increase in salt intake (Figure 19-1 3). Conversely, when the kidney and the indirect effect acting through aldoster- the usual suppression of angiotensin formation is pre- one secretion, as explained earlier. vented due to continuous infusion of small amounts of Finally, note the two equilibrium points, one for zero angiotensin showing an arterial pressure level of 75 mm angiotensin II so that blood levels cannot decrease, the Hg, and one for elevated angiotensin showing a pressure same increase in salt intake may cause the pressure to level of 115 mm Hg. Therefore, the effect of angiotensin to rise by 40 mm Hg or more (see Figure 19-13). When salt cause renal retention of salt and water can have a powerful intake is reduced to
