also adds to the neu- ronal damage by reducing nutrition to the retina. In most cases of glaucoma, the abnormally high pressure results from increased resistance to fluid outflow through Footplate the trabecular spaces into the canal of Schlemm at the iri- docorneal junction. For example, in acute eye inflammation, white blood cells and tissue debris can block these trabecular spaces and cause an acute increase in intraocular pressure. In chronic conditions, especially in older persons, fibrous occlu- Intraocular pressure sion of the trabecular spaces appears to be the likely culprit. Figure 50- 21. Principles of the tonometer. Glaucoma can sometimes be treated by placing drops in the eye that contain a drug that diffuses into the eyeball and Regulation of Intraocular Pressure. Intraocular pres- reduces the secretion or increases the absorption of aque- sure remains constant in the normal eye, usually within ±2 ous humor. When drug therapy fails, operative techniques mm Hg of its normal level, which averages about 15 mm to open the spaces of the trabeculae or make channels to al- Hg. The level of this pressure is determined mainly by the low fluid to flow directly from the fluid space of the eyeball resistance to
