the volume of the FRC can be calcu- lated from the degree of dilution of the helium, using the 20 following formula: Ci FRC = He −1 Vi Spir 0 (Cf He ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 Air expired (ml) where FRC is functional residual capacity, Ci He is the Figure 38- 7 Record of the changes in nitrogen concentration in the initial concentration of helium in the spirometer, Cf is expired air after a single previous inspiration of pure oxygen. This He the final concentration of helium in the spirometer, and record can be used to calculate dead space, as discussed in the text. Vi Spir is the initial volume of the spirometer. DEAD SPACE AND ITS EFFECT ON Once the FRC has been determined, the residual vol- ALVEOLAR VENTILATION ume (RV) can be determined by subtracting expiratory reserve volume (ERV), as measured by normal spirom- Some of the air a person breathes never reaches the gas etry, from the FRC. Also, the total lung capacity (TLC) exchange areas but simply fills respiratory passages, such can be determined by adding the inspiratory capacity (IC) as the nose, pharynx, and trachea, where gas exchange to the FRC.
