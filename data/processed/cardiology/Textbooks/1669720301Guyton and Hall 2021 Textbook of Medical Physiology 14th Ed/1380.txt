This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel Macula densa NaCl and, at the same time, by raising vascular resistance, helps prevent excessive increases in renal blood flow and the Macula GFR when arterial pressure increases. Afferent arteriolar densa Although the myogenic mechanism probably operates feedback resistance in most arterioles throughout the body, its importance in renal blood flow and GFR autoregulation has been questioned by some physiologists because this pressure- GFR sensitive mechanism has no means of directly detecting Figure 27- 12.
