Hypertension Caused by Patchy Renal Damage and skeleton in CKD is the rise in serum phosphate concen- tration that occurs as a result of decreased GFR. This rise Increased Renal Secretion of Renin. If one part of the kid- in serum phosphate level increases binding of phosphate ney is ischemic, and the remainder is not ischemic, such as with calcium in the plasma, thus decreasing plasma serum when one renal artery is severely constricted, the ischemic 431 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys renal tissue secretes large quantities of renin. This secretion protein is formed in response to a respective gene in the leads to increased formation of Ang II, which can cause hy- nucleus.
