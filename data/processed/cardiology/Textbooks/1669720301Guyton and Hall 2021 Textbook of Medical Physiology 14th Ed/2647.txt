needed. Conversely, when there is excess retinal in the Lumirhodopsin retina, it is converted back into vitamin A, thus reducing (µsec) the amount of light- sensitive pigment in the retina. We shall see later that this interconversion between retinal (minutes) Metarhodopsin I and vitamin A is especially important in long- term adap- (msec) tation of the retina to different light intensities. Metarhodopsin II Night Blindness Due to Vitamin A Deficiency. Night (sec) blindness occurs in persons with severe vitamin A defi- ciency because, without vitamin A, the amounts of retinal Scotopsin and rhodopsin that can be formed are severely depressed. This condition is called night blindness because the amount Isomerase of light available at night is too little to permit adequate vi- 11-cis retinal All-trans retinal sion in vitamin A–deficient persons. For night blindness to occur, a person usually must re- Isomerase 11-cis retinol All-trans retinol main on a vitamin A–deficient diet for months, because (Vitamin A) large quantities of vitamin A are normally stored in the liver and can be made available to the eyes. Once night blindness Figure 51- 5. The rhodopsin-r etinal visual cycle in the rod, showing develops, it can sometimes be reversed in less than
