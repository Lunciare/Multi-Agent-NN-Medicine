Microtubules serve filaments that often work together with microtubules, as the conveyor belts for the intracellular transport of providing strength and support for the fragile tubulin vesicles, granules, and organelles such as mitochondria. structures. They are called intermediate because their Nucleus average diameter is between that of narrower actin micro- filaments and wider myosin filaments found in muscle The nucleus is the control center of the cell and sends cells. Their functions are mainly mechanical, and they are messages to the cell to grow and mature, replicate, or less dynamic than actin microfilaments or microtubules. die.
