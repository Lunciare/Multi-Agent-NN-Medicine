role of the vestibular nuclei, however, is The top of Figure 56- 9 shows the membranous to selectively control the excitatory signals to the different labyrinth. It is composed mainly of the cochlea (ductus antigravity muscles to maintain equilibrium in response to signals from the vestibular apparatus. We discuss this concept more fully later in this chapter. Anterior Ampullae The Decerebrate Animal Develops Spastic Rigidity. Utricle When the brain stem of an animal is sectioned below the Maculae and statoconia midlevel of the mesencephalon but the pontine and med- ullary reticular systems, as well as the vestibular system, Semi- circular are left intact, a condition called decerebrate rigidity de- canals velops. This rigidity does not occur in all the muscles of the body, but it does occur in the antigravity muscles— the muscles of the neck and trunk and the extensors of the legs. The cause of decerebrate rigidity is blockage of nor- mally strong input to the medullary reticular nuclei from Saccule Ductus the cerebral cortex, the red nuclei, and the basal ganglia.
