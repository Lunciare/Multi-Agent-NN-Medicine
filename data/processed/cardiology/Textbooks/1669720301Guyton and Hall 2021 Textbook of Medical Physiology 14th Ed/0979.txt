Cardiac output is equal to venous return and is the sum Under most normal unstressed conditions, the cardiac of tissue and organ blood flows. Except when the heart is severely output is controlled mainly by peripheral factors that weakened and unable to pump the venous return adequately, cardiac determine venous return. However, as we discuss later output (total tissue blood flow) is determined mainly by the metabolic needs of the tissues and organs of the body. in the chapter, if the returning blood does become more than the heart can pump, then the heart becomes the lim- iting factor that determines cardiac output.
