When the concentration of ADH decreases, the raises tubular reabsorption of sodium and water. molecules of AQP- 2 are shuttled back to the cell cytoplasm, 3. Angiotensin II directly stimulates sodium reabsorp- thereby removing the water channels from the luminal tion in the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle, the membrane and reducing water permeability. These actions distal tubules, and the collecting tubules.
