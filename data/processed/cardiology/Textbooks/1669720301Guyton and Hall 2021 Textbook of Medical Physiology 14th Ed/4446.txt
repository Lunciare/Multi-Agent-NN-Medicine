Conversely, the hormone sinus (ampulla) prolactin has the opposite effect and promotes milk Lactiferous duct secretion. Prolactin is secreted by the mother’s ante- rior pituitary gland, and its concentration in her blood Nipple rises steadily from the fifth week of pregnancy until Areola birth of the baby, at which time it has risen to 10 to 20 times the normal nonpregnant level. This high level of prolactin at the end of pregnancy is shown in Figure 83-1 2. In addition, the placenta secretes large quantities of A human chorionic somatomammotropin, which probably has lactogenic properties, thus supporting the prolactin from the mother’s pituitary during pregnancy. Even so, Lobule because of the suppressive effects of estrogen and pro- gesterone, no more than a few milliliters of fluid are Alveoli secreted each day until after the baby is born. The fluid secreted during the last few days before and the first few
