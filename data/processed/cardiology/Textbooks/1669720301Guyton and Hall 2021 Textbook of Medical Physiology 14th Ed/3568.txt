remaining portion of the fatty acid molecule, and 72 hydrogen atoms. Thus a total of 104 hydrogen atoms are thus a new fatty acyl- CoA molecule is formed; this time, eventually released by the degradation of each stearic acid however, the molecule is two carbon atoms shorter because molecule. Of this group, 34 are removed from the degrad- of the loss of the first acetyl- CoA from its terminal end. ing fatty acids by flavoproteins and 70 are removed by nico- Next, this shorter fatty acyl- CoA enters into Equation tinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as NADH and H+. 2 and progresses through Equations 3, 4, and 5 to release These two groups of hydrogen atoms are oxidized in the another acetyl-C oA molecule, thus shortening the original mitochondria, as discussed in Chapter 68, but they enter fatty acid molecule by another two carbons. In addition to the oxidative system at different points. Therefore, 1 mol- the released acetyl- CoA molecules, four atoms of hydrogen ecule of ATP is synthesized for each of the 34 flavoprotein are released from the fatty acid molecule at the same time, hydrogens, and 1.5 molecules of ATP are synthesized for entirely separate from the acetyl-
