of the points shown in Figure 11-8 . This Another system of leads in wide use is the augmented electrode is connected to the positive terminal of the limb leads. In this type of recording, two of the limbs electrocardiograph, and the negative electrode, called are connected through electrical resistances to the neg- the indifferent electrode or Wilson central terminal, is ative terminal of the electrocardiograph, and the third connected through equal electrical resistances to the limb is connected to the positive terminal. When the right arm, left arm, and left leg all at the same time, positive terminal is on the right arm, the lead is known as also shown in the figure. Usually, six standard chest as the aVR lead; when on the left arm, it is known as leads are recorded, one at a time, from the anterior the aVL lead; and when on the left leg, it is known as chest wall, with the chest electrode being placed the aVF lead. sequentially at the six points shown in the diagram. Normal recordings of the augmented limb leads are The different recordings are known as leads V 1, V 2, V 3, shown in Figure 11- 10.
