increase the rate of CO excretion, as represented by the fourfold 2 the alveolar Po 2 above 149 mm Hg as long as the person elevation of the curve (when 800 ml of CO 2 are excreted is breathing normal atmospheric air at sea level pressure, per minute). Second, the alveolar Pco decreases in 2 because 149 mm Hg is the maximum Po in humidified inverse proportion to alveolar ventilation. Therefore, the 2 air at this pressure. If the person breathes gases that con- concentrations and partial pressures of both O 2 and CO 2 tain partial pressures of O higher than 149 mm Hg, the in the alveoli are determined by the rates of absorption or 2 alveolar Po can approach these higher pressures at high excretion of the two gases and by the amount of alveolar 2 rates of ventilation. ventilation. 514 sag fo noitartnecnoC )noitartnecnoc lanigiro fo %( erusserp laitrap raloevlA )gHmm( negyxo fo erusserp laitrap raloevlA )gHmm( OC fo 2 Chapter 40 Principles of Gas Exchange; Diffusion of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Through the Respiratory Membrane 160 140 120 Oxygen (Po ) 2 100 Dead Alveolar air 80 space and dead Alveolar air 60 air space
