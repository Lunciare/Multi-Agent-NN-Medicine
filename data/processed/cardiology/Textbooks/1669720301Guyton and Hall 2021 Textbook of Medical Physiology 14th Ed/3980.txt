4 ANTERIOR PITUITARY SECRETION OF Hypertrophy TSH IS REGULATED BY THYROTROPIN- Increased RELEASING HORMONE FROM THE metabolism Thyroxine Increased secretion HYPOTHALAMUS Anterior pituitary secretion of TSH is controlled by a hypothalamic hormone, thyrotropin- releasing hormone Cells Thyroid Iodine (TRH), which is synthesized by neurons in the paraven- Figure 77- 7 Regulation of thyroid secretion.

From the median eminence, TRH is TRH neurons in the PVN receive input from leptin- then transported to the anterior pituitary by way of the responsive neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamic- hypophysial portal blood, as explained in hypothalamus that regulate energy balance—the neu- Chapter 75. ropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-r elated protein (AGRP) and TRH is a tripeptide amide—pyroglutamyl- histidyl- pro-o piomelanocortin (POMC) neurons which were dis- proline- amide.
