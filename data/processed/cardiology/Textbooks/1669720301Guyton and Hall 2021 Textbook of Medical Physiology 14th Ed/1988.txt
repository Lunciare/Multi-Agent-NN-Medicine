Fibrinogen is a high- molecular- weight protein fibrin meshwork. (molecular weight ≈340,000) that occurs in the plasma in Blood Clot. The clot is composed of a meshwork of fi- quantities of 100 to 700 mg/dl. Fibrinogen is formed in brin fibers running in all directions and entrapping blood the liver, and liver disease can decrease the concentration cells, platelets, and plasma (see Figure 37- 4).
