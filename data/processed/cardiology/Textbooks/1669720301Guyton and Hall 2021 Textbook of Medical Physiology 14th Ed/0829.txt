Angiogenesis begins with new vessels sprouting from In most tissues of the body, when an artery or a vein is other small vessels. The first step is dissolution of the base- blocked, a new vascular channel usually develops around ment membrane of the endothelial cells at the point of the blockage and allows at least partial resupply of blood sprouting. This step is followed by rapid reproduction of to the affected tissue. The first stage in this process is dila- new endothelial cells, which stream outward through the tion of small vascular loops that already connect the ves- vessel wall in extended cords directed toward the source sel above the blockage to the vessel below. This dilation of the angiogenic factor. The cells in each cord continue occurs within the first minute or two, indicating that
