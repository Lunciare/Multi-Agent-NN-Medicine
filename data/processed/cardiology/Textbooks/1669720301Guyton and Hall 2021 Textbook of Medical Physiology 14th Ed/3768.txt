of Substrate Concentration in Regulation of Met- muscles or of the tissues so that the limbs can move. This abolic Reactions. Note also in Figure 73- 2 that when the viscous movement causes friction within the tissues, which generates heat. substrate concentration becomes low enough that only a Consider also the energy expended by the heart in small portion of the enzyme is required in the reaction, pumping blood. The blood distends the arterial system, and the rate of the reaction becomes directly proportional to this distention represents a reservoir of potential energy. As the substrate concentration, as well as the enzyme concen- the blood flows through peripheral vessels, the friction of tration. This is the relationship seen in the absorption of different layers of blood flowing over one another and the substances from the intestinal tract and renal tubules when friction of blood against the walls of the vessels turn all this their concentrations are low. Rate Limitation in a Series of Reactions. Almost all energy into heat. Essentially all the energy expended by the body is even- chemical reactions of the body occur in series, with the tually converted into heat. The only significant exception product of one
