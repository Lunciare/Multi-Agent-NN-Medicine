At birth, the walls of the mains almost exactly zero until the negative pressure has alveoli are at first collapsed because of the surface tension reached −40 centimeters of water (−30 mm Hg). Then, of the viscid fluid that fills them. More than 25 mm Hg of as the negative pressure increases to −60 centimeters of negative inspiratory pressure in the lungs is usually required water, about 40 ml of air enters the lungs.

Note that the second breath is much easier, requiring far less negative and positive pressures. Breathing does not become completely normal until about 40 minutes after birth, as shown by the third compliance curve, the shape of which compares favorably with that for the normal adult, as Lung Lung shown in Chapter 38.
