rate of the sympathetic nerves releases norepinephrine at the heart pumping, often to as little as one- half normal. Fur- sympathetic nerve endings. Norepinephrine, in turn, thermore, strong stimulation of the vagi can completely stimulates beta- 1 adrenergic receptors, which mediate the stop the rhythmical excitation by the sinus node or com- effects on heart rate. The precise mechanism whereby be- pletely block transmission of the cardiac impulse from the ta- 1 adrenergic stimulation acts on cardiac muscle fibers atria into the ventricles through the A- V node. In either is somewhat unclear, but is thought to increase the per- case, rhythmical excitatory signals are no longer transmit- meability of the fiber membrane to sodium and calcium ted into the ventricles. The ventricles may stop beating for ions. In the sinus node, an increase of sodium-c alcium 5 to 20 seconds, but then some small area in the Purkinje permeability causes a more positive resting potential. It fibers, usually in the ventricular septal portion of the A- V also causes an increased rate of upward drift of the di- bundle, develops a rhythm of its own and causes ventricu- astolic membrane potential toward the threshold level lar contraction at a
