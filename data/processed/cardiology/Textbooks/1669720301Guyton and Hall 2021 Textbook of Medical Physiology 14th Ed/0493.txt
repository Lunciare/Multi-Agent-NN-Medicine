a threshold 0 voltage of about –40 millivolts, the L- type calcium chan- nels become activated, thus causing the action potential. Therefore, basically, the inherent leakiness of the sinus –40 nodal fibers to sodium and calcium ions causes their self- excitation. Resting Why does this leakiness to sodium and calcium ions –80 potential not cause the sinus nodal fibers to remain depolarized all the time? Two events occur during the course of the 0 1 2 3 action potential to prevent such a constant state of depo- Seconds larization. First, the L- type calcium channels become Figure 10- 2 Rhythmical discharge of a sinus nodal fiber. Also, the inactivated (i.e., they close) within about 100 to 150 mil- sinus nodal action potential is compared with that of a ventricular liseconds after opening; and second, at about the same muscle fiber. time, greatly increased numbers of potassium channels open.
