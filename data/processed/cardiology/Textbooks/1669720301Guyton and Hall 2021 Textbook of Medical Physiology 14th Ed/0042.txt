solid particulates. Chemical re- actions take place among the dissolved chemicals or at the Lipids. Lipids are several types of substances that are surfaces of the suspended particles or membranes. grouped together because of their common property of being soluble in fat solvents. Especially important lipids Ions. Important ions in the cell include potassium, magne- sium, phosphate, sulfate, bicarbonate, and smaller quanti- ties of sodium, chloride, and calcium. These ions are all Cell discussed in Chapter 4, which considers the interrelations membrane between the intracellular and extracellular fluids. The ions provide inorganic chemicals for cellular reac- Cytoplasm tions and are necessary for the operation of some cellular Nucleolus Nucleoplasm control mechanisms. For example, ions acting at the cell Nuclear membrane are required for the transmission of electro- membrane Nucleus chemical impulses in nerve and muscle fibers. Proteins. After water, the most abundant substances in most cells are proteins, which normally constitute 10% to Figure 2-1.
