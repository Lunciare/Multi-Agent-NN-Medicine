Several systems contribute to arterial blood pressure regulation. One of EXAMPLES OF CONTROL MECHANISMS these, the baroreceptor system, is an excellent example of a rapidly acting control mechanism (Figure 1-3). In the Regulation of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Concen- walls of the bifurcation region of the carotid arteries in trations in the Extracellular Fluid. Because oxygen is the neck, and also in the arch of the aorta in the thorax, one of the major substances required for chemical reac- are many nerve receptors called baroreceptors that are tions in cells, the body has a special control mechanism to stimulated by stretch of the arterial wall. When arterial maintain an almost exact and constant oxygen concentra- pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors send barrages tion in the extracellular fluid. This mechanism depends of nerve impulses to the medulla of the brain. Here, these principally on the chemical characteristics of hemoglobin, impulses inhibit the vasomotor center, which in turn de- which is present in red blood cells.
