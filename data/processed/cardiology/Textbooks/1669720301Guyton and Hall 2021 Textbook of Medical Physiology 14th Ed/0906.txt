Points A and B represent the equilibrium points for long- term regulation of arterial pressure when salt intake is normal or 4 six times normal, respectively. Because of the steepness of the chronic renal output curve, increased salt intake normally causes only small Normal changes in arterial pressure. In persons with impaired kidney func- 2 tion, the steepness of the renal output curve may be reduced, similar to the acute curve, resulting in increased sensitivity of arterial pres- 0 sure to changes in salt intake.
