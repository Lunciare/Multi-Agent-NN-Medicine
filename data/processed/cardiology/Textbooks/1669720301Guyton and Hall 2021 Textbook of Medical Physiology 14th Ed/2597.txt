said to have a dioptric Light from distant source strength of −1. Likewise, if the concave lens diverges light rays as much as a +10-d iopter lens converges them, this lens is said to have a strength of −10 diopters. Focal Concave lenses “neutralize” the refractive power of con- points vex lenses. Thus, placing a 1- diopter concave lens imme- diately in front of a 1- diopter convex lens results in a lens Point source system with zero refractive power. The strengths of cylindrical lenses are computed in the same manner as the strengths of spherical lenses, ex- cept that the axis of the cylindrical lens must be stated in addition to its strength. If a cylindrical lens focuses parallel light rays to a line focus 1 meter beyond the lens, it has a strength of +1 diopter. Conversely, if a cylindri- Figure 50-6 . The two upper lenses of this figure have the same focal length, but the light rays entering the top lens are parallel, whereas cal lens of a concave type diverges light rays as much as those entering the middle lens are diverging. The effect of parallel a +1- diopter cylindrical lens converges them, it has
