The angiotensin II, in turn, raises the Other Types of Hypertension Caused by Combinations of Volume Loading and Vasoconstriction arterial pressure acutely. The secretion of renin rises to a peak in about 1 or 2 hours but returns nearly to normal in Hypertension in the Upper Part of the Body Caused by 5 to 7 days because the renal arterial pressure by that time Coarctation of the Aorta.
