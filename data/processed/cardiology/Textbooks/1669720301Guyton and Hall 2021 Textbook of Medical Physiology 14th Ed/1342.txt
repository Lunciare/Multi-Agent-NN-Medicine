a layer of f and filtering surface area of the capillaries. The glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) that line the outer surface of capillaries have a much higher rate of filtration than most the glomerulus. These podocytes are not continuous but other capillaries because of a high glomerular hydrostatic have long footlike processes (pedicels) that encircle the pressure and a large K f. In the average adult human, the outer surface of the capillaries (see Figure 27- 2).

The epithelial cells, capillaries which also have negative charges, provide additional restriction to filtration of plasma proteins. Thus, all layers of the glomerular capillary wall provide a barrier to the Renal filtration of plasma proteins but permit rapid filtration of vein water and most
