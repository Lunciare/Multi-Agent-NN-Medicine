The DNA helixes of the nucleus are packaged in chro- growing between the respective centriole pairs and actu- mosomes. The human cell contains 46 chromosomes ally pushing them apart. At the same time, other microtu- arranged in 23 pairs. Most of the genes in the two chro- bules grow radially away from each of the centriole pairs, mosomes of each pair are identical or almost identical to forming a spiny star called the aster, in each end of the each other, so it is usually stated that the different genes cell. Some of the spines of the aster penetrate the nuclear also exist in pairs, although occasionally this is not the membrane and help separate the two sets of chromatids case. during mitosis.
