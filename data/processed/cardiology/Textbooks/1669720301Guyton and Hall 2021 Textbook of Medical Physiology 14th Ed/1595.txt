tubule, 25% to 30% is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, bones to increase resorption of bone salts (release of salts and 4% to 9% is reabsorbed in the distal and collecting from the bones) and release large amounts of calcium tubules. This pattern of reabsorption is similar to that into the extracellular fluid, thereby returning calcium for sodium. 390 Chapter 30 Renal Regulation of Potassium, Calcium, Phosphate, and Magnesium Renal Tubular membrane. The mechanism for this active transport is interstitial Proximal tubular cells lumen similar to that in the proximal tubule and thick ascending fluid Ca2+ limb. It involves diffusion across the luminal membrane through calcium channels and exit across the basolat- H 2O eral membrane by a calcium- ATPase pump, as well as a Ca2+ sodium- calcium counter- transport mechanism. In this ATP Ca2+ segment, as well as in the loops of Henle, PTH stimulates calcium reabsorption. Vitamin D (calcitriol) and calci- tonin also stimulate calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle’s loop and in the distal tubule, 3 Na+ although these hormones are not as important quantita- Ca2+ tively as PTH in reducing renal calcium excretion. Ca2+ Regulation of Tubular Calcium Reabsorption. One of the
