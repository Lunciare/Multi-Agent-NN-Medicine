These combined contractions of ileal peristalsis is inhibited, both of which greatly delay the circular and longitudinal strips of muscle cause the emptying of additional chyme into the cecum from the unstimulated portion of the large intestine to bulge out- ileum. Also, any irritant in the cecum delays emptying. ward into baglike sacs called haustrations. For example, when a person has an inflamed appendix, Each haustration usually reaches peak intensity in the irritation of this vestigial remnant of the cecum can about 30 seconds and then disappears during the next 60 cause such intense spasm of the ileocecal sphincter and seconds.
