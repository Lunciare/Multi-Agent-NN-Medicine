An shows the general principle of ameboid motion. Basical- important initiator of ameboid locomotion is the process ly, this results from the continual formation of new cell called chemotaxis, which results from the appearance of membrane at the leading edge of the pseudopodium and certain chemical substances in the tissues. Any chemi- continual absorption of the membrane in the mid and rear cal substance that causes chemotaxis to occur is called portions of the cell. Two other effects are also essential for a chemotactic substance. Most cells that exhibit ameboid forward movement of the cell.
