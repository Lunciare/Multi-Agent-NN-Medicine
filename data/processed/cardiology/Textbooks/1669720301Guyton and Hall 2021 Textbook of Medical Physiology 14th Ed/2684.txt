The responses of P cells to stimuli, especially color on off stimuli, can be sustained, whereas the responses of M cells are much more transient. 1 4. The P cells are generally sensitive to the color of a Excitation stimulus, whereas M cells are not sensitive to color stimuli. 2 5. The M cells are much more sensitive than
