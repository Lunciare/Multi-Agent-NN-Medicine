Erectile duct Two seminal vesicles, one located on each side of the tissue Bulbourethral prostate, empty into the prostatic end of the ampulla, and gland Prepuce the contents from both the ampulla and the seminal vesicles Vas deferens pass into an ejaculatory duct leading through the body of the Glans Epididymis A penis Testis Scrotum prostate gland and then emptying into the internal urethra. Prostatic ducts also empty from the prostate gland into the ejaculatory duct and from there into the prostatic urethra.
