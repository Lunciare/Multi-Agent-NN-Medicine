with a thin layer of metal, Absorption, mainly sodium and chloride ions such as silver or gold, which reflects radiant heat back to the body, makes the insulating properties of clothing far more effective than otherwise. By using this technique, clothing for use in the arctic can be decreased in weight by about half. The effectiveness of clothing in maintaining body temperature is almost completely lost when the cloth- Gland ing becomes wet because the high conductivity of water Primary increases the rate of heat transmission through cloth 20- secretion, fold or more. Therefore, one of the most important factors mainly for protecting the body against cold in arctic regions is protein- free extreme caution against allowing the clothing to become filtrate wet. Indeed, one must be careful not to become over- heated even temporarily because sweating in one’s clothes makes them much less effective thereafter as an insulator.

A primary protein-f ree secretion is formed by the Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus- preoptic area in glandular portion, but most of the electrolytes are reabsorbed in the
