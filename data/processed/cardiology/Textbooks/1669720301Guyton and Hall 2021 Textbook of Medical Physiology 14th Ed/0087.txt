C CH In this citric acid cycle, acetyl- CoA is split into its N N O O O component parts, hydrogen atoms and carbon dioxide. O CH 2 O P O~~P O~~P O– The carbon dioxide diffuses out of the mitochondria and eventually out of the cell; finally, it is excreted from the C H H C O– O– O– body through the lungs. Phosphate H C C H The hydrogen atoms, conversely, are highly reactive; they combine with oxygen that has also diffused into OH OH the mitochondria. This combination releases a tremen- Ribose dous amount of energy, which is used by mitochondria Adenosine triphosphate to convert large amounts of ADP to ATP. The processes of these reactions are complex, requiring the participa- ATP is a nucleotide composed of the following: (1) the tion of many protein enzymes that are integral parts of nitrogenous base adenine; (2) the pentose sugar ribose; mitochondrial membranous shelves that protrude into the and (3) three phosphate radicals. The last two phosphate mitochondrial matrix. The initial event is the removal of radicals are connected with the remainder of the mol- an electron from the hydrogen atom, thus converting it to ecule by high- energy
