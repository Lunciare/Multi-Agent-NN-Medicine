It is transported mainly in the form of free fatty acids. This transport is achieved by hydrolysis of the triglycerides back into fatty acids and glycerol. At least two classes of stimuli play important roles in promoting this hydrolysis. First, when the amount of glu- cose available to the fat cell is inadequate, one of the glucose breakdown products, α- glycerophosphate, is also available in insufficient quantities. Because this substance is required to maintain the glycerol portion of triglycerides, the result is hydrolysis of triglycerides. Second, a hormone- sensitive cellular lipase can be activated by several hormones from the endocrine glands, and this also promotes rapid hy-
