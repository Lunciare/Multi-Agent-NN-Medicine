For increase in pulse pressure, as previously explained. example, in patients with arteriovenous fistulas for hemo- dialysis or with aortic insufficiency, Korotkoff sounds may Mean Arterial Pressure. The mean arterial pressure is be heard after complete deflation of the cuff. the average of the arterial pressures measured millisecond The auscultatory method for determining systolic and by millisecond over a period of time. It is not equal to the diastolic pressures is not entirely accurate, but it usually average of the systolic and diastolic pressures because at 187 )gH mm( erusserP UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation 200 that causes rapid inflow of blood into the right atrium from the peripheral veins elevates the right atrial pressure. 150 Systolic Some factors that can increase this venous return and thereby increase the right atrial pressure are as follows: (1) Mean increased blood volume; (2) increased large vessel tone 100 throughout the body with resultant increased peripheral Diastolic venous pressures; and (3) dilation of the arterioles, which 50 decreases the peripheral resistance and allows rapid flow of blood from the arteries into the veins. 0 The same factors that regulate right atrial pressure also 0 20 40
