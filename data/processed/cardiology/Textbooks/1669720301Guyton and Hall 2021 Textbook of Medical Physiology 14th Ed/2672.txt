in the direct pathway: (1) cones; (2) bipolar cells; and (3) gan- glion cells. In addition, horizontal cells transmit inhibitory signals laterally in the outer plexiform layer, and amacrine cells transmit signals laterally in the inner plexiform layer. To the left in Figure 51- 12 are the neural connections for the peripheral retina, where both rods and cones are present. Three bipolar cells are shown; the middle of these connects only to rods, representing the type of visual sys- tem present in many lower animals. The output from the bipolar cell passes only to amacrine cells, which relay the signals to the ganglion cells. Thus, for pure rod vision, there are four neurons in the direct visual pathway: (1) rods; (2) bipolar cells; (3) amacrine cells; and (4) ganglion cells. In addition, horizontal and amacrine cells provide Figure 51- 11. Two Ishihara charts. In this chart (upper panel), a lateral connectivity. person with normal vision reads “74,” but a red-g reen color- blind The other two bipolar cells shown in the peripheral person reads “21.” In this chart (lower panel), a red- blind person retinal circuitry of Figure 51- 12 connect with both rods (protanope) reads “2,” but a green-
