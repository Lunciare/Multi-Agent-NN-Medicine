index of 1.50. When the beam first strikes the angulated that light rays striking an angulated glass surface are bent. interface, the lower edge of the beam enters the glass ahead of the upper edge. The wave front in the upper portion of the beam continues to travel at a velocity of 300,000 km/sec, whereas that which entered the glass travels at a velocity of 200,000 km/sec. This difference in velocity causes the upper portion of the wave front to move ahead of the lower portion so that the wave front is no longer vertical but is angulated to the right. Because the direction in which light travels is al- ways perpendicular to the plane of the wave front, the direc- tion of travel of the light beam bends downward. Light from Focal length This bending of light rays at an angulated interface is distant source known as refraction. Note particularly that the degree of Figure 50- 2. Bending of light rays at each surface of a convex spheri- refraction increases as a function of the following: (1) the cal lens showing that parallel light rays are focused to a focal point. 627 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System:
