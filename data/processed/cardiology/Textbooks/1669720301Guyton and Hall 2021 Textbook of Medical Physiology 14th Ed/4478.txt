The ductus arteriosus DDuuccttuuss also closes, but for different reasons. First, the increased aarrtteerriioossuuss 1155 systemic resistance elevates the aortic pressure while the 4422 decreased pulmonary resistance reduces the pulmonary ar- 3300 RRiigghhtt RRiigghhtt terial pressure. As a consequence, after birth, blood begins aattrriiuumm vveennttrriiccllee to flow backward from the aorta into the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus, rather than in the other di- 2277 rection, as in fetal life. However, after only a few hours, the LLuunnggss muscle wall of the ductus arteriosus constricts markedly 5588 and, within 1
