sure averages 2 mm Hg, giving a net pressure difference of vessels indicate that the velocity of flow in each ring is 14 mm. Therefore, when the cardiac output is normal at different from that in the adjacent rings because of lami- about 100 ml/sec, the total pulmonary vascular resistance nar flow, which was discussed earlier in the chapter. That calculates to be about 0.14 PRU (about one seventh that in is, the blood in the ring touching the wall of the vessel is the systemic circulation). barely flowing because of its adherence to the vascular en- dothelium. The next ring of blood toward the center of the Conductance of Blood in a Vessel Is the Reciprocal vessel slips past the first ring and, therefore, flows more of Resistance. Conductance is a measure of the blood rapidly. Likewise, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rings flow through a vessel for a given pressure difference. This flow at progressively increasing velocities. Thus, the blood measurement is generally expressed in terms of ml/sec that is near the wall of the vessel flows slowly, whereas per mm Hg pressure, but it can also be expressed in terms that in the middle of the
