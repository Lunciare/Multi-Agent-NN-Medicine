Because the proteins are the only volume is four times the volume of plasma, the average dissolved constituents in the plasma and interstitial fluids protein concentration of the interstitial fluid of most tis- that do not readily pass through the capillary pores, it is sues is usually only 40% of that in plasma, or about 3 g/ the proteins of the plasma and interstitial fluids that are dl. Quantitatively, the average interstitial fluid colloid responsible for the osmotic pressures on the two sides of osmotic pressure for this concentration of proteins is the capillary membrane. To distinguish this osmotic pres- about 8 mm Hg. sure from that which occurs at the cell membrane, it is called colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. The FLUID VOLUME EXCHANGE THROUGH term colloid osmotic pressure is derived from the fact that THE CAPILLARY MEMBRANE a protein solution resembles a colloidal solution, despite the fact that it is actually a true molecular
