Cardiac Index Another important factor, discussed in Chapters 10 and 18, is that stretching the heart causes an increased heart rate. Experiments have shown that the cardiac output increases Stretch of the sinus node in the wall of the right atrium has approximately in proportion to the surface area of the body. a direct effect on the rhythmicity of the node to increase the Therefore, cardiac output is frequently stated in terms of the cardiac index, which is the cardiac output per square heart rate as much as 10% to 15%. In addition, the stretched meter of body surface area. The average person who weighs right atrium initiates a nervous reflex called the Bainbridge 70 kilograms has a body
