Moreo- Action potential ver, their release may be differentially regulated because of different calcium ion sensitivities (Figure 46- 8B) or spatial segregation of the vesicles on different boutons Ca2+ Ca2+ (Figure 46- 8C). The co- release of transmitters and co- transmission of signals obviously has important functional implications. Each different transmitter released from the same pre- synaptic neuron has its own specific receptors and may have inhibitory or excitatory influences on the postsyn- aptic target. Different neurons may release different com- binations of fast-a cting transmitters that directly activate B Co-transmission; differential Ca2+ sensitivity postsynaptic receptors,
