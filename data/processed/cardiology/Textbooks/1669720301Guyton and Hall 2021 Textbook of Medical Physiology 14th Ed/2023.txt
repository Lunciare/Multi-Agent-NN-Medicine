oxa- tissue factor activates the prothrombin to thrombin reac- late anticoagulants because oxalate is toxic to the body, tion by means of the extrinsic clotting pathway. The time whereas moderate quantities of citrate can be injected required for coagulation to take place is known as the intravenously. After injection, the citrate ion is removed prothrombin time. The shortness of the time is determined from the blood within a few minutes by the liver and is mainly by the prothrombin concentration. The normal 487 UNIT VI UNIT VI Blood Cells, Immunity, and Blood Coagulation 100 Tests similar to that for prothrombin time and INR have been devised to determine the quantities of other blood- clotting factors. In each of these tests, excesses of calcium ions and all the other factors in addition to the one being tested are added to oxalated blood all at once. Then, the time required for coagulation is determined in the same manner as for prothrombin time. If the factor being tested is defi- 50.0 cient, the coagulation time is prolonged. The time itself can then be used to quantitate the concentration of the factor. 25.0 Bibliography 12.5 Becker RC, Sexton T, Smyth SS: Translational implications of
