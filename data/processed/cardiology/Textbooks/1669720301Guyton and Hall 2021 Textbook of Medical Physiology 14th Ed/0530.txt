remote from the heart, the voltage of the QRS com- plex may be as high as 3 to 4 millivolts. Even this voltage is FLOW OF CURRENT AROUND THE small in comparison with the monophasic action poten- HEART DURING THE CARDIAC CYCLE tial of 110 millivolts recorded directly at the heart muscle membrane. When ECGs are recorded from electrodes on Recording Electrical Potentials from a the two arms or on one arm and one leg, the voltage of the Partially Depolarized Mass of Syncytial QRS complex usually is 1.0 to 1.5 millivolts from the top Cardiac Muscle of the R wave to the bottom of the S wave, the voltage of the P wave is between 0.1 and 0.3 millivolts, and the volt- Figure 11- 4 shows a syncytial mass of cardiac muscle that age of the T wave is between 0.2 and 0.3 millivolts. has been stimulated at its most central point. Before stimu- lation, all the exteriors of the muscle cells had been positive, P- Q or P-R Interval. The time between the beginning of and the interiors had been negative.
