are present in the body pro- teins in significant quantities. Figure 70- 1, which shows C O H N the chemical formulas of these 20 amino acids, demon- strates that they all have two features in common; each R HC CH R(cid:31) amino acid has an acidic group (–COOH) and a nitrogen atom attached to the molecule, usually represented by the N H O C amino group (–NH ). 2 Peptide Linkages and Peptide Chains. The amino ac- ids of proteins are aggregated into long chains by means of peptide linkages. The chemical nature of this linkage is Many peptide chains are coiled or folded, and the suc- demonstrated by the following reaction: cessive coils or folds are held in a tight spiral or in other shapes by similar hydrogen bonding and other forces. NH HNH 2 Transport and Storage of Amino Acids R CH CO OH+ R(cid:31) CH COOH Blood Amino Acids The normal concentration of amino acids in the blood is NH 2 between 35 and 65 mg/dl, which is an average of about 2 mg/dl for each of the 20 amino acids, although some are R CH CO present in far greater amounts than are others.
