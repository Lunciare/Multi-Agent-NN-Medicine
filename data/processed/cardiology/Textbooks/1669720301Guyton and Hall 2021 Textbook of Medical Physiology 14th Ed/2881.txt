to the Face 2, central sulcus. It begins laterally in the sylvian fissure, 3, Mouth spreads superiorly to the uppermost portion of the brain, and then dips deep into the longitudinal fissure. (This area is the same as area 4 in Brodmann’s classification of the brain cortical areas, shown in Figure 48- 5.) Premotor Figure 56- 1 lists the approximate topographical repre- area sentations of the different muscle areas of the body in the primary motor cortex, beginning with the face and mouth Figure 56- 1. Motor and somatosensory functional areas of the cere- region near the sylvian fissure; the arm and hand area, in bral cortex. The numbers 4, 5, 6, and 7 are Brodmann’s cortical areas, the midportion of the primary motor cortex; the trunk, as explained in Chapter 48. 697 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C.
