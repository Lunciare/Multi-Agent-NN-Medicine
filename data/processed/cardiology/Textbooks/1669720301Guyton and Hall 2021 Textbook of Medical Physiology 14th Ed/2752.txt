Another feature of the traveling wave is that it travels The principal method whereby sound frequencies are fast along the initial portion of the basilar membrane but discriminated from one another is based on the “place” of becomes progressively slower as it goes farther into the maximum stimulation of the nerve fibers from the organ cochlea. The cause of this difference is the high coefficient of Corti lying on the basilar membrane, as explained in of elasticity of the basilar fibers near the oval window and a the next section. progressively decreasing coefficient farther along the mem- FUNCTION OF THE ORGAN OF CORTI brane.
