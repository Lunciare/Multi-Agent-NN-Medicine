O 2 2 pressure can be detrimental to many of the body’s tissues. For example, breathing O at 4 atm pressure of O (Po = 2 2 2 3040 mm Hg) will cause brain seizures followed by coma in most people within 30 to 60 minutes. The seizures of- ten occur without warning and, for obvious reasons, are 233 ft likely to be lethal to divers submerged beneath the sea. 1/8 liter Other symptoms encountered in acute O poison- 2 ing include nausea, muscle twitchings, dizziness, distur- bances of vision, irritability, and disorientation. Exercise Figure 45- 1. Effect of sea depth on pressure (top) and on gas vol- greatly increases the diver’s susceptibility to O toxicity, 2 ume (bottom). causing symptoms to appear much earlier and with far greater severity than in the resting person. Excessive Intracellular Oxidation as a Cause of Nerv- 30 ous System Oxygen Toxicity—Oxidizing Free Radi- cals. Molecular O has little capability of oxidizing other A 2 chemical compounds. Instead, it must first be converted 25 into an active form of oxygen. There are several forms of B active oxygen, called oxygen free radicals. One of the most important of these is the superoxide free radical
