This observation means that the higher becomes high enough to cause glucose excretion in the the concentration of sodium in the proximal tubules, urine, even after eating a meal. However, in uncontrolled the higher is its reabsorption rate. Also, the slower the diabetes mellitus, plasma glucose concentration may rise to flow rate of tubular fluid, the greater the percentage high levels, causing the filtered load of glucose to exceed of sodium that can be reabsorbed from the proximal the transport maximum and resulting in urinary glucose tubules. excretion. Some of the important transport maximums for In the more distal parts of the nephron, the epithelial substances actively reabsorbed by the tubules are as follows: cells have much tighter junctions and transport much smaller amounts of sodium. In these segments, sodium Substance Transport Maximum reabsorption exhibits a transport maximum similar to that for other actively transported substances.
