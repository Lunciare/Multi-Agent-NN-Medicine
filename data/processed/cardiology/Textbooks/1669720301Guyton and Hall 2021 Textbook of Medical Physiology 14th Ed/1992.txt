When converted to the proteolytic effect on prothrombin, tending to convert it active forms, their enzymatic actions cause the successive, into still more thrombin, and it acts on some of the blood- cascading reactions of the clotting process. clotting factors responsible for formation of prothrombin Most of the clotting factors listed in Table 37- 1 are activator. (These effects, discussed in subsequent para- designated by Roman numerals. To indicate the activated graphs, include acceleration of the actions of factors VIII, form of the factor, a small letter “a” is added after the IX, X, XI, and XII and aggregation of platelets.)
