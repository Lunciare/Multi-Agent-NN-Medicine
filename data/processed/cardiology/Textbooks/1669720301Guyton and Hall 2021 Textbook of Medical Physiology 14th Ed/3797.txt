74- 4, only minute quanti- tities of heat than can be absorbed by air. Also, heat con- ties of heat, about 3%, are normally lost from the body by ductivity in water is very great in comparison with that in direct conduction from the surface of the body to solid air. Consequently, it is impossible for the body to heat a objects, such as a chair or a bed. Loss of heat by conduc- thin layer of water next to the body to form an “insulator tion to air, however, represents a sizable proportion of the zone” as occurs in air. Therefore, if the temperature of the body’s heat loss (≈15%), even under normal conditions. water is below body temperature the rate of heat loss to Heat is actually the kinetic energy of molecular motion, water is usually many times greater than the rate of heat and the molecules of the skin are continually undergoing loss to air. vibratory motion. Much of the energy of this motion can Evaporation be transferred to the air if the air is colder than the skin, thus increasing the velocity of the air molecules’ motion. When water evaporates from the body surface, 0.58 Calo-
