If such a strip is stimulated at blocking the rhythmical discharge of the focal point that the 12 o’clock position so that the impulse travels in only has been causing the paroxysmal attack. Amiodarone has one direction, the impulse spreads progressively around multiple actions, such as prolonging the action potential the circle until it returns to the 12 o’clock position. If the and refractory period in cardiac muscle and slowing A- V originally stimulated muscle fibers are still in a refractory conduction.
