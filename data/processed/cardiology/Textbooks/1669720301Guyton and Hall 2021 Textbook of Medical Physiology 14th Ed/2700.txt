Primary Visual Cortex. The primary visual cortex (see degree of visual acuity. Based on retinal area, the fovea Figure 52- 2) lies in the calcarine fissure area, extending has several hundred times as much representation in the forward from the occipital pole on the medial aspect of primary visual cortex as do the most peripheral portions each occipital cortex.
