1 inch in front of the sorbed. The balance between formation and reabsorption eye, the image moves almost all the way across the retinas, of aqueous humor regulates the total volume and pressure whereas the image of an object 200 feet away from the eyes of the intraocular fluid. does not move perceptibly. Thus, by using this mechanism FORMATION OF AQUEOUS HUMOR BY of moving parallax, one can tell the relative distances of dif- ferent objects even though only one eye is used. THE CILIARY BODY Determination of Distance by Stereopsis—Binocular Aqueous humor is formed in the eye at an average rate Vision. Another method whereby one perceives parallax is of 2 to 3 μL/min. Essentially all of it is secreted by the that of binocular vision. Because one eye is a little more than ciliary processes, which are linear folds projecting from 2 inches to one side of the other eye, the images on the two the ciliary body into the space behind the iris where the retinas are different from each other. For example, an object 1 lens ligaments and ciliary muscle attach to the eyeball. A inch in front of the nose forms an image on the
