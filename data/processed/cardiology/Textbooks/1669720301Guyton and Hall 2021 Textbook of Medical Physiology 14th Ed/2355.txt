This system consists of the follow- ing components: (1) one or more tanks of compressed air Special Physiological Problems in Submarines or some other breathing mixture; (2) a first- stage “reduc- Escape From Submarines. Essentially the same prob- ing” valve for reducing the very high pressure from the lems encountered in deep sea diving are often found in re- tanks to a low pressure level; (3) a combination inhala- lation to submarines, especially when it is necessary to es- tion “demand” valve and exhalation valve that allows air cape from a submerged submarine. Escape is possible from to be pulled into the lungs with slight negative pressure of as deep as 300 feet without use of any apparatus. However, breathing and then to be exhaled into the sea at a pressure proper use of rebreathing devices, especially when using level slightly positive to the surrounding water pressure; helium,
