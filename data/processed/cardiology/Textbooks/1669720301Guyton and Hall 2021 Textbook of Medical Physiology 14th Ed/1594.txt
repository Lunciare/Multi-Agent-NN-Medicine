Renalcalciumexcretion = Calciumfiltered the bone, with only about 0.1% in the extracellular fluid −Calciumreabsorbed and 1.0% in the intracellular fluid and cell organelles. The bone, therefore, acts as a large reservoir for calcium and Only about 60% of the plasma calcium is ionized, as a source of calcium when extracellular fluid calcium with 40% being bound to the plasma proteins and 10% concentration tends to decrease. complexed with anions such as phosphate. There- One of the most important regulators of bone uptake fore, only about 60% of the plasma calcium is filtered and release of calcium is PTH. When extracellular fluid at the glomerulus. Normally, about 99% of the filtered calcium concentration falls below normal, activity of calcium is reabsorbed by the tubules, with only about calcium- sensing receptors (CSRs) on the cell membrane of 1% of the filtered calcium being excreted. About 65% the parathyroid glands is reduced, promoting increased of the filtered calcium is reabsorbed in the proximal secretion of PTH. This hormone then acts directly on the tubule, 25% to 30% is reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, bones to increase resorption of bone salts (release of salts and 4% to 9% is reabsorbed in the distal
