Associated with these reproductive functions Spermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules are the effects of the male sex hormones on the accessory during active sexual life as the result of stimulation by sexual organs, cellular metabolism, growth, and other anterior pituitary gonadotropic hormones. Spermatogen- functions of the body. esis begins in the male at an average age of 13 years and continues throughout most of the remainder of life but Physiological Anatomy of the Male Sexual Organs decreases markedly in old age. Figure 81-1 A shows various portions of the male re- productive system, and Figure 81-1 B gives a more de- tailed structure of the testis and epididymis. The testis Urinary bladder is composed of up to 900 coiled seminiferous tubules, each averaging more than one- half meter long, in which the sperm are formed. The sperm then empty into the Ampulla Prostate epididymis, which is another coiled tube about 6 meters gland Seminal long. The epididymis leads into the vas deferens, which vesicle enlarges into the ampulla of the
