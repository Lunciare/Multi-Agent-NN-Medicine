In the next two cells called the type A intercalated cells of the late distal tubule sections, we discuss the mechanisms whereby phosphate and in the collecting tubules. Hydrogen ion secretion in these and ammonia buffers contribute to generation of new cells is accomplished in two steps: (1) the dissolved CO in this HCO −. 2 3 cell combines with H O to form H CO ; and (2) the H CO 2 2 3 2 3 then dissociates into HCO 3−, which is reabsorbed into the PHOSPHATE BUFFER SYSTEM CARRIES blood, plus H+, which is secreted into the tubule by means of EXCESS H+ INTO THE URINE AND the hydrogen-A TPase and the hydrogen- potassium-A TPase GENERATES NEW HCO − 3 transporters.
