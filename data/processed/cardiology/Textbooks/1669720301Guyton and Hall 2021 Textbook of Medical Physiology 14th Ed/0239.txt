The reason for this phenomenon Note that the internal membrane potential is negative when potas- is that excess positive ions diffuse to the outside when sium ions diffuse and positive when sodium ions diffuse because of opposite concentration gradients of these two ions. their concentration is higher inside than outside the membrane. This diffusion carries positive charges to the outside but leaves the nondiffusible negative anions on the inside, thus creating electronegativity on the inside. The Goldman Equation Is Used to Calculate the Dif- The opposite effect occurs when there is a gradient for fusion Potential When the Membrane Is Permeable a negative ion.
