an action bers can set off automatic regenerative opening of the potential. Conversely, at the positive electrode, the injec- sodium channels. This automatic regenerative opening tion of positive charges on the outside of the nerve mem- can result from mechanical disturbance of the membrane, brane heightens the voltage difference across the mem- chemical effects on the membrane, or passage of electric- brane, rather than lessening it. This effect causes a state of ity through the membrane. All these approaches are used hyperpolarization, which actually decreases the excitability at different points in the body to elicit nerve or muscle of the fiber rather than causing an action potential.
