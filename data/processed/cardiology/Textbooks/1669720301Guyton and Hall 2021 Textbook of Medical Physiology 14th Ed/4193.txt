only at very low levels of vitamin D intake. the 25-h ydroxycholecalciferol has a feedback inhibitory concentration of calcium in the plasma. There are two rea- effect on the conversion reactions. This feedback effect is sons for this effect. First, the calcium ion has a slight effect extremely important for two reasons. in preventing conversion of 25- hydroxycholecalciferol to First, the feedback mechanism precisely regulates the 1,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol. Second, and even more concentration of 25-h ydroxycholecalciferol in the plasma, important, as we discuss later in the chapter, the rate of an effect that is shown in Figure 80- 9. Note that intake PTH secretion is greatly suppressed when plasma cal- of vitamin D can increase many times, and yet the con- cium ion concentration rises above 9 to 10 mg/100 ml. 3 centration of 25-h ydroxycholecalciferol remains nearly Therefore, at calcium concentrations below this level, normal. This high degree of feedback control prevents PTH promotes conversion of 25- hydroxycholecalciferol excessive action of vitamin D when intake of vitamin D is to 1,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol in the kidneys.
