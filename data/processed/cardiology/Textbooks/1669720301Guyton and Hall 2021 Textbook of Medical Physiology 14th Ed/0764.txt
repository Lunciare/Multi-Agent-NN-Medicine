Interstitial Fluid Pressures in Tightly Encased Tissues. To measure pressure in a capillary by cannulation, a micro- Some tissues of the body are surrounded by tight en- scopic glass pipette is thrust directly into the capillary, and casements, such as the cranial vault around the brain, the pressure is measured by an appropriate micromanome- the strong fibrous capsule around the kidney, the fibrous ter system. Using this method, capillary pressures have been sheaths around the muscles, and the sclera around the measured in exposed tissues of animals and in large capillary eye. In most of
