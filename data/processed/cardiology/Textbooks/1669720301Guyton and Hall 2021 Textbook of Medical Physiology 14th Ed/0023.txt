This process continues for each one. Values outside these ranges are often caused until the concentration returns to normal. by illness, injury, or major environmental challenges. 7 UNIT I UNIT I Introduction to Physiology: The Cell and General Physiology Table 1-1 Important Constituents and Physical Characteristics of Extracellular Fluid Constituent Normal Value Normal Range Approximate Short- Term Nonlethal Limit Unit Oxygen (venous) 40 25–40 10–1000 mm Hg Carbon dioxide (venous) 45 41–51 5–80 mm Hg Sodium ion 142 135–145 115–175 mmol/L Potassium ion 4.2 3.5–5.3 1.5–9.0 mmol/L Calcium ion 1.2 1.0–1.4 0.5–2.0 mmol/L Chloride ion 106 98–108 70–130 mmol/L Bicarbonate ion 24 22–29 8–45 mmol/L Glucose 90 70–115 20–1500 mg/dl Body temperature 98.4 (37.0) 98–98.8 (37.0) 65–110 (18.3–43.3) °F (°C) Acid–base (venous) 7.4 7.3–7.5 6.9–8.0 pH Most important are the limits beyond which abnor- the extracellular fluid carbon dioxide concentration malities can cause death.
