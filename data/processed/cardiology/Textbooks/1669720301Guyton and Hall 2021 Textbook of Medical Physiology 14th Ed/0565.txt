This lies, and the direction of initial depolarization is denoted sequence of repolarization is postulated to be caused by the black vector in Figure 12-9. Furthermore, the vector by the high blood pressure inside the ventricles during remains generally in this direction throughout the process contraction, which greatly reduces coronary blood flow of normal atrial depolarization. Because this direction is to the endocardium, thereby slowing repolarization in generally in the positive directions of the axes of the three the endocardial areas. standard bipolar limb leads I, II, and III, the ECGs recorded Because the outer apical surfaces of the ventricles from the atria during depolarization are also usually posi- repolarize before the inner surfaces, the positive end of tive in all three of these leads, as shown in Figure 12-9.

As a result, the normal T wave in all three bipolar limb leads is
