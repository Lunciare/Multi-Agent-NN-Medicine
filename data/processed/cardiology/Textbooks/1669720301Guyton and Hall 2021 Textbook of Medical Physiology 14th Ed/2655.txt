Sodium ions photon of light, the smallest possible quantal unit of light continue to be pumped outward through the membrane energy, can cause a receptor potential of about 1 millivolt in 643 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses a rod. Only 30 photons of light will cause half- saturation of Blue Green Red cone Rods cone cone the rod. How can such a small amount of light cause such 100 great excitation? The answer is that the photoreceptors have an extremely sensitive chemical cascade that ampli- 75 fies the stimulatory effects about a millionfold, as follows: 1. The photon activates an electron in the 11- cis retinal 50 portion of the rhodopsin; this activation leads to the formation of metarhodopsin II, which is the active 25 form of rhodopsin, as shown in Figure 51- 5. 2. The activated rhodopsin functions as an enzyme to 0 activate many molecules of transducin, a protein 400 500 600
