They gen- erally cannot be absorbed in their natural forms through Hydrolysis of Proteins. Proteins are formed from multi- the gastrointestinal mucosa, and for this reason, they are ple amino acids that are bound together by peptide link- useless as nutrients without preliminary digestion. This ages. At each linkage, a OH− has been removed from one chapter discusses the processes by which carbohydrates, amino acid and a H+ has been removed from the succeed- fats, and proteins are digested into small enough com- ing one; thus, the successive amino acids in the protein pounds for absorption and the mechanisms by which the chain are also bound together by condensation, and di- digestive end products, as well as water, electrolytes, and gestion occurs by the reverse effect: hydrolysis. That is, other substances, are absorbed. the
