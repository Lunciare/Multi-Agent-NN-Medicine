ming of blood in the veins, resulting in increased venous stimulated by sympathetic stimulation, in this way par- pressure. tially compensating for the nonfunctional muscle. Thus, The progressive changes in heart pumping effective- the heart becomes a stronger pump as a result of sympa- ness at different times after an acute myocardial infarc- thetic stimulation. This effect is illustrated in Figure 22- 1, tion are shown graphically in Figure 22- 1. The top curve which shows about a twofold elevation of the very low of this figure shows a normal cardiac output curve. Point cardiac output curve after sympathetic compensation. A on this curve is the normal operating point, showing a Sympathetic stimulation also increases venous return normal cardiac output under resting conditions of 5 L/ because it increases the tone of most of the blood vessels min and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg. of the circulation, especially the veins, raising the mean Immediately after the heart becomes damaged, the systemic filling pressure to 12 to 14 mm Hg, almost 100% cardiac output curve becomes greatly depressed, falling to above normal. As discussed in Chapter 20, this increased the lowest curve at the bottom of the graph.
