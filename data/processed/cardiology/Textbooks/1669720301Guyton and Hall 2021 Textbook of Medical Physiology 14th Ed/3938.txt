as high as 20 times normal. Supraoptic Conversely, injection of a dilute solution into this artery nucleus causes cessation of these impulses and therefore almost total cessation of ADH secretion. Thus, the concentra- tion of ADH in the body fluids can change from small Mammillary body amounts to large amounts, or vice versa, in only a few minutes. Optic chiasm Hypothalamic- hypophysial In or near the hypothalamus are modified neuron tract receptors called osmoreceptors. When the extracellular fluid becomes too concentrated, fluid is pulled by osmo- Anterior pituitary Posterior pituitary sis out of the osmoreceptor cell, decreasing its size and initiating appropriate nerve signals in the hypothalamus to cause additional ADH secretion. Conversely, when the extracellular fluid becomes too dilute, water moves by osmosis in the opposite direction, into the cell, which Figure 76- 10.

Although some researchers place these osmoreceptors in the hypothala- of water into the urine, also causing extreme dilution of mus (in the supraoptic nuclei), others believe that they the urine, a condition called central diabetes insipidus. are located in the organum vasculosum, a highly vascular Conversely, in the presence of high levels of
