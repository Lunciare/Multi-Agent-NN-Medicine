In addition to causing renal injury ing about a 10% decrease in the number of functional through diabetes and hypertension, obesity may have additive or synergistic effects to worsen renal function in nephrons for every 10 years after the age of 40 years (Fig- patients with pre- existing kidney disease. ure 32- 3). This loss of glomeruli and overall nephron func- tion is reflected by a progressive decrease in renal blood INJURY TO RENAL BLOOD VESSELS AS A flow and GFR. Even in healthy people without underlying CAUSE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE hypertension or diabetes, renal plasma flow and GFR may decrease by 40% to 50% by the age of 80 years. Many types of vascular lesions can lead to renal ischemia The frequency and severity of nephrosclerosis and and death of kidney tissue. The most common of these glomerulosclerosis are greatly increased by concurrent lesions are the following: (1) atherosclerosis of the larger hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Thus, benign nephro- renal arteries, with progressive sclerotic constriction of sclerosis in association with severe hypertension can
