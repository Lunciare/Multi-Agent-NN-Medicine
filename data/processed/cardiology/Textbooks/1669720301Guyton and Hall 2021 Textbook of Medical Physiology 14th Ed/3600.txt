to the Arterial lumen LDL receptor and induces a conformational change that Arterial intima Blood monocyte leads to its destruction, thereby reducing LDL absorption by the liver and other cells and increasing plasma choles- terol markedly. Drugs that inhibit PCSK9 are now available Damaged endothelium to treat familial hypercholesterolemia, although they are still very expensive and not widely used. Monocyte Patients with full- blown familial hypercholesterolemia adhered to Adhesion molecule may have blood cholesterol concentrations of 600 to 1000 epithelium mg/dl, levels that are four to six times normal. If untreated, many of these people die before age 30 years because of Monocyte myocardial infarction or other sequelae of atherosclerotic migrating into intima blockage of blood vessels throughout the body. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is relatively common and occurs in about 1 in 500 people. The more Receptor severe form of this disorder caused by homozygous muta- Lipoprotein tions is much rarer, occurring in only about one of every particle million births on average. Role of High-D ensity Lipoproteins in Preventing Macrophage foam cell Atherosclerosis. Much less is known about the function of HDLs compared with that of LDLs. It is believed that Lipid A HDLs can actually absorb cholesterol crystals
