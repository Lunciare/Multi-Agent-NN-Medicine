The effect of parallel a +1- diopter cylindrical lens converges them, it has a versus diverging rays on the focal distance is shown. The bottom lens strength of −1 diopter. If the focused line is horizontal, has far more refractive power than either of the other two lenses (i.e., its axis is said to be 0 degrees. If it is vertical, its axis is it has a much shorter focal length), demonstrating that the stronger 90 degrees. the lens, the nearer to the lens is the focal point. 629 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B.
