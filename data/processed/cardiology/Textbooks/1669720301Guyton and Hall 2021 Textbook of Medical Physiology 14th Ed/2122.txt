Carbon monoxide: 0.81 Nitrogen: 0.53 Helium: 0.95 Diffusion of Gases Through Tissues The gases that are of respiratory importance are all highly 1st breath 2nd breath 3rd breath soluble in lipids and, consequently, are highly soluble in cell membranes. Because of this, the major limitation to move- ment of gases in tissues is the rate at which the gases can diffuse through the tissue water instead of through the cell membranes. Therefore, diffusion of gases through tissues, in- cluding through the respiratory membrane, is almost equal to 4th breath 8th breath 12th breath 16th breath the diffusion of gases in water, as given in the preceding list.
