Spaces and Cerebrospinal Fluid. The large large particulate matter, by fibrosis, or by blood cells that arteries and veins of the brain lie on the surface of the have leaked into the cerebrospinal fluid in brain diseases. brain but their ends penetrate inward, carrying with them Such blockage can cause high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, a layer of pia mater, the membrane that covers the brain, as described in the following section. High Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure in Pathological Con- as shown in Figure 62- 7. The pia is only loosely adherent ditions of the Brain. Often a large brain tumor elevates the to the vessels, so a space, the perivascular space, exists cerebrospinal fluid pressure by decreasing reabsorption of between it and each vessel. Therefore, perivascular spaces the cerebrospinal fluid back into the blood. As a result, the follow both the arteries and the veins into the brain as far cerebrospinal fluid pressure can rise to as much as 500 mm as the arterioles and venules go. of water (37 mm Hg) or about four times normal. Lymphatic Function of the Perivascular Spaces. As The cerebrospinal fluid pressure also rises considerably when hemorrhage or infection occurs in the cranial vault. In
