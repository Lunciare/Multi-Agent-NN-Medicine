equation is extremely important in understanding the transmission of nerve impulses and is discussed in Chapter 5. Effect of a Pressure Difference Across the Membrane. At times, a considerable pressure difference develops be- Osmosis tween the two sides of a diffusible membrane. This pres- sure difference occurs, for example, at the blood capillary Figure 4-10. Osmosis at a cell membrane when a sodium chloride solution is placed on one side of the membrane and water is placed membranes in all tissues of the body. The pressure in on the other side. many capillaries is about 20 mm Hg greater inside than outside. Pressure actually means the sum of all the forces of the other side. Water molecules pass through the cell mem- different molecules striking a unit surface area at a given brane with ease, whereas sodium and chloride ions pass instant. Therefore, having a higher pressure on one side of a through only with difficulty. Therefore, sodium chloride membrane than on the other side means that the sum of all solution is actually a mixture of permeant water mole- the forces of the molecules striking the channels on that side cules and nonpermeant sodium and chloride ions, and of
