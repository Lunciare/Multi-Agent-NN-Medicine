As explained in Chapter 69, some of the acetoacetic acid is also converted into β- hydroxybutyric acid and acetone. These two substances, along with the acetoace- Insulin Deficiency Causes Lipolysis of Storage Fat and tic acid, are called ketone bodies, and their presence in Release of Free Fatty Acids.
