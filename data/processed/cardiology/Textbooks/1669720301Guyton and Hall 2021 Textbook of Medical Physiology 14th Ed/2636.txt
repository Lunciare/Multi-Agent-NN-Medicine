When either rods or cones are excited, nuclear layer containing the cell bodies of the rods and signals are transmitted first through successive layers of cones; (5) outer plexiform layer; (6) inner nuclear layer; neurons in the retina and, finally, into optic nerve fibers (7) inner plexiform layer; (8) ganglionic layer; (9) layer of and the cerebral cortex. In this chapter, we explain the optic nerve fibers; and (10) inner limiting membrane. mechanisms whereby the rods and cones detect light and After light passes through the lens system of the eye and color and convert the visual image into optic nerve signals. then through the vitreous humor, it enters the retina from the inside of the eye (see Figure 51-
