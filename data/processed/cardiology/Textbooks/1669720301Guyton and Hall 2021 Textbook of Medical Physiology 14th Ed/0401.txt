Instead, smooth muscle con- son with 3 to 4 kilograms for skeletal muscle. This great traction is activated by an entirely different mechanism, force of smooth muscle contraction results from the pro- as described in the next section. 103 UNIT II UNIT II Membrane Physiology, Nerve, and Muscle Extracellular fluid Ca2+ Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ Ca2+ CaM Caveolae Ca2+ CaM Inactive MLCK Active MLCK Sarcoplasmic ATP reticulum P P ADP + Inactive myosin Phosphorylated myosin Figure 8-4 Sarcoplasmic tubules in a large smooth muscle fiber showing their relation to invaginations in the cell membrane called caveolae. Actin cycling of the myosin head with the actin filament does not occur. However, when the regulatory chain Muscle contraction is phosphorylated, the head has the capability of binding repetitively with the actin filament and pro- ceeding through the entire cycling process of inter- Figure 8-3 Intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration increases when Ca2+ enters the cell through calcium channels in the cell mem- mittent pulls, the same as what
