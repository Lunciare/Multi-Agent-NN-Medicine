Figure 56- 3 shows Motor cortex a premotor area labeled “word formation” lying immedi- ately anterior to the primary motor cortex and immedi- ately above the sylvian fissure. This region is called Broca’s area. Damage to it does not prevent a person from vo- calizing but makes it impossible for the person to speak Corpus callosum whole words rather than uncoordinated utterances or an occasional simple word such as “no” or “yes.” A closely as- Posterior limb of sociated cortical area also causes appropriate respiratory internal capsule function, so respiratory activation of the vocal cords can occur simultaneously with the movements of the mouth and tongue during speech. Thus, the
