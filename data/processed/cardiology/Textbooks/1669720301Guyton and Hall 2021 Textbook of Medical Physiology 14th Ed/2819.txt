considering what happens in animals originally subserved olfaction later evolved into the basal brain structures that control emotions and other aspects Hypothalamus Medial olfactory area of human behavior; we call this system the limbic system, as discussed in Chapter 59. Prefrontal Transmission of Olfactory Signals Into the Olfactory cortex Bulb. The olfactory bulb is shown in Figure 54- 5. The ol- Olfactory factory nerve fibers leading backward from the bulb are tract called cranial nerve I, or the olfactory tract. In reality, both the tract and the bulb are an anterior outgrowth of brain Mitral cell tissue from the base of the brain; the bulbous enlargement at its end, the olfactory bulb, lies over the cribriform plate, Olfactory bulb separating the brain cavity from the upper reaches of the nasal cavity. The cribriform plate has multiple small per- Lateral Orbito- forations through which an equal number of small nerves olfactory frontal pass upward from the olfactory membrane in the nasal area cortex cavity to enter the olfactory bulb in the cranial cavity. Brain stem Hippocampus Temporal Figure 54- 3 demonstrates the close relation between the cortex olfactory cells in the olfactory membrane and the olfac- tory bulb, showing short axons
