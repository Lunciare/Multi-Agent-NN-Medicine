a way that the overlapping edge is free to flap inward, capillaries and in this way enter the lymph. As the lymph thus forming a minute valve that opens to the interior of passes through the lymph nodes, these particles are the lymphatic capillary. Interstitial fluid, along with its almost entirely removed and destroyed, as discussed in suspended particles, can push the valve open and flow Chapter 34. directly into the lymphatic capillary. However, this fluid has difficulty leaving the capillary once it has entered RATE OF LYMPH FLOW because any backflow closes the flap valve. Thus, the lymphatics have valves at the very tips of the terminal About 100 ml/hr of lymph flows through the thoracic lymphatic capillaries, as well as valves along their larger duct of a resting human, and approximately another 20 ml vessels, up to the point where they empty into the blood flows into the circulation each hour through other chan- circulation. nels, making a total estimated lymph flow of about 120 ml/hr or 2 to 3 L/day. FORMATION OF LYMPH Effect of Interstitial Fluid Pressure on Lymph Flow. Lymph is derived from interstitial fluid that flows into the Figure 16- 8 shows the effect
