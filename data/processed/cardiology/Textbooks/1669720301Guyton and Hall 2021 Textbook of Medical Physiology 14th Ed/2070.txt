During vapor before it reaches the trachea. When a person breathes normal breathing, the cords are wide open to allow easy pas- air through a tube directly into the trachea (as through a tra- sage of air. During phonation, the cords move together so cheostomy), the cooling and especially the drying effect in the that passage of air between them will cause vibration. The lower lung can lead to serious lung crusting and infection. pitch of the vibration is determined mainly by the degree Filtration Function of the Nose. The hairs at the entrance of stretch of the cords, but also by how tightly the cords are to the nostrils are important for filtering out large particles. approximated to one another and by the mass of their edges.
