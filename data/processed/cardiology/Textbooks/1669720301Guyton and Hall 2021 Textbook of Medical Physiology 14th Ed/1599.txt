The remaining 50% of calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb occurs through REGULATION OF RENAL PHOSPHATE the transcellular pathway, a process that is stimulated by EXCRETION PTH. In the distal tubule, calcium reabsorption occurs Phosphate excretion by the kidneys is controlled primarily by almost entirely by active transport through the cell an overflow mechanism that can be explained as follows.
