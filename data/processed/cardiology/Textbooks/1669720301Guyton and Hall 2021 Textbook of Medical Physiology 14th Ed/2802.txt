as long as the lower tip of the postcentral gyrus in the parietal cerebral taste stimulus remains. Thus, a strong immediate signal is cortex, where it curls deep into the sylvian fissure, and into transmitted by the taste nerve, and a weaker continuous the adjacent opercular insular area. This area lies slightly signal is transmitted as long as the taste bud is exposed to lateral, ventral, and rostral to the area for tongue tactile the taste stimulus. signals in cerebral somatic area I. From this description of the taste pathways, it is evident that they closely parallel TRANSMISSION OF TASTE SIGNALS INTO the somatosensory pathways from the tongue. THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Taste Reflexes Are Integrated in the Brain Stem. From Figures 54- 1 and 54- 2 show the neuronal pathways for the tractus solitarius, many taste signals are transmitted transmission of taste signals from the tongue and pharyn- within the brain stem itself directly into the superior and geal region into the central nervous system. Taste impulses inferior salivatory nuclei. These areas transmit signals to from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue pass first into the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands to help the lingual nerve, then through the
