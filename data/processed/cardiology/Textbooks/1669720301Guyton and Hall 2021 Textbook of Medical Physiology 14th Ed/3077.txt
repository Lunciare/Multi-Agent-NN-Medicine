cortex becomes activated by brain thought process- tory and dopamine is excitatory in some areas but inhibi- es or by motor processes, signals are sent from the cortex tory in others. As would be expected, these three systems to the brain stem excitatory area, which in turn sends still have different effects on levels of excitability in different more excitatory signals to the cortex. This process helps parts of the brain. The norepinephrine system spreads to to maintain the level of excitation of the cerebral cortex or virtually every area of the brain, whereas the serotonin even to enhance it. This is a positive feedback mechanism and dopamine systems are directed much more to spe- that allows any beginning activity in the cerebral cortex cific brain regions—the dopamine system mainly into the to support still more activity, thus leading to an “awake” basal ganglial regions and the serotonin system more into mind. the midline structures.
