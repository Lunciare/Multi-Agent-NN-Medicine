Conversely, estrogens have tend to increase the stretch in eliciting uterine contractions. 1054 Chapter 83 Pregnancy and Lactation Stretch or Irritation of the Cervix. There is reason to believe that stretching or irritating the uterine cervix is particularly important in eliciting uterine contractions. For example, obstetricians frequently induce labor by rupturing the membranes so the head of the baby stretch- es the cervix more forcefully than usual or irritates it in other
