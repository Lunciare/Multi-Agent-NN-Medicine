Abnormal Circulatory Dynamics. It is readily apparent Some congenital defects of the heart are hereditary that the major physiological difficulty caused by tetralogy because the same defect has been known to occur in 290 Chapter 23 Heart Valves and Heart Sounds; Valvular and Congenital Heart Defects identical twins, as well as in succeeding generations. for this is that the coronary vasculature typically does not Children of patients surgically treated for congenital heart increase to the same extent as the mass of cardiac muscle disease have about a 10 times greater chance of having increases. The second reason is that fibrosis often develops congenital heart disease than other children. Congenital in the muscle, especially in the subendocardial muscle where defects of the heart are also frequently associated with the coronary blood flow is poor, with fibrous tissue replacing other congenital defects of the baby’s body. degenerating muscle fibers. Because of the disproportion- ate increase
