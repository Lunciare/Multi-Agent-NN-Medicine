Drugs or pathological factors that increase neuronal contralateral ipsilateral cortex cortex excitation or impair inhibition tend to be epileptogenic (i.e., predisposing a person to epilepsy), whereas effective antie- pileptic drugs attenuate excitation and facilitate inhibition. In cases in which a person has brain injury due to trauma, stroke, or infection, there may be a delay of several months or years after the injury before the seizures begin. Epileptic seizures can be classified into two major types: (1) focal seizures (also called partial seizures) that are lim- ited to a focal area of one cerebral hemisphere, and (2) gen- A eralized seizures that diffusely involve both
