this area in Chapter 56 because it is the same brain stem entering the brain that transmit significant numbers of reticular area that transmits facilitory signals downward 741 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C. Motor and Integrative Neurophysiology Thalamus of the cortex. Furthermore, signals regularly reverberate back and forth between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, with the thalamus exciting the cortex and the cor- tex then re- exciting the thalamus via return fibers. Acti- vation of these back- and- forth reverberation signals has been suggested to establish long- term memories. Whether the thalamus also functions to call forth specific memories from the cortex or to activate specific thought processes is still unclear, but the thalamus does have appropriate neuronal circuitry for these purposes. A Reticular Inhibitory Area Is Located in the Lower Brain Stem Figure 59- 1 shows another area that is important in Excitatory area controlling brain activity—the reticular inhibitory area, located medially and ventrally in the medulla. In Chapter Fifth cranial nerve 56, we learned that this area can inhibit the reticular facil- Inhibitory area itory area of the upper brain stem and thereby decrease activity in the superior portions of the brain.
