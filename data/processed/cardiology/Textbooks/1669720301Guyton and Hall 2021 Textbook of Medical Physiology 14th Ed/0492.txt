Because of the high sodi- bundle branch um ion concentration in the extracellular fluid outside the nodal fiber, as well as a moderate number of already open sodium channels, positive sodium ions from outside the fibers normally tend to leak to the inside through inward, “funny” currents. Therefore, between heartbeats, the in- Figure 10- 1 Sinus node and the Purkinje system of the heart, show- ing also the atrioventricular (A- V) node, atrial internodal pathways, flux of positively charged sodium ions causes a slow rise and ventricular bundle branches. in the resting membrane potential in the positive direc- tion. Thus, as shown in Figure 10- 2, the resting potential Threshold for Sinus Ventricular gradually rises and becomes less negative between each +20 discharge nodal fiber muscle fiber two heartbeats. When the potential reaches a threshold 0 voltage of about –40 millivolts, the L- type calcium chan- nels become activated, thus causing the action potential. Therefore, basically, the inherent leakiness of the sinus –40
