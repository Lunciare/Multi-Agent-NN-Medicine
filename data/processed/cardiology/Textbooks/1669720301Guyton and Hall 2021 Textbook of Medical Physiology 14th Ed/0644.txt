The waves that can be seen are ventricular QRS and T waves. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Electrodes Remember that except for the conducting pathway through the A- V bundle, the atrial muscle mass is sepa- rated from the ventricular muscle mass by fibrous tissue. Therefore, ventricular fibrillation often occurs without atrial fibrillation. Likewise, fibrillation often occurs in the atria without ventricular fibrillation (shown on the right in Figure 13-20). The mechanism of atrial fibrillation is identical to that of ventricular fibrillation,
