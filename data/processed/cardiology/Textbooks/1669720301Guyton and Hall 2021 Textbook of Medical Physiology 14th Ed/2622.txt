DETERMINATION OF DISTANCE OF AN OBJECT FROM THE EYE—”DEPTH Figure 50- 17, which shows the images of a red spot and a PERCEPTION” yellow square actually reversed on the two retinas because they are at different distances in front of the eyes.

It is almost entirely this binocular parallax (or ste- retina; (2) the phenomenon of moving parallax; and (3) reopsis) that gives a person with two eyes far greater ability to the phenomenon of stereopsis.
