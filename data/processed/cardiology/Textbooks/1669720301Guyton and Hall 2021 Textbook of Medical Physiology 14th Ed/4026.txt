REGULATION OF ALDOSTERONE Fourth, the mRNA diffuses back into the cytoplasm SECRETION where, operating in conjunction with the ribosomes, it causes protein formation. The proteins formed are a Regulation of aldosterone secretion is so deeply inter- mixture of (1) one or more enzymes and (2) membrane twined with regulation of extracellular fluid electrolyte transport proteins that, all acting together, are required concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, blood volume, for sodium, potassium, and hydrogen transport through arterial pressure, and many special aspects of renal func- the cell membrane (see Figure 78- 4).
