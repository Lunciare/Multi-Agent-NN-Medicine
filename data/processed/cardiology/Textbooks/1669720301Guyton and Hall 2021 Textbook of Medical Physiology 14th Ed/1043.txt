These receptors are discussed in Chapter 61. An important effect of increased sympathetic stimula- tion in exercise is to increase the arterial pressure. This CIRCULATORY READJUSTMENTS DURING increased arterial pressure results from multiple stimula- EXERCISE tory effects, including the following: (1) vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the Three major effects occur during exercise that are body except the brain and active muscles, including the essential for the circulatory system to supply the tre- heart; (2) increased pumping activity by the heart; and (3) mendous blood flow required by the muscles: (1) sym- a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused pathetic nervous system activation in many tissues with mainly by venous contraction.
