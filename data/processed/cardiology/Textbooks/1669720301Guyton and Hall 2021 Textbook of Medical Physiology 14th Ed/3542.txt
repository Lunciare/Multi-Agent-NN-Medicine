cyclical process in which fore, lactic acid represents a type of “sinkhole” into which one molecule of glucose is metabolized for each revolution 850 Chapter 68 Metabolism of Carbohydrates and Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate Glucose-6-phosphate ther stored as glycogen or converted into fat. Glucose 2H is preferentially stored as glycogen until the cells have 6-Phosphoglucono-d-lactone stored as much glycogen as they can—an amount suf- ficient to supply the energy needs of the body for only 12 to 24 hours. 6-Phosphogluconic acid When the glycogen- storing cells (primarily liver 2H and muscle cells) approach saturation with glycogen, 3-Keto-6-phosphogluconic acid the additional glucose is converted into fat in liver and CO 2 fat cells and is stored as fat in the fat cells. Other steps D-Ribulose-5-phosphate in the chemistry of this conversion are discussed in H O 2 Chapter 69. D-Xylulose-5-phosphate Gluconeogenesis—Formation of Carbohydrates + From Proteins and Fats D-Ribose-5-phosphate When the body’s stores of carbohydrates decrease below normal, moderate quantities of glucose can be formed from D-Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate amino acids and the glycerol portion of fat. This process is + called gluconeogenesis. D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Gluconeogenesis is especially important in preventing excessive reductions in blood glucose concentration dur- Fructose-6-phosphate ing fasting. Glucose is the
