In many other types of stress besides muscle exercise, signals into the CNS. Feedback signals are then sent back a similar rise in pressure can also occur. For example, dur- through the autonomic nervous system to the circulation ing extreme fright, the arterial pressure sometimes rises to reduce arterial pressure down toward the normal level. by as much as 75 to 100 mm Hg within a few seconds. This response is called the alarm reaction, and it provides Physiologic Anatomy of the Baroreceptors and Their an elevated arterial pressure that can immediately supply Innervation.
