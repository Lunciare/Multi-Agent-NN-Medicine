The pulmonary artery, which receives blood passing back to the right atrium. Therefore, the flow into from the right ventricle, and its arterial branches carry the left atrium and left ventricular output are about 1% to blood to the alveolar capillaries for gas exchange, and the 2% greater than that of the right ventricular output. pulmonary veins then return the blood to the left atrium to be pumped by the left ventricle though the systemic Lymphatics. Lymph vessels are present in all the support- circulation. ive tissues of the lung, beginning in the connective tissue In this chapter, we discuss the special aspects of the spaces that surround the terminal bronchioles, coursing pulmonary circulation that are important for gas exchange to the hilum of the lung, and then mainly into the right in the lungs. thoracic lymph duct. Particulate matter entering the alve- oli is partly removed by these lymph vessels, and plasma protein leaking from the lung capillaries is also removed PHYSIOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE from the lung tissues, thereby helping to prevent pulmo- PULMONARY CIRCULATORY SYSTEM nary edema.
