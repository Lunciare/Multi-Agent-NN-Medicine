a Pump and Function of the Heart Valves The presence of this plateau in the action potential causes ventricular contraction to last as much as 15 times longer 20 1 in cardiac muscle than in skeletal muscle. 2 0 What Causes the Long Action Potential and Plateau in Cardiac Muscle? At least two major differences between -20 the membrane properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle ac- count for the prolonged action potential and the plateau in -40 0 3 cardiac muscle. First, the action potential of skeletal muscle -60 is caused almost entirely by the sudden opening of large numbers of fast sodium channels that allow tremendous -80 numbers of sodium ions to enter the skeletal muscle fiber 4 4 from the extracellular fluid. These channels are called fast -100 channels because they remain open for only a few thou- 0 100 200 300 sandths of a second and then abruptly close. At the end of Time (milliseconds) this closure, repolarization occurs, and the action potential is over within about another thousandth of a second. In cardiac muscle, the action potential is caused by Outward iK+ opening of two types of channels: (1) the same voltage- activated fast sodium channels
