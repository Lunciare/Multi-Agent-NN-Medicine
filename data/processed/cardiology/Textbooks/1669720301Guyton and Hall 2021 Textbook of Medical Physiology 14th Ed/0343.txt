Changes in Muscle Strength at the Onset of Contraction—the Staircase Effect (Treppe). When a Multiple Fiber Summation. When the central nerv- muscle begins to contract after a long period of rest, its ous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the initial strength of contraction may be as little as one-h alf smaller motor units of the muscle may be stimulated in its strength 10 to 50 muscle twitches later. That is, the preference to the larger motor units. Then, as the strength strength of contraction increases to a plateau, a phenom- of the signal increases, larger and larger motor units begin enon called the staircase effect, or treppe. to be excited, with the largest motor units often having Although all the possible causes of the staircase effect as much as 50 times the contractile force of the smallest are not known, it is believed to be caused primarily by units. This phenomenon,
