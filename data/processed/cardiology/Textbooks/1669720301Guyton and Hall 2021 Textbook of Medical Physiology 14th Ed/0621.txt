When the heart contracts ahead of sched- ule, the ventricles will not have filled with blood normally, CAUSES OF PREMATURE CONTRACTIONS and the stroke volume output during that contraction is depressed or is almost absent. Therefore, the pulse wave Most premature contractions result from ectopic foci in passing to the peripheral arteries after a premature con- the heart, which emit abnormal impulses at odd times traction may be so weak that it cannot be felt in the radial during the cardiac rhythm. Possible causes of ectopic artery. Thus, a deficit in the number of radial pulses oc- foci are as follows: (1) local areas of ischemia; (2) small curs when compared with the actual number of contrac- calcified plaques at different points in the heart, which tions of the heart. press against the adjacent cardiac muscle so that some of the fibers are irritated; and (3) toxic irritation of the A- V NODAL OR A- V BUNDLE PREMATURE A- V node, Purkinje system, or myocardium caused by CONTRACTIONS infection, drugs, nicotine, or caffeine.
