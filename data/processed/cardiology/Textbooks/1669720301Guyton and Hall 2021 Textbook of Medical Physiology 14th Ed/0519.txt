Note that when depolarization has WAVEFORMS OF THE NORMAL reached the halfway mark in Figure 11- 2A, the recording on ELECTROCARDIOGRAM the right has risen to a maximum positive value. In Figure 11- 2B, depolarization has extended over The normal ECG (see Figure 11- 1) is composed of a P the entire muscle fiber, and the recording to the right has wave, a QRS complex, and a T wave. The QRS complex is returned to the zero baseline because both electrodes are often, but not always, three separate waves: the Q wave, now in areas of equal negativity. The completed wave is a the R wave, and the S wave. depolarization wave because it results from the spread of The P wave is caused by electrical potentials generated depolarization along the muscle fiber membrane. when the atria depolarize before
