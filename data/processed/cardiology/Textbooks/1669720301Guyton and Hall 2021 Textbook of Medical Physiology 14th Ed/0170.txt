The cell thus dismantles vessels. itself, and its remains are rapidly digested by neighboring What is it that causes the altered genes? Considering phagocytic cells. that many trillions of new cells are formed each year in A tremendous amount of apoptosis occurs in tissues humans, a better question might be to ask why all of us that are being remodeled during development. Even in do not develop millions or billions of mutant cancerous adult humans, billions of cells die each hour in tissues cells. The answer is the incredible precision with which such as the intestine and bone marrow and are replaced DNA chromosomal strands are replicated in each cell by new cells. Programmed cell death, however, is normally before mitosis can take place, along with the proofreading balanced by formation of new cells in healthy adults. Oth- process that cuts and repairs any abnormal DNA strand erwise, the body’s
