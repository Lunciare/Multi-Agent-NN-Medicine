The abnormal consequences of obstruction depend on Certain foods are known to cause greater expulsion of the point in the gastrointestinal tract that becomes ob- flatus through the anus than others—beans, cabbage, on- structed. If the obstruction occurs at the pylorus, which ion, cauliflower, corn, and certain irritant foods such as often results from fibrotic constriction after peptic ulcera- vinegar. Some of these foods serve as a suitable medium tion, persistent vomiting of stomach contents occurs. This for gas- forming bacteria, especially unabsorbed ferment- vomiting depresses bodily nutrition; it also causes excessive able types of carbohydrates. For example, beans contain loss of hydrogen ions from the stomach and can result in an indigestible carbohydrate that passes into the colon and various degrees of whole- body metabolic alkalosis. becomes a superior food for colonic bacteria. But in other If the obstruction is beyond the stomach, antiperistaltic cases, excess expulsion of gas results
