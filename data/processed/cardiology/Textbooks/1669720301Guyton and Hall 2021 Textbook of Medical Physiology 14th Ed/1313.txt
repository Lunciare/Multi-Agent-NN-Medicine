Glomerulus Bowman’s Proximal tubule Efferent arteriole capsule Regional Differences in Nephron Structure: Cortical Juxta- and Juxtamedullary Nephrons. Although each nephron glomerular has all the components described earlier, there are some apparatus differences, depending on how deep the nephron lies within the kidney mass. The nephrons that have glomeruli Afferent arteriole located in the outer cortex are called cortical nephrons; they have short loops of Henle that penetrate only a short distance into the medulla (Figure 26- 5). Cortical About 20% to 30% of the nephrons have glomeruli that Distal tubule collecting lie deep in the renal cortex near the medulla and are called tubule juxtamedullary nephrons. These nephrons have long loops of Henle that dip deeply into the medulla, in some Arcuate Arcuate Loop of cases all the way to the tips of the renal papillae. Peritubular artery vein Henle capillaries The vascular structures supplying the juxtamedullary nephrons also differ from those supplying the cortical nephrons. For the cortical nephrons, the entire tubular Collecting duct system is surrounded by an extensive network
