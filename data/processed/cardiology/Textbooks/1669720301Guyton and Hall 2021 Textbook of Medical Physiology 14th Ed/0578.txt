Therefore, a strong vector develops, with its and the depolarization potentials do not neutralize each negative end toward the left ventricle and its positive end other. As a result, axis deviation occurs as follows. toward the right ventricle. In other words, intense right Vectorial Analysis of Left Axis Deviation in Left B undle axis deviation occurs. In Figure 12-15, right axis devia- tion caused by right bundle branch block is demonstrated, Branch Block. When the left bundle branch is blocked, and its vector is analyzed; this analysis shows an axis of cardiac depolarization spreads through the right ventricle about 105 degrees instead of the normal 59 degrees and a two to three times as rapidly as through the left ventricle. prolonged QRS complex because of slow conduction. Consequently, much of the left ventricle remains polar- ized for as long as 0.1 second after the right ventricle has CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE ABNORMAL become totally depolarized. Thus, the right ventricle be- VOLTAGES OF THE QRS COMPLEX comes electronegative, whereas the left ventricle remains electropositive during most of the depolarization process, INCREASED VOLTAGE IN THE STANDARD and a strong vector projects from
