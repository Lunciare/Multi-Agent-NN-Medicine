Growth Hormone Decreases There are two principal mechanisms of bone growth. Carbohydrate Utilization First, in response to GH stimulation, the long bones grow GH has multiple effects that influence carbohydrate in length at the epiphyseal cartilages, where the epiphyses metabolism, including (1) decreased glucose uptake in at the ends of the bone are separated from the shaft.

At Each of these changes results from GH- induced “insu- the same time, the epiphyseal cartilage is progressively lin resistance,” which attenuates insulin’s actions to stimu- used up so, by late adolescence, no additional epiphyseal late uptake and utilization of glucose in skeletal muscle cartilage remains to provide for further long bone growth. and adipose tissue and
