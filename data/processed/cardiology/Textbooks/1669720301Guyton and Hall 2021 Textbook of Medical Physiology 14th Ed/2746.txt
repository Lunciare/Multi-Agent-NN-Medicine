outward. These two forces figure. This membrane is so thin and so easily moved that oppose each other and thereby cause the entire ossicular it does not obstruct the passage of sound vibrations from system to develop increased rigidity, thus greatly reducing the scala vestibuli into the scala media. Therefore, as far as the ossicular conduction of low-f requency sound, mainly fluid conduction of sound is concerned, the scala vestibuli frequencies below 1000 cycles/sec. and scala media are considered to be a single chamber. As This attenuation reflex can reduce the intensity of discussed later, Reissner’s membrane maintains a special lower frequency sound transmission by 30 to 40 decibels, kind of fluid in the scala media that is required for normal which is about the same difference as that between a loud function of the sound- receptive hair cells. voice and a whisper. The function of this mechanism is Sound vibrations enter the scala vestibuli from the believed to be twofold—to protect the cochlea from dam- faceplate of the stapes at the oval window.
