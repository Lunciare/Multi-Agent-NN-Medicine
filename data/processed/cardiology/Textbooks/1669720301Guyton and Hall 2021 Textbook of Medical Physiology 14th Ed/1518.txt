highly permeable to solutes in the blood, except for forming concentrated urine, and high levels of ADH are the plasma proteins. As blood descends into the medulla present, reabsorption of water from the distal tubule and toward the papillae, it becomes progressively more con- cortical collecting tubule further raises the tubular fluid centrated, partly by solute entry from the interstitium and concentration of urea. As this urea flows into the inner partly by loss of water into the interstitium. By the time medullary collecting duct, the high tubular fluid concen- the blood reaches the tips of the vasa recta, it has a con- tration of urea and urea transporters UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 centration of about 1200 mOsm/L, the same as that of the cause urea to diffuse into the medullary interstitium. A medullary interstitium. As blood ascends back toward the moderate share of the urea that moves into the medullary cortex, it becomes progressively less concentrated as sol- interstitium eventually diffuses into the thin loop of Henle utes diffuse back out into the medullary interstitium and and then passes upward through the ascending loop of as water moves into the vasa recta. 371 UNIT V UNIT V The
