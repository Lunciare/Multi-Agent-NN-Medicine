in circulatory shock, when all Central lacteal the body’s vital tissues are in danger of cellular death for lack of blood flow—especially the brain and the heart— sympathetic stimulation can decrease splanchnic blood Blood capillaries flow to very little for many hours. Sympathetic stimulation also causes strong vasocon- striction of the large- volume intestinal and mesenteric veins. This vasoconstriction decreases the volume of these veins, thereby displacing large amounts of blood into other parts of the circulation. In persons experiencing hemorrhagic shock or other states of low blood volume, this mechanism can provide as much as 200 to 400 ml of extra blood to sustain the general circulation.
