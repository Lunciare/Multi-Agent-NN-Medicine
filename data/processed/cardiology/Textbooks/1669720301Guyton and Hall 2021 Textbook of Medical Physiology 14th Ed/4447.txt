than a few milliliters of fluid are Alveoli secreted each day until after the baby is born. The fluid secreted during the last few days before and the first few days after parturition is called colostrum; it contains B essentially the same concentrations of proteins and lac- tose as milk, but it has almost no fat, and its maximum Myoepithelial cells rate of production is about 1/100 the subsequent rate of milk production. Immediately after the baby is born, the sudden loss of both estrogen and progesterone secretion from the Ductule placenta allows the lactogenic effect of prolactin from Milk the mother’s pituitary gland to assume its natural milk- promoting role, and during the next 1 to 7 days, the Milk- secreting breasts begin to secrete copious quantities of milk instead epithelial of colostrum. This secretion of milk requires an adequate cells background secretion of most of the mother’s other hor- mones as well, but most important are growth hormone, C cortisol, parathyroid hormone, and insulin. These hor- Figure 83- 11. A, The breast and its secretory lobules, alveoli, and mones are necessary to provide the amino acids, fatty lactiferous ducts (milk ducts) that constitute its mammary gland.
