During each revolution of the citric acid cycle, 1 mol- A, and A3. Each electron is shuttled from one of these ac- ecule of ATP is formed. However, because each glucose ceptors to the next until it finally reaches cytochrome A3, molecule splits into 2 pyruvic acid molecules, there are which is called cytochrome oxidase because it is capable of 2 revolutions of the cycle for each molecule of glucose giving up 2 electrons and thus reducing elemental oxygen metabolized, giving a net production of 2 more mole- to form ionic oxygen, which then combines with hydrogen cules of ATP. ions to form water. 3. D uring the entire schema of glucose breakdown, a Thus, Figure 68-7 shows the transport of electrons total of 24 hydrogen atoms are released during glyco- through the electron chain and then their ultimate use by lysis and during the citric acid cycle. Twenty of these cytochrome oxidase to cause the formation of water mol- atoms are oxidized in conjunction with the chemi- ecules. During the transport of these electrons through the osmotic mechanism shown in
