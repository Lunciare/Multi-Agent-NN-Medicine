Yet, when the permeability of the usually expresses most of the fluid from the clot within capillaries becomes pathologically increased, fibrinogen 20 to 60 minutes.

(1) Tissue trauma Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low. Electron micrographs of platelets in blood clots show that Tissue factor they become attached to the fibrin fibers in such a way that they actually bond different fibers together. Furthermore,
