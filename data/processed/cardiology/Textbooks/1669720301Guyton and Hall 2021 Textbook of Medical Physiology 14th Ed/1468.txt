We can use renal clearance to quantify renal blood ter Reabsorption. When specific cells of the cardiac atria flow, GFR, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. are stretched because of plasma volume expansion and To illustrate the clearance principle, consider the fol- increased atrial blood pressure, they secrete a peptide lowing example. If the plasma passing through the kidneys called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increased levels contains 1 milligram of a substance in each milliliter, and of this peptide in turn directly inhibit reabsorption of if 1 milligram of this substance is also excreted into the sodium and water by the renal tubules, especially in the urine each minute, then 1 ml/min of the plasma is cleared collecting ducts.
