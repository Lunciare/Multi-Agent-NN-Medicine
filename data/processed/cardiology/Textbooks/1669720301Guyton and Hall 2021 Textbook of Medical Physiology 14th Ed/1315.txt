The initial parts of 8 to 10 cortical collecting ducts join to form a single, larger collecting duct that MICTURITION runs downward into the medulla and becomes the medullary collecting duct. The collecting ducts merge Micturition is the process whereby the urinary bladder to form progressively larger ducts that eventually empties when it becomes filled. This process involves empty into the renal pelvis through the tips of the renal two main steps. First, the bladder fills progressively until papillae. In each kidney, there are about 250 of these the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level. This very large collecting ducts, each of which collects urine tension elicits the second step, which is a nervous reflex from about 4000 nephrons. called the micturition reflex that empties the bladder or, 324 Chapter 26 The Urinary System: Functional Anatomy and Urine Formation by the Kidneys Efferent Cortical arteriole nephron Afferent arteriole Juxtamedullary Interlobular nephron artery vein Arcuate artery Thick loop vein of Henle Interlobar Vasa artery recta vein Collecting duct Thin loop of Henle Duct of Bellini
