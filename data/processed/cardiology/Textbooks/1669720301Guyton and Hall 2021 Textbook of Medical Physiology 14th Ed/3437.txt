portions of their molecules are highly soluble When bile salts are of a high enough concentration in in fat. Therefore, the fat- soluble portions of these liver water, they have the propensity to form micelles, which secretions dissolve in the surface layer of the fat globules, are small spherical, cylindrical globules 3 to 6 nanometers with the polar portions projecting. The polar projections, in diameter composed of 20 to 40 molecules of bile salt. in turn, are soluble in the surrounding watery fluids, These micelles develop because each bile salt molecule which greatly decreases the interfacial tension of the fat is composed of a sterol nucleus that is highly fat- soluble and makes it soluble as well. and a polar group that is highly water- soluble. The sterol When the interfacial tension of a globule of non- nucleus encompasses the fat digestate, forming a small miscible fluid is low, this non- miscible fluid, upon agita- fat globule in the middle of a resulting micelle, with polar tion, can be broken up into many tiny particles far more groups of bile salts projecting outward to cover the sur- easily than it can when the interfacial tension is great. face of the
