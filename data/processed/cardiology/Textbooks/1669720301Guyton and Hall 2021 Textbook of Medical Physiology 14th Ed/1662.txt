When the concentrations of these two components that equation, which yields the following: are equal, the right- hand portion of Equation 8 becomes the log of 1, which is equal to 0. Therefore, when the two −logH+ =−log pK−log(0.03×Pco 2) components of the buffer system are equal, the pH of the HCO 3− solution is the same as the pK (6.1) of the bicarbonate (5) buffer system.
