Intercalated cells play the tubular fluid. a major role in acid–base regulation and constitute 30% to The principal cells are the primary sites of action of the 40% of the cells in the collecting tubules and collecting potassium- sparing diuretics, including spironolactone, ducts. There are two types of intercalated cells, type A and eplerenone, amiloride, and triamterene. Spironolactone type B (Figure 28-1 3). Type A intercalated cells secrete and eplerenone are mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hydrogen ions by a hydrogen-A TPase transporter and by that compete with aldosterone for receptor sites in the a hydrogen- potassium- ATPase transporter. Hydrogen is principal cells and therefore inhibit the stimulatory effects generated in this cell by the action of carbonic anhydrase of aldosterone on sodium reabsorption and potassium on water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which secretion.
