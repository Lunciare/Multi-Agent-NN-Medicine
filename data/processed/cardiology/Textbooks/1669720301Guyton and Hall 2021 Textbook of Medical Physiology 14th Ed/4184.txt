bone resorption with its receptor appear to be useful for treating bone loss in postmenopausal women and in some patients with bone cancer. Bone Deposition and Resorption Are Normally in Osteocytes Equilibrium. Except in growing bones, the rates of bone deposition and resorption are normally equal, so the total Figure 80- 6.

Osteoclasts usually ex- (PTH) binds to receptors on osteoblasts, causing them to form re- ist in small but concentrated masses, and once a mass of ceptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and to release macrophage-c olony stimulating factor (M-C SF).
