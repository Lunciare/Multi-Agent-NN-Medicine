3 reabsorbed, 4320 mEq of H+ must be secreted each day just to reabsorb the filtered HCO −. Then, an additional 3 80 mEq of H+ must be secreted to rid the body of the non- volatile acids produced each day for a total of 4400 mEq of H+ secreted into the tubular fluid each day. When there is a reduction in the extracellular fluid H+ concentration (alkalosis), the kidneys usually secrete less H+ (1 mEq/day) and fail to reabsorb all the filtered HCO 3−, thereby increas- Figure 31- 4.

Therefore, in alkalosis, the removal of HCO − raises the extracellular 3 fluid H+ concentration back toward normal.
