Head Anterior head cap Back- and- forth movement of the tail (flagellar move- Posterior head cap ment) provides motility for the sperm. This movement Neck results from a rhythmic longitudinal sliding motion between the anterior and posterior tubules that make up Body the axoneme. The energy for this process is supplied in the form of adenosine triphosphate, which is synthesized Mitochondria by the mitochondria in the body of the tail. Microtubules Normal sperm move in a fluid medium at a velocity of 1 to 4 mm/min, which allows them to move through the female genital tract in quest of the ovum. Tail (flagellum) Hormonal Factors That Stimulate Spermatogenesis The role of hormones in reproduction is discussed later in detail; for now, note that several hormones play essen- tial roles
