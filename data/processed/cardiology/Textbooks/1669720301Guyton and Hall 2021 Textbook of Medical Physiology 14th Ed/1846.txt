Actually, the cardiac output in ties of oxygen are actually delivered to the tissues. However, polycythemia is not far from normal because these two when a person with anemia begins to exercise, the heart is factors more or less neutralize each other. not capable of pumping much greater quantities of blood The arterial pressure is also normal in most people than it is already pumping. Consequently, during exercise, with polycythemia, although in about one-third of them, which greatly increases tissue demand for oxygen, extreme the arterial pressure is elevated. This means that the blood tissue hypoxia results and acute cardiac failure may ensue.
