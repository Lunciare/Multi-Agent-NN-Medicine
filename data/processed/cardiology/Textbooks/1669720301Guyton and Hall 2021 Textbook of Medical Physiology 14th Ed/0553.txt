vector A representing the instantaneous mean direc- tion of current flow in the ventricles. In this case, the direction of the vector is +55 degrees, and the voltage of the potential, represented by the length of vector A, 180° 0° is 2 millivolts. In the diagram below the heart, vector A A is shown again, and a line is drawn to represent the axis 120° 59° of lead I in the 0- degree direction. To determine how much of the voltage in vector A will be recorded in lead I, a line perpendicular to the axis of lead I is drawn from +90° the tip of vector A to the lead I axis, and a so- called pro- jected vector (B) is drawn along the lead I axis. The arrow of this projected vector points toward the positive end Figure 12-2 Vectors drawn to represent potentials for several dif- ferent hearts and the axis of the potential (expressed in degrees) for of the lead I axis, which means that the record momen- each heart. tarily being recorded in the ECG of lead I is positive. The instantaneous recorded voltage will be equal to the length of B divided by the
