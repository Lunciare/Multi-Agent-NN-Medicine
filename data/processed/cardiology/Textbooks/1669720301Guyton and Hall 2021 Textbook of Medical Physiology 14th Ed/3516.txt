phosphorylase and thereby cause rapid glycogenoly- 4H sis. The initial effect of each of these hormones is to promote 2 (1,3-Diphosphoglyceric acid) formation of cyclic AMP in the cells, which then initiates a cascade of chemical reactions that activates the phosphory- 2ADP +2ATP lase. This process is discussed in detail in Chapter 79. 2 (3-Phosphoglyceric acid) Epinephrine is released by the adrenal medullae when the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated. Therefore, 2 (2-Phosphoglyceric acid) one of the functions of the sympathetic nervous system is to increase the availability of glucose for rapid energy me- 2 (Phosphoenolpyruvic acid) tabolism. This function of epinephrine occurs markedly 2ADP 2ATP in liver cells and muscle, thereby contributing (along with other effects of sympathetic stimulation) to preparation of 2 (Pyruvic acid) the body for action, as discussed in Chapter 61.
