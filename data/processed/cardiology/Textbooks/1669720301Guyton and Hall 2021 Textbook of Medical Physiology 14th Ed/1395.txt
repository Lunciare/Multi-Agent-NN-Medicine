The energy for this active transport comes from capillaries because there is a net reabsorptive force that the hydrolysis of ATP by way of membrane- bound AT- moves the fluid and solutes from the interstitium into the Pase, which is also a component of the carrier mechanism blood. that binds and moves solutes across the cell membranes. ACTIVE TRANSPORT The primary active transporters in the kidneys that are known include Na+- K+ ATPase, hydrogen ATPase, Active transport can move a solute against an electro- hydrogen- potassium ATPase, and calcium ATPase. chemical gradient; this requires energy derived from A good example of a primary active transport system metabolism. Transport that is coupled directly to an is the reabsorption of sodium ions across the proximal energy source, such as the hydrolysis of adenosine tubular membrane, as shown in Figure 28- 2.
