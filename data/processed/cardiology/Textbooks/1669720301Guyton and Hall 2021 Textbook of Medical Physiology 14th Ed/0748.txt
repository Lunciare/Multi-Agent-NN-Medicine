Small membrane invaginations, called caveolae, are believed to play a role in transporting macromol- Present in the endothelial cells are many minute plas- ecules across the cell membrane. Caveolae contain caveolins, which malemmal vesicles, also called caveolae (small caves). are proteins that interact with cholesterol and polymerize to form These plasmalemmal vesicles form from oligomers of pro- the caveolae. teins called caveolins that are associated with molecules of cholesterol and sphingolipids.
