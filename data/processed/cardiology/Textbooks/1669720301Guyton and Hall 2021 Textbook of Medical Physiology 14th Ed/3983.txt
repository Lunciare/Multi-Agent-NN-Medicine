Indeed, when the anterior pituitary has been separated from persons moving to arctic regions have been known to the hypothalamus. Therefore, as shown in Figure 77-7 , develop basal metabolic rates that are 15% to 20% above it is probable that increased thyroid hormone inhibits normal. anterior pituitary secretion of TSH mainly by a direct 949 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction effect on the anterior pituitary gland. However, there the thyroid gland and especially decrease its blood supply, is also evidence for negative feedback effects of thyroid in contradistinction to the opposite effects caused by most hormone to inhibit thyrotropin releasing hormone by of the other antithyroid agents. For this reason, iodides are frequently administered to patients for 2 to 3 weeks before the hypothalamus.
