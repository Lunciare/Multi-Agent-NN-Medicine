This process causes the α subunit (to which the GTP is bound) to dissociate from the β and γ subunits of the G protein and to interact with membrane- bound target proteins (enzymes) that initiate intracellular signals. 921 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction When the receptor is activated, it undergoes a conforma- many physiological effects, but it is especially important tional change that causes the GDP-b ound trimeric G pro- in regulating appetite and energy balance, as discussed tein to associate with the cytoplasmic part of the receptor in Chapter 72.
