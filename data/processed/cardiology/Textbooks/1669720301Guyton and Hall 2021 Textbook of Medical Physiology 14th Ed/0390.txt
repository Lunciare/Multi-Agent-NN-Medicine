This type of smooth muscle is also The smooth muscle of each organ is distinctive from known as syncytial smooth muscle because of its syncyt- that of most other organs in several ways: (1) physical ial interconnections among fibers. It is also called visceral dimensions; (2) organization into bundles or sheets; (3) smooth muscle because it is found in the walls of most vis- response to different types of stimuli; (4) characteristics cera of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, bile of innervation; and (5) function.
