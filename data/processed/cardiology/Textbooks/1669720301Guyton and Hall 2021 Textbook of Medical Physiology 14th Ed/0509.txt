rather than the A- V ROLE OF THE PURKINJE SYSTEM IN node or the Purkinje fibers control the heart’s rhythmic- CAUSING SYNCHRONOUS CONTRACTION ity? The answer derives from the fact that the discharge OF THE VENTRICULAR MUSCLE rate of the sinus node is considerably faster than the natu- ral self-e xcitatory discharge rate of either the A- V node or The rapid conduction of the Purkinje system normally the Purkinje fibers. Each time the sinus node discharges, its permits the cardiac impulse to arrive at almost all por- impulse is conducted into both the A- V node and Purkinje tions of the ventricles within a narrow span of time, excit- fibers, also discharging their excitable membranes. How- ing the first ventricular muscle fiber only 0.03 to 0.06 ever, the sinus node discharges again before either the A- V second ahead of excitation of the last ventricular muscle node or Purkinje fibers can reach their own thresholds for fiber. This timing causes all portions of the ventricular self-e xcitation. Therefore, the new impulse from the sinus muscle in both ventricles to begin contracting at almost node discharges both the A- V node and Purkinje fibers the same time and then to
