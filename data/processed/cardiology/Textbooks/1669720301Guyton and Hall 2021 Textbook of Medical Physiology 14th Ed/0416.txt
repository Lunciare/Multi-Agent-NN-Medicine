slow wave rhythm of the membrane potential. of smooth muscle, as discussed in a subsequent section. A typical slow wave in a visceral smooth muscle of the gut The action potentials of visceral smooth muscle occur is shown in Figure 8-7B. The slow wave is not the action in one of two forms—(1) spike potentials or (2) action potential. That is, it is not a self-r egenerative process that potentials with plateaus. spreads progressively over the membranes of the muscle fibers. Instead, it is a local property of the smooth muscle Spike Potentials. Typical spike action potentials, such fibers that make up the muscle mass. as those seen in skeletal muscle, occur in most types of The cause of the slow wave rhythm is unknown. One unitary smooth muscle. The duration of this type of ac- suggestion is that the slow waves are caused by waxing tion potential is 10 to 50 milliseconds, as shown in Fig- and waning of the pumping of positive ions (presumably ure 8-7A. Such action potentials can be elicited in many sodium ions) outward through the muscle fiber mem- ways—for example, by electrical stimulation, by the ac- brane. That is, the membrane potential becomes more
