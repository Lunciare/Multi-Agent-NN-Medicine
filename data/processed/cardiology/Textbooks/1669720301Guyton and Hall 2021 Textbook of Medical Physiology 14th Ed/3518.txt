glucose were decomposed all at once tween the phosphoenolpyruvic acid and the pyruvic acid into water and carbon dioxide while forming only a single stages, the packets of energy released are greater than ATP molecule. Fortunately, cells of the body contain special 12,000 calories per mole, the amount required to form ATP, enzymes that cause the glucose molecule to split a little at a and the reactions are coupled in such a way that ATP is time in many successive steps, so that its energy is released formed. Thus, a total of 4 moles of ATP are formed for each in small packets to form one molecule of ATP at a time, mole of fructose- 1,6- diphosphate that is split into pyruvic thus forming a total of 38 moles of ATP for each mole of acid. glucose metabolized by the cells. Yet, 2 moles of ATP are required to phosphorylate the In the next sections we describe the basic principles of original glucose to form fructose- 1,6-d iphosphate before the processes by which the glucose molecule is progres- glycolysis can begin. Therefore, the net gain in ATP mol- sively dissected and its energy released to form ATP. ecules by the
