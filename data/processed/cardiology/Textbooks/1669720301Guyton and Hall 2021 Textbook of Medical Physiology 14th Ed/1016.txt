A, called the equi- 1/2 resistance librium point, giving a normal value for cardiac output of 1/3 resistance 5 L/min and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg. 10 Effect of Increased Blood Volume on Cardiac Output. A sudden increase in blood volume of about 20% increas- es the cardiac output to about 2.5 to 3 times normal. An 5 Psf = 10.5 analysis of this effect is shown in Figure 20- 15. Imme- Psf = 10 diately on infusing the large quantity of extra blood, the Psf = 2.3 increased filling of the system causes the Psf to increase Psf = 7 0 to 16 mm Hg, which shifts the venous return curve to –4 0 +4 +8 +12 the right. At the same time, the increased blood volume Right atrial pressure (mm Hg) distends the blood vessels, reducing their resistance and Figure 20- 14. Combinations of the major patterns of venous return thereby reducing the resistance to venous return, which curves showing the effects of simultaneous changes in the mean sys- rotates the curve upward. As a result of these two effects, temic filling pressure (Psf) and in resistance to venous return. (Modi- the venous return curve
