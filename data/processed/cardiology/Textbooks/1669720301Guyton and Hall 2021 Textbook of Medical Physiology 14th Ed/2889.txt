the direct pathways are concerned with regions of the cord gray matter. A few terminate on sen- discrete and detailed movements, especially of the distal sory relay neurons in the dorsal horn, and a very few ter- segments of the limbs, particularly the hands and fingers. minate directly on the anterior motor neurons that cause muscle contraction. Corticospinal (Pyramidal) Tract A few of the fibers do not cross to the opposite side The most important output pathway from the motor in the medulla but pass ipsilaterally down the cord in the cortex is the corticospinal tract, also called the pyrami- ventral corticospinal tracts. Many, if not most, of these dal tract, shown in Figure 56- 4. The corticospinal tract fibers eventually cross to the opposite side of the cord originates about 30% from the primary motor cortex, 30% either in the neck or in the upper thoracic region. These from the premotor and supplementary motor areas, and fibers may be concerned with control of bilateral postural 40% from the somatosensory areas posterior to the cen- movements by the supplementary motor cortex. tral sulcus. The most impressive fibers in the pyramidal tract are a After leaving the cortex, it passes through
