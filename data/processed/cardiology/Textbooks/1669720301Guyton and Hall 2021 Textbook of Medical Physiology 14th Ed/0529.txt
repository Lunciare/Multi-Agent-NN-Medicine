The 0.20- second inter- Heart Rate as Determined from the Electrocardio- vals are then broken into five smaller intervals by thin lines, gram. The rate of the heartbeat can be determined easily each of which represents 0.04 second. from an ECG because the heart rate is the reciprocal of the time interval between two successive heartbeats (the Normal Voltages in the Electrocardiogram. The re- R- R interval). If the interval between two beats as deter- corded voltages of the waves in the normal ECG depend mined from the time calibration lines is 1 second, the on the manner in which the electrodes are applied to the heart rate is 60 beats/min. The normal interval between surface of the body and how close the electrodes are to the two successive QRS complexes in an adult is about 0.83 heart. When one electrode is placed directly over the ven- second, which is a heart rate of 60/0.83 times/min, or 72 tricles, and a second electrode is placed elsewhere on the beats/min. body remote from the heart, the voltage of the QRS com- plex may be as high as 3 to 4 millivolts. Even this voltage is FLOW OF CURRENT AROUND THE small
