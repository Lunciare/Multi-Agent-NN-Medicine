The curve shown in Figure 41-14, the CO 2 dissociation two CO 2 dissociation curves: (1) when the Po 2 is 100 mm curve, depicts the dependence of total blood CO in all its Hg, which is the case in the blood capillaries of the lungs; 2 forms on Pco . Note that the normal blood Pco is within a and (2) when the Po is 40 mm Hg, which is the case in 2 2 2 narrow range of 40 mm Hg in arterial blood and 45 mm Hg the tissue capillaries. Point A shows that the normal Pco 2 in venous blood. Note also that the normal concentration of of 45 mm Hg in the tissues causes 52 volume percent of CO in the blood in all its different forms is about 50 volume CO to combine with the blood.
