The the odorant to a G- protein–coupled receptor causes the activation of adenylate cyclase, which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cy- portion of each olfactory cell that responds to the olfac- clic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP activates a gated tory chemical stimuli is the olfactory cilia.
