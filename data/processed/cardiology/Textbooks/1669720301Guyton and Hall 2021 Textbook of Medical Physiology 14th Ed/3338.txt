Peristalsis by Nervous and Hormonal Sig- dition, individual fibers from this muscle extend into the nals. Peristaltic activity of the small intestine increases intestinal villi and cause them to contract intermittently. The mucosal folds increase the surface area exposed to the markedly after a meal. This increased activity is caused chyme, thereby increasing absorption. Also, contractions partly by the beginning entry of chyme into the duode- of the villi—shortening, elongating, and shortening again— num, causing stretch of the duodenal wall. In addition, “milk” the villi so that lymph flows freely from the central peristaltic activity is increased by the gastroenteric reflex lacteals of the villi into the lymphatic system. These mu- that is initiated by distention of the stomach and con- cosal and villous contractions are initiated mainly by local ducted principally through the myenteric plexus from the nervous reflexes in the submucosal nerve plexus that occur stomach down along the wall of the small intestine. in response to chyme in the small intestine. In addition to the nervous signals that may affect small intestinal peristalsis, several hormonal factors also affect THE ILEOCECAL VALVE PREVENTS peristalsis. These factors include gastrin, CCK, insulin, BACKFLOW FROM THE COLON TO THE motilin, and
