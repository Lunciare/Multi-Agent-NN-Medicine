Ubiquitin is macromotor units, which can contain as many as five times a regulatory protein that basically labels which cells will the normal number of muscle fibers for each motoneuron be targeted for proteosomal degradation. coming from the spinal cord. The formation of large mo- tor units decreases the fineness of control one has over the Adjustment of Muscle Length. Another type of hyper- muscles but allows the muscles to regain varying degrees trophy occurs when muscles are stretched to greater than of strength. normal length. This stretching causes new sarcomeres to Rigor Mortis. Several hours after death, all the muscles be added at the ends of the muscle fibers, where they at- of the body go into a state of contracture called rigor mortis; tach to the tendons. In fact, new sarcomeres can be added that is, the muscles contract and become rigid, even with- out action potentials. This rigidity results from loss of all as rapidly as several per minute in newly developing mus- the ATP, which is required to cause separation of the cross- cle, illustrating the rapidity of this type of
