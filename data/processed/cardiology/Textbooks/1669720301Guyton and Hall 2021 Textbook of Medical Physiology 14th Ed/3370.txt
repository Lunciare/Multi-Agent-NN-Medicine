810 Chapter 65 Secretory Functions of the Alimentary Tract Esophageal Secretion Gastric pit Esophageal secretions are entirely mucous and mainly pro- Mucus layer vide lubrication for swallowing. The main body of the es- ophagus is lined with many simple mucous glands. At the gastric end and to a lesser extent in the initial portion of the esophagus, many compound mucous glands can also be found. The mucus secreted by the compound glands in the Surface upper esophagus prevents mucosal excoriation by newly epithelium entering food, whereas the compound glands located near the esophagogastric junction protect the esophageal wall from digestion by acidic gastric juices that often reflux from the stomach back into the lower esophagus. Despite Mucous neck cells this protection, a peptic ulcer at times can still occur at the gastric end of the esophagus. Oxyntic GASTRIC SECRETION (parietal) cells In addition to mucus- secreting cells that line the entire surface of the stomach, the stomach mucosa has two ECL cell important types of tubular glands—oxyntic glands (also called gastric glands) and pyloric glands. The oxyntic (acid- forming) glands secrete hydrochloric acid, pepsino- gen, intrinsic factor, and mucus. The pyloric glands secrete Peptic (chief) mainly mucus for protection of
