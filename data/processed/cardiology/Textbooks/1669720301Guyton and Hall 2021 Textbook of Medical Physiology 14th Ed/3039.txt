This effect, called motor aphasia, results from dam- age to Broca’s speech area, which lies in the prefrontal and premotor facial regions of the cerebral cortex—about 95% of the time in the left hemisphere, as shown in Figures 58- 5 and 58- 8. The skilled motor patterns for control of the lar- ynx, lips, mouth, respiratory system, and other accessory muscles of speech are all initiated from this area. Articulation.
