In this case, sodium entry into the cell is GLUT Glucose SGLT coupled with hydrogen extrusion from the cell by sodium- NNaa++ hydrogen counter- transport. This transport is mediated NNaa++ −70 mV by a specific protein (sodium- hydrogen exchanger) in the ATP NNaa++ brush border of the luminal membrane. As sodium is car- KK++ ried to the interior of the cell, hydrogen ions are forced Amino acids Amino acids outward in the opposite direction into the tubular lumen. The basic principles of primary and secondary active transport are discussed in Chapter 4. Pinocytosis Is an Active Transport Mechanism for Re- absorption of Proteins.
