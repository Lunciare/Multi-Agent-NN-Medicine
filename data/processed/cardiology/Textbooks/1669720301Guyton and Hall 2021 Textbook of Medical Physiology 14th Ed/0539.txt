part of the triangle represent the points at bipolar ECGs are being recorded. which the two arms connect electrically with the fluids around the heart, and the lower apex is the point at which Normal Electrocardiograms Recorded from the the left leg connects with the fluids. Three Standard Bipolar Limb Leads. Figure 11-7 shows recordings of the ECGs in leads I, II, and III. It is Einthoven’s Law. Einthoven’s law states that if the ECGs obvious that the ECGs in these three leads are similar are recorded simultaneously with the three limb leads, the to one another because they all record positive P waves sum of the potentials recorded in leads I and III will equal and positive T waves, and the major portion of the QRS the potential in lead II: complex is also positive in each ECG. On analysis of the Lead I potential+Lead III potential=Lead II potential three ECGs, it can be shown, with careful measurements and proper observance of polarities, that at any given In other words, if the electrical potentials of any two instant, the sum of the potentials in leads I and III equals of the three bipolar limb electrocardiographic leads are the potential
