resting conditions 2 Nevertheless, measurements of diffusion of other gases averages 21 ml/min per mm Hg. In functional terms, what have shown that the diffusing capacity varies directly with does this mean? The mean O pressure difference across 2 the diffusion coefficient of the particular gas. Because the the respiratory membrane during normal quiet breathing is diffusion coefficient of CO is slightly more than 20 times about 11 mm Hg. Multiplying this pressure by the diffusing 2 that of O , one would expect a diffusing capacity for CO capacity (11 × 21) gives a total of about 230 ml of oxygen 2 2 under resting conditions of about 400 to 450 ml/min per diffusing through the respiratory membrane each minute, mm Hg and during exercise of about 1200 to 1300 ml/ which is equal to the rate at which the resting body uses O . 2 min per mm Hg.
