Chemical (ligand) gating. Some protein channel gates are opened by the binding of a chemical sub- stance (a ligand) with the protein, which causes a conformational or chemical bonding change in the protein molecule that opens or closes the gate. One Outside of the most important instances of chemical gat- ing is the effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcho- line on the acetylcholine receptor which serves as a ligand- gated ion channel. Acetylcholine opens the Gate open
