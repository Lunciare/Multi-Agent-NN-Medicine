solid scarred masses. Mitral regurgitation A valve in which the leaflets adhere to one another so extensively that blood cannot flow through it normally D is said to be stenosed. Conversely, when the valve edges Aortic regurgitation are so destroyed by scar tissue that they cannot close as E the ventricles contract, regurgitation (backflow) of blood Mitral stenosis occurs when the valve should be closed. Stenosis usually does not occur without the coexistence of at least some F degree of regurgitation, and vice versa.
