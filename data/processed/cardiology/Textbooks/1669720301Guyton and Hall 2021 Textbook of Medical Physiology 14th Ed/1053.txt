Blood flow in the coronary ar- teries usually is regulated almost exactly in proportion to Cardiac the need of the cardiac musculature for oxygen. Normally, muscle about 70% of the oxygen in the coronary arterial blood is removed as the blood flows through the heart muscle. Subendocardial arterial plexus Because not much oxygen is
