the lung in which some or all of the alveoli are filled with fluid and blood cells, as shown in Figure 43- 5. A common type of pneumonia is bacterial pneu- monia, caused most frequently by pneumococci. This dis- ease begins with infection in the alveoli; the pulmonary membrane becomes inflamed and highly porous so that fluid and even red and white blood cells leak out of the blood into the alveoli. Thus, the infected alveoli become progressively filled with fluid and cells, and the infection spreads by extension of bacteria or virus from alveolus to alveolus. Eventually, large areas of the lungs, sometimes whole lobes or even a whole lung, become “consolidated,” which means that they are filled with fluid and cellular debris. In persons with pneumonia, the gas exchange func- tions of the lungs decline in different stages of the dis- ease. In early stages, the pneumonia process might well be localized to only one lung, with alveolar ventilation Figure 43- 4.

This condition causes two major pulmonary physema. (Courtesy
