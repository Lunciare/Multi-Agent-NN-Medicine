imme- diately to the opposite side of the brain stem and continue upward through the medial lemnisci to the thalamus. In this pathway through the brain stem, each medial lemnis- cus is joined by additional fibers from the sensory nuclei of Figure 48- 3. Dorsal column–medial lemniscal pathway for transmit- the trigeminal nerve; these fibers subserve the same sensory ting critical types of tactile signals. functions for the head that the dorsal column fibers sub- serve for the body. In the thalamus, the medial lemniscal fibers terminate Spatial Orientation of the Nerve Fibers in the thalamic sensory relay area, called the ventrobasal in the Dorsal Column–Medial Lemniscal complex. From the ventrobasal complex, third- order nerve System fibers project, as shown in Figure 48- 4, mainly to the post- central gyrus of the cerebral cortex, called somatic sensory One of the distinguishing features of the dorsal column– area I (as shown in Figure 48- 6, these fibers also project to medial lemniscal system is a distinct spatial orientation a smaller area in the lateral parietal cortex called somatic of nerve fibers from the individual parts of the body that sensory area II). is maintained throughout.
