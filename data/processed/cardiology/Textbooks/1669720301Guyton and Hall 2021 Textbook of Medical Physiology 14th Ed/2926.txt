Fortunately, each time the head is suddenly ro- tated, signals from the semicircular ducts cause the eyes to when attempting to perform rapid, intricate changing rotate in a direction equal and opposite to the rotation of body movements. the head. This movement results from reflexes transmitted through the vestibular nuclei and the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the oculomotor nuclei.
