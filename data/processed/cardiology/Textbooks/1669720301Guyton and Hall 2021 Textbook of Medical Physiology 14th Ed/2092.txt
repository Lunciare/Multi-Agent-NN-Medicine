Abnormal Zones 1, 2, and 3 of Pulmonary Blood Conditions. Zone 1 blood flow, which means no blood Flow flow at any time during the cardiac cycle, occurs when the pulmonary systolic arterial pressure is too low or The capillaries in the alveolar walls are distended by the alveolar pressure is too high to allow flow. For ex- the blood pressure inside them but simultaneously are ample, if an upright person is breathing against a posi- compressed by the alveolar air pressure on their out- tive air pressure so that the intra- alveolar air pressure sides. Therefore, whenever the lung alveolar air pressure is at least 10 mm Hg greater than normal but the pul- becomes greater than the capillary blood pressure, the monary systolic blood pressure is normal, one would capillaries close, and there is no blood flow. Under dif- expect zone 1 blood flow—no blood flow—in the lung ferent normal and pathological lung conditions, one may apices. Another case in which zone 1 blood flow oc- find any one of three possible zones (patterns) of pulmo- curs is in an upright person whose pulmonary systolic nary blood flow, as follows: arterial pressure is exceedingly low, as might occur
