VOLTAGES OF THE QRS COMPLEX comes electronegative, whereas the left ventricle remains electropositive during most of the depolarization process, INCREASED VOLTAGE IN THE STANDARD and a strong vector projects from the right ventricle toward BIPOLAR LIMB LEADS the left ventricle. In other words, intense left axis deviation of about −50 degrees occurs because the positive end of Normally, the voltages in the three standard bipolar the vector points toward the left ventricle. This situation limb leads, as measured from the peak of the R wave is demonstrated in Figure 12-14, which shows typical left to the bottom of the S wave, vary between 0.5 and 2.0 axis deviation resulting from left bundle branch block. millivolts, with lead III usually recording the lowest 150 Chapter 12 Electrocardiographic Interpretation of Cardiac Muscle and Coronary Blood Flow Abnormalities III I – I– +I II I II III + III Figure 12-15 Right axis deviation caused by right bundle branch block.
