of reverse T (RT ) are formed by coupling of 3 3 diiodotyrosine with monoiodotyrosine, but RT 3 does not 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine (T 3) appear to be of functional significance in humans. Monoiodotyrosine + Diiodotyrosine Storage of Thyroglobulin. The thyroid gland is unusual HO O CH CHNH COOH among the endocrine glands in its ability to store large 2 2 amounts of hormone. After synthesis of the thyroid hor- mones has run its course, each thyroglobulin molecule 3,3',5'-Triiodothyronine (RT ) 3 contains up to 30 thyroxine molecules and a few triiodo- Diiodotyrosine + Diiodotyrosine thyronine molecules. In this form, the thyroid hormones are stored in the follicles in an amount sufficient to supply HO O CH CHNH COOH the body with its normal requirements of thyroid hor- 2 2 mones for 2 to 3 months. Therefore, when synthesis of Thyroxine (T ) thyroid hormone ceases, the physiological effects of defi- 4 ciency are not observed for several months.
