by Valvular Lesions and of very low frequency, so most of the sound spectrum is below the low-f requency end of human hearing. As shown by the phonocardiograms in Figure 23- 3, many During the early part of diastole, a left ventricle with a abnormal heart sounds, known as heart murmurs, occur stenotic mitral valve has so little blood in it, and its walls when abnormalities of the valves are present, as discussed are so flabby, that blood does not reverberate back and here. forth between the walls of the ventricle. For this reason, even in persons with severe mitral stenosis, no murmur Systolic Murmur of Aortic Stenosis. In persons with may be heard during the first third of diastole. Then, after aortic stenosis, blood is ejected from the left ventricle partial filling, the ventricle has stretched enough for blood through only a small fibrous opening of the aortic valve. to reverberate, and a low rumbling murmur begins. Because of the resistance to ejection, the blood pressure in the left ventricle sometimes rises as high as 300 mm Hg; Phonocardiograms of Valvular Murmurs. Phonocar- the pressure in the aorta is still normal. Thus, a nozzle ef- diograms B, C, D,
