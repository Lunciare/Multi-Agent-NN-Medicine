When a visual scene is mov- ing continually before the eyes, such as when a person is riding in a car, the eyes fix on one highlight after another in the visual field, jumping from one to the next at a rate of two to three jumps per second. The jumps are called sac- cades, and the movements are called opticokinetic move- ments. The saccades occur so rapidly that no more than 10% of the total time is spent moving the eyes, with 90%
