is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner. The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cell Axon then rotates around the axon many times, laying down mul- tiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid Myelin substance sphingomyelin.
