NE ability of the fiber membrane to calcium ions, allowing these ions to diffuse into the nerve terminals or nerve var- icosities. The calcium ions in turn cause the terminals or Norepinephrine released into varicosities to empty their contents to the exterior.

Acetylcholine is Postganglionic synthesized in the terminal endings and varicosities of the axon cholinergic nerve fibers, where it is stored in vesicles in highly concentrated form until it is released.
