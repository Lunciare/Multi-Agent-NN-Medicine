exist for determining the axis of the much as the light rays in vertical plane BD. Therefore, light abnormal cylindrical component of the lens system of an rays passing through an astigmatic lens do not all come to a eye. One of these methods is based on the use of paral- common focal point because the light rays passing through lel black bars of the type shown in Figure 50- 15. Some of one plane focus far in front of those passing through the these parallel bars are vertical, some are horizontal, and other plane. some are at various angles to the vertical and horizontal The accommodative power of the eye can never com- axes. After placing various spherical lenses in front of the pensate for astigmatism because, during accommodation, astigmatic eye, a strength of lens that causes sharp focus of the curvature of the eye lens changes approximately equally one set of parallel bars but does not correct the fuzziness in both planes; therefore, in astigmatism, each of the two of the set of bars at right angles to the sharp bars is usually planes requires a different degree of accommodation. Thus, found. It can be shown from the
