In this to decrease the volume of these vessels. This decrease in chapter, we consider additional specific anatomical and volume can push blood into the heart and thereby plays a functional characteristics. major role in regulation of heart pumping, as we explain later in this and subsequent chapters.

Sympathetic fibers also go directly to the tem for regulating the circulation is the sympathetic heart, as shown in Figure 18- 1. As discussed in Chapter nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system, 9, sympathetic stimulation markedly increases the activity however, contributes importantly to regulation of heart of the heart, both increasing the heart rate and enhancing function, as described later in the chapter. its strength and volume of pumping.
