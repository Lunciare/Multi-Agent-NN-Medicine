Conversely, stimulation of the gamma- s fibers, transmit delayed signals to the anterior motor neurons or which excite the nuclear chain fibers, enhances the static serve other functions. 688 Chapter 55 Spinal Cord Motor Functions; the Cord Reflexes Dynamic Stretch Reflex and Static Stretch Reflexes. Stimulus (8 per second) The stretch reflex can be divided into two components: the dynamic stretch reflex and the static stretch reflex. The dynamic stretch reflex is elicited by potent dynamic signals transmitted from the primary sensory endings of the muscle spindles, caused by rapid stretch or un- stretch. That is, when a muscle is suddenly stretched or unstretched, a strong signal is transmitted to the spinal cord, which causes an instantaneous strong reflex con- A B traction (or decrease in contraction) of the same muscle from which the signal originated.
