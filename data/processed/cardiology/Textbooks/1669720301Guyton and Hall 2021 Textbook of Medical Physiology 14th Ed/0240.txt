because excess negatively charged chloride ions diffuse that develops depends on three factors: (1) the polarity to the inside while leaving the nondiffusible positive ions of the electrical charge of each ion; (2) the permeability on the outside. of the membrane (P) to each ion; and (3) the concentra- Fourth, as explained later, the permeability of the tion (C) of the respective ions on the inside (i) and out- sodium and potassium channels undergoes rapid side (o) of the membrane. Thus, the following formula, changes during transmission of a nerve impulse, called the Goldman equation or the Goldman-H odgkin- whereas the permeability of the chloride channels does Katz equation, gives the calculated membrane potential not change greatly during this process. Therefore, rapid on the inside of the membrane when two univalent pos- changes in sodium and potassium permeability are pri- itive ions, sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), and one marily responsible for signal transmission in neurons, univalent negative ion, chloride (Cl−), are involved: which is the subject of most of the remainder of this C P +C P +C P chapter.
