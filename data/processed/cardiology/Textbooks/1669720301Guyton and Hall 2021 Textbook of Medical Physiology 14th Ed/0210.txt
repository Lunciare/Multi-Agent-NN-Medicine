(98.6°F), a concentration Semipermeable of 1 osmole per liter will cause 19,300 mm Hg osmotic membrane pressure in the solution. Likewise, 1 milliosmole per lit- er concentration is equivalent to 19.3 mm Hg osmotic pressure. Multiplying this value by the 300- milliosmolar concentration of the body fluids gives a total calculated osmotic pressure of the body fluids of 5790 mm Hg. The measured value for this, however, averages only about 5500 mm Hg. The reason for this difference is that many ions in the body fluids, such as sodium and chloride ions, Figure 4-11.

The osmotic pressure exerted by particles in a solution, whether they are molecules or ions, is determined by the The Term Osmolarity. Osmolarity is the osmolar con- number of particles per unit volume of fluid, not by the centration expressed as osmoles
