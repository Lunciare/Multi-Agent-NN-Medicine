enterochromaffin- like (ECL) cells that secrete histamine. Oxyntic Secretion of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells (parietal) Secretion cell involves special mechanisms, as follows. Basic Mechanism of Hydrochloric Acid Secretion. Canaliculi When stimulated, the parietal cells secrete an acid so- lution that contains about 160 mmol/L of hydrochloric acid, which is nearly isotonic with the body fluids. The pH of this acid is about 0.8, demonstrating its extreme acid- ity. At this pH, the H+ concentration is about 3 million times that of the arterial blood. To concentrate the H+ this tremendous amount requires more than 1500 calories of Figure 65- 5. Schematic anatomy of the canaliculi in a parietal (ox- energy/L of gastric juice.

The hydrochloric acid is formed at the villus- Figure 65- 5 shows schematically the functional struc- like projections inside these canaliculi and is then con- ture of a parietal cell (also called an oxyntic cell), dem- ducted through the canaliculi to the secretory end of the onstrating
