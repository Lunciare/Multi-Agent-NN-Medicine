About 65% of most filtered electrolytes is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. However, the proxi- Figure 29-7. Countercurrent exchange in the vasa recta. Plasma mal tubular membranes are highly permeable to water flowing down the descending limb of the vasa recta becomes more so, whenever solutes are reabsorbed, water also diffuses hyperosmotic because of diffusion of water out of the blood and diffusion of solutes from the renal interstitial fluid into the blood. In through the tubular membrane by osmosis. Water diffu- the ascending limb of the vasa recta, solutes diffuse back into the sion across the proximal tubular epithelium is aided by interstitial fluid, and water diffuses back into the vasa recta.

Therefore, the amounts of solutes would be lost from the renal medulla without osmolarity of the fluid remains about the same as the glo- the U shape of the vasa recta capillaries. (Numerical
