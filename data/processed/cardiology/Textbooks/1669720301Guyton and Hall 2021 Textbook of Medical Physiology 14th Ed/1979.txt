(Modi- nearby platelets to activate them as well; the stickiness fied from Seegers WH: Hemostatic Agents. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1948.) of these additional activated platelets causes them to adhere to the original activated platelets. Therefore, at the site of a puncture in a blood vessel BLOOD COAGULATION IN THE RUPTURED wall, the damaged vascular wall activates successively VESSEL increasing numbers of platelets that attract more and more additional platelets, thus forming a platelet plug. The third mechanism for hemostasis is formation of the This plug is loose at first but is usually successful in block- blood clot. The clot begins to develop in 15 to 20 seconds ing blood loss if the vascular opening is small. Then, dur- if the trauma to the vascular wall is severe and in 1 to 2 ing the subsequent process of blood coagulation, fibrin minutes if the trauma is minor. Activator substances from threads form. These threads attach tightly to the platelets, the traumatized vascular wall, from platelets, and from
