To treat the condition, rhythmical electrical single electric shock is programmed (or synchronized) to impulses from an implanted electronic cardiac pacemaker fire only during the QRS complex when the ventricles are have been used successfully to keep patients alive for refractory to stimulation. A normal rhythm often follows months to years. if the heart is capable of generating a normal rhythm. This procedure is called synchronized cardioversion instead of defibrillation in the setting of ventricular fibrillation.
