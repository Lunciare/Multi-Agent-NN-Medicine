through the artery. Using device- specific algorithms, the cuff pressure oscillations are automatically converted into digital systolic and dias- tolic pressures signals, as well as heart rate, and displayed. Oscillometric arterial pressure monitors require less skill than the auscultatory technique and can be used by the patient at home, avoiding the so-c alled white-c oat effect that raises blood pressure in some patients when a health care professional is present. These devices, however, must be calibrated for accuracy and can yield unreliable mea- surements in patients when the cuff size is inappropriate or in some abnormal circulatory conditions, such as severe arteriosclerosis, which increases stiffness of the artery wall. Normal Arterial Pressures as Measured by the Auscultatory and Oscillatory Methods. Figure 15-8 Figure 15-7.

The progressive increase in pressure with age results from the effects of aging on the diastolic pressure determined by direct intra- arterial the blood pressure control mechanisms. We shall see in catheter. As the cuff pressure falls a few mm Hg further, Chapter 19 that the kidneys are primarily responsible for the artery
