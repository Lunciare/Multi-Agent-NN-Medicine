pump, 0.1 and calcium serves along with (or instead of) sodium in Na+ some cells to cause most of the action potential. Like the 0.01 sodium pump, the calcium pump transports calcium ions 0.005 from the interior to the exterior of the cell membrane (or 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Milliseconds into the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell), creating a cal- cium ion gradient of about 10,000- fold. This process leaves Figure 5- 10 Changes in sodium and potassium conductance dur- an internal cell concentration of calcium ions of about 10−7 ing the course of the action potential. Sodium conductance increases molar, in contrast to an external concentration of about several thousand–fold during the early stages of the action potential, whereas potassium conductance increases only about 30- fold during 10−3 molar. the latter stages of the action potential and for a short period thereaf- In addition, there are voltage- gated calcium channels. ter.
