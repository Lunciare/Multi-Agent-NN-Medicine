Because intense colon sults from the slow but persistent haustral contractions, 804 Chapter 64 Propulsion and Mixing of Food in the Alimentary Tract requiring as many as 8 to 15 hours to move the chyme From conscious Descending from the ileocecal valve through the colon, while the cortex colon chyme becomes fecal in quality—a semisolid instead of a Afferent semifluid slush. nerve fibers From the cecum to the sigmoid, mass movements can, for many minutes at a time, take over the propulsive role. Parasympathetic These movements usually occur only one to three times nerve fibers (pelvic nerves) each day, in many people especially for about 15 minutes during the first hour after eating breakfast. A mass movement is a modified type of peristalsis characterized by the following sequence of events. First, a Sigmoid constrictive ring occurs in response to a distended or irri- colon tated point in the colon, usually in the transverse colon. Then, rapidly, the 20 or more centimeters of colon distal Skeletal Rectum motor nerve to the constrictive ring lose their haustrations
