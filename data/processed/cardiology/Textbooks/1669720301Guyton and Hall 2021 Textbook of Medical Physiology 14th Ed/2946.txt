cerebellum from the body zones of the cerebellum on the same side as its origin. The periphery through the spinal dorsal columns to the dorsal ventral tract enters the cerebellum through the superior column nuclei of the medulla and are then relayed to the cerebellar peduncle, but it terminates in both sides of the cerebellum. Likewise, signals are transmitted up the spinal cerebellum. cord through the spinoreticular pathway to the reticular The signals transmitted in the dorsal spinocerebel- formation of the brain stem and also through the spino- lar tracts come mainly from the muscle spindles and to olivary pathway to the inferior olivary nucleus. Signals a lesser extent from other somatic receptors throughout are then relayed from both of these areas to the cerebel- the body, such as Golgi tendon organs, large tactile re- lum. Thus, the cerebellum continually collects information ceptors of the skin, and joint receptors. All these signals about the movements and positions of all parts of the body apprise the cerebellum of the momentary status of (1) even though it is operating at a subconscious level. muscle contraction, (2) degree of tension on the muscle 713 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C.
