cleaved from the thyroglobulin molecule, and then these gen peroxide, which provide a potent system capable of free hormones are released. This process occurs as fol- oxidizing iodides. The peroxidase is either located in the lows: The apical surface of thyroid cells sends out pseu- apical membrane of the cell or attached to it, thus pro- dopod extensions that close around small portions of the viding the oxidized iodine at exactly the point in the cell colloid to form pinocytic vesicles that enter the apex of the where the thyroglobulin molecule issues forth from the thyroid cell. Then lysosomes in the cell cytoplasm imme- Golgi apparatus and through the cell membrane into the diately fuse with these vesicles to form digestive vesicles stored thyroid gland colloid. When the peroxidase system containing digestive enzymes from the lysosomes mixed is blocked or when it is hereditarily absent from the cells, with the colloid. Multiple proteases among the enzymes the rate of formation of thyroid hormones falls to zero. digest the thyroglobulin molecules and release thyrox- ine and triiodothyronine in free form, which then diffuse Iodination of Tyrosine and Thyroid Hormone Forma- through the base of the thyroid cell into the surrounding tion—“Organification”
