fiber pathway tells the cerebellum which areas (mainly in the vermis). Afferent Pathways From the Periphery. The cer- motor signals have arrived at the anterior horns; this feedback is called the efference copy of the anterior horn ebellum also receives important sensory signals directly motor drive. from the peripheral parts of the body, mainly through four The spinocerebellar pathways can transmit impulses at tracts on each side, two of which are located dorsally in the velocities up to 120 m/sec, which is the most rapid con- cord and two ventrally. The two most important of these duction in any pathway in the central nervous system. This tracts are shown in Figure 57-5 , the dorsal spinocerebel- speed is important for instantaneous apprisal of the cer- lar tract and the ventral spinocerebellar tract. The dorsal ebellum of changes in peripheral muscle actions. tract enters the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar In addition to signals from the spinocerebellar tracts, peduncle and terminates in the vermis and intermediate signals are transmitted into the cerebellum from the body zones of the cerebellum on the same side as its origin. The periphery through the spinal dorsal columns to the dorsal ventral tract enters the cerebellum
