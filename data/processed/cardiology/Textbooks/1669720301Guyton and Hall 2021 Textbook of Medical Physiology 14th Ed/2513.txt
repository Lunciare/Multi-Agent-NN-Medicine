Vibratory signals are rapidly re- petitive and can be detected as vibration up to 700 cycles/ sec. The higher frequency vibratory signals originate from the Pacinian corpuscles in the skin and deeper tissues, but lower frequency signals (< ≈200 cycles/sec) can also originate from Meissner’s corpuscles. These signals are transmitted only in the dorsal column pathway. For this reason, application of vibration (e.g., from a “tuning fork”) to different peripheral parts of the body is an important tool used by neurologists for testing functional integrity of the dorsal columns. Cortex Interpretation of Sensory Stimulus Intensity The ultimate goal of most sensory stimulation is to apprise the mind of the state of the body and its surroundings. Therefore, it is important that we discuss briefly some of the principles related to transmission of sensory stimulus Two adjacent points intensity to the higher levels of the nervous system. strongly stimulated How is it possible for the sensory system to transmit Figure 48- 10.
