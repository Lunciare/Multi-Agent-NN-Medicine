The filtration coefficient can also be expressed for sepa- rate parts of the body in terms of the rate of filtration per STARLING EQUILIBRIUM FOR CAPILLARY minute per mm Hg per 100 grams of tissue. On this basis, EXCHANGE the capillary filtration coefficient of the average tissue is about 0.01 ml/min per mm Hg per 100 g of tissue. How- Ernest Starling pointed out more than a century ago that ever, because of extreme differences in permeabilities and under normal conditions, a state of near- equilibrium surface areas of the capillary systems in different tissues, exists in most capillaries. That is, the amount of fluid this coefficient varies more than 100-f old among the dif- filtering outward from the arterial ends of capillaries ferent tissues.
