Fluid Exchange, Interstitial Fluid, and Lymph Flow Arterial end Blood capillary Venous end stituents in the plasma and interstitial fluids that do not readily pass through the capillary membrane. Lipid- Soluble Substances Diffuse Directly Through the Cell Membranes of the Capillary Endothelium. If a substance is lipid- soluble, it can diffuse directly through the cell membranes of the capillary without having to go through the pores. Such substances include oxygen and carbon dioxide. Because these substances can permeate all areas of the capillary membrane, their rates of trans- port through the capillary membrane are many times faster than the rates for lipid-i nsoluble substances, such as sodium ions and glucose, which can go only through Lymphatic capillary the pores. Water- Soluble, Non–Lipid- Soluble Substances Diffuse Through Intercellular Pores in the Capillary Membrane. Figure 16- 3. Diffusion of fluid molecules and dissolved substances Many substances needed by the tissues are soluble in wa- between the capillary and interstitial fluid spaces. ter but cannot pass through the lipid membranes of the endothelial cells; these include water molecules, sodium normal—the intermittent periods of capillary blood flow ions, chloride ions, and glucose.
