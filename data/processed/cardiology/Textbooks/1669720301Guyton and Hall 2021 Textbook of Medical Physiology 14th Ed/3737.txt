Finally, high fever often develops before death. cells of the gastric glands and is essential for absorption of vitamin B by the ileal mucosa. This topic is discussed in Vitamin D 12 Chapters 33 and 67. Vitamin D (calciferol) increases calcium absorption from the Folic Acid (Pteroylglutamic Acid, Vitamin B ) gastrointestinal tract and helps control calcium deposition 9 in the bone. The mechanism by which vitamin D increases Several pteroylglutamic acids exhibit the “folic acid effect.” calcium absorption is mainly to promote active transport Folic acid functions as a carrier of hydroxymethyl and for- of calcium through the epithelium of the ileum. In particu- myl groups. Perhaps its most important use in the body is lar, it increases the formation of a calcium-b inding protein in the synthesis of purines and thymine, which are required in the intestinal epithelial cells that aids in calcium absorp- for DNA formation. Therefore, folic acid, like vitamin B , 12 tion.
