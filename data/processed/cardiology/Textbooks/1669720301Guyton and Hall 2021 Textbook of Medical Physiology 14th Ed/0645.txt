fibrillation. Likewise, fibrillation often occurs in the atria without ventricular fibrillation (shown on the right in Figure 13-20). The mechanism of atrial fibrillation is identical to that of ventricular fibrillation, except that the process occurs only in the atrial muscle mass instead of the ventricu- lar mass. A frequent cause of atrial fibrillation is atrial Figure 13-18.
