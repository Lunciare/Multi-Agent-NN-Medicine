The cilium moves forward with a sudden, kidneys, for example, primary cilia are found in most epi- rapid whiplike stroke 10 to 20 times per second, bending thelial cells of the tubules, projecting into the tubule lu- sharply where it projects from the surface of the cell.

The rapid, over the tubular epithelial cells, the primary cilia bend and forward- thrusting, whiplike movement pushes the fluid cause flow- induced changes in intracellular calcium sign- lying adjacent to the cell in the direction that the cilium aling.
