Thus, each a steady rate through a long smooth blood vessel, it flows layer toward the center flows progressively more rapidly in streamlines, with each layer of blood remaining the than the outer layers. same distance from the vessel wall. Also, the centralmost portion of the blood stays in the center of the vessel.
