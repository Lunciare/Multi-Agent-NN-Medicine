Lead I is depolarization of the ventricular septum and of parts of recorded from two electrodes placed respectively on the the apical endocardial walls of the two ventricles. At the two arms. Because the electrodes lie exactly in the hori- instant of heart excitation, electrical current flows between zontal direction, with the positive electrode to the left, the the depolarized areas inside the heart and the nondepolar- axis of lead I is 0 degrees. ized areas on the outside of the heart, as indicated by the In recording lead II, electrodes are placed on the right long elliptical arrows. Some current also flows inside the arm and left leg. The right arm connects to the torso in heart chambers directly from the depolarized areas toward the upper right- hand corner, and the left leg connects in the still polarized areas. Overall, considerably more current the lower left- hand corner. Therefore, the direction of this flows downward from the base
