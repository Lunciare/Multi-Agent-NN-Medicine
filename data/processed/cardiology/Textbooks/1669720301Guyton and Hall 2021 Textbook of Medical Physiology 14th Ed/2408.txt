the neuron is the −65 causing almost no resistance to conduction of electric mV in the neuron. That is, this negative voltage repels the current from one part of the somal interior to another negatively charged chloride ions, forcing them outward part. Therefore, any change in potential in any part of the through channels until the concentration is much less intrasomal fluid causes an almost exactly equal change in inside the membrane than outside. potential at all other points inside the soma, as long as the Let us recall from Chapters 4 and 5 that an electrical neuron is not transmitting an action potential. This prin- potential across the cell membrane can oppose move- ciple is important because it plays a major role in “summa- ment of ions through a membrane if the potential is of tion” of signals entering the neuron from multiple sources, proper polarity and magnitude. A potential that exactly as we shall see in subsequent sections of this chapter. opposes movement of an ion is called the Nernst potential for that ion, represented by the following equation: Effect of Synaptic Excitation on the Postsynaptic Membrane—Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential.
