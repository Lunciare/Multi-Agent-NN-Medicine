jaws by adulthood and later. Enamel Dentin Pulp. The pulp cavity of each tooth is filled with pulp, Oral epithelium which is composed of connective tissue with an abundant supply of nerve fibers, blood vessels, and lymphatics. The cells lining the surface of the pulp cavity are the odonto- blasts, which, during the formative years of the tooth, lay down the dentin but at the same time encroach more and more on the pulp cavity, making it smaller. In later life, the dentin stops growing and the pulp cavity remains essen- tially constant in size. However, the odontoblasts are still viable and send projections into small dentinal tubules B C that penetrate all the way through the dentin; they are Alveolar bone of importance for exchange of calcium, phosphate, and other minerals with the dentin.

The first teeth are called Development of the Permanent Teeth. During embry- deciduous teeth, or milk teeth, and they number 20 in hu- onic life, a tooth- forming organ also develops in the deep- mans. They erupt between
