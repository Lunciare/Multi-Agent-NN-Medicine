Rarely, “breaks” occur in the placental membrane, Second, the hemoglobin concentration of fetal blood is which allows fetal blood cells to pass into the mother or, about 50% greater than that of the mother, which is an even less commonly, the mother’s cells to pass into the even more important factor in enhancing the amount of fetus.
