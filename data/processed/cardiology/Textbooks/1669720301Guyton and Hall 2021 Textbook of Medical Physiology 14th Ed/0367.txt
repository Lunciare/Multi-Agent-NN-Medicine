Patch clamp studies have shown that one of these chan- Acetylcholine Opens Ion Channels on Postsynaptic nels, when opened by acetylcholine, can transmit 15,000 Membranes. Figure 7-2 also shows many small acetyl- to 30,000 sodium ions in 1 millisecond. Conversely, nega- choline receptors and voltage- gated sodium channels in tive ions, such as chloride ions, do not pass through the muscle fiber membrane. The acetylcholine- gated ion because of strong negative charges in the mouth of the channels are located almost entirely near the mouths of channel that repel these negative ions. 94 Chapter 7 Excitation of Skeletal Muscle: Neuromuscular Transmission and Excitation-Contraction Coupling Ach binding Ach binding +60 site site +40 – – – – +20 – – 0 –20 Threshold –40 –60 –80 A B C –100 0 15 30 45 60 75 Milliseconds Figure 7-4.
