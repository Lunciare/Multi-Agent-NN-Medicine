Slightly less than caused by damage to the linings of the bronchi and al- one-half of this nitrogen is dissolved in the water of the veoli begin to develop. The reason for this effect in the body, and a little more than one-half is dissolved in the fat lungs but not in other tissues is that the air spaces of the of the body, because nitrogen is five times as soluble in fat lungs are directly exposed to the high O pressure, but O as in water. 2 2 is delivered to the other body tissues at almost normal Po After the diver has become saturated with nitrogen, 2 because of the hemoglobin- O buffer system. the sea level volume of nitrogen dissolved in the body at 2 different depths is as follows: CARBON DIOXIDE TOXICITY AT GREAT DEPTHS IN THE SEA Feet Liters 0 1 If the diving gear is properly designed and functions 33 2 properly, the diver has no problem due to toxicity 100 4 because depth alone does not increase the
