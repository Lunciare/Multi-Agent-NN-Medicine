1% of the potassium in the 25% to 30% of the filtered potassium is reabsorbed in the glomerular filtrate (to <10 mEq/day). With potassium loop of Henle, especially in the thick ascending part, where intakes below this level, severe hypokalemia can develop. potassium is actively co- transported along with sodium Thus, most of the daily regulation of potassium excre- and chloride. In the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, a tion occurs in the late distal and cortical collecting relatively constant fraction of the filtered potassium load tubules, where potassium can be reabsorbed or secreted, is reabsorbed. Changes in potassium reabsorption in these depending on the needs of the body. In the next section, segments can influence potassium excretion, but most of the we consider the basic mechanisms of potassium secretion daily variation of potassium excretion is not due to changes and the factors that regulate this process. in reabsorption in the proximal tubule or loop of Henle.
