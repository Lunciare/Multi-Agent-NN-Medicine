secretion back toward the desired operating level. Conversely, too little testosterone allows the hypothalamus to secrete large amounts of GnRH, LH FSH with a corresponding increase in anterior pituitary LH and FSH secretion and consequent increase in testicular testosterone secretion. Testis Regulation of Spermatogenesis by Follicle- Stimulating Hormone and Leydig cell Sertoli Testosterone cell Testosterone Inhibin FSH binds with specific FSH receptors attached to the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules, which causes the Sertoli cells to grow and secrete various spermato- genic substances. Simultaneously, testosterone (and dihydrotestosterone) diffusing into the seminiferous Androgenic effects Spermatogenesis tubules from the Leydig cells in the interstitial spaces also has a strong tropic effect on spermatogenesis. Thus, Figure 81- 10 Feedback regulation of the hypothalamic- pituitary- both FSH and testosterone are necessary to initiate testicular axis in males. Stimulatory effects are shown by plus signs, spermatogenesis. and negative feedback inhibitory effects are shown by minus signs.

When the seminiferous tu- bules fail to produce sperm, secretion of FSH by the ante- rior pituitary gland increases markedly. Conversely,
