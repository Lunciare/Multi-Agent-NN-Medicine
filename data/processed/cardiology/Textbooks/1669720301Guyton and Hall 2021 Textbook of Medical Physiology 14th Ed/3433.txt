DIGESTION OF FATS Both trypsin and chymotrypsin split proteins into small polypeptides; carboxypolypeptidase then cleaves Fats of the Diet. By far the most abundant fats of the individual amino acids from the carboxyl ends of the diet are the neutral fats, also known as triglycerides, each polypeptides.
