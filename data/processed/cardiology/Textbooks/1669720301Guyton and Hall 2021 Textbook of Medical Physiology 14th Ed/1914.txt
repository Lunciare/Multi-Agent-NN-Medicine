are always at least two and as many as 10 such pairs in each immunoglobulin molecule. Antibodies Figure 35- 4 shows a designated end of each light and heavy chain, called the variable portion; the remainder of each chain is called the constant portion. The variable portion is different for each specific antibody, and it is this portion that attaches specifically to a particular type of antigen. The constant portion determines other proper- ties of the antibody, establishing such factors as antibody diffusivity in the tissues, adherence to specific structures in the tissues, attachment to the complement complex, ease with which the antibodies pass through membranes, Figure 35- 5.

The IgM class is also Specificity of Antibodies.
