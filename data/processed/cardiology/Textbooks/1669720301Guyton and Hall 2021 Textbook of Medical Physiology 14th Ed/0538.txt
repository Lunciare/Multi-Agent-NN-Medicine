millivolts because this is the difference between the −0.2 the positive terminal is connected to the left leg. This millivolts on the right arm and the +0.3 millivolts on the configuration means that the electrocardiograph records left arm. Similarly, lead III records a positive potential of positively when the left arm is negative with respect to +0.7 millivolts, and lead II records a positive potential of the left leg. +1.2 millivolts because these are the instantaneous poten- tial differences between the respective pairs of limbs. Einthoven’s Triangle. In Figure 11- 6, the triangle, called Now, note that the sum of the voltages in leads I and Einthoven’s triangle, is drawn around the area of the heart. III equals the voltage in lead II; that is, 0.5 plus 0.7 equals This triangle illustrates that the two arms and left leg form 1.2. Mathematically, this principle, called Einthoven’s law, apices of a triangle surrounding the heart. The two apices holds true at any given instant while the three “standard” at the upper part of the triangle represent the points at bipolar ECGs are being recorded. which the two arms connect electrically with the fluids around the heart, and the lower apex is
