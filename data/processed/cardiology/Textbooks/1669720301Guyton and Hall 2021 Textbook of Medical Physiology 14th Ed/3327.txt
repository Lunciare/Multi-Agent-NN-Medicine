These reflexes are me- The distal opening of the stomach is the pylorus. Here diated by three routes: (1) directly from the duodenum the thickness of the circular wall muscle becomes 50% to to the stomach through the enteric nervous system in 100% greater than in the earlier portions of the stomach the gut wall; (2) through extrinsic nerves that go to the antrum, and it remains slightly tonically contracted al- prevertebral sympathetic ganglia and then back through most all the time. Therefore, the pyloric circular muscle is inhibitory sympathetic nerve fibers to the stomach; and called the pyloric sphincter. (3) probably to a slight extent through the vagus nerves all Despite normal tonic contraction of the pyloric the way to the brain stem, where they inhibit the normal sphincter, the pylorus usually is open enough for water excitatory signals transmitted to the stomach through the and other fluids to empty from the stomach into the duo- vagi. All these parallel reflexes have two effects on stom- denum with
