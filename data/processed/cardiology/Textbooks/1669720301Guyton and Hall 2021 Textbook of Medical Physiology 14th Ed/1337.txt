Conversely, electrolytes, the body fluids to be filtered and processed by the kidneys such as sodium ions, chloride ions, and bicarbonate ions, many times each day. Because the entire plasma volume are highly reabsorbed, so only small amounts appear in is only about 3 liters, whereas the GFR is about 180 L/ the urine. Certain nutritional substances, such as amino day, the entire plasma can be filtered and processed about acids and glucose, are completely reabsorbed from the 60 times each day. This high GFR allows the kidneys to tubules and do not appear in the urine, even though large control the volume and composition of the body fluids amounts are filtered by the glomerular capillaries. precisely and rapidly. Each of the processes—glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion—is regulated accord-
