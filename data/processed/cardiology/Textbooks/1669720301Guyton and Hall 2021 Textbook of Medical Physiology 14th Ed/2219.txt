In both these fluids, the CO immediately reacts 2 none of these is affected directly by changes in blood CO with the water to form new H+. Thus, paradoxically, more 2 or H+ concentration. Instead, an additional neuronal area, H+ is released into the respiratory chemosensitive sen- a chemosensitive area, shown in Figure 42- 2, is located sory area of the medulla when the blood CO 2 concen- bilaterally, lying only 0.2 millimeter beneath the ventral tration increases than when the blood H+ concentration surface of the medulla. This area is highly sensitive to increases. For this reason, respiratory center activity is changes in either blood Pco or H+ concentration, and it increased very strongly by changes in blood CO , a fact 2 2 in turn excites the other portions of the respiratory center. that we subsequently discuss quantitatively.
