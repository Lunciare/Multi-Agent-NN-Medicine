pressure natriuresis is greatly enhanced because long as the kidneys and various nervous and hormonal the increased blood pressure also, after a short time delay, mechanisms are operating effectively, large changes in suppresses renin release and, therefore, decreases the salt and water intake can be accommodated with minimal formation of Ang II and aldosterone. As discussed previ- changes in blood volume, extracellular fluid volume, car- ously, decreased levels of Ang II and aldosterone inhibit diac output, and arterial pressure. 394 emulov ro muidos yranirU )lamron ×( tuptuo Chapter 30 Renal Regulation of Potassium, Calcium, Phosphate, and Magnesium Nonrenal Fluid fluid loss intake Arterial Rate of change of Extracellular pressure extracellular fluid volume fluid volume Total peripheral Arterial pressure Blood resistance volume Cardiac Venous Mean circulatory output return filling pressure Heart strength Vascular capacity Figure 30-14.
