Digestion of fats. Instead, essentially all fat digestion occurs in the small in- testine, as follows. all triglycerides that it can reach. The enterocytes of the The First Step in Fat Digestion Is Emulsification by small intestine contain additional lipase, known as enteric Bile Acids and Lecithin. The first step in fat digestion lipase, but it is usually not needed. is to physically break the fat globules into small sizes so End Products of Fat Digestion Are Free Fatty Acids. that the water- soluble digestive enzymes can act on the Most of the triglycerides of the diet are split by pancreatic globule surfaces. This process is called emulsification of lipase into free fatty acids and 2- monoglycerides, as shown the fat, and it begins by agitation in the stomach to mix in Figure 66- 4. the fat with the products of stomach digestion. Most of the emulsification then occurs in the duode- Bile Salts Form Micelles That Accelerate Fat Diges- num under the influence of bile, the liver secretion that tion.
