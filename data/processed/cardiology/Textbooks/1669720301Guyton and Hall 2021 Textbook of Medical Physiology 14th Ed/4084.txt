cleared from the circulation within 10 to 15 min- utes. Except for the portion of the insulin that combines with receptors in the target cells, the insulin is degraded Insulin by the enzyme insulinase mainly in the liver, to a lesser extent in the kidneys and muscles, and slightly in most other tissues. This rapid removal from the plasma is Figure 79-2 . A schematic of the human proinsulin molecule, which important because, at times, it is as important to rapidly is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus of the pancreatic beta cells to form turn off the control functions of insulin as it is to turn connecting peptide (C peptide), and insulin, which is composed of the A and B chains connected by disulfide bonds. The C peptide and them on. insulin are packaged in granules and secreted in equimolar amounts, along with a small amount of proinsulin. ACTIVATION OF TARGET CELL RECEPTORS BY INSULIN AND THE RESULTING in promoting amino acid uptake by cells and conversion CELLULAR EFFECTS of these amino acids into protein. In addition, it inhibits breakdown of proteins that are already in the cells. To initiate its effects on target cells, insulin must first bind with
