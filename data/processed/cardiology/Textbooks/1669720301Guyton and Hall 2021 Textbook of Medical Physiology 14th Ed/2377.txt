shows a typical anterior motor neuron in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. It is composed of three major parts—the soma, which is the main body of the B Electrical synapse neuron, a single axon, which extends from the soma into Action a peripheral nerve that leaves the spinal cord, and den- potential drites, which are great numbers of branching projections of the soma that extend as much as 1 millimeter into the surrounding areas of the cord. Presynaptic As many as 10,000 to 200,000 minute synaptic knobs terminal called presynaptic terminals lie on the surfaces of the den- Gap junction channels drites and soma of the motor neuron, with about 80% to 95% of them on the dendrites and only 5% to 20% on the Intercellular soma. These presynaptic terminals are the ends of nerve gap (20-40 Å) fibrils that originate from many other neurons. Many of these presynaptic terminals are excitatory—that is, they secrete a neurotransmitter that excites the postsynaptic neuron. However, other presynaptic terminals are inhibi- Postsynaptic tory—that is, they secrete a neurotransmitter that inhibits terminal the postsynaptic neuron. Neurons in other parts of the cord and brain differ from the anterior motor neuron in (1)
