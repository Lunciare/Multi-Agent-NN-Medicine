For example, when the cerebrospinal fluid pres- peripheral vessels into the heart and lungs and, there- sure rises to equal the arterial pressure, it compresses the fore, increases cardiac output. This effect is essential whole brain, as well as the arteries in the brain, and cuts in helping cause the fivefold to sevenfold increase in off the blood supply to the brain. This action initiates a cardiac output that sometimes occurs during heavy ex- CNS ischemic response that causes the arterial pressure ercise.
