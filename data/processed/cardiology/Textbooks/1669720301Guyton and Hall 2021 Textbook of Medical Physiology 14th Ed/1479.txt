creted in the urine. Therefore, the renal plasma flow can be calculat- lated as follows: ed from the clearance of PAH. To be more accurate, one can correct for the percentage of PAH that is still in the blood when it leaves the FF = GFR/RPF = 125/650 = 0.19 kidneys. P , Arterial plasma PAH concentration; U , urine PAH PAH PAH concentration; V, urine flow rate. CALCULATION OF TUBULAR REABSORPTION OR SECRETION FROM RENAL CLEARANCES Because the GFR is only about 20% of the total plasma flow, a substance that is completely cleared from the If the rates of glomerular filtration and renal excretion plasma must be excreted by tubular secretion, as well as of a substance are known, one can calculate whether by glomerular filtration (Figure 28- 23). There is no known there is a net reabsorption or net secretion of that sub- substance that is completely cleared by the kidneys. One stance by the renal tubules. For example, if the rate substance, PAH, is about 90% cleared from the plasma. of excretion of the substance (U × V) is less than the s Therefore, clearance of PAH can be used to approximate filtered load of the
