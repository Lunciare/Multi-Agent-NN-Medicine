effects, the concentrations of the photosensitive chemicals at any intensity of light greater than extremely dim twilight. remaining in the rods and cones are considerably reduced, and the sensitivity of the eye to light is correspondingly Photochemistry of Color Vision by the reduced. This process is called light adaptation. Cones Conversely, if a person remains in darkness for a long We previously pointed out that the photochemicals in the time, the retinal and opsins in the rods and cones are con- cones have almost exactly the same chemical composition verted back into the light- sensitive pigments. Furthermore, as that of rhodopsin in the rods. The only difference is that vitamin A is converted back into retinal to increase light- the protein portions, or the opsins—called photopsins in the sensitive pigments, the final limit being determined by the cones—are slightly different from the scotopsin of the rods. amount of opsins in the rods and cones to combine with the The retinal portion of all the visual pigments is exactly the retinal. This process is called dark adaptation. same in the cones and rods. The color- sensitive pigments of the Figure 51- 9 shows the course of dark adaptation when cones, therefore,
