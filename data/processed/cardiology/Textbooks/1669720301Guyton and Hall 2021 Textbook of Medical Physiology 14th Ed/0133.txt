newly forming poly- NH 2 O H R peptide (protein) chains passing through the endoplasmic R C C OH+H N C COOH reticulum membrane into the endoplasmic matrix. It should be noted that except in glandular cells, in NH 2 O H R which large amounts of protein- containing secretory ves- R C C N CCOOH H+ O 2 icles are formed, most proteins synthesized by the ribo- somes are released directly into the cytosol instead of into In this chemical reaction, a hydroxyl radical (OH−) is the endoplasmic reticulum. These proteins are enzymes removed from the COOH portion of the first amino acid, and internal structural proteins of the cell. and a hydrogen (H+) of the NH 2 portion of the other amino acid is removed. These combine to form water, and the Chemical Steps in Protein Synthesis. Some of the two reactive sites left on the two successive amino acids chemical events that occur in the synthesis of a protein bond with each other, resulting in a single molecule. This molecule are shown in Figure 3-12. This Fig. shows rep- process is called peptide linkage. As each additional amino resentative reactions for three separate amino acids, AA 1,
