of filtration is called net filtration, and it is the NET INWARD FORCE 7 fluid that must be returned to the circulation through the lymphatics. The normal rate of net filtration in the entire Thus, there is a net reabsorption pressure of 7 mm Hg body, not including the kidneys, is only about 2 ml/min. at the venous ends of the capillaries. This reabsorption pressure is considerably less than the filtration pressure at CAPILLARY FILTRATION COEFFICIENT the capillary arterial ends, but remember that the venous capillaries are more numerous and more permeable than In the previous example, an average net imbalance of the arterial capillaries. Thus less reabsorption pressure is forces at the capillary membranes of 0.3 mm Hg causes required to cause inward movement of fluid. net fluid filtration in the entire body of 2 ml/min. Express- The reabsorption pressure causes about nine tenths ing the net fluid filtration rate for each mm Hg imbalance, of the fluid that has filtered out of the arterial ends of one finds a net filtration rate of 6.67 ml/min of fluid per the capillaries to be reabsorbed at the venous ends. The mm Hg for the entire body. This value is called
