osteocytic cell membranes. ciferol functions as a type of “hormone” to promote intes- tinal absorption of calcium mainly by increasing, over a PARATHYROID HORMONE period of about 2 days, formation of calbindin, a calcium- binding protein, in intestinal epithelial cells. This protein PTH provides a powerful mechanism for controlling functions in the brush border of these cells to transport extracellular calcium and phosphate concentrations by calcium into the cell cytoplasm. The calcium then moves regulating intestinal reabsorption, renal excretion, and through the basolateral membrane of the cell by facili- exchange between the extracellular fluid and bone of tated diffusion. The rate of calcium absorption is directly these ions. Excess activity of the parathyroid gland causes proportional to the quantity of this calcium-b inding pro- rapid release of calcium salts from the bones, with resul- tein. Furthermore, this protein remains in the cells for tant hypercalcemia in the extracellular fluid; conversely, several weeks after the 1,25-d ihydroxycholecalciferol has hypofunction of the parathyroid glands causes hypocalce- been removed from the body, thus causing a prolonged mia, often with resultant tetany. effect on calcium absorption.
