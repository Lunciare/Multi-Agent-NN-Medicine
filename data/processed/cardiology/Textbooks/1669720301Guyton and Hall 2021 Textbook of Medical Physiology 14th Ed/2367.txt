the Nervous System, Basic Functions of Synapses, and Neurotransmitters Motor nerve Motor Once memories have been stored in the nervous sys- to muscles area tem, they become part of the brain processing mechanism for future “thinking.” That is, the thinking processes of the brain compare new sensory experiences with stored Caudate nucleus memories; the memories then help select the important new sensory information and channel this into appropri- ate memory storage areas for future use or into motor areas to cause immediate bodily responses. MAJOR LEVELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS Thalamus SYSTEM FUNCTION Putamen Globus pallidus The human nervous system has inherited special func- Subthalamic nucleus tional capabilities from each stage of human evolution- Bulboreticular formation ary development. From this heritage, three major levels Cerebellum of the central nervous system have specific functional characteristics: (1) the spinal cord level; (2) the lower brain or subcortical level; and (3) the higher brain or cor- tical level. SPINAL CORD LEVEL Gamma motor fiber Alpha motor fiber We often think of the spinal cord as being only a conduit for signals from the periphery of the body to the brain or in the opposite direction from the brain back to the body. This supposition
