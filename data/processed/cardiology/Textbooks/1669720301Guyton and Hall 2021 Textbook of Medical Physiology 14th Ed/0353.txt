This goal is achieved by daily stretching of the muscles or When a muscle remains unused for many weeks, the use of appliances that keep the muscles stretched during rate of degradation of the contractile proteins is more the atrophying process. rapid than the rate of replacement. Therefore, muscle Recovery of Muscle Contraction in Poliomyelitis: atrophy occurs.
