A special type of stiff filament composed of polym- erized tubulin molecules is used in all cells to construct Cell Cytoskeleton—Filament and Tubular strong tubular structures, the microtubules. Figure 2-8 Structures shows typical microtubules of a cell. The cell cytoskeleton is a network of fibrillar proteins Another example of microtubules is the tubular skeletal organized into filaments or tubules. These originate as structure in the center of each cilium that radiates
