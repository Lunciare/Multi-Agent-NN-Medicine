same as that of the cal organization for the control of motor function. It lies primary motor cortex, with the mouth and face areas mainly in the longitudinal fissure but extends a few centime- located most laterally; as one moves upward, the hand, ters onto the superior frontal cortex. Contractions elicited by arm, trunk, and leg areas are encountered. stimulating this area are often bilateral rather than unilateral. Nerve signals generated in the premotor area cause For example, stimulation frequently leads to bilateral grasp- much more complex “patterns” of movement than the ing movements of both hands simultaneously; these move- discrete patterns generated in the primary motor cortex. ments are perhaps rudiments of the hand functions required For example, the pattern may be to position the shoul- for climbing. In general, this area functions in concert with ders and arms so that the hands are properly oriented the premotor area to provide body- wide attitudinal move- to perform specific tasks. To achieve these results, the ments, fixation movements of the different segments of the most anterior part of the premotor area first develops a body, positional movements of the head and eyes, and so “motor image” of the total muscle
