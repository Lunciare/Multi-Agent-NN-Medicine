potentials (in millivolts). A, Weakened end plate potential recorded in a curarized muscle that is too weak to elicit an action potential. B, Normal end plate potential eliciting a A muscle action potential. C, Weakened end plate potential caused by Na+ botulinum toxin that decreases end plate release of acetylcholine, again too weak to elicit a muscle action potential. Ach Ach – – spreads along the muscle membrane and causes muscle – – contraction. – – Destruction of the Released Acetylcholine by Ace- tylcholinesterase. The acetylcholine, once released into the synaptic space, continues to activate acetylcholine re- ceptors as long as the acetylcholine persists in the space. However, it is rapidly destroyed by the enzyme acetylcho- linesterase, which is attached mainly to the spongy layer of fine connective tissue that fills the synaptic space be- tween the presynaptic nerve terminal and the postsynap- tic muscle membrane. A small amount of acetylcholine diffuses out of the synaptic space and is then no longer B available to act on the muscle fiber membrane. Figure 7-3. Acetylcholine- gated channel. A, Closed state. B, After The short time that the acetylcholine remains in the acetylcholine (Ach) has become attached and a conformational change synaptic
