Beyond increased red blood cell concentration in the remaining a certain point, so much tissue damage has occurred, so blood, and this increase in viscosity exacerbates the slug- many destructive enzymes have been released into the gishness of blood flow. body fluids, so much acidosis has developed, and so many Loss of fluid from all fluid compartments of the body other destructive factors are now in progress that even a is called dehydration; this condition can also reduce the normal cardiac output for a few minutes cannot reverse blood volume and cause hypovolemic shock similar to the continuing deterioration. Therefore, in severe shock, that resulting from hemorrhage. Some of the causes of a stage is
