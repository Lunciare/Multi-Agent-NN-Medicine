Most cell membranes are adherent to one another at multiple important, essentially the same attractive forces between points so that force generated in one muscle fiber can be myosin and actin filaments cause contraction in smooth transmitted to the next. In addition, the cell membranes muscle as in skeletal muscle, but the internal physical are joined
