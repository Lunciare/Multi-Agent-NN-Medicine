H+, organic acids, bases As discussed in Chapter 31, secretion of hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen is an important step in the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubule (by combining H+ with the HCO − to form H CO , which then dissociates 3 2 3 Figure 28- 6 Cellular ultrastructure and primary transport character- into H O and CO ). 2 2 istics of the proximal tubule.
