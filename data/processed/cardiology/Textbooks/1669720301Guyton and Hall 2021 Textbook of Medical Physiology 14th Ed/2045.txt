A typical basic spirometer is Residual volume 1200 1100 shown in Figure 38- 5. It consists of a drum inverted over Capacities (ml) a chamber of water, with the drum counterbalanced by Inspiratory capacity 3500 2400 a weight. In the drum is a breathing gas, usually air or Functional residual capacity 2300 1800 oxygen; a tube connects the mouth with the gas chamber. Vital capacity 4600 3100 When the person breathes into and out of the chamber, the drum rises and falls, and an appropriate recording is Total lung capacity 5800 4200 made. Figure 38-
