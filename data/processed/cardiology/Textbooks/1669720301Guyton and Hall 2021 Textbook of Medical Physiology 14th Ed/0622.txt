After almost all PVCs, the T wave has an electrical potential polarity exactly opposite to that of the QRS II complex because the slow conduction of the impulse through the cardiac muscle causes the muscle fibers that depolarize first also to repolarize first. Some PVCs are relatively benign in their effects on III overall pumping by the heart; they can result from such factors as cigarettes, excessive intake of coffee, lack of sleep, various mild toxic states, and even emotional irri- I −I −III tability. Conversely, many other PVCs result from stray impulses or re-e ntrant signals that
