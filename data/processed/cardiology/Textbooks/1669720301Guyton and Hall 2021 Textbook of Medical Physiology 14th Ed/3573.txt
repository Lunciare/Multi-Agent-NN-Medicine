Normally, the acetoacetic acid and β-h ydroxybutyric brain cells, which normally derive almost all their energy from glucose, can derive 50% to 75% of their energy from fats. acid that enter the blood are transported so rapidly to the tissues that their combined concentration in the plasma Synthesis of Triglycerides From
