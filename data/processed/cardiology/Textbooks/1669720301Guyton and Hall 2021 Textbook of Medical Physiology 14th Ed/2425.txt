General Principles and Sensory Physiology SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SYNAPTIC 600 TRANSMISSION 500 Fatigue of Synaptic Transmission. When excitatory 400 synapses are repetitively stimulated at a rapid rate, the 300 Neuron 1 Neuron 3 number of discharges by the postsynaptic neuron is at first very great, but the firing rate becomes progressively 200 Threshold less in succeeding milliseconds or seconds. This phenom- Neuron 2 enon is called fatigue of synaptic transmission. 100 Fatigue is an exceedingly important characteristic of synaptic function because when areas of the nervous 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 system become overexcited, fatigue causes them to lose this excess excitability after a while. For example, fatigue Excitatory state (arbitrary units) is probably the most important means whereby the Figure 46- 13. Response characteristics of different types of neurons excess excitability of the brain during an epileptic seizure to different levels of excitatory state. is finally subdued so that the seizure ceases. Thus, the development of fatigue is a protective mechanism against drites can summate excitatory and IPSPs in the same way excess
