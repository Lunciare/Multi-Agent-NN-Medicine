Normally, the renal tubules reabsorb 99% of the fil- tered calcium, and about 100 mg/day are excreted in the BONE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO urine (see Chapter 30 for further discussion of renal cal- EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM AND cium excretion). Approximately 90% of the calcium in the PHOSPHATE glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, loops of Henle, and early distal tubules. There are two general
