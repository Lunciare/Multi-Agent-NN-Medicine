To the left is the effect of a weak Figure 47-7 Pattern of stimulation of pain fibers in a nerve leading stimulus, with only a single nerve fiber in the middle from an area of skin pricked by a pin. This pattern of stimulation is an example of spatial summation. of the bundle stimulated strongly (represented by the red- colored fiber), whereas several adjacent fibers are stimulated weakly (half- red fibers). The other two views of the nerve cross section show the effect of a moderate SIGNAL INTENSITY TRANSMISSION stimulus and a strong stimulus, with progressively more IN NERVE TRACTS—SPATIAL AND fibers being stimulated.
