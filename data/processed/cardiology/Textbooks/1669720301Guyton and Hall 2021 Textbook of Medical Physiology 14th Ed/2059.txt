In a person with healthy lungs, the anatomical and physiological dead Trachea, Bronchi, and Bronchioles spaces are nearly equal because all alveoli are functional in Figure 38- 8 highlights the respiratory passageways. The air the normal lung but, in a person with partially functional is distributed to the lungs by way of the trachea, bronchi, or nonfunctional alveoli in some parts of the lungs, the and bronchioles. physiological dead space may be as much as 10 times the One of the most important challenges in the respiratory volume of the anatomical dead space, or 1 to 2 liters.
