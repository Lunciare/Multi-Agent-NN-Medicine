In the most lateral portions of Figures 58- 4 and 58- 5 show still another association area the anterior occipital lobe and posterior temporal lobe is called the limbic association area. This area is found in the an area for naming objects. The names are learned mainly anterior pole of the temporal lobe, in the ventral portion through auditory input, whereas the physical natures of the of the frontal lobe, and in the cingulate gyrus lying deep objects are learned mainly through visual input. In turn, in the longitudinal fissure on the midsurface of each cere- the names are essential for both auditory and visual lan- bral hemisphere. It is concerned primarily with behav- guage comprehension (functions performed in Wernicke’s ior, emotions, and motivation. We discuss in Chapter 59 area located immediately superior to the auditory “names” that the limbic cortex is part of a much more extensive region and anterior to the visual word processing area). system, the limbic system, that includes a complex set of neuronal structures in the midbasal regions of the brain.
