The venules collect blood from the capillaries and The rate of blood flow through many tissues is controlled gradually coalesce into progressively larger veins. mainly in response to their need for nutrients and removal of The veins function as conduits for transport of blood from waste products of metabolism. In some organs, such as the the venules back to the heart. The veins also serve as a major kidneys, the circulation serves additional functions. Blood reservoir of extra blood. Because the pressure in the venous flow to the kidney, for example, is far in excess of its metabolic system is low, the venous walls are thin. Even so, they are requirements and is related to its excretory function, which muscular enough to contract or expand and thereby serve as requires that a large volume of blood be filtered each minute.
