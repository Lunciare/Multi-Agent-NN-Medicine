When an action potential arrives at the nerve terminal, the acetylcholinesterase so that the esterase once again be- it opens many calcium channels in the membrane of the comes active. Conversely, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, nerve terminal because this terminal has an abundance which is a powerful nerve gas poison, inactivates acetylcho- of voltage- gated calcium channels. As a result, the cal- linesterase for weeks, which makes this poison particularly cium ion concentration inside the terminal membrane lethal. increases about 100- fold, which in turn increases the Drugs That Block Transmission at the Neuromuscular rate of fusion of the acetylcholine vesicles with the ter- Junction. A group of drugs known as curariform drugs can minal membrane about 10,000-f old.

For example. d- tubocurarine blocks the action tylcholine into the synaptic space. About 125 vesicles of acetylcholine on the muscle fiber acetylcholine receptors, usually rupture with each action potential. Then, after a thus preventing
