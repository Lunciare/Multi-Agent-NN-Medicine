This the dilator receptors are called beta receptors. Both alpha is almost certainly one of the major causes of cardiac cel- and beta receptors exist in the coronary vessels. In gen- lular death during myocardial ischemia. eral, the epicardial coronary vessels have a preponderance of alpha receptors, whereas the intramuscular arteries ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE may have a preponderance of beta receptors. Therefore, sympathetic stimulation can, at least theoretically, cause The most common cause of death in the Western coun- slight overall coronary constriction or dilation, but usu- tries is ischemic heart disease, which results from insuf- ally constriction.
