After the head has detached from the actin, the ment of forces causes the head to tilt toward the arm new molecule of ATP is cleaved to begin the next and to drag the actin filament along with it. This tilt of cycle, leading to a new power stroke. That is, the the head is called the power stroke. Immediately after energy again cocks the head back to its perpen- tilting, the head then automatically breaks away from dicular condition, ready to begin the new power the active site. Next, the head returns to its extended stroke cycle. direction. In this position, it combines with a new 6. When the cocked head (with its stored energy de- active site farther down along the actin filament; the rived from the cleaved ATP) binds with a new active head then tilts again to cause a new power stroke, and site on the actin filament, it becomes uncocked and the actin filament moves another step. Thus, the heads once again provides a new power stroke. of the cross- bridges bend back and forth and, step by Thus, the process proceeds again and again until the step, walk along the actin filament, pulling the
