The bipolar cells, which transmit signals vertically from the rods, cones, and horizontal cells to the in- Red- Green Color Blindness. When a single group of ner plexiform layer, where they synapse with gan- color- receptive cones is missing from the eye, the per- glion cells and amacrine cells son is unable to distinguish some colors from others. For 4. The amacrine cells, which transmit signals in two example, one can see in Figure 51- 10 that green, yellow, orange, and red colors, which are the colors between the directions, either directly from bipolar cells to gan- wavelengths of 525 and 675 nanometers, are normally dis- glion cells or horizontally within the inner plexiform tinguished from one another by the red and green cones. layer from axons of the bipolar cells to dendrites of If either of these two cones is missing, the person cannot the ganglion cells or to other amacrine cells use this mechanism for distinguishing these four colors;
