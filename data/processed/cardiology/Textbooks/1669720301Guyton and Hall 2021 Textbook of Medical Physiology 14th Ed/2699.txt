Layers III through VI are called parvocellular lay- ers because they contain large numbers of small 18 to medium- sized neurons. These neurons receive 17 their input almost entirely from the type P retinal ganglion cells that transmit color and convey accu- rate point to point spatial information, but at only a Primary moderate velocity of conduction rather than at high visual velocity. cortex Secondary Visual detail, visual color cortex ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION OF THE VISUAL CORTEX Figure 52- 3. Transmission of visual signals from the primary visual cortex into secondary visual areas on the lateral surfaces of the oc- cipital and parietal cortices. Note that the signals representing form, Figures 52- 2 and 52- 3 show the visual cortex, which is third- dimensional (3D) position, and motion are transmitted mainly located primarily on the medial aspect of the occipital into the superior portions of the occipital lobe and posterior portions lobes.
