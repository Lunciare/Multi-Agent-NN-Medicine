remains at the zero point because there is no vectorial III electrical potential. However, as soon as current begins to Figure 12-11 Plotting the mean electrical axis of the ventricles from flow through the ventricles at the beginning of ventricu- two electrocardiographic leads (leads I and III). lar depolarization, the positive end of the vector leaves the zero reference point. When the septum first becomes depolarized, the vector of ventricular depolarization, the direction of the electrical extends downward toward the apex of the ventricles, but potential (negative to positive) is from the base of the it is relatively weak, thus generating the first portion of the ventricles toward the apex. This preponderant direction ventricular vectorcardiogram, as shown by the positive end of the potential during depolarization from the base to the of vector 1. As more of the ventricular muscle becomes de- apex of the heart is called the mean electrical axis of the polarized, the vector becomes stronger and stronger, usual- ventricles. The mean electrical axis of the normal ventricles ly swinging slightly to one side. Thus, vector 2 of Figure 12- is 59 degrees. In many pathological conditions of the heart, 10 represents the state of depolarization of
