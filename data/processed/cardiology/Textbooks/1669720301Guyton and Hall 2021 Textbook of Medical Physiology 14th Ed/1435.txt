cells. The chloride-b icarbonate HH++ ++ HHCCOO 33–– HHCCOO 33–– Pendrin counter- transporter on the apical membrane of type B HH++ CCll–– cells is called pendrin and is different than the chloride- ATP KK++ bicarbonate transporter of type A cells. Hydrogen ions are actively transported out of the type B intercalated cell on CCll–– KK++ the basolateral side of the cell membrane by hydrogen- ATPase, and bicarbonate is secreted into the lumen, thus eliminating excess plasma bicarbonate in alkalosis. Induc- Figure 28- 13 Type A and type B intercalated cells of the collect- tion of chronic metabolic alkalosis increases the number ing tubule. Type A cells contain hydrogen- ATPase and hydrogen- of type B intercalated cells, which contribute to increased potassium- ATPase in the luminal membrane and secrete hydrogen excretion of bicarbonate, whereas acidosis increases the ions while reabsorbing bicarbonate and potassium ions in acidosis. In type B cells, the hydrogen- ATPase and hydrogen- potassium- ATPase number of type A cells. transporters are located in the basolateral membrane and reabsorb A more detailed discussion of this mechanism is pre- hydrogen ions while secreting bicarbonate and potassium ions in al- sented in Chapter 31. The intercalated cells can also reab- kalosis.
