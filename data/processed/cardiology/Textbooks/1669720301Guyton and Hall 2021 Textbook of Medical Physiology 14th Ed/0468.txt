Phase III: Period of Ejection. During ejection, the contractile properties of muscle, it is important to specify systolic pressure rises even higher because of still more the degree of tension on the muscle when it begins to con- contraction of the ventricle. At the same time, the volume tract, called the preload, and to specify the load against of the ventricle decreases because the aortic valve has which the muscle exerts its contractile force, called the now opened, and blood flows out of the ventricle into the afterload. aorta. Therefore, in Figure 9- 10, the curve labeled “III,” For cardiac contraction, the preload is usually con- or “period of ejection,” traces the changes in volume and sidered to be the end- diastolic pressure when the ven- systolic pressure during this period of ejection. tricle has become filled.
