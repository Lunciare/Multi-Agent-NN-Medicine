is split to pyruvic acid, each mole Other substrates Despite the paramount importance of ATP as a coupling of glucose in the glycogen gives rise to 3 moles of ATP. The agent for energy transfer, this substance is not the most reason for this difference is that free glucose entering the abundant store of high-e nergy phosphate bonds in the cells. cell must be phosphorylated by using 1 mole of ATP before CO 2 + H 2O Creatine + PO 4 Phosphocreatine, which also contains high-e nergy phosphate it can begin to be split; this is not true of glucose derived bonds, is three to eight times more abundant than ATP. Also, from glycogen because it comes from the glycogen already the high-e nergy bond (∼) of phosphocreatine contains about in the phosphorylated state, without the additional expend- 8500 calories per mole under standard conditions and as iture of ATP. Thus, the best source of energy under anaerobic many as 13,000 calories per mole under conditions in the conditions is the stored glycogen of the cells. body (37°C and low concentrations of the reactants). This Anaerobic Energy Utilization During Hypoxia. One of amount is slightly greater than the 12,000 calories
