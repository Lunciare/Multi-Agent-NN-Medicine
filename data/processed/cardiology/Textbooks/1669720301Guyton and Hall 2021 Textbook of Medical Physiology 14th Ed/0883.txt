When the heart rate is rapid, atrial stretch and low- pressure receptors, all of which are located in the cause by infusion of fluids may reduce the heart rate due to peripheral circulation outside the brain.

Thus, the net effect of blood flow to the vasomotor center in the lower brain increased blood volume and atrial stretch on heart rate de- stem becomes decreased severely enough to cause nutri- pends on the relative contributions of the baroreceptor re- tional deficiency—that is, to cause cerebral ischemia—the flexes (which tends to slow the heart rate) and the Bainbridge vasoconstrictor and cardioaccelerator neurons in the reflex which tends to accelerate the heart rate, as shown in vasomotor center respond directly to the ischemia and Figure 18- 10.
