These same foods can also be burned with pure oxygen outside the body in an actual fire, releasing large amounts of energy, but the energy is released suddenly, Energy production all in the form of heat. The energy needed by the physi- • Proteins ologic processes of the cells is not heat but energy to cause • Carbohydrates Oxidation • Fats mechanical movement in the case of muscle function, to concentrate solutes in the case of glandular secretion, and to effect many other cell functions. To provide this energy, the chemical reactions must be “coupled” with the systems ADP + P ATP responsible for these physiologic functions. This coupling i is accomplished by special cellular enzymes and energy transfer systems, some of which are explained in this and
