products in the body, such as creatinine, are handled by from the blood into the renal tubules as follows: the kidneys in this manner, allowing excretion of essen- tially all that is filtered. Urinary excretion rate In panel B, the substance is freely filtered but is also =Filtration rate−Reabsorption rate+Seecretion rate partly reabsorbed from the tubules back into the blood. Therefore, the rate of urinary excretion is less than the Urine formation begins when a large amount of fluid rate of filtration at the glomerular capillaries. In this case, that is virtually free of protein is filtered from the glomer- the excretion rate is calculated as the filtration rate minus ular capillaries into Bowman’s capsule. Most substances the reabsorption rate. This pattern is typical for many of in the plasma, except for proteins, are freely filtered, so the electrolytes of the body, such as sodium and chloride their concentration in the glomerular filtrate in Bow- ions. man’s capsule is almost the same as in the plasma.
