In hemolytic jaundice, the excretory function of kidneys into the urine. After exposure to air in the urine, the liver is not impaired, but red blood cells are hemolyzed urobilinogen becomes oxidized to urobilin; alternatively, in so rapidly that the hepatic cells simply cannot excrete the bil- the feces, it becomes altered and oxidized to form stercobi- irubin as quickly as it is formed. Therefore, plasma concen- lin. These interrelations of bilirubin and the other bilirubin tration of free bilirubin rises to above-n ormal levels. Like- products are shown in Figure 71- 2. wise, the rate of formation of urobilinogen in the intestine is Jaundice—Excess Bilirubin in the Extracellular Fluid greatly increased, and much of this urobilinogen is absorbed into the blood and later excreted in the urine. Jaundice refers to a yellowish tint to the body tissues, including Obstructive Jaundice Is Caused by Obstruction of Bile a yellowness of the skin and deep tissues.
