flow—arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc) remain above the level of the heart all the way to the bottom of greater than alveolar air pressure at all times. the lungs, the pulmonary arterial pressure during both systole and diastole remains greater than the 0 alveolar air pressure. Therefore, continuous flow occurs through the standing position at rest, there is little flow in the top the alveolar capillaries, or zone 3 blood flow. Also, when of the lung but about five times as much flow in the bot- a person is lying down, no part of the lung is more than a tom. To help explain these differences, the lung is often few centimeters above the level of the heart. In this case, described as being divided into three zones, as shown in blood flow in a normal person is entirely zone 3 blood Figure 39- 5. In each zone, the patterns of blood flow are flow, including the lung apices. quite different. Zone 1 Blood Flow Occurs Only Under Abnormal Zones 1, 2, and 3 of Pulmonary Blood Conditions. Zone 1 blood flow, which means no blood Flow flow at any time during the cardiac cycle, occurs when the
