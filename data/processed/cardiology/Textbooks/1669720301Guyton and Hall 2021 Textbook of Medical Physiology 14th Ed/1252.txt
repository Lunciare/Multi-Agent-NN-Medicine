example, the osmotic pressure of a 0.9% sodium chloride maintaining adequate fluids in one or both of the intra- solution is calculated as follows. A 0.9% solution means cellular and extracellular compartments. As discussed in that there is 0.9 gram of sodium chloride per 100 millilit- Chapter 16 and later in this chapter, the relative amounts ers of solution, or 9 g/L. Because the molecular weight of of extracellular fluid distributed between the plasma and sodium chloride is 58.5 g/mol, the molarity of the solu- interstitial spaces are determined mainly by the balance of tion is 9 g/L divided by 58.5 g/mol, or about 0.154 mol/L. hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces across the capillary Because each molecule of sodium chloride is equal to 2 membranes. osmoles, the osmolarity of the solution is 0.154 × 2, or The distribution of fluid between intracellular and 0.308 Osm/L.
