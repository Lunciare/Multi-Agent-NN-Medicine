the development of duodenal ulcers, as discussed in Chapter 67. Bicarbonate ion secretion by the pancreas provides Vagal stimulation an appropriate pH for action of the pancreatic digestive releases enzymes, which function optimally in a slightly alkaline enzymes or neutral medium, at a pH of 7.0 to 8.0. Fortunately, into acini the pH of the sodium bicarbonate secretion averages 8.0. Secretin causes copious secretion Cholecystokinin Contributes to Control of Diges- of pancreatic fluid tive Enzyme Secretion by the Pancreas. The presence and bicarbonate; of food in the upper small intestine also causes a second cholecystokinin Secretin and cholecystokinin causes secretion hormone, CCK, a polypeptide containing 33 amino ac- absorbed into blood stream of enzymes ids, to be released from yet another group of cells, the I cells, in the mucosa of the duodenum and upper jejunum. Figure 65- 10. Regulation of pancreatic secretion. This release of CCK results especially from the presence of proteoses and peptones (products of partial protein di- to soap (a fat); and (3) intense digestive enzyme secre- gestion) and long- chain fatty acids in the chyme coming tion (when peptones enter the duodenum) stimulated by from the stomach. CCK. CCK, like secretin, passes via the blood
