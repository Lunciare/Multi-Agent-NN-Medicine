from the Figure 9-1 3. Approximate normal right and left ventricular volume output curves for the normal resting human heart as extrapolated normal rate of 70 beats/min up to 180 to 200 beats/min from data obtained in dogs and data from humans. and, rarely, even 250 beats/min. Also, sympathetic stimu- lation may double the force of heart contraction, thereby curve called the stroke work output curve. Note that as increasing the volume of blood pumped and increasing the atrial pressure for each side of the heart increases, stroke ejection pressure. Thus, sympathetic stimulation often can work output for that side increases until it reaches the increase the maximum cardiac output as much as twofold limit of the ventricle’s pumping ability. to threefold, in addition to the increased output caused by Figure 9- 13 shows another type of ventricular func- the Frank- Starling mechanism already discussed. tion curve called the ventricular volume output curve. The Conversely, inhibition of the sympathetic nerves to the two curves of this figure represent function of the two heart can decrease cardiac pumping to a moderate extent. ventricles of the human heart based on data extrapolated Under normal conditions, the sympathetic nerve fibers from experimental animal
