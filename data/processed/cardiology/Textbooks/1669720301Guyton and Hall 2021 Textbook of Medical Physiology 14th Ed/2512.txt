Thus, a weak stimulus the spatial pattern of cortical excitation when both skin causes only the most central neurons to fire. A stronger points are stimulated simultaneously. Note that the resul- stimulus causes still more neurons to fire, but those in the tant zone of excitation has two separate peaks. These two center discharge at a considerably more rapid rate than do peaks, separated by a valley, allow the sensory cortex to those farther away from the center. detect the presence of two stimulatory points, rather than Two- Point Discrimination. A method frequently used a single point.
