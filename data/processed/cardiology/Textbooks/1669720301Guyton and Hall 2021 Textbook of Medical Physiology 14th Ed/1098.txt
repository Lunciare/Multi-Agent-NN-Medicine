Progressive fluid retention raises the right time, considerable fluid has been retained in the body, atrial pressure over a period of days, and the cardiac output pro- gresses from point A to point F until death occurs. and the tendency for venous return has increased mark- edly as well; therefore, the right atrial pressure has risen even more. As a result, the state of the circulation is now Compensated Heart Failure.
