The positive charges of sodium ions in turn pull through the brain. along large amounts of negatively charged chloride ions. The arrows in Figure 62-5 show that the main The two ions increase the quantity of osmotically active channels of fluid flow from the choroid plexuses and sodium chloride in the cerebrospinal fluid, which then then through the cerebrospinal fluid system. The fluid causes almost immediate osmosis of water through the secreted in the lateral ventricles passes first into the membrane, thus providing the fluid of the secretion. third ventricle; then, after addition of minute amounts of Less important transport processes move small fluid from the third ventricle, it flows downward along amounts of glucose into the cerebrospinal fluid and both the aqueduct of Sylvius into the fourth ventricle, where potassium and bicarbonate ions out of the cerebrospinal still another minute amount of fluid is added. Finally, fluid into the capillaries. Therefore, the resulting charac- the fluid passes out of the fourth ventricle through three teristics of the cerebrospinal fluid become the following: small openings, two lateral foramina of Luschka and
