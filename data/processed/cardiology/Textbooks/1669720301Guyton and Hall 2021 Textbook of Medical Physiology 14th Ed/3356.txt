The hormones are then absorbed into the blood and carried to the glands, where Na+ active absorption they stimulate secretion. This type of stimulation is par- Cl− passive absorption ticularly valuable to increase the output of gastric juice K+ active secretion and pancreatic juice when food enters the stomach or HCO − secretion 3 duodenum. Chemically, the gastrointestinal hormones are poly- peptides or polypeptide derivatives and will be discussed in more detail later. Saliva BASIC MECHANISM OF SECRETION BY Figure 65- 2. Formation and secretion of saliva by a submandibular GLANDULAR CELLS salivary gland. Secretion of Organic Substances. Although all the ba- sic mechanisms by which glandular cells function are not In addition, local epithelial stimulation also activates known, experimental evidence points to the following the enteric nervous system of the gut wall. The types of principles of secretion, as shown in Figure 65- 1. stimuli that activate this system are (1) tactile stimulation, 1. The nutrient material needed for formation of the (2) chemical irritation, and (3) distention of the
