Eye: III. Central Neurophysiology of Vision terminate in layer IV, but at points different from the M I signals. They terminate in layers IVa and IVcβ, the shal- lowest and deepest portions of layer IV, shown to the II right in Figure 52- 4. From there, these signals are trans- mitted vertically both toward the surface of the cortex III and to deeper layers. It is these P ganglion pathways that (a) transmit the accurate point to point type of vision, as well as color vision. (b) Color IV (c(cid:30)) “blobs” Vertical Neuronal Columns in the Visual Cortex. The visual cortex is organized structurally into several million (c(cid:31)) vertical columns of neuronal cells, with each column hav- ing a diameter of 30 to 50 micrometers. The same vertical V columnar organization is found throughout the cerebral cortex for the other senses as well (and also in the motor VI and analytical cortical regions). Each column represents a functional unit. One can roughly calculate that each of the visual vertical columns has perhaps 1000 or more neu- LGN LGN rons. (magnocellular) (parvocellular) After the optic signals terminate in layer IV, they are further processed as they spread outward and inward Retinal
