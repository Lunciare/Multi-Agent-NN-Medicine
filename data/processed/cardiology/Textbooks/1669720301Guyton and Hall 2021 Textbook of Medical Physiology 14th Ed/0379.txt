The electrical currents surrounding these T tubules then elicit the muscle contraction. MUSCLE ACTION POTENTIAL Figure 7-5 also shows a sarcoplasmic reticulum, in yellow. This sarcoplasmic reticulum is composed of two Almost everything discussed in Chapter 5 regarding the major parts: (1) large chambers called terminal cisternae initiation and conduction of action potentials in nerve that abut the T tubules; and (2) long longitudinal tubules fibers applies equally to skeletal muscle fibers, except for that surround all surfaces of the contracting myofibrils. quantitative differences.
