displacing much of the CO that is present in the carb- 2 with hemoglobin and plasma proteins is about 30% of the amino form from the blood. Second, the increased acidity total quantity transported—that is, normally about 1.5 ml of the hemoglobin also causes it to release an excess of H+, of CO in each 100 ml of blood. However, because this and these ions bind with HCO − to form carbonic acid, 2 3 reaction is much slower than the reaction of CO with which then dissociates into water and CO , and the CO 2 2 2 water inside the red blood cells, it is doubtful that under is released from the blood into the alveoli and, finally, into normal conditions this carbamino mechanism transports the air. more than 20% of the total CO 2.
