ulcers some- “Vomiting center” times fail to heal, and the only solution might be surgical removal of the entire colon. Paralysis of Defecation in Persons With Spinal Cord Injuries As discussed in Chapter 64, defecation is normally initiated by accumulating feces in the rectum, which causes a spinal Vagal Vagal cord–mediated defecation reflex passing from the rectum afferents afferents to the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and then back to the descending colon, sigmoid, rectum, and anus. When the spinal cord is injured somewhere between the conus medullaris and the brain, the voluntary por- tion of the defecation act is blocked while the basic cord reflex for defecation is still intact. Nevertheless, loss of the Sympathetic afferents voluntary aid to defecation—that is, loss of the increased abdominal pressure and relaxation of the voluntary anal sphincter—often makes defecation a difficult process in the person with this type of upper cord injury. However, because the cord defecation reflex can still occur, a small enema to excite action of this cord reflex, usually given in the morning shortly after a meal, can often cause adequate defecation. In this way, people with spinal cord injuries that do not destroy the conus medullaris of
