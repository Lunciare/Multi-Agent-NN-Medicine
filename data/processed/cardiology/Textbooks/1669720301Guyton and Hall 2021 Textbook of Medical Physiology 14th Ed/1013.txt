and small arteries as well. venous return curve, showing that a decrease in this Why is venous resistance so important in determining resistance to half- normal allows twice as much flow of the resistance to venous return? The answer is that when blood and, therefore, rotates the curve upward to twice the resistance in the veins increases, blood begins to be as great a slope. Conversely, an increase in resistance dammed up, mainly in the veins themselves. However, to twice normal rotates the curve downward to half as the venous pressure rises very little because the veins are great a slope. highly distensible. Therefore, this rise in venous pressure is Note also that when the right atrial pressure rises to not very effective in overcoming the resistance, and blood equal the Psf, venous return becomes zero at all levels of flow into the right atrium decreases drastically. Conversely, resistance to venous return because there is no pressure when arteriolar and small artery resistances increase, blood gradient to cause flow of blood. Therefore, the highest accumulates in the arteries, which have a capacitance only level to which the right atrial pressure can rise, regardless one thirtieth as great as that of
