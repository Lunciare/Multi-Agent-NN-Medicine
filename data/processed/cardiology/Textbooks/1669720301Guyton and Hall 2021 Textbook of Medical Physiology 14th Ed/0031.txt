through sodium channels in the nerve membrane to the from positive feedback. This figure depicts the pumping fiber’s interior. The sodium ions entering the fiber then effectiveness of the heart, showing the heart of a healthy change the membrane potential, which, in turn, causes human pumping about 5 liters of blood per minute. If the more opening of channels, more change of potential, still person suddenly bleeds a total of 2 liters, the amount of more opening of channels, and so forth. Thus, a slight leak blood in the body is decreased to such a low level that becomes an explosion of sodium entering the interior of not enough blood is available for the heart to pump effec- the nerve fiber, which creates the nerve action potential. tively. As a result, the arterial pressure falls, and the flow This action potential, in turn, causes electrical current to of blood to the heart muscle through the coronary ves- flow along the outside and inside of the fiber and initiates sels diminishes. This scenario results in weakening of the additional action potentials. This process continues until heart, further diminished pumping, a further decrease the nerve signal goes all the way to the
