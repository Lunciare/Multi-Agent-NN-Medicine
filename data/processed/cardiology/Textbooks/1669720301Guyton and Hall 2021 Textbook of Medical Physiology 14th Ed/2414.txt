simultaneous discharge called hyperpolarization. The neuron is inhibited because occurs by a process called summation, discussed in the the membrane potential is even more negative than the next sections. normal intracellular potential. Therefore, an increase in negativity beyond the normal resting membrane potential Generation of Action Potentials in the Initial Segment level is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). of the Axon Leaving the Neuron—Threshold for Excitation. When the EPSP rises high enough in the Figure 46- 10C shows the effect on the membrane potential caused by activation of inhibitory synapses, positive direction, there comes a point at which this rise allowing chloride influx into the cell and/or potas- initiates an action potential in the neuron. However, the sium efflux out of the cell, with the membrane potential action potential does not begin adjacent to the excita- decreasing from its normal value of −65 mV to the more tory synapses. Instead, it begins in the initial segment of negative value of −70 mV. This membrane potential is 5 the axon where the axon leaves the neuronal soma. The mV more negative than normal and is therefore an IPSP 581 UNIT IX UNIT IX The Nervous System: A. General Principles and
