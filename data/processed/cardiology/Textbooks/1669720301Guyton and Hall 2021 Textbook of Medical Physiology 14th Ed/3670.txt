For example, the protein of corn has stances vary in the average percentages that are absorbed inadequate amounts of tryptophan and lysine, two of the from the gastrointestinal tract: about 98% of carbohydrate, essential amino acids. Therefore, individuals who consume 95% of fat, and 92% of protein. Therefore, the average cornmeal as their principal source of protein sometimes physiologically available energy in each gram of these three develop the protein- deficiency syndrome called kwashior- foodstuffs is as follows: kor, which consists of failure to grow, lethargy, depressed Calories mentality, and edema caused by low plasma protein con- centration. On the other hand, food legumes, such as Carbohydrate 4 chick peas and beans, provide a relatively rich source of Fat 9 tryptophan and lysine but contain inadequate amounts of Protein 4 methionine, another essential amino acid. Therefore the 877 UNIT XIII Unit XIII Metabolism and Temperature Regulation Table 72- 1 Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrate Content of Different Foods Fuel Value per 100 Food Protein (%) Fat (%) Carbohydrate (%) Grams (Calories) Apples 0.3 0.4 14.9 64 Asparagus 2.2 0.2 3.9 26 Bacon, fat 6.2 76.0 0.7 712 Bacon, broiled 25.0 55.0 1.0 599 Beef (average) 17.5 22.0
