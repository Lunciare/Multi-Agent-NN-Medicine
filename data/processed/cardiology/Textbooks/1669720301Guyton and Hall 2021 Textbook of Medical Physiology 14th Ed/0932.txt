another powerful mechanism for controlling pressure, the renin- angiotensin system. Converting Renin is a protein enzyme released by the kidneys enzyme (lung) when the arterial pressure falls too low. In turn, it raises the arterial pressure in several ways, thus helping correct Angiotensin II the initial fall in pressure. Angiotensinase COMPONENTS OF THE RENIN- (Inactivated) ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM Renal retention Vasoconstriction of salt and water Figure 19- 9 shows the main functional steps whereby the renin- angiotensin system helps regulate arterial pressure. Renin is synthesized and stored in the juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells) of the kidneys. The JG cells are modified Increased arterial pressure smooth muscle cells located mainly in the walls of the afferent arterioles immediately proximal to the glomeruli. Figure 19- 9. The renin- angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism for Multiple factors control renin secretion, including the arterial pressure control. 236 Chapter 19 Role of the Kidneys in Long-T erm Control of Arterial Pressure and in Hypertension properties but not enough to cause significant changes in 100 With circulatory function. The renin persists in the blood for renin-angiotensin system 30 to 60 minutes and continues to cause formation of still 75 more angiotensin I during this entire time. Within a few
