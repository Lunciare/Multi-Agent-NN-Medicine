from the distal tubules and collecting tubules. With high ADH levels, rapidly from the cortical collecting tubule, and the urea the osmolarity of the urine is about the same as the osmolarity of the renal medullary interstitial fluid in the papilla, which is about 1200 concentration increases rapidly because urea is not very mOsm/L. (Numerical values are in milliosmoles per liter.) permeant in this part of the tubule. As the tubular fluid flows into the inner medullary col- lecting ducts, still more water reabsorption takes place, 140 mOsm/L (Figure 29-5). The early distal tubule fur- resulting in an even higher concentration of urea in the ther dilutes the tubular fluid because this segment, like fluid. This high concentration of urea in the tubular fluid the ascending loop of Henle, actively transports sodium of the inner medullary collecting duct causes urea to dif- chloride out of the tubule but is relatively impermeable fuse out of the tubule into the renal interstitial fluid. This to water. diffusion is greatly facilitated by specific urea transporters, As fluid flows into the cortical collecting tubule, the UT- A1 and UT- A3. These urea transporters are activated amount of water reabsorbed is critically dependent on the
