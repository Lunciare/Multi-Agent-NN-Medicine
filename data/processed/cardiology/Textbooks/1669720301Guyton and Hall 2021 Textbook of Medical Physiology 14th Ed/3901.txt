and β regulates spermatogenesis in the testis (112 amino acids) Luteinizing (LH) Glycoprotein of two subunits, Causes ovulation and formation of the corpus hormone α (89 amino acids) and β luteum in the ovary; stimulates production (115 amino acids) of estrogen and progesterone by the ovary; stimulates testosterone production by the testis Lactotropes- Prolactin (PRL) Single chain of 198 amino Stimulates milk secretion and production mammotropes acids Almost all the blood that enters these sinuses passes first through another capillary bed in the lower Hypothalamus hypothalamus. The blood then flows through small hypothalamic- hypophysial portal blood vessels into Optic chiasm the anterior pituitary sinuses. Figure 76-4 shows the lowermost portion of the hypothalamus, called the median eminence, which connects inferiorly with the Mammillary body pituitary stalk. The median eminence is the functional Median eminence link between the hypothalamus and the anterior pitu- Artery Primary capillary itary gland. Small arteries penetrate into the median plexus eminence and then additional small vessels return Hypothalamic- Anterior pituitary hypophysial to its surface, coalescing to form the hypothalamic- portal vessels hypophysial portal blood vessels. These vessels pass downward along the pituitary stalk to supply blood to Posterior pituitary the anterior pituitary sinuses. Vein Sinuses Hypothalamic
