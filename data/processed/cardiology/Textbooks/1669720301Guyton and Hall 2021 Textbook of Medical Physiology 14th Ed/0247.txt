Also, lar fluid, and the potential difference between the inside an equally small number of positive ions moving from and outside of the fiber is measured using an appropriate outside to inside the fiber can reverse the potential voltmeter. This voltmeter is a highly sophisticated elec- from −70 millivolts to as much as +35 millivolts within tronic apparatus that is capable of measuring small volt- as little as 1/10,000 of a second.
