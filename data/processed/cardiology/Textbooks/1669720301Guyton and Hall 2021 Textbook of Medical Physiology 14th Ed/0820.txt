nitric oxide (NO), a lipophilic The primary clinical use of the PDE-5 inhibitors is to treat gas that is released from endothelial cells in response to erectile dysfunction. Penile erection is caused by parasym- a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. Endothelial- pathetic nerve impulses through the pelvic nerves to the derived nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzymes synthesize penis, where the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and NO NO from arginine and oxygen and by reduction of inor- are released. By preventing the degradation of NO, the ganic nitrate. After diffusing out of the endothelial cell, PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the dilation of the blood vessels NO has a half-l ife in the blood of only about 6 seconds and in the penis and aid in erection, as discussed in Chapter 81. acts mainly in the local tissues, where it is released. NO activates soluble guanylate cyclases in vascular smooth Endothelin Is a Powerful Vasoconstrictor Released muscle cells (Figure 17- 6), resulting in the conversion of From Damaged Endothelium. Endothelial cells also re- cyclic guanosine triphosphate (cGTP) to cyclic guano- lease vasoconstrictor substances. The most important of sine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cGMP- these is endothelin, a large, 27–amino acid peptide that dependent
