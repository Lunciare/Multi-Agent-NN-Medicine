16th breath the diffusion of gases in water, as given in the preceding list. Figure 40- 2. Expiration of a gas from an alveolus with successive breaths. COMPOSITIONS OF ALVEOLAR AIR AND ATMOSPHERIC AIR ARE DIFFERENT the air dilutes the oxygen partial pressure at sea level from an average of 159 mm Hg in atmospheric air to 149 mm Alveolar air does not have the same concentrations of Hg in the humidified air, and it dilutes the nitrogen partial gases as atmospheric air (Table 40- 1). There are several pressure from 597 to 563 mm Hg. reasons for the differences. First, alveolar air is only par- Alveolar Air Is Slowly Renewed by tially replaced by atmospheric air with each breath.
