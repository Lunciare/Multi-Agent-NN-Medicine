For example, in Figure 47- 9, let us assume that six terminals must discharge almost simulta- neously to excite any one of the neurons. Note that input d fiber 1 has more than enough terminals to cause neuron a 2 to discharge. The stimulus from input fiber 1 to this neu- ron is said to be an excitatory stimulus; it is also called a suprathreshold stimulus because it is above the threshold required for excitation. Input fiber 1 also contributes terminals to neurons b and c, but not enough to cause excitation. Nevertheless, discharge of these terminals makes both these neurons more likely to be excited by
