this apparatus, two electrodes are in- nel at a time. For example, the sodium channels can be serted into the nerve fiber. One of these electrodes is used blocked by a toxin called tetrodotoxin when it is applied to to measure the voltage of the membrane potential, and the the outside of the cell membrane where the sodium acti- other is used to conduct electrical current into or out of the vation gates are located. Conversely, tetraethylammonium nerve fiber. ion blocks the potassium channels when it is applied to the This apparatus is used in the following way. The inves- interior of the nerve fiber. tigator decides which voltage to establish inside the nerve Figure 5- 9 shows typical changes in conductance of fiber. The electronic portion of the apparatus is then adjust- the voltage- gated sodium and potassium channels when ed to the desired voltage, automatically injecting either pos- the membrane potential is suddenly changed through use itive or negative electricity through the current electrode at of the voltage clamp, from −70 millivolts to +10 millivolts whatever rate is required to hold the voltage, as measured and then, 2 milliseconds later, back to −70 millivolts.
