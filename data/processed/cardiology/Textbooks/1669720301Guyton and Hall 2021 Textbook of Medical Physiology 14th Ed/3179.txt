Secretion of Acetylcholine and Norepinephrine by Postganglionic Nerve Endings. A few of the postgan- glionic autonomic nerve endings, especially those of the parasympathetic nerves, are similar to but much smaller than those of the skeletal neuromuscular junction. However, many of the parasympathetic nerve fibers and almost all the sympathetic fibers merely touch the effector cells of the or- gans that they innervate as they pass by, or in some cases, they terminate in connective tissue located adjacent to the cells that are to be stimulated. Where these filaments touch ACh or pass over or near the cells to be stimulated, they usually have bulbous enlargements called varicosities (see Figure 61- 4). It is in these varicosities that the transmitter vesicles of acetylcholine or norepinephrine are synthesized and stored. Also in the varicosities are large numbers of mitochondria ACh ACh that supply adenosine triphosphate, which is required to en- ergize acetylcholine or norepinephrine synthesis. When an action potential spreads over the terminal NE fibers, the depolarization process increases the perme- ACh NE ability of the fiber membrane to calcium ions, allowing these ions to diffuse into the nerve terminals or nerve var- icosities. The calcium ions in turn cause the terminals
