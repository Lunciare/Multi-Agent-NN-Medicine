For example, if an ob- vents the object of attention from leaving the foveal ject is moving up and down in a wavelike form at a rate of portion of the retina. The eyes normally have three several times per second, the eyes at first may be unable to types of continuous but almost imperceptible move- fixate on it. However, after a second or so, the eyes begin ments: (1) a continuous tremor at a rate of 30 to 80 cy- to jump by means of saccades in approximately the same cles/sec caused by successive contractions of the motor wavelike pattern of movement as that of the object. Then, units in the ocular muscles; (2) a slow drift of the eye- after another few seconds, the eyes develop progressively balls in one direction or another; and (3) sudden flick- smoother movements and finally follow the wave move- ing movements that are controlled by the involuntary ment almost exactly. This represents a high degree of au- fixation mechanism. tomatic subconscious computational
