their eyes are open, and all ments of the eyes and head. Also, placing pressure on the motions are performed slowly. However, when moving rap- upper anterior parts of their legs causes them to pull to idly or when the eyes are closed, equilibrium is immediately the sitting position. It is clear that many of the stereotyped lost. motor functions of the human being are integrated in the brain stem. Neuronal Connections of the Vestibular Apparatus With the Central Nervous System Figure 53- 13 shows the connections in the hindbrain of the vestibular nerve. Most of the vestibular nerve fibers terminate in the brain stem in the vestibular nuclei, which Dentate nucleus Fastigial are located approximately at the junction of the medulla nucleus Medial longitudinal and the pons. Some fibers pass directly to the brain stem fasciculus reticular nuclei without synapsing and also to the cerebellar fastigial, uvular, and flocculonodular lobe nuclei. The fibers Red nucleus that end in the brain stem vestibular nuclei synapse with second- order neurons that also send fibers into the cerebel- lum, the vestibulospinal tracts, the medial longitudinal fas- Reticular ciculus, and other areas of the brain stem, particularly the substance reticular nuclei.
