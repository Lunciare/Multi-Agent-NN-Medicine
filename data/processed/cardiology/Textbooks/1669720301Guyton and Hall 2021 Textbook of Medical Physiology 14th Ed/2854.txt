likely function of the Golgi tendon reflex is to equalize neuron inhibited contractile forces of the separate muscle fibers. That is, the fibers that exert excess tension become inhibited by the reflex, whereas those that exert too little tension be- Relaxation reponse come more excited because of the absence of reflex inhi- bition.
