These vesicles can then move slowly without having to pass through the clefts between through the endothelial cell. Some of these vesicles may the endothelial cells. coalesce to form vesicular channels all the way through the endothelial cell, as shown in Figure 16- 2. FLOW OF BLOOD IN THE CAPILLARIES—VASOMOTION Special Types of Pores in Capillaries of Certain Or- gans. The pores in capillaries of some organs have special Blood usually does not flow continuously through the characteristics to meet the specific needs of the organs. capillaries. Instead, it flows intermittently, turning on and Some of these characteristics are as follows: off every few seconds or minutes. The cause of this inter- 1.
