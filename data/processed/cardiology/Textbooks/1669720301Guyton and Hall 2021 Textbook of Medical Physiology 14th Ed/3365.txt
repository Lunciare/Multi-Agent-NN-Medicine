of 1000 ml in Table 65- 1. The net result of these transport processes is that under Saliva contains two major types of protein secretion: resting conditions, the concentrations of Na+ and Cl− in (1) a serous secretion that contains ptyalin (an α- amylase), saliva are only about 15 mEq/L each, about one-seventh which is an enzyme for digesting starches, and (2) mucus to one-tenth their concentrations in plasma. Conversely, 809 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology K+ concentration is about 30 mEq/L, seven times as great Superior and inferior salivatory nuclei as in plasma, and HCO 3− concentration is 50 to 70 mEq/L, Tractus Submandibular about two to three times that of plasma. solitarius gland Submandibular During maximal salivation, the salivary ionic concentra- ganglion tions change considerably because the formation rate of pri- mary secretion by the acini can increase as much as 20-f old.

Therefore, when copious quantities of saliva tympani Sublingual are being secreted, the sodium chloride concentration is gland about one-half or two-thirds that of plasma, and potassium concentration rises to only
