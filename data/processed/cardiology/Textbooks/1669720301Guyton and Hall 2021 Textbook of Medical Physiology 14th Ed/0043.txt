CELL STRUCTURE In addition to phospholipids and cholesterol, some cells contain large quantities of triglycerides, also called The cell contains highly organized physical structures neutral fats. In fat cells (adipocytes), triglycerides often called intracellular organelles, which are critical for cell account for as much as 95% of the cell mass. The fat stored function. For example, without one of the organelles, the in these cells represents the
