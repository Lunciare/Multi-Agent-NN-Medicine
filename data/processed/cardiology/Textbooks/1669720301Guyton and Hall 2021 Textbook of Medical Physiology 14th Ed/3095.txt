The SCN receives direct innervation from the retina via ies, which control at least partially the patterns of many the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to entrain its activity to day–night cycles. SCN neurons project to various brain centers, which contain feeding reflexes, such as licking the lips and swallowing. local circadian clocks that direct feeding–fasting, sleep–wakefulness, autonomic and neuroendocrine circadian rhythms. These systemic Hypothalamic Control of Endocrine Hormone Secre- cues synchronize local molecular clocks in peripheral tissues, and tion by the Anterior Pituitary Gland. Stimulation of these local clocks then direct circadian gene expression that regulates certain areas of the hypothalamus also causes the anterior physiological rhythms, including those related to mental alertness and cognition, cardiovascular regulation, metabolism, and renal function. pituitary gland to secrete its endocrine hormones. This subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 75 in relation to neural control of the endocrine glands. Briefly, the basic mechanisms are as follows. The anterior pituitary gland a “master clock,” with a pacemaker firing frequency that receives its blood supply mainly from blood that flows follows a circadian rhythm (Figure 59- 8). This pacemaker
