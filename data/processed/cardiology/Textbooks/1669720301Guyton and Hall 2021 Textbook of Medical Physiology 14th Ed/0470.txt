Heart muscle, like skeletal muscle, uses chemical energy to provide the work of contraction. Approximately 70% INTRINSIC REGULATION OF HEART to 90% of this energy is normally derived from oxidative PUMPING—THE FRANK- STARLING metabolism of fatty acids, with about 10% to 30% com- MECHANISM ing from other nutrients, especially glucose and lactate. Therefore, the rate of oxygen consumption by the heart In Chapter 20, we will learn that under most conditions, is an excellent measure of the chemical energy liberated the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute is while the heart performs its work. The different chemi- normally determined almost entirely by the rate of blood cal reactions that liberate this energy are discussed in flow into the heart from the veins, which is called venous Chapters 68 and 69. return.
