(Data from Metcalfe J, Moll W, Bartels H: Gas exchange across the placenta. Fed Proc 23:775, 1964.) Villus after it becomes oxygenated in the placenta is about 30 mm Hg. Therefore, the mean pressure gradient for diffu- Fetal capillaries sion of oxygen through the placental membrane is about 20 mm Hg. Intervillous space One might wonder how it is possible for a fetus to obtain sufficient oxygen when the fetal blood leaving the Chorionic epithelium placenta has a Po 2 of only 30 mm Hg. There are three rea- sons why even this low Po is capable of allowing the fetal 2 blood to transport almost as much oxygen to
