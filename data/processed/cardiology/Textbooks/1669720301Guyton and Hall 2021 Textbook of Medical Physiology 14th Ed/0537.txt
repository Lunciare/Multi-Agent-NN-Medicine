when the point where the right arm connects to the chest is electronegative with respect to the point where the left arm connects, the electrocardiograph records positively—that is, above the zero- voltage line in the III ECG. When the opposite is true, the electrocardiograph records below the line. Lead II. To record limb lead II, the negative terminal of Figure 11- 7. Normal electrocardiograms recorded from the three standard electrocardiographic leads (I–III). the electrocardiograph is connected to the right arm and the positive terminal is connected to the left leg. There- fore, when the right arm is negative with respect to the with respect to the average potential in the body, the left left leg, the electrocardiograph records positively. arm is +0.3 millivolts (positive), and the left leg is +1.0 millivolts (positive). Observing the meters in the figure, Lead III. To record limb lead III, the negative terminal of one can see that lead I records a positive potential of +0.5 the electrocardiograph is connected to the left arm, and millivolts because this is the difference between the −0.2 the positive terminal is connected to the left leg. This millivolts on the right arm and the +0.3 millivolts on the
