the activated enzyme adenylyl cyclase at the end that pro- lular receptor can activate a gene response only if the trudes to the interior of the cell. This cyclase catalyzes appropriate combination of gene regulatory proteins is the formation of cAMP, which has a multitude of effects present, and many of these regulatory proteins are tis- inside the cell to control cell activity, as discussed later. sue specific. Thus, the responses of different tissues to a cAMP is called a second messenger because it is not the hormone are determined not only by the specificity of hormone itself that directly institutes the intracellular the receptors but also by the expression of genes that the changes; instead, the cAMP serves as a second messenger receptor regulates. to cause these effects. SECOND MESSENGER MECHANISMS FOR For a few peptide hormones, such as atrial natriuretic MEDIATING INTRACELLULAR HORMONAL peptide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which is only FUNCTIONS slightly different from cAMP, serves in a similar manner as a second messenger. We noted earlier that one way that hormones exert intra- Intracellular Hormone Receptors and Activation of cellular actions is to stimulate formation of the second Genes.
