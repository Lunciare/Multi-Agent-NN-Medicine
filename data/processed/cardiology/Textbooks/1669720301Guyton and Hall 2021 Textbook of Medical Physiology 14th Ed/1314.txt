vascular structures supplying the juxtamedullary nephrons also differ from those supplying the cortical nephrons. For the cortical nephrons, the entire tubular Collecting duct system is surrounded by an extensive network of peritu- bular capillaries. For the juxtamedullary nephrons, long Figure 26- 3.
