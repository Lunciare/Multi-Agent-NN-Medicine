of Hemoglobin in the Cells. RBCs can con- tein in the circulatory fluids and is not enclosed in RBCs. centrate hemoglobin in the cell fluid up to about 34 When it is free in human plasma, about 3% of it leaks g/100 ml of cells. The concentration does not rise above through the capillary membrane into the tissue spaces or this value because this is the metabolic limit of the cell’s through the glomerular membrane of the kidney into the hemoglobin- forming mechanism. Furthermore, in nor- glomerular filtrate each time the blood passes through mal people, the percentage of hemoglobin is almost al- the capillaries. Therefore, hemoglobin must remain inside ways near the maximum in each cell. However, when RBCs to perform its functions in humans effectively. hemoglobin formation is deficient, the percentage of The RBCs have other functions besides transport of hemoglobin in the cells may fall considerably below this hemoglobin. For example, they contain a large quantity of value, and the volume of the RBC may also decrease be- carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that catalyzes the revers- cause of diminished hemoglobin to fill the cell. ible reaction between carbon dioxide (CO ) and water to When the hematocrit
