so the maximal concentrating from the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium, ability of the kidneys is also greatly reduced. In addition, thereby decreasing the osmolarity of the medullary inter- decreased renal medullary interstitial fluid osmolarity stitial fluid. Therefore, loop diuretics impair the ability of reduces reabsorption of water from the descending loop of Henle. Because of these multiple effects, 20% to 30% Diuretic therapy of the glomerular filtrate may be delivered into the urine, causing urine output, under acute conditions, to be as great as 25 times normal for at least a few minutes. 200 Excretion Thiazide Diuretics Inhibit Sodium- Chloride Reabsorption in the Early Distal Tubule 100 Intake The thiazide derivatives, such as chlorothiazide, act mainly on the early distal tubules to block the sodium- chloride co- transporter in the luminal membrane of the tubular cells (see Figure 28- 10). Under favorable condi- 15.0 tions, these agents may cause a maximum of 5% to 10% of the glomerular filtrate to pass into the urine, which is about the same amount of sodium normally reabsorbed 14.0 by the distal tubules.
