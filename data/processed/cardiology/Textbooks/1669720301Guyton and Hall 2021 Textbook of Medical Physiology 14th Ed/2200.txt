A small amount of CO also reacts in the same way The Haldane effect results from the simple fact that the 2 with the plasma proteins in tissue capillaries. This reac- combination of O with hemoglobin in the lungs causes 2 tion is much less significant for the transport of CO the hemoglobin to become a stronger acid. This displaces 2 because the quantity of these proteins in the blood is only CO from the blood and into the alveoli in two ways. First, 2 one-fourth as great as the quantity of hemoglobin. the more highly acidic hemoglobin has less tendency to The quantity of CO that can be carried from the combine with CO to form carbaminohemoglobin, thus 2 2 peripheral tissues to the lungs by carbamino combination displacing much of the CO that is present in the carb- 2 with hemoglobin and plasma proteins is about 30% of the amino form from the blood. Second, the increased
