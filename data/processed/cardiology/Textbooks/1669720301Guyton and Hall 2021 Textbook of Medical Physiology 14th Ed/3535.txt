Conversely, ADP (and AMP as tron transport chain (representing the ionization of two well) causes the opposite change in this enzyme, greatly in- hydrogen atoms), up to three ATP molecules are synthe- creasing its activity. Whenever ATP is used by the tissues sized. for energizing a major fraction of almost all intracellular chemical reactions, this action reduces the ATP inhibition Summary of ATP Formation During the Breakdown of the enzyme phosphofructokinase and at the same time of Glucose increases its activity as a result of the excess ADP formed. We can now determine the total number of ATP molecules Thus, the glycolytic process is set in motion, and the total that, under optimal conditions, can be formed by the en- cellular store of ATP is replenished. ergy from one molecule of glucose. Another control linkage is the citrate ion formed in the citric acid cycle. An excess of this ion also strongly inhibits 1. During glycolysis, 4 molecules of ATP are formed and phosphofructokinase, thus preventing the glycolytic process 2 are expended to cause the initial phosphorylation of from getting ahead of the citric acid cycle’s ability to use the glucose to get the process going, giving a net
