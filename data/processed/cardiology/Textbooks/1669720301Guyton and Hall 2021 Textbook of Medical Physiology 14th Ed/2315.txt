The red blood cell mass becomes so great that the effect of centrifugal acceleration is on the circulatory sys- blood viscosity increases severalfold. This increased tem because blood is mobile and can be translocated by viscosity tends to decrease tissue blood flow so that centrifugal forces. O delivery also begins to decrease.
