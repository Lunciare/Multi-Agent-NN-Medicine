importance of TNAP in bone min- Osteoblasts Fibrous periosteum eralization is illustrated by the finding that mice with genetic deficiency of TNAP, which causes pyrophosphate levels to rise too high, are born with soft bones that are not adequately calcified. The osteoblast also secretes at least two other sub- stances that regulate bone calcification: (1) nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1), which pro- duces pyrophosphate outside the cells, and (2) ankylosis protein (ANK), which contributes to the extracellular pool Osteoclasts Vein of pyrophosphate by transporting it from the interior to the surface of the cell. Deficiencies of NPP1 or ANK cause decreased extracellular pyrophosphate and excessive cal- cification of bone, such as bone spurs, or even calcifica- Bone tion of other tissues such as tendons and ligaments of the spine, which occurs in people with a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis.
