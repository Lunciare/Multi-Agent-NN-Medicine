several hours after a Gallbladder Hepatic duct meal. This increase in secretion consists almost entirely of secretion of a sodium bicarbonate–rich watery solution by Stones Course followed by bile: the epithelial cells of the bile ductules and ducts and does Cystic duct 1. During rest 2. During digestion not represent increased secretion by the liver parenchymal cells. The bicarbonate in turn passes into the small intestine Common bile duct and joins the bicarbonate from the pancreas in neutralizing the hydrochloric acid from the stomach. Thus, the secretin feedback mechanism for neutralizing duodenal acid oper- Papilla of Vater Pancreatic duct ates not only through its effects on pancreatic secretion but also to a lesser extent through its effect on secretion by the Sphincter of Oddi liver ductules and ducts. Duodenum Liver Secretion of Cholesterol and Gallstone Formation Figure 65- 12. Formation of gallstones. Bile salts are formed in the hepatic cells from cholesterol in the blood plasma. In the process of secreting bile salts, stomach and the papilla of Vater, where pancreatic secretion about 1 to 2 grams of cholesterol are removed from the and bile empty into the duodenum. These glands secrete blood plasma and secreted into the bile each
