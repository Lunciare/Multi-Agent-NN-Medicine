Glucose-6-phosphate Under resting conditions, the phosphorylase is in an inactive form, and thus glycogen remains stored. When Fructose-6-phosphate it is necessary to re- form glucose from glycogen, the ATP ADP phosphorylase must first be activated. This activation can be accomplished in several ways, including activa- Fructose-1,6-diphosphate tion by epinephrine or by glucagon, as described in the next section. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate Activation of Phosphorylase by Epinephrine or by Glucagon. Two hormones, epinephrine and glucagon, can 2 (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) activate phosphorylase and thereby cause rapid glycogenoly- 4H sis. The initial effect of each of these hormones is to promote 2 (1,3-Diphosphoglyceric acid) formation of cyclic AMP in the cells, which
