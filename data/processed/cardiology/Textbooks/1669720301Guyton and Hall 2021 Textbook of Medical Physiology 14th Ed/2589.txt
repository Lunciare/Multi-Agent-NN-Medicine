The Special Senses A Light from distant source Figure 50-3 . Bending of light rays at each surface of a concave spherical lens showing that parallel light rays are diverged. B the rays. Half the bending occurs when the rays enter the lens, and half occurs as the rays exit from the opposite side. If the lens has exactly the proper curvature, parallel light rays passing through each part of the lens will be bent ex- actly enough so that all the rays will pass through a single point, called the focal point. Concave Lens Diverges Light Rays. Figure 50- 3 shows the effect of a concave lens on parallel light rays. The rays that enter the center of the lens strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam and, therefore, do not refract. The rays at the edge of the lens enter the lens ahead of the rays in the center. This effect is opposite to the effect in Figure 50- 4. A, Point focus of parallel
