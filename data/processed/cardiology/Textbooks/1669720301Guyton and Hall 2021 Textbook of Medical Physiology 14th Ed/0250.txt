Transport of Sodium and Potassium Ions + – – + Through the Membrane—the Sodium-P otassium Na+ Na+ pump – + (Na+- K+) Pump. Recall from Chapter 4 that all cell mem- + – – + branes of the body have a powerful Na+- K+ pump that 142 mEq/L + – 14 mEq/L – + + – – + continually transports sodium ions to the outside of the + – – + cell and potassium ions to the inside, as illustrated on the – + Diffusion left side in Figure 5- 4. Note that this is an electrogenic – + pump because three Na+ ions are pumped to the outside K+ + – K+ – + for each two K+ ions to the inside, leaving a net deficit of pump – + + – – + positive ions on the inside and causing a negative poten- 4 mEq/L + – 140 mEq/L – + tial inside the cell membrane. + – – + The Na+- K+ pump also causes large concentration gra- + – (–90 mV) – + dients for sodium and potassium across the resting nerve + – – + (Anions)– + – (Anions)– – + membrane. These gradients are
