For this reason, the arter- 7% ies have strong vascular walls, and blood flows at a high velocity in the arteries. The arterioles are the last small branches of the arterial system; they act as control conduits through which blood is Veins, venules, and released into the capillaries. Arterioles have strong muscular venous sinuses walls that can close the arterioles completely or, by relax- 64% ing, can dilate the vessels severalfold; thus, the arterioles can Figure 14-1.
