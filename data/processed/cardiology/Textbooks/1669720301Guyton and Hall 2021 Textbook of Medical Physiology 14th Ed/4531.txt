Figure 85- 4 The effect of diet on the rate of muscle glycogen re- plenishment after prolonged exercise. (Modified from Fox EL: Sports Figure 85- 5 The effect of duration of exercise, as well as type of diet, Physiology. Philadelphia: Saunders College Publishing, 1979.) on relative percentages of carbohydrate or fat used for energy by muscles. (Data from Fox EL: Sports Physiology. Philadelphia: Saunders College Publishing, 1979.) is removed. The early portion of the oxygen debt is called the alactacid oxygen debt and amounts to about 3.5 liters. Not all the energy from carbohydrates comes from the The latter portion is called the lactic acid oxygen debt and stored muscle glycogen. In fact, almost as much glycogen is amounts to about 8 liters. Recovery of Muscle Glycogen. Recovery from exhaus- stored in the liver as in the muscles, and this glycogen can be released into the blood in the form of glucose and then tive muscle glycogen depletion is not a simple matter. This taken up by the muscles as an energy source. In addition, process often requires days, rather than the seconds, min- glucose solutions given to an athlete to drink during the utes, or hours required for recovery
