Genesis of normal red blood cells (RBCs) and characteristics of RBCs in different types of anemias. At least four major growth inducers have been described, The first- generation cells are called basophil erythroblasts each having different characteristics. One of these, because they stain with basic dyes. Hemoglobin first interleukin- 3, promotes growth and reproduction of appears in polychromatophil erythroblasts.
