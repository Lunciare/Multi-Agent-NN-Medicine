Therefore, the sodium channels in these A Positive-F eedback Cycle Opens the Sodium Chan- new areas immediately open, as shown in Figure 5- 11C nels. As long as the membrane of the nerve fiber remains and D, and the explosive action potential spreads. These undisturbed, no action potential occurs in the normal newly depolarized areas produce still more local circuits of nerve. However, if any event causes enough initial rise in current flow farther along the membrane, causing progres- the membrane potential from −70 millivolts toward the sively more and more depolarization. Thus, the depolariza- zero level, the rising voltage will cause many voltage-g ated tion process travels along the entire length of the fiber. This sodium channels to begin opening. This occurrence allows transmission of the depolarization process along a nerve or for the rapid inflow of sodium ions, which causes a further muscle fiber is called a nerve or muscle impulse. 71 UNIT II UNIT II Membrane Physiology, Nerve, and Muscle Direction of Propagation.
