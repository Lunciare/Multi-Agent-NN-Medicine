The mucus is secreted partly by individual amount of resistance to airflow occurs not in the tiny air mucous goblet cells in the epithelial lining of the passages and passages of the terminal bronchioles but in some of the partly by small submucosal glands. In addition to keeping the larger bronchioles and bronchi near the trachea. The rea- surfaces moist, the mucus traps small particles out of the in- son for this high resistance is that there are relatively few of spired air and keeps most of these particles from ever reach- these larger bronchi in comparison with the approximately ing the alveoli. The mucus is removed from the passages in 65,000 parallel terminal bronchioles, through each of which the following manner. only a minute amount of air must pass. The entire surface of the respiratory passages, in the nose In some disease conditions, the smaller bronchioles play and the lower passages, down as far as the terminal bronchi- a far greater role in determining airflow resistance because oles, is lined with ciliated epithelium, with about 200 cilia on of their small size and because they are
