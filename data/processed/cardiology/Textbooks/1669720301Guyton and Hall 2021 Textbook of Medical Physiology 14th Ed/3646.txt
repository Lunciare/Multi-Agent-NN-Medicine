In liver diseases associated Although most cells of the body metabolize fat, certain with fibrosis, inflammation, or viral infections, however, aspects of fat metabolism occur mainly in the liver. In fat the regenerative process of the liver is severely impaired metabolism, the liver performs the following specific func- and
