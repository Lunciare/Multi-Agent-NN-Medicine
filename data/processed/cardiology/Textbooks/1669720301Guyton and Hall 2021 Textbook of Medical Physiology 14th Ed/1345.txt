electrical charge affects the membrane filtration of different molecular weight dextrans by the glomerulus. Dextrans are polysaccharides that can be Endothelium manufactured as neutral molecules or with negative B Fenestrations or positive charges. Note that for any given molecular radius, positively charged molecules are filtered much Figure 27- 2. A, Basic ultrastructure of the glomerular capillaries.

Neu- components: capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and epi- tral dextrans are also filtered more readily than nega- thelium (podocytes). tively charged dextrans of equal molecular weight.
