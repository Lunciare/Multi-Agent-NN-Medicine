on extracellular fluid sorption and decreased sodium excretion by the kidneys volume or blood volume as long as heart failure or kidney are transient. After 1 to 3 days of sodium and water reten- failure does not occur. The reason for this phenomenon is tion, the extracellular fluid volume rises by about 10% to that with large increases in Ang II levels, as occurs with a 15%, and there is a simultaneous increase in arterial blood renin- secreting tumor of the kidney, the high Ang II levels pressure. When the arterial pressure rises sufficiently, the initially cause sodium and water retention by the kidneys kidneys “escape” from the sodium and water retention and and a small increase in extracellular fluid volume. This also thereafter excrete amounts of sodium equal to the daily in- initiates a rise in arterial pressure that quickly increases take, despite the continued presence of high levels of aldos- kidney output of sodium and water, thereby overcoming terone. The primary reason for this escape is the pressure the sodium- and water- retaining effects of the Ang II and natriuresis and diuresis that occur when the arterial pres- re- establishing a balance between the intake and output of
