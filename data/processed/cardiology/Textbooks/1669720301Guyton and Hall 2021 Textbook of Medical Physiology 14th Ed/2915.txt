Directional Sensitivity of the Hair Cells—Kinocilium. Each hair cell has about 100 small cilia called stereocilia, plus one large cilium, the kinocilium, as shown in Figure Figure 56- 10.

The kinocilium is always located to one side, and apses with the vestibular nerve. the stereocilia become progressively shorter toward the other side of the cell.

Therefore, as the Because of these attachments, when the stereocilia orientation of the head in space changes and the weight bend in the direction of the kinocilium, the filamentous of the statoconia bends the cilia, appropriate signals are attachments tug in
