The thick part of the the urine in these circumstances is due to high concentra- ascending loop of Henle is also virtually impermeable to tions of other solutes, especially of waste products such water, but large amounts of sodium, chloride, potassium, as urea.

Therefore, fluid in the in Chapter 30, a low sodium intake stimulates formation thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle becomes very of the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone, which dilute, falling to a concentration of about 140 mOsm/L. together cause avid sodium reabsorption from the tubules while leaving the urea and other solutes to maintain the Early Distal Tubule. The early distal tubule has properties highly concentrated urine. similar to those of the thick ascending loop of Henle, so Second, large quantities of dilute urine can be excreted further
