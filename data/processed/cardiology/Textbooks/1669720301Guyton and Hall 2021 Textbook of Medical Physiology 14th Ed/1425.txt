as a result of the slight positive charge of ATP KK++ HH++ the tubular lumen relative to the interstitial fluid. Although the NKCC2 co- transporter moves equal amounts of cat- NNaa++ ions and anions into the cell, there is a slight backleak of CCll−− KK++ 22CCll–– − potassium ions into the lumen, creating a positive charge KK++ of about +8 millivolts in the tubular lumen. This positive charge forces cations such as Mg2+ and Ca2+ to diffuse from the tubular lumen through the paracellular space and into the interstitial fluid. The thick segment of the ascending loop of Henle is vir- Loop diuretics tually impermeable to water. Therefore, most of the water • Furosemide delivered to this segment remains in the tubule, despite • Ethacrynic acid • Bumetanide reabsorption of large amounts of solute. The tubular fluid in the ascending limb becomes very dilute as it flows toward Figure 28- 9 Mechanisms of sodium, chloride, and potassium trans- the distal tubule, a feature that is important in allowing the port in the thick ascending loop of Henle.
