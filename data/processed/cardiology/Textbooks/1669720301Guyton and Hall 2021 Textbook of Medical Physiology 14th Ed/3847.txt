as most other pro- teins (Figure 75- 2). They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins that are not biologically active (preprohor- Parathyroid glands (behind thyroid gland) Thyroid gland mones) and are cleaved to form smaller prohormones in the endoplasmic reticulum. These prohormones are then Thymus gland transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packaging into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. The vesicles are stored within the cytoplasm, and many are bound to the cell membrane until their secretion is needed. Secretion of the hormones (as well as the inactive fragments) occurs when the secretory vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and the granular contents are extruded into the interstitial Stomach fluid or directly into the blood stream by exocytosis. Adrenal In many cases, the stimulus for exocytosis is increased glands cytosolic calcium concentration caused by depolarization Pancreas of the plasma membrane. In other cases, stimulation of Kidney an endocrine cell surface receptor causes increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequently Adipose tissue activation of protein kinases that initiate secretion of the hormone. The peptide hormones are water soluble, allow- Small intestine ing them to
