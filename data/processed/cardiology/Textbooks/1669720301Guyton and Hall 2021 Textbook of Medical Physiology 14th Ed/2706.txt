rap- with each other. In turn, the deciphered information is idly conducted signals from the M retinal ganglion cells used to adjust the directional gaze of the separate eyes so terminate in layer IVcα, and from there they are relayed that they will fuse with each other (i.e., be brought into vertically, both outward toward the cortical surface and “register”). The information observed about degree of inward toward deeper levels. register of images from the two eyes also allows a person The visual signals from the medium- sized optic nerve to distinguish the distance of objects by the mechanism fibers, derived from the P ganglion cells in the retina, also of stereopsis. 655 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses Two Major Pathways for Analysis of Visual Informa- tion: (1) The Fast “Position” and “Motion” Pathway and (2) the Accurate Color Pathway. Figure 52- 3 shows that after leaving the primary visual cortex, the visual information is analyzed in two major pathways in the secondary visual areas. 1. Analysis of Third-D imensional Position, Gross Form, and Motion of Objects. One of the analytical pathways, demonstrated in Figure 52- 3 by the black Retinal image Cortical stimulation
