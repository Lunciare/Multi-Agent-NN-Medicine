mucosa about threefold. These folds extend circularly most of the way around the intestine and are especially well developed in the duodenum and jeju- num, where they often protrude up to 8 millimeters into the lumen. Also located on the epithelial surface of the small intes- Valvulae conniventes tine all the way down to the ileocecal valve are millions of small villi. These villi project about 1 millimeter from the surface of the mucosa, as shown on the surfaces of the valvulae conniventes in Figure 66- 5 and in individual detail in Figure 66- 6. The villi lie so close to one another Figure 66- 5.
