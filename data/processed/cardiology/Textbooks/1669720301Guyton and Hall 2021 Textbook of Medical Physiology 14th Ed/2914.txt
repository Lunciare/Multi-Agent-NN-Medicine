for Detecting Orientation of the Head With Re- spect to Gravity. Located on the inside surface of each utricle and saccule, shown in the top diagram of Figure 56- 9, is a small sensory area slightly greater than 2 mil- limeters in diameter called a macula. The macula of the utricle lies mainly in the horizontal plane on the inferior surface of the utricle and plays an important role in deter- mining orientation of the head when the head is upright. Conversely, the macula of the saccule is located mainly in a vertical plane and signals head orientation when the person is lying down. Each macula is covered by a gelatinous layer in which many small calcium carbonate crystals called statoconia are embedded. Also in the macula are thousands of hair cells, one of which is shown in Figure 56- 10; these hair cells project cilia up into the gelatinous layer. The bases and sides of the hair cells synapse with sensory endings of the vestibular nerve. The calcified statoconia have a specific gravity two to three times the specific gravity of the surrounding fluid and tissues. The weight of the statoconia bends the cilia in Nerve fiber the direction
