Most of the extra energy required during these bursts of energy in the phosphocreatine is transferred rapidly back activity cannot come from the oxidative processes because to ATP and then to the functional systems of the cells. This they are too slow to respond. Instead, the extra energy reversible interrelation between ATP and phosphocreatine comes from anaerobic sources: (1) ATP already present in is demonstrated by the following equation: the muscle cells, (2) phosphocreatine in the cells, and (3) anaerobic energy released by glycolytic breakdown of gly- Phosphocreatine + ADP cogen to lactic acid.
