If the muscles are not used again and again, as needed. exercised after a meal and yet glucose is transported into 2. The cell membrane becomes more permeable to the muscle cells in abundance, instead of being used for many of the amino acids, potassium ions, and phos- energy, most of the glucose is stored in the form of mus- phate ions, causing increased transport of these cle glycogen, up to a limit of 2% to 3% concentration.
