the ganglion cells that the long inhibited. The reason for this is that signals transmitted fibers of the optic nerve lead into the brain. Because of the directly from the photoreceptors through depolarizing distance involved, the electrotonic method of conduction bipolar cells are excitatory, whereas the signals transmitted employed in the rods, cones, and bipolar cells in the retina laterally through hyperpolarizing bipolar cells, as well as is no longer appropriate; therefore, ganglion cells trans- through horizontal cells, are mainly inhibitory. Thus, the mit their signals by means of repetitive action potentials direct excitatory signal through one pathway is likely to instead. Furthermore, even when unstimulated, they still be neutralized by inhibitory signals through lateral path- transmit continuous impulses at rates varying between 5 ways. One circuit for this process is demonstrated in Fig- and 40 per second.
