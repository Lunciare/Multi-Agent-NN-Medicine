General Principles and Sensory Physiology Problem HIGHER BRAIN OR CORTICAL LEVEL After the preceding account of the many nervous system Input Output Answer functions that occur at the cord and lower brain levels, one may ask, “what is left for the cerebral cortex to do?” The answer to this question is complex, but it begins with Procedure Initial Result of the fact that the cerebral cortex is an extremely large for solution data operations Information memory storehouse. The cortex never functions alone storage but always in association with lower centers of the ner- vous system. Central Computational Without the cerebral cortex, the functions of the lower processing unit unit brain centers are often imprecise. The vast storehouse of cortical information usually converts these functions to Figure 46-4 .

Finally, the cerebral cortex is essential for most of our thought processes, but it cannot function by itself. In fact, CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SYNAPSES it is the lower brain
