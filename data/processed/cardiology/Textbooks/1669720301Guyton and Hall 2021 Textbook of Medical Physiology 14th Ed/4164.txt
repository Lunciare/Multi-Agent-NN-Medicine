(1.2 mmol/L) (1.0 mmol/L) Approximately 85% of the body's phosphate is stored in bones, 14% to 15% is in the cells, and less than 1% is in the extracellular fluid. Although extracellular fluid phos- phate concentration is not nearly as well regulated as cal- cium concentration, phosphate serves several important Figure 80- 1.
