words to be used; and then (2) motor control of vocalization and the actual act of vocaliza- tion itself. The formation of thoughts and even most choices of words are the function of sensory association areas of the brain. Again, it is Wernicke’s area in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus that is most important for this ability. There- fore, a person with either Wernicke’s aphasia or global aphasia is unable to formulate the thoughts that are to be communi- cated. Or, if the lesion is less severe, the person may be able to Broca’s area Wernicke’s area formulate the thoughts but unable to put together appropriate Primary auditory area sequences of words to express the thought. The person some- times is even fluent with words, but the words are jumbled. Motor cortex Loss of Broca’s Area Causes Motor Aphasia. Sometimes SPEAKING A WRITTEN WORD a person is capable of deciding what he or she wants to say but cannot make the vocal system emit words instead of noises. This effect, called motor aphasia, results from dam- age to Broca’s speech area, which lies in the prefrontal and premotor facial regions of the cerebral cortex—about 95% of the
