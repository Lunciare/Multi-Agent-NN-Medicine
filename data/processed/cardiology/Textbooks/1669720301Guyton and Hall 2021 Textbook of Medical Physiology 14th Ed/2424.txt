Most dendrites E I I fail to transmit action potentials because their mem- branes have relatively few voltage- gated sodium channels, and their thresholds for excitation are too high for action potentials to occur. Yet, they do transmit electrotonic cur- rent down the dendrites to the soma. Transmission of electrotonic current means direct spread of electrical cur- Figure 46- 12. Stimulation of a neuron by presynaptic terminals lo- cated on dendrites, showing especially decremental conduction of rent by ion conduction in the fluids of the dendrites but excitatory (E) electrotonic potentials in the two dendrites to the left without the generation of action potentials.
