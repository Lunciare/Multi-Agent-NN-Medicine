signal is allowed to pass to the cortex. The nucleus receives gating control signals from two major sources: (1) corticofugal fibers returning in a backward direction from the pri- Secondary mary visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus; and visual areas (2) reticular areas of the mesencephalon. Both of these sources are inhibitory and, when stimulated, can turn off Calcarine fissure transmission through selected portions of the dorsal lat- eral geniculate nucleus. Both of these gating circuits help highlight the visual information that is allowed to pass. Primary Finally, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is divided visual cortex in another way: 1. Layers I and II are called magnocellular layers be- 90° 60° 20° Macula cause they contain large neurons. These neurons re- ceive their input almost entirely from the large type Figure 52- 2.
