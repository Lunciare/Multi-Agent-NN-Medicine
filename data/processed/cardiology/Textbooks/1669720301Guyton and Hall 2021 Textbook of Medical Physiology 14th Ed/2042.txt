This collapse creates positive pressure in the alveoli, attempting to push the air out. The amount of extreme. When near these limits, the compliance of the pressure generated in this way in an alveolus can be calcu- combined lung- thorax system can be less than 20% of lated from the following formula: that of the lungs alone. 2×Surfacetension Pressure = Work of Breathing Radiusofalveolus For the average- sized alveolus with a radius of about We have already pointed out that during normal quiet 100 micrometers and lined with normal surfactant, this breathing, all respiratory muscle contraction occurs during calculates to be about 4 cm H O pressure (3 mm Hg). If the inspiration; expiration is almost entirely a passive process 2 alveoli were lined with pure water without any surfactant, caused by elastic recoil of the lungs and chest cage. Thus, the pressure would be calculated as about 18 cm H O pres- under resting conditions, the respiratory muscles normally 2 sure—4.5 times as great. Thus, one sees
