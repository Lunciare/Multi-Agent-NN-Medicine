extrahepatic tissues, as discussed later, but this is prob- muscle, it also promotes mobilization of fatty acids from 963 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction adipose tissue. This mobilization increases the concentra- 45 tion of free fatty acids in the plasma, which also increases 40 their utilization for energy. Cortisol also seems to have a 35 30 direct effect to enhance the oxidation of fatty acids in the 25 cells. 20 The mechanism by which cortisol promotes fatty acid 15 mobilization is not completely understood. However, part 10 5 of the effect probably results from diminished transport of 55 glucose into the fat cells. Recall that α- glycerophosphate, 50 which is derived from glucose, is required for both depo- 45 40 sition and maintenance of triglycerides in these cells. In 35 its absence, the fat cells begin to release fatty acids. 30 The increased mobilization of fats by cortisol, com- 25 bined with increased oxidation of fatty acids in the cells, 20 15 helps shift the metabolic systems of the cells from utiliza- 10 tion of glucose for energy to utilization of fatty acids in 5 times of starvation or other stresses. This cortisol mecha- –0 nism, however, requires
