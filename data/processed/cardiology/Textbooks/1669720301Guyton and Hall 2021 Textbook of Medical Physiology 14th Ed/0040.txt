Cells also contain the body’s hereditary code, the cytoskeletons of cellular organelles such as cilia, nerve which controls the substances synthesized by the cells axons, the mitotic spindles of cells undergoing mitosis, and permits them to make copies of themselves. and a tangled mass of thin filamentous tubules that hold the parts of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm together in ORGANIZATION OF THE CELL their respective compartments.
