The higher waves, shown in Figure 63-3 , are not action potentials. the slow wave potential rises, the greater the frequency Instead, they are slow, undulating changes in the rest- of the spike potentials, usually ranging between 1 and 10 ing membrane potential. Their intensity usually varies spikes per second. The spike potentials last 10 to 40 times between 5 and 15 millivolts, and their frequency ranges as long in gastrointestinal muscle as the action potentials in different parts of the human gastrointestinal tract in large nerve fibers, with each gastrointestinal spike last- from 3 to 12/min—about 3 in the body of the stomach, ing as long as 10 to 20 milliseconds. as much as 12 in the duodenum, and about 8 or 9 in the Another important difference between the action terminal ileum.
