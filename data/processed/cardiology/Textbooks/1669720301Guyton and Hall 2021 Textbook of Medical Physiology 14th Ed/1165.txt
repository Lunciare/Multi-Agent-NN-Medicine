This increased volume ventricle to adapt to increasing loads prevents significant results from the following: (1) an initial slight decrease in abnormalities in circulatory function in the person dur- arterial pressure; (2) nervous reflexes and hormonal chang- ing rest, other than the increased work output required es induced by the decrease in pressure.
