remainder of the depolarization process, current also continues to flow in this same direc- Figure 11- 6 shows electrical connections between the tion, whereas depolarization spreads from the endocardial patient’s limbs and the electrocardiograph for recording 138 Chapter 11 Fundamentals of Electrocardiography ECGs from the so-c alled standard bipolar limb leads. The term bipolar means that the ECG is recorded from two electrodes located on different sides of the heart—in this I case, on the limbs. Thus, a lead is not a single wire con- necting from the body but a combination of two wires and their electrodes to make a complete circuit between the body and the electrocardiograph. The electrocardiograph in each case is represented by an electrical meter in the diagram, although the actual electrocardiograph is a high- speed, computer- based system with an electronic display. II Lead I. In recording limb lead I, the negative terminal of the electrocardiograph is connected to the right arm, and the positive terminal is connected to the left arm. There- fore, when the point where the right arm connects to the chest is electronegative with respect to the point where the left arm connects, the electrocardiograph records positively—that is, above the
