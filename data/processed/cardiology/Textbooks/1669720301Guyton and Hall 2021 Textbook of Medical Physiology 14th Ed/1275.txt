With chronic hyponatremia, the and severe symptoms usually occur only with rapid and brain swelling is attenuated by transport of solutes from the cells. large increases in the plasma sodium concentration above 158 to 160 mmol/L. Hypernatremia usually promotes intense thirst and stimulates secretion of ADH, which cells and may lead to osmotic injury of the neurons that is both protect against a large increase in plasma and extra- associated with demyelination, a loss of the myelin sheath cellular fluid sodium, as discussed in Chapter 29.

This osmosis-m ediated demyelination of ever, severe hypernatremia can occur in patients with neurons can be avoided by limiting the correction of hypothalamic lesions that impair their sense of thirst, in chronic hyponatremia to less than 10 to 12 mmol/L in infants who may not have ready access to water, in older 24 hours and to less than 18 mmol/L in 48 hours. This patients with altered mental status, or in persons with slow rate of correction permits the brain to recover the diabetes insipidus. osmoles
