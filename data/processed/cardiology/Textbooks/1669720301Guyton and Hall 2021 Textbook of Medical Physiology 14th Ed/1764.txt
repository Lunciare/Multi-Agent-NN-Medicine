In general, CKD, like AKI, can occur because of This progressive injury may be related in part to increased disorders of the blood vessels, glomeruli, tubules, renal pressure or stretch of the remaining glomeruli, which occurs interstitium, and lower urinary tract. Despite the wide as a result of functional vasodilation of afferent arterioles or variety of diseases that can lead to CKD, the end result is increased blood pressure. The chronic increase in pressure essentially the same—a decrease in the number of func- and stretch of the small arterioles and glomeruli are believed tional nephrons. to cause injury and sclerosis of these vessels (replacement of VICIOUS CYCLE OF CHRONIC KIDNEY normal tissue with connective tissue). These sclerotic lesions DISEASE LEADING TO END-S TAGE RENAL can eventually obliterate the glomerulus, leading to further DISEASE reduction in kidney function, further adaptive changes in the remaining nephrons, and a slowly progressing vicious cycle In some cases, an initial insult to the kidney leads to that eventually terminates in ESRD (Figure 32- 2).
