Figure 29-13. Effect of large changes in sodium intake on extracel- Salt appetite is due in part to the fact that animals and lular fluid sodium concentration in dogs under normal conditions (red humans like salt and eat it, regardless of whether they are line) and after the aldosterone feedback system was blocked (blue salt-d eficient. Salt appetite also has a regulatory component line). Note that the sodium concentration was maintained relatively in which there is a behavioral drive to obtain salt when a constant over this wide range of sodium intakes, with or without sodium deficiency exists in the body. This behavioral drive aldosterone feedback control. (Courtesy Dr. David B. Young.) is particularly important in herbivores, which naturally eat a low- sodium diet, but salt craving may also be important in There are two primary reasons why changes in an- humans, especially in those who have an extreme deficiency giotensin II and aldosterone do not have a major effect of sodium, such as occurs in Addison disease. In this case, on plasma sodium concentration. First, as discussed there is a deficiency of aldosterone secretion, which causes earlier, angiotensin II and aldosterone increase both excessive loss of sodium in the
