Likewise, with a low sodium intake, chloride to about 65 to 100 mmol/day (corresponding to there is little change in potassium excretion because of 1.5–2.3 g/day of sodium or 3.8–5.8 g/day sodium chloride) the counterbalancing effects of increased aldosterone while increasing potassium intake to 120 mmol/day (4.7 g/ secretion and decreased tubular flow rate on potassium day) for healthy adults. secretion. 389 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys REGULATION OF RENAL CALCIUM [Ca2+] EXCRETION AND EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM ION CONCENTRATION The mechanisms for regulating calcium ion concentration Vitamin D 3 PTH are discussed in detail in Chapter 80, along with the endo- activation crinology of the calcium-r egulating hormones, parathy- roid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin.
