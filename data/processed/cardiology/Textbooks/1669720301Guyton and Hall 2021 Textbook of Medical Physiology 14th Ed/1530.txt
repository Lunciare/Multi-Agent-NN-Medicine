osmo- osm large decreases in body fluid water do not occur. The primary larity is 300 mOsm/L, urine osmolarity is 600 mOsm/L, and abnormality observed clinically in people with this condition urine flow rate is 1 ml/min (0.001 L/min), the rate of osmolar is the large volume of dilute urine. However, if water intake is excretion is 0.6 mOsm/min (600 mOsm/L × 0.001 L/min), and restricted, as can occur in a hospital setting when fluid intake osmolar clearance is 0.6 mOsm/min divided by 300 mOsm/L, is restricted or the patient is unconscious (e.g., because of a or 0.002 L/min (2.0 ml/min).
