derived from the other eye, representing corresponding points on Visual Superior cortex colliculus the two retinas. However, the signals from the two eyes are kept apart in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This nucleus is composed of six nuclear layers. Layers II, III, and V (from ventral to dorsal) receive signals from the lat- eral half of the ipsilateral retina, whereas layers I, IV, and VI receive signals from the medial half of the retina of the Right eye opposite eye. The respective retinal areas of the two eyes connect with neurons that are superimposed over one Figure 52- 1. Principal visual pathways from the eyes to the visual another in the paired layers, and similar parallel transmis- cortex. sion is preserved all the way to the visual cortex. 653 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses The second major function of the dorsal lateral genicu- late nucleus is to “gate” the transmission of signals to the visual cortex—that is, to control how much of the signal is allowed to pass to the cortex. The nucleus receives gating control signals from two major sources: (1) corticofugal fibers returning in a backward direction from the pri- Secondary
