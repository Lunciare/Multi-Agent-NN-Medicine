When tissue is a fraction of the total blood flow (cardiac out- blood vessels are arranged in series, flow through each put) and is determined by the resistance (the reciprocal blood vessel is the same, and the total resistance to of conductance) for blood flow in the tissue, as well as blood flow (R ) is equal to the sum of the resistances the pressure gradient. Therefore, amputation of a limb or total of each vessel: surgical removal of a kidney also removes a parallel cir- cuit and reduces the total vascular conductance and total blood flow (i.e., cardiac output) while increasing the total The total peripheral vascular resistance is therefore peripheral vascular resistance. equal to the sum of resistances of the arteries, arterioles, Effect of Blood Hematocrit and Blood capillaries, venules, and veins.
