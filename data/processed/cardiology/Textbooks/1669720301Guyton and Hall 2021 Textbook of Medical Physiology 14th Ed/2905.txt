fingers. This does not mean that the hand Interneurons and finger muscles cannot contract; rather, the ability to control the fine movements is gone. From these observa- Corticospinal tract tions, one can conclude that the area pyramidalis is essen- from pyramidal cells of cortex tial for voluntary initiation of finely controlled movements, especially of the hands and fingers. Rubrospinal tract Muscle Spasticity Caused by Lesions That Damage Large Reticulospinal tract Areas Adjacent to the Motor Cortex. The primary motor Anterior motor neuron cortex normally exerts a continual tonic stimulatory effect on the motor neurons of the spinal cord; when this stimu- Motor nerve latory effect is removed, hypotonia results. Most lesions of Tectospinal and the motor cortex, especially those caused by a stroke, involve reticulospinal tracts not only the primary motor cortex but also adjacent parts of Vestibulospinal and the brain, such as the basal ganglia. In these cases, muscle reticulospinal tracts spasm almost invariably occurs in the afflicted muscle areas Figure 56-6 . Convergence of different motor control pathways on on the opposite side of the body (because the motor path- the anterior motor neurons. ways cross to the opposite side). This spasm results mainly 702 CHAPTER 56 Cortical
