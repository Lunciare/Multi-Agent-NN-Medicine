Even when the most Interposed Nucleus rapidly conducting sensory pathways are used, up to 120 m/sec in the spinocerebellar afferent tracts, the delay for As shown in Figure 57- 8, the intermediate zone of each transmission from the feet to the brain is still 15 to 20 cerebellar hemisphere receives two types of information milliseconds. The feet of a person running rapidly can when a movement is performed: (1) information from the move as much as 10 inches during that time. Therefore, cerebral motor cortex and from the midbrain red nucleus, it is never possible for return signals from the peripheral telling the cerebellum the intended sequential plan of move- parts of the body to reach the brain at the same time that ment for the next few fractions of a second; and (2) feed- the movements actually occur. How, then, is it possible back information from the peripheral parts of the body, for the brain to know when
