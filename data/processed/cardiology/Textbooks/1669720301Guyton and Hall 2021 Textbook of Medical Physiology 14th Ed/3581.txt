de- and NADPH needed for fat synthesis can be derived from graded. This effect is caused partially by the large quantities glucose. Second, lack of glucose in the fat cells greatly reduc- of acetyl-C oA formed from the carbohydrates and by the es the availability of α-g lycerophosphate, which also makes low concentration of free fatty acids in the adipose tissue, it difficult for the tissues to form triglycerides. thus creating conditions appropriate for the conversion of acetyl- CoA into fatty acids. An even more important effect that promotes conver- sion of carbohydrates to fats is the following: The first step, Step 1: CH COCoA + CO + ATP which is the rate-l imiting step, in the synthesis of fatty acids 3 2 (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase) is carboxylation of acetyl- CoA to form malonyl- CoA. The rate of this reaction is controlled primarily by the enzyme COOH acetyl- CoA carboxylase, the activity of which is accelerated in the presence of intermediates of the citric acid cycle. CH + ADP + PO −3 2 4 When excess carbohydrates are being used, these interme- diates increase, automatically causing increased synthesis O C CoA of fatty acids. Malonyl-CoA Thus, an excess of carbohydrates in
