diffuse far less rapidly than molecular substances because of their large size. DIFFUSION THROUGH THE CELL MEMBRANE Diffusion through the cell membrane is divided into two subtypes, called simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion means that kinetic movement of mol- Figure 4-3.

The rate of diffusion other side of the membrane. Channel proteins and carrier is determined by the amount of substance available, the proteins are usually selective for the types of molecules or velocity of kinetic motion, and the number and sizes of ions that are allowed to cross the membrane. openings in the membrane through which the molecules or ions can move. “Diffusion” Versus “Active Transport.” Transport Facilitated diffusion requires interaction of a carrier through the cell membrane, either directly through the li- protein.
