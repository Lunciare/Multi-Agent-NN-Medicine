if this potential rises high the resting neuronal membrane. Therefore, opening the enough in the positive direction, it will elicit an action chloride channels will allow negatively charged chloride potential in the postsynaptic neuron, thus exciting it. (In ions to move from the extracellular fluid to the interior, this case, the EPSP is +20 mV—i.e., 20 mV more positive which will make the interior membrane potential more than the resting value.) negative than normal, approaching the −70 mV level. Discharge of a single presynaptic terminal can never Opening potassium channels will allow positively increase the neuronal potential from −65 mV all the way charged potassium ions to move to the exterior and will up to −45 mV. An increase of this magnitude requires also make the interior membrane potential more nega- simultaneous discharge of many terminals—about 40 tive than usual. Thus, both chloride influx and potas- to 80 for the usual anterior motor neuron—at the same sium efflux increase the degree of intracellular negativity, time or in rapid succession. This simultaneous discharge called hyperpolarization. The neuron is inhibited because occurs by a process called summation, discussed in the the membrane potential is even more negative than the next sections. normal
