its failure to fall below the control level demonstrate energy from glucose metabolism, and insulin is not neces- that either (1) the normal increase in insulin secretion af- sary for this use of glucose. However, if high levels of insulin ter glucose ingestion does not occur, or (2) the person has cause blood glucose to fall to low levels, the metabolism of the decreased sensitivity to insulin. A diagnosis of diabetes central nervous system becomes depressed. Consequently, mellitus can usually be established on the basis of such a in patients with insulin- secreting tumors or in patients with curve, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be distinguished diabetes who administer too much insulin to themselves, the from each other by measurements of plasma insulin, with syndrome called insulin shock may occur as follows. plasma insulin being low or undetectable in type 1 diabetes As blood glucose level falls into the range of 50 to 70 and increased in type 2 diabetes. Acetone Breath. As pointed out in Chapter 69, small mg/100 ml, the central nervous system usually becomes excitable because this degree of hypoglycemia sensitizes quantities of acetoacetic acid in the blood, which increase neuronal activity. Sometimes various
