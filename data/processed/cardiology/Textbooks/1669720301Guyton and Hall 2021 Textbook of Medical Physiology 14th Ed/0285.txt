resting membrane potential in the rhythmical con- of the action potential, whereas the prolonged opening of trol center of the heart is only −60 to −70 millivolts, which is the slow calcium- sodium channels mainly allows calcium not enough negative voltage to keep the sodium and calcium ions to enter the fiber, which is largely responsible for the channels totally closed. Therefore, the following sequence plateau portion of the action potential. occurs: (1) some sodium and calcium ions flow inward; (2) Another factor that may be partly responsible for the this activity increases the membrane voltage in the positive plateau is that the voltage- gated potassium channels are direction, which further increases membrane permeability; slower to open than usual, often not opening much until (3) still more ions flow inward; and (4) the permeability in- the end of the plateau. This factor delays the return of the creases more, and so on, until an action potential is gener- membrane potential toward its normal negative value ated. Then, at the end of the action potential, the membrane of −70 millivolts. The plateau ends when the calcium- repolarizes. After another delay of milliseconds or seconds, sodium channels close, and permeability to potassium
