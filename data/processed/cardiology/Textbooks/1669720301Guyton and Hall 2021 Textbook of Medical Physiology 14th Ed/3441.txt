Folds of Kerckring, Villi, and Microvilli Increase the Mucosal Absorptive Area by Nearly 1000-F old. Figure Villi 66- 5 demonstrates the absorptive surface of the small in- testinal mucosa, showing many folds called valvulae con- FFoooodd mmoovveemmeenntt niventes (or folds of Kerckring), which increase the surface area of the absorptive mucosa about threefold. These folds extend circularly most of the way around the intestine and are especially well developed in the duodenum and jeju- num, where they often protrude up
