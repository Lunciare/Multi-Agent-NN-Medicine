of the extracellular fluid 15 volume, blood volume, and cardiac output back to 6.0 normal 5.5 20% 5% Therefore, we can divide volume- loading hypertension 5.0 into two sequential stages. The first stage results from 7.0 40% increased fluid volume causing increased cardiac output. 6.5 This increase in cardiac output mediates the hyperten- 6.0 sion. The second stage in volume-l oading hypertension 5.5 5% is characterized by high blood pressure and high total 5.0 peripheral resistance but return of the cardiac output so close to normal that the usual measuring techniques 28 frequently cannot detect an abnormally elevated cardiac 26 33% 24 output. 22 20 Thus, the increased total peripheral resistance in 18 −13% volume- loading hypertension occurs after the hyper- 150 40% tension has developed and, therefore, is secondary to 30% 140 the hypertension rather than being the cause of the 130 hypertension. 120 110 Volume- Loading Hypertension in Patients 0 Who Have No Kidneys but Are Being 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Maintained With an Artificial Kidney Days Figure 19- 8.
