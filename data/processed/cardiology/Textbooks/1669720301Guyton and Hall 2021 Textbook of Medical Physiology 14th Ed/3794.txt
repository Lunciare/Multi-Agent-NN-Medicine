of maintaining normal internal core temperature, even The various methods by which heat is lost from the skin though it allows the temperature of the skin to approach to the surroundings are shown in Figure 74- 4. They the temperature of the surroundings. include radiation, conduction, and evaporation, which are explained next. Blood Flow to the Skin From the Body Core Provides Heat Transfer Radiation Causes Heat Loss in the Form of Infrared Rays. As shown in Figure 74- 4, in a nude person sitting Blood vessels are distributed profusely beneath the skin. inside at normal room temperature, about 60% of total Especially important is a continuous venous plexus that heat loss is by radiation. is supplied by inflow of blood from the skin capillaries, Most infrared heat rays (a type of electromagnetic shown in Figure 74- 2. In the most exposed areas of the ray) that radiate from the body have wavelengths of 5 to body—the hands, feet, and ears—blood is also supplied to the plexus directly from the small arteries through highly Vasodilated muscular arteriovenous anastomoses. 8 The rate of blood flow into the skin venous plexus can vary tremendously, from barely above zero to as great as
