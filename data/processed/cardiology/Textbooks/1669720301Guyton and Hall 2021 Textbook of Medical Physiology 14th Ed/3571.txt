metabolism of glucose. The extra hydrogen atoms are also acetyl-C oA, two molecules of acetyl-C oA condense to form oxidized by the same chemiosmotic oxidative system of the one molecule of acetoacetic acid, which is then transported mitochondria that is used in carbohydrate oxidation, liber- in the blood to the other cells throughout the body, where it ating large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). is used for energy. The following chemical processes occur: Large Amounts of ATP Are Formed by Oxidation of Fatty Acids.
