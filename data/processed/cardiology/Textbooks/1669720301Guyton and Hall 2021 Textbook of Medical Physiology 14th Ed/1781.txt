rid Isosthenuria—Inability of the Kidney to Concen- the body of normal acidic products; (3) high concentration trate or Dilute the Urine. One important effect of the of the nonprotein nitrogens—especially urea, creatinine, and rapid rate of tubular flow that occurs in the remaining uric acid—resulting from failure of the body to excrete the metabolic end products of proteins; and (4) high concen- nephrons of diseased kidneys is that the renal tubules lose trations of other substances excreted by the kidney, includ- their ability to concentrate or dilute the urine fully. The con- ing phenols, sulfates, phosphates, potassium, and guanidine centrating ability of the kidney is impaired mainly because bases. This total condition is called uremia because of the of the following: (1) the rapid flow of tubular fluid through high concentration of urea in the body fluids. the collecting ducts prevents adequate water reabsorption; Water Retention and Development of Edema in Chronic and (2) the rapid flow through both the loop of Henle and Kidney Disease. If water intake is restricted immediately af- collecting ducts prevents the countercurrent mechanism ter acute kidney injury begins, the total body fluid content from operating effectively to concentrate the medullary may become only slightly
