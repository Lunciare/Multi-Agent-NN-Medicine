Spontane- the carrier status. ous bleeding, however, will not ordinarily occur until the Although female carriers have one normal allele and number of platelets in the blood falls below 30,000/μl. usually do not develop symptomatic hemophilia, some Levels as low as 10,000/μl are frequently lethal. may experience a mild bleeding trait. It is also possible Even without determining specific platelet counts in for female carriers to develop mild hemophilia due to the blood, sometimes one can suspect the existence of loss of part or all of the normal X chromosome (as in thrombocytopenia if the person’s blood clot fails to retract. Turner syndrome) or inactivation (lyonization) of the As noted earlier, clot retraction is normally dependent X- chromosomes.
