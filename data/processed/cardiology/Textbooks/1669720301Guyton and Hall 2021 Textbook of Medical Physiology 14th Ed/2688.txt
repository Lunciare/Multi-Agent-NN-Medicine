As noted previously, many ganglion cells to the same bipolar cell through inhibitory horizontal cells are specifically excited by changes in light intensity, dem- that neutralize the direct excitatory signal if all three recep- onstrated by the records of nerve impulses in Figure 51- tors are stimulated simultaneously by light. 14.
