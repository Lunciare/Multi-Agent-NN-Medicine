The actual stage of mitosis, however, lasts for only about 30 minutes, and thus more than 95% of the DNA Replication. DNA is replicated in much the same life cycle of even rapidly reproducing cells is represented way that RNA is transcribed from DNA, except for a few by the interval between mitosis, called interphase. important differences: Except in special conditions of rapid cellular repro- 1.
