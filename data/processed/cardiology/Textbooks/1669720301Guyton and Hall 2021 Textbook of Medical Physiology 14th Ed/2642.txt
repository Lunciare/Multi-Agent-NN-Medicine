which is also a highly vascular tissue lying between the retina and the sclera. The outer layers of the retina, especially the outer segments of the rods and cones, depend mainly on diffusion from the choroid blood vessels for their nutrition, especially for their oxygen. Retinal Detachment. The neural retina occasionally de- taches from the pigment epithelium. In some cases, the cause of such detachment is injury to the eyeball that allows fluid or blood to collect between the neural retina and the pigment epithelium. Detachment is occasionally caused by contrac- ture of fine collagenous fibrils in the vitreous humor, which pull areas of the retina toward the interior of the globe. Partly because of diffusion across the detachment gap, and partly because of the independent blood supply to the neural retina through the retinal artery, the detached retina can resist degeneration for days and can become functional Figure 51- 4.

If it is not replaced soon, however, the retina will be destroyed and will be unable to
