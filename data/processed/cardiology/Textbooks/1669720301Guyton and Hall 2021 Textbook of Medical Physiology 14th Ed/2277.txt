The HYPOXIA AND OXYGEN THERAPY combined effects of all these factors, especially the slow- reacting substance of anaphylaxis, are to produce the Almost any of the conditions discussed in the past few following: (1) localized edema in the walls of the small sections of this chapter can cause serious cellular hypoxia bronchioles, as well as secretion of thick mucus into the throughout the body. Sometimes O therapy is of great 2 bronchiolar lumens; and (2) spasm of the bronchiolar value, other times it is of moderate value, and at still other smooth muscle. Therefore, the airway resistance increases times it is of almost no value. Therefore, it is important greatly. to understand the different types of hypoxia, and then we As discussed earlier in this chapter, the bronchiolar can discuss the physiological principles of oxygen therapy. diameter becomes reduced more during expiration than The following is a descriptive classification of the causes during inspiration in persons with asthma as a result of of hypoxia: bronchiolar collapse during expiratory effort that com- 1.
