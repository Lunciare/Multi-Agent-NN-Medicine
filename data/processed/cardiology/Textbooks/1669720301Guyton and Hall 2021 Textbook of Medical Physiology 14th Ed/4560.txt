maximal athletic feats on the first day, the Now, recognizing that the oxygen consumption by the sweat glands also become acclimatized, so the amount of body can increase as much as 20-f old in the well- trained salt lost in the sweat becomes only a small fraction of that athlete and that the amount of heat liberated in the body is lost before acclimatization. This sweat gland acclimatiza- almost exactly proportional to the oxygen consumption (as tion results mainly from increased aldosterone secretion by discussed in Chapter 73), one quickly realizes that tremen- the adrenal cortex. The aldosterone in turn has a direct ef- dous amounts of heat are injected into the internal body fect on the sweat glands, increasing reabsorption of sodium tissues when performing endurance athletic events. Next, chloride from the sweat before the sweat issues forth from with a vast rate of heat flow into the body, on a very hot the sweat gland tubules onto the surface of the skin. Once and humid day that prevents the sweating mechanism from the athlete is acclimatized, only rarely do salt supplements eliminating the heat, an intolerable and even lethal condi- need to be considered during athletic events. tion
