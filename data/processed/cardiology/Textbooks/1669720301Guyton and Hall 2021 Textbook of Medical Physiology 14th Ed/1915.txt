When the antibody is highly specific, there are invader; and (2) by activation of the complement system so many bonding sites that the antibody- antigen coupling that then has multiple means of its own for destroying is exceedingly strong, held together by (1) hydrophobic the invader. bonding; (2) hydrogen bonding; (3) ionic attractions; and Direct Action of Antibodies on Invading Agents.
