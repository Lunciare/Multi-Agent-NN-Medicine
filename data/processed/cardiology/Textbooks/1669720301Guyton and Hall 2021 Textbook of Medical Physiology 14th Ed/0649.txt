muscle mass, as shown to the left in Figure 13-20. Atrial flutter causes a rapid rate of contraction of the atria, usually between 200 and 350 beats/min. How- ever, because one side of the atria is contracting while the low voltage wave record. Conversely, the QRS- T complexes other side is relaxing, the amount of blood pumped by the are normal unless there is some pathology of the ventricles, atria is reduced. Furthermore, the signals reach the A- V but their timing is irregular, as explained next. node too rapidly for all of them to be passed into the ven- tricles because the refractory periods of the A- V node and IRREGULARITY OF VENTRICULAR A- V bundle are too long to pass more than a fraction of RHYTHM DURING ATRIAL FIBRILLATION the atrial signals. Therefore, there are usually two to three beats of the atria for every single beat of the ventricles. When the atria are fibrillating, impulses arrive from the Figure 13-21 shows a typical ECG in atrial flutter. The atrial muscle at the A- V node rapidly but also irregularly. P waves are strong because of the contraction of semico- Because the A- V node will not pass
