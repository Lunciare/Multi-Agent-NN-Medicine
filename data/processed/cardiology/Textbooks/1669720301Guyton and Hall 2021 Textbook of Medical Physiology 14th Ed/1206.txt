in the microvessels. Because tissue metabolism continues despite the low flow, large amounts of acid, both carbonic acid and lac- tic acid, continue to empty into the local blood vessels and greatly increase the local acidity of the blood. This acidic effect, plus other deterioration products from the ischemic tissues, causes local blood agglutination, re- sulting in minute blood clots and leading to very small plugs in the small vessels. Even if the vessels do not be- come plugged, an increased tendency for the blood cells to stick to one another makes it more difficult for blood to flow through the microvasculature, giving rise to the term sludged blood. Increased Capillary Permeability. After many hours of capillary hypoxia and lack of other nutrients, the per- meability of the capillaries gradually increases, and large quantities of fluid begin to transude into the tissues. This phenomenon decreases the blood volume even more, with a resultant further decrease in cardiac output, mak- ing the shock still more severe. Capillary hypoxia does not cause increased capillary permeability until the late stages Figure 24- 5 Necrosis of the central portion of a liver lobule during of prolonged shock. severe circulatory shock.
