nerve fibers innervate the gut. tal circulation and exert physiological actions on target Some of the nerve fibers have their cell bodies in the cells with specific receptors for the hormone. The effects enteric nervous system, and some have them in the dor- of the hormones persist even after all nervous connec- sal root ganglia of the spinal cord. These sensory nerves tions between the site of release and the site of action have can be stimulated by (1) irritation of the gut mucosa, been severed.
