directly as enzymes or are closely associated with enzymes that they activate. These enzyme- Leptin linked receptors are proteins that pass through the mem- brane only once, in contrast to the seven- transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors. Enzyme-l inked receptors Leptin receptor have their hormone- binding site on the outside of the cell P JAK2 Y Y JAK2 P membrane and their catalytic or enzyme-b inding site on the inside. When the hormone binds to the extracellular part of the receptor, an enzyme immediately inside the Activation STAT3 P Y Y P STAT3 cell membrane is activated (or occasionally inactivated). of enzymes P Y Y P Although many enzyme- linked receptors have intrinsic P enzyme activity, others rely on enzymes that are closely T3 associated with the receptor to produce changes in cell Physiological STA TAT3 S function. effects P Table 75- 2 lists a few of the many peptide growth fac- tors, cytokines, and hormones that use the enzyme-l inked STAT3 P receptor tyrosine kinases for cell signaling. One example Translation P STAT3 of an enzyme-l inked receptor is the leptin receptor (Figure 75- 5). Leptin is a hormone secreted by fat cells and has Target gene Table 75- 2
