is discussed in Chapter 80 Evaporative heat loss 55. During maximum shivering, body heat production can rise to four to five times normal. 70 Sympathetic “Chemical” Excitation of Heat Produc- 60 tion. As noted in Chapter 73, an increase in either sym- 50 pathetic stimulation or circulating norepinephrine and epi- Heat production nephrine in the blood can rapidly increase the rate of cellular 40 metabolism. This effect is called chemical thermogenesis, or nonshivering thermogenesis. It results at least partially from 30 the ability of norepinephrine and epinephrine to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, which means that excess food- 20 stuffs are oxidized and thereby release energy in the form of 10 heat but do not cause adenosine triphosphate to be formed. The degree of chemical thermogenesis that occurs in 0 an animal is almost directly proportional to the amount of 36.4 36.6 36.8 37.0 37.2 37.4 37.6 brown fat in the animal’s tissues. This type of fat contains Head temperature (°C) large numbers of special mitochondria where uncoupled Figure 74- 7.
