Therefore, nervous control is the most rapid mechanism for arterial pressure regulation. ing vasodilatory reaction occurs in people who experience intense emotional disturbances that cause fainting. In this INCREASES IN ARTERIAL PRESSURE case, the muscle vasodilator system becomes activated DURING MUSCLE EXERCISE AND OTHER and, at the same time, the vagal cardioinhibitory center STRESSES transmits strong signals to the heart to slow the heart rate markedly.
