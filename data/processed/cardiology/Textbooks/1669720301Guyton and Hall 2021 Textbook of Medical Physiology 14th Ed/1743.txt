lar reabsorption at different sites along the renal nephron. the clinically used diuretics. 421 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys By blocking sodium- chloride- potassium co- transport the kidneys to concentrate or dilute the urine. Urinary in the luminal membrane of the loop of Henle, the loop dilution is impaired because the inhibition of sodium and diuretics increase urine output of sodium, chloride, chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle causes more potassium, and other electrolytes, as well as water, for of these ions to be excreted, along with increased water two reasons: (1) they greatly increase the quantities of excretion. Urine concentrating ability is impaired because solutes delivered to the distal parts of the nephrons, and the renal medullary interstitial fluid concentration of these solutes act as osmotic agents to prevent water these ions, and therefore renal medullary osmolarity, is reabsorption; and (2) they disrupt the countercurrent reduced. Consequently, reabsorption of fluid from the col- multiplier system by decreasing absorption of ions lecting ducts is decreased, so the maximal concentrating from the loop of Henle into the medullary interstitium, ability of the kidneys is also greatly reduced. In addition, thereby decreasing the osmolarity of the medullary
