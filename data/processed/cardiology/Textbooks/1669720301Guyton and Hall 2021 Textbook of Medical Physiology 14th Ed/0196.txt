4-6B. A micropipette with a molecular conformation of the gate or its chemi- tip diameter of only 1 or 2 micrometers is abutted against cal bonds responds to the electrical potential across the outside of a cell membrane. Suction is then applied the cell membrane. For example, in the top panel of inside the pipette to pull the membrane against the tip of Figure 4-5, a strong negative charge on the inside the pipette, which creates a seal where the edges of the of the cell membrane may cause the outside sodium pipette touch the cell membrane. The result is a minute gates to remain tightly closed. Conversely, when the membrane “patch” at the tip of the pipette through which inside of the membrane loses its negative charge, electrical current flow can be recorded. these gates open suddenly and allow sodium to pass Alternatively, as shown at the bottom right in Figure inward through the sodium pores. This process is 4-6B, the small cell membrane patch at the end of the the basic mechanism for eliciting action potentials pipette can be torn away from the cell. The pipette with in nerves that are responsible for nerve signals. In its sealed
