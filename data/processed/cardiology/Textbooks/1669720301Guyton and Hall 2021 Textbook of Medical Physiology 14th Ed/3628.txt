This process involves 20 to 30 grams of protein 2NH 3+CO 2→H 2N−−C−−NH 2+H 2O each day, which is called the obligatory loss of proteins. There- || fore, to prevent net loss of protein from the body, the average O person must ingest a minimum of 20 to 30 grams of protein each day, although this amount depends on multiple factors, Essentially all urea formed in the human body is synthe- including muscle mass, activity, and age; to be on the safe sized in the liver.
