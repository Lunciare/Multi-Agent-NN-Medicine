In turn, the food in the cells is grad- ually oxidized, and the released energy is used to form new ATP, thus always maintaining a supply of this substance. All ATP Glucose Glucose-6-phosphate these energy transfers take place via coupled reactions. The principal purpose of this chapter is to explain how the energy from carbohydrates can be used to form ATP in
