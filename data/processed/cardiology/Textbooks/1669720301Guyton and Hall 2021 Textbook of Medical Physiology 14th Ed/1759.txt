causes of postrenal AKI Another cause of intrarenal acute renal failure is tubular include the following: (1) bilateral obstruction of the ure- necrosis, which means destruction of epithelial cells in the ters or renal pelvises caused by large stones or blood clots; tubules. Some common causes of tubular necrosis are as fol- (2) bladder obstruction; and (3) obstruction of the urethra. lows: (1) severe ischemia and inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tubular epithelial cells; and (2) poisons, PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ACUTE toxins, or medications that destroy the tubular epithelial cells. KIDNEY INJURY Acute Tubular Necrosis Caused by Severe Renal Is- A major physiological effect of AKI is the retention of chemia. Severe ischemia of the kidney can result from water, waste products of metabolism, and electrolytes in circulatory shock or other disturbances that severely im- the blood and extracellular fluid. This can lead to water pair the blood supply to the kidneys. If the ischemia is and salt overload, which, in turn, can lead to edema and severe enough to seriously impair the delivery of nutrients hypertension. Excessive retention of potassium, how- and oxygen to the renal tubular epithelial cells, and if the ever, is often a
