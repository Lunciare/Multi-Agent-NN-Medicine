The axons from the giant Betz cells send short collat- erals back to the cortex. These collaterals are believed THE RED NUCLEUS SERVES AS to inhibit adjacent regions of the cortex when the Betz AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY FOR cells discharge, thereby “sharpening” the boundaries of the excitatory signal.

A moderate number of motor fibers pass to red nuclei of from the primary motor cortex through the corticorubral the midbrain. From these nuclei, additional fibers pass tract, as well as branching fibers from the corticospinal
