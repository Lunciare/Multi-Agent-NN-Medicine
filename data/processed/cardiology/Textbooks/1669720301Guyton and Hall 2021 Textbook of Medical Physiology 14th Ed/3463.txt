At least 10 different types of transport proteins for Most of the absorption in the large intestine occurs amino acids and peptides have been found in the intestinal in the proximal half of the colon, giving this portion the epithelial cells. This multiplicity of transport proteins name absorbing colon, whereas the distal colon functions is required because of the diverse binding properties of principally for feces storage until a propitious time for different amino acids and peptides. feces excretion and is therefore called the storage colon. 831 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Absorption and Secretion of Electrolytes and Water.
