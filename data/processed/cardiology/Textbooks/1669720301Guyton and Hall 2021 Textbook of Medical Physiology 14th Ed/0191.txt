Many protein Different selectivity filters for the various ion channels channels are highly selective for transport of one or more are believed to determine, in large part, the specificity of specific ions or molecules. This selectivity results from various channels for cations or anions or for particular specific characteristics of the channel, such as its diam- ions, such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium eter, shape, and the nature of the electrical charges and (Ca2+), that gain access to the channels. chemical bonds along its inside surfaces. One of the most important of the protein channels, Potassium channels permit passage of potassium ions the sodium channel, is only 0.3 to 0.5 nanometer in across the cell membrane about 1000 times more read- diameter, but the ability of sodium channels to discrimi- ily than they permit passage of sodium ions.
