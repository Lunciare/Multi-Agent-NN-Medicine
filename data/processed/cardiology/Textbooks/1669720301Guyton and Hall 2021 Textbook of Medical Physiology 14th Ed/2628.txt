of Schlemm is a thin- walled vein that extends circumferentially all the way around the eye. Its endothelial membrane is so porous that even large protein molecules, as well as small particulate mat- ter up to the size of red blood cells, can pass from the anterior Ciliary muscle Vascular layer chamber into the canal of Schlemm. Even though the canal of Figure 50- 19. Anatomy of the ciliary processes. Aqueous humor is Schlemm is actually a venous blood vessel, so much aqueous formed on surfaces. humor normally flows into it that it is filled only with aqueous humor rather than with blood. The small veins that lead from the canal of Schlemm to the larger veins of the eye usually large area, considering the small size of the ciliary body. contain only aqueous humor; they are called aqueous veins. The surfaces of these processes are covered by highly INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE secretory epithelial cells, and immediately beneath them is a highly vascular area. The average normal intraocular pressure is about 15 mm Aqueous humor is formed almost entirely as an active Hg, with a range from 12 to 20 mm Hg. secretion by the epithelium of the ciliary processes.
