subunits, also shown in Figure 6-1, and described filaments are attached to a Z disk. From this disk, these in subsequent paragraphs. filaments extend in both directions to interdigitate with In most skeletal muscles, each fiber extends the entire the myosin filaments. The Z disk, which is composed of length of the muscle. Except for about 2% of the fibers, filamentous proteins different from the actin and myo- each fiber is usually innervated by only one nerve ending, sin filaments, passes crosswise across the myofibril and located near the middle of the fiber. also crosswise from myofibril to myofibril, attaching the myofibrils to one another all the way across the muscle The Sarcolemma Is a Thin Membrane Enclosing a fiber. Therefore, the entire muscle fiber has light and dark Skeletal Muscle Fiber. The sarcolemma consists of a bands, as do the individual myofibrils. These bands give true cell membrane, called the plasma membrane, and skeletal and cardiac muscle their striated appearance. an outer coat made up of a thin layer of polysaccharide The portion of the myofibril (or of the whole muscle material that contains numerous thin collagen fibrils. At fiber) that lies between two successive Z disks is called
