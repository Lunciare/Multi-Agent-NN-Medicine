mm Hg, almost 100% cardiac output curve becomes greatly depressed, falling to above normal. As discussed in Chapter 20, this increased the lowest curve at the bottom of the graph. Within a few filling pressure greatly increases the tendency for blood seconds, a new circulatory state is established at point B, to flow from the veins back into the heart. Therefore, the illustrating that the cardiac output has fallen to 2 L/min, damaged heart becomes primed with more inflowing about two- fifths normal, whereas the right atrial pressure blood than usual, and the right atrial pressure rises still has risen to +4 mm Hg because venous blood returning to further, which helps the heart pump still larger quantities 271 UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation Normal heart Moderate Fluid Retention in Cardiac Failure Can Be Partially recovered heart Beneficial. Many cardiologists have considered fluid Damaged heart + sympathetic stimulation retention always to have a detrimental effect in cardiac 15 Acutely damaged heart failure. However, a moderate increase in body fluid and blood volume is an important factor in helping to com- pensate for the diminished pumping ability of the heart by increasing the venous return.
