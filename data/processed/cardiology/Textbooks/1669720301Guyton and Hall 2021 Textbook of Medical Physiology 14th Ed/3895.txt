Rathke’s pouch, which is an embryonic invagination of the The Anterior Pituitary Gland Contains Several pharyngeal epithelium, and the posterior pituitary from a Different Cell Types That Synthesize and Secrete neural tissue outgrowth from the hypothalamus. The origin Hormones. Usually, there is one cell type for each ma- of the anterior pituitary from the pharyngeal epithelium jor hormone formed in the anterior pituitary gland. With explains the epithelioid nature of its cells, and the origin of the posterior pituitary from neural tissue explains the presence of large numbers of glial- type cells in this gland. Hypothalamus Six major peptide hormones plus several other hor- mones of lesser known importance are secreted by the Optic chiasm anterior pituitary, and two important peptide hormones are secreted by the posterior pituitary. The hormones of the anterior pituitary play major roles in the control of metabolic functions throughout the Mammillary body body, as shown in Figure 76- 2. • Growth hormone promotes growth of the entire Hypophysial stalk body by affecting protein formation, cell multiplica- tion, and cell differentiation. Anterior pituitary Posterior pituitary • Adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin) con- trols the secretion of some of the adrenocortical hor- mones, which affect metabolism of glucose, proteins,
