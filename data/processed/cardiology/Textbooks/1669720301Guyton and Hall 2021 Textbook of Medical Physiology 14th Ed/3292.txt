times. PROPULSIVE MOVEMENTS—PERISTALSIS B. Segmentation contractions (small and large intestines) The basic propulsive movement of the gastrointestinal tract is peristalsis, which is illustrated in Figure 63- 5A. A contractile ring appears around the gut and then moves forward; this mechanism is analogous to putting one’s fingers around a thin distended tube, then constricting the fingers and sliding them forward along the tube. Any material in front of the contractile ring is moved forward. Peristalsis is an inherent property of many syncytial smooth muscle tubes; stimulation at any point in the gut Mixing can cause a contractile ring to appear in the circular mus- Figure 63- 5. Peristalsis involves contraction and downstream re- cle, and this ring then spreads along the gut tube. (Peristal- laxation in the esophagus, stomach and small intestine propel the sis also occurs in the bile ducts, glandular ducts, ureters, contents toward the anus. Intermittent segmentation contractions in and many other smooth muscle tubes of the body.) separate sections of the small and large intestines mix their contents with little forward movement. The usual stimulus for intestinal peristalsis is distention of the gut. That is, if a large amount of food collects at any point in the
