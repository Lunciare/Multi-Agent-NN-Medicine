at 10,000 feet, it is following discussions. only 523 mm Hg; and at 50,000 feet, it is 87 mm Hg. This decrease in barometric pressure is the basic cause of all Alveolar P o at Different Altitudes. The fifth column 2 the hypoxia problems in high-a ltitude physiology, because of Table 44- 1 shows the approximate Po 2 values in the as the barometric pressure decreases, the atmospheric alveoli at different altitudes when one is breathing air for oxygen partial pressure (Po ) decreases proportionately, both the unacclimatized and the acclimatized person. At 2 remaining at all times slightly less than 21% of the total sea level, the alveolar Po is 104 mm Hg. At 20,000 feet 2 barometric pressure; at sea level, Po is about 159 mm Hg, altitude, it falls to about 40 mm Hg in the unacclimatized 2 but at 50,000 feet, Po is only 18 mm Hg. person but only to 53 mm Hg in the acclimatized per- 2 son. The reason for the difference between these two is ALVEOLAR Po2 AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS that alveolar ventilation increases much more in the ac- climatized person than in the unacclimatized person, as Carbon Dioxide and Water Vapor
