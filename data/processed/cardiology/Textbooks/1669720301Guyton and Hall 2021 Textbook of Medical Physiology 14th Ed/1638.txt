renal output of fluid with daily intake of fluid. INCREASED BLOOD VOLUME AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME CAUSED CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE LARGE BY HEART DISEASES INCREASES IN EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME WITH NORMAL OR REDUCED In persons with congestive heart failure, blood volume BLOOD VOLUME may increase by 15% to 20%, and the extracellular fluid volume sometimes increases by 200% or more. The reason In several conditions, extracellular fluid volume becomes for these increases can be understood by re- examination markedly increased, but blood volume remains normal or of Figure 30- 14. Initially, heart failure reduces cardiac even slightly reduced. These conditions are usually initi- output and, consequently, decreases arterial pressure. ated by leakage of fluid and protein into the interstitium, This effect in turn activates multiple sodium-r etaining which tends to decrease the blood volume. The kidneys’ systems, especially the renin-a ngiotensin- aldosterone response to these conditions is similar to the response system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous systems. In after hemorrhage—that is, the kidneys retain salt and addition, the low blood pressure itself causes the kidneys water in an attempt to restore blood volume toward nor- to retain salt and water. Therefore, the kidneys retain vol- mal. Much of the extra
