Concentration of Red Blood Cells in the Blood. In RED BLOOD CELLS (ERYTHROCYTES) healthy men, the average number of RBCs per cubic mil- limeter is 5,200,000 (±300,000); in healthy women, it is A major function of RBCs, also known as erythrocytes, is 4,700,000 (±300,000). Persons living at high altitudes have to transport hemoglobin, which, in turn, carries oxygen greater numbers of RBCs, as discussed later. from the lungs to the tissues.
