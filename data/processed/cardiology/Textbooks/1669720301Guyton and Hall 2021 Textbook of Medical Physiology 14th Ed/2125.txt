alveoli, but the fluids that cover the respiratory surfaces. Even before the note that even at the end of 16 breaths, the excess gas still has air enters the alveoli, it becomes almost totally humidified. not been completely removed from the alveoli. The partial pressure of water vapor at a normal body Figure 40- 3 demonstrates graphically the rate at which temperature of 37°C is 47 mm Hg, which is therefore the excess gas in the alveoli is normally removed, showing partial pressure of water vapor in the alveolar air. Because that with normal alveolar ventilation, about half the gas is the total pressure in the alveoli cannot rise to more than removed in 17 seconds. When a person’s rate of alveolar the atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg at sea level), this ventilation is only half-n ormal, half of the gas is removed water vapor simply dilutes all the other gases in the in 34 seconds, and when the rate of ventilation is twice inspired air. Table 40- 1 also shows that humidification of normal, half is removed in about 8 seconds. 513 UNIT VII UNIT VII Respiration 100 Upper limit at maximum ventilation 150 250 ml O /min 2
