extracellular sodium chloride is also usually associated 2 with at least some degree of water retention by the kid- neys. For example, excessive secretion of the sodium- K+, Na+ retaining hormone aldosterone can cause a mild degree Organic of hypernatremia and overhydration. The reason that solutes H O the hypernatremia is not more severe is that the sodium 2 retention also stimulates secretion of ADH and causes the kidneys to reabsorb greater amounts of water. Thus, in analyzing abnormalities of plasma sodium concentration and deciding on proper therapy, one should first determine whether the abnormality is caused Chronic hyponatremia by a primary loss or gain of sodium or a primary loss or Figure 25- 7.

This process stimulates transport of Na+, K+, and organic solutes out of the cells (2), which then causes Hypernatremia is much less common than hyponatremia water diffusion out of the cells (3). With chronic hyponatremia, the and
