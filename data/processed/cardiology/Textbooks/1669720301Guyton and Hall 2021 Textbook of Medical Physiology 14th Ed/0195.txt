remain closed all the time or almost all the time, whereas the channels. This mechanism is shown in both panels of at another voltage, it may remain open either all or most Figure 4-5 for selective gating of sodium and potassium of the time. At in-b etween voltages, as shown in the fig- ions. Some of the gates are thought to be gatelike exten- ure, the gates tend to snap open and closed intermittently, sions of the transport protein molecule, which can close resulting in an average current flow somewhere between the opening of the channel or can be lifted away from the the minimum and maximum. opening by a conformational change in the shape of the protein molecule. Patch Clamp Method for Recording Ion Current Flow The opening and closing of gates are controlled in two Through Single Channels. The patch clamp method for principal ways: recording ion current flow through single protein chan- 1. Voltage gating. In the case of voltage gating, the nels is illustrated in Figure 4-6B. A micropipette with a molecular conformation of the gate or its chemi- tip diameter of only 1 or 2 micrometers is abutted against cal bonds responds to the electrical
