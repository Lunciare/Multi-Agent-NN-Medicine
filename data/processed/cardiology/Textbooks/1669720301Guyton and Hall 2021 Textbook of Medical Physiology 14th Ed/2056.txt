This can been washed from the passages and only alveolar air remains. give a minute respiratory volume greater than 200 L/min, Therefore, the recorded nitrogen concentration reaches a pla- or more than 30 times normal.

The gray area represents the air that has than 1 minute. no nitrogen in it and is a measure of the volume of dead space air. For exact quantification, the following equation is used: ALVEOLAR VENTILATION VD= Grayarea×VE Pinkarea+Grayarea The ultimate importance of pulmonary ventilation is to where V is dead space air and V is the total volume D E renew the air in the gas exchange areas of the lungs con- of expired air. tinually, where air is in
