A primary protein-f ree secretion is formed by the Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus- preoptic area in glandular portion, but most of the electrolytes are reabsorbed in the duct, leaving a dilute, watery secretion. the brain either electrically or by excess heat causes sweat- ing. The nerve impulses from this area that cause sweating are transmitted in the autonomic pathways to the spinal The precursor secretion is an active secretory product cord and then through sympathetic outflow to the skin. of the epithelial cells lining the coiled portion of the sweat It should be recalled from the discussion of the auto- gland. Cholinergic sympathetic nerve fibers ending on or nomic nervous system in Chapter 61 that the sweat near the glandular cells elicit the secretion. glands are innervated by cholinergic nerve fibers (fibers The composition of the precursor secretion is simi- that secrete acetylcholine but that run in the sympathetic lar to that of plasma, except that it does not contain nerves along with the adrenergic fibers). These glands plasma proteins. The concentration of sodium is about can also be stimulated to some extent by epinephrine or 142 mEq/L, and that of chloride is about 104 mEq/L, norepinephrine
