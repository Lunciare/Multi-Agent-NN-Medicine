Fastigioreticular The primary pathway for the equilibrium reflexes tract begins in the vestibular nerves, where the nerves are Vestibular nucleus excited by the vestibular apparatus. The pathway then Flocculo- passes to the vestibular nuclei and cerebellum. Next, sig- nodular lobe Vestibular nerve nals are sent into the reticular nuclei of the brain stem, as well as down the spinal cord via the vestibulospinal Vestibulospinal tract and reticulospinal tracts.
