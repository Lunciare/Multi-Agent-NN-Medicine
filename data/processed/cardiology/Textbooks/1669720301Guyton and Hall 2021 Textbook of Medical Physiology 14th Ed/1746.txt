Action Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) Inhibit water and solute reabsorption by Mainly proximal tubules increasing osmolarity of tubular fluid Loop diuretics (furosemide, Inhibit Na+- K+- Cl− co- transport in luminal Thick ascending loop of bumetanide) membrane Henle Thiazide diuretics (hydrochloro- Inhibit Na+- Cl− co- transport in luminal Early distal tubules thiazide, chlorthalidone) membrane Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Inhibit H+ secretion and HCO − reabsorption, Mainly proximal tubules 3 (acetazolamide) which reduces Na+ reabsorption Aldosterone antagonists Inhibit action of aldosterone on tubular receptor, Collecting tubules (spironolactone, eplerenone) decrease Na+ reabsorption, decrease K+ secretion Sodium channel blockers Block entry of Na+ into Na+ channels of Collecting tubules (triamterene, amiloride) luminal membrane, decrease Na+ reabsorption, decrease K+ secretion 422 ro noitercxe muidoS diulf ralullecartxE )yad/qEm( ekatni muidos )sretil( emulov Chapter 32 Diuretics and Kidney Diseases Because hydrogen ion (H+) secretion and HCO 3− KIDNEY DISEASES reabsorption in the proximal tubules are coupled to sodium reabsorption through the sodium- hydrogen ion Diseases of the kidneys are among the most important counter- transport mechanism in the luminal membrane, causes of death and disability in many countries through- decreasing HCO − reabsorption also reduces sodium out the world.
