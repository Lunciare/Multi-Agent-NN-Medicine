One of the analytical pathways, demonstrated in Figure 52- 3 by the black Retinal image Cortical stimulation arrows, analyzes the third-d imensional positions of Figure 52- 5.

This pathway stimulated adjacent retinal receptors mutually inhibit one reveals where every object is during each instant and another.
