in the process of autophagy, terior. which literally means “to eat oneself.” Autophagy is 4. The contractile proteins then pinch the stem of the a housekeeping process whereby obsolete organelles vesicle so completely that the vesicle separates from and large protein aggregates are degraded and re- the cell membrane, leaving the vesicle in the cell in- cycled (Figure 2-13). Worn- out cell organelles are terior in the same way that pinocytotic vesicles are transferred to lysosomes by double- membrane struc- formed. tures called autophagosomes, which are formed in the cytosol. Invagination of the lysosomal membrane and LYSOSOMES DIGEST PINOCYTOTIC AND the formation of vesicles provides another pathway for PHAGOCYTIC FOREIGN SUBSTANCES cytosolic structures to be transported into the lumen INSIDE THE CELL of lysosomes. Once inside the lysosomes, the orga- nelles are digested, and the nutrients are reused by the Almost immediately after a pinocytotic or phagocytic ves- cell. Autophagy contributes to the routine turnover of icle appears inside a cell, one or more lysosomes become cytoplasmic components; it is a key mechanism for attached to the vesicle and empty their acid hydrolases to tissue development, cell survival when nutrients are the inside of the vesicle, as shown in Figure
