bases is a code word. Figure 3-4. Deoxyadenylic acid, one of the nucleotides that make up DNA. The successive triplets eventually control the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule that is to be synthe- sized in the cell. Note in Figure 3-6 that the top strand of DNA, reading from left to right, has the genetic code GGC, AGA, CTT, with the triplets being separated from A T one another by the arrows. As we follow this genetic code through Figure 3-7 and Figure 3-8, we see that these P D P D Deoxyadenylic acid Deoxythymidylic acid three respective triplets are responsible for successive placement of the three amino acids, proline, serine, and glutamic acid, in a newly formed molecule of protein. TRANSCRIPTION—TRANSFER OF CELL G C NUCLEUS DNA CODE TO CYTOPLASM P D P D RNA CODE Deoxyguanylic acid Deoxycytidylic acid Because DNA is located in the cell nucleus, yet most of Figure 3-5. Symbols for the four nucleotides that combine to form the cell functions are carried out in the cytoplasm, there DNA. Each nucleotide contains phosphoric acid (P), deoxyribose (D), and one of the four nucleotide bases: adenine (A); thymine (T); gua- must be some
