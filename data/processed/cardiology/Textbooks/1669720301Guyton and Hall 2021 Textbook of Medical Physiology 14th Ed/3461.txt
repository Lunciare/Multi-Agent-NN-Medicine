rate of transport is only about one-half Direct Absorption of Fatty Acids Into the Portal Blood. that of glucose or galactose. Small quantities of short- and medium-c hain fatty acids, such as those from butterfat, are absorbed directly into the Absorption of Proteins as Dipeptides, portal blood rather than being converted into triglycerides Tripeptides, or Amino Acids and absorbed by way of the lymphatics. The cause of this As explained earlier, most proteins, after digestion, are difference between short- and long-c hain fatty acid absorp- absorbed through the luminal membranes of the intestinal tion is that the short-c hain fatty acids are more water solu- epithelial cells in the form of dipeptides, tripeptides, and a ble and mostly are not reconverted into triglycerides by the few free amino acids. The energy for most of this transport endoplasmic reticulum. This phenomenon allows diffusion is supplied by a sodium co- transport mechanism in the of these short-c hain fatty acids from the intestinal epithelial same way that sodium co- transport of glucose occurs. That cells directly into the capillary blood of the intestinal villi. is, most peptide or amino acid molecules bind in the cell’s microvillus membrane with a specific transport protein
