By far the most es the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells abundant non-m embranous use of cholesterol in the body and decreases their ability to release nitric oxide and other is to form cholic acid in the liver. As much as 80% of choles- substances that help prevent adhesion of macromolecules, terol is converted into cholic acid. As explained in Chapter platelets, and monocytes to the endothelium. After damage 71, cholic acid is conjugated with other substances to form to the vascular endothelium occurs, circulating monocytes bile salts, which promote digestion and absorption of fats. and lipids (mostly LDLs) begin to accumulate at the site of A small quantity of cholesterol is used by (1) the adrenal injury (Figure 69- 8A). The monocytes cross the endothe- glands to form adrenocortical hormones, (2) the ovaries to lium, enter the intima of the vessel wall, and differentiate form progesterone and estrogen, and (3) the testes to form to become macrophages, which then ingest and oxidize the testosterone. These glands can also synthesize their own accumulated lipoproteins, giving the macrophages a foam- sterols and then form hormones from them, as discussed in like appearance. These macrophage foam cells then
