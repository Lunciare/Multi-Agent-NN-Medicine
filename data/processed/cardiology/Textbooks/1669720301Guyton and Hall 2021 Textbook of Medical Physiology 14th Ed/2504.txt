General Organization, Tactile and Position Senses I function almost entirely separately from one another. At other levels of the columns, interactions occur that initi- ate analysis of the meanings of the sensory signals. In the most anterior 5 to 10 millimeters of the post- II central gyrus, located deep in the central fissure in Brod- mann’s area 3A, an especially large share of the vertical columns responds to muscle, tendon, and joint stretch III receptors. Many of the signals from these sensory col- umns then spread anteriorly, directly to the motor cor- tex located immediately forward of the central fissure. These signals play a major role in controlling the efflu- IV ent motor signals
