The testes usually descend into the scrotum during testosterone levels below 3 ng/ml (usually expressed clini- the last 2 to 3 months of gestation when the testes begin cally as <300 ng/dl or <10.4 nmol/L). In recent years, it has secreting reasonable quantities of testosterone. If a male become clear that there is a clear association between late child is born with undescended but otherwise normal tes- onset reductions in testosterone and metabolic disorders tes, administration of testosterone usually causes the tes- such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
