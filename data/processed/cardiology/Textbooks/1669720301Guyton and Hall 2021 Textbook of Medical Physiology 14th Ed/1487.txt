or swelling. The osmolarity is deter- mined by the amount of solute (mainly sodium chloride) ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE CONTROLS divided by the volume of the extracellular fluid. Thus, to URINE CONCENTRATION a large extent, extracellular fluid osmolarity and sodium chloride concentration are regulated by the amount of The body has a powerful feedback system for regulating extracellular water. The total body water is controlled plasma osmolarity and sodium concentration that oper- by (1) fluid intake, which is regulated by factors that ates by altering renal excretion of water independently of determine thirst; and (2) renal water excretion, which is solute excretion rate. A primary effector of this feedback controlled by multiple factors that influence glomerular is antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin. filtration and tubular reabsorption. When osmolarity of the body fluids increases above In this chapter, we discuss the following: (1) mecha- normal (i.e., the solutes in the body fluids become too nisms that cause the kidneys to eliminate excess water by concentrated), the posterior pituitary gland secretes excreting a dilute urine; (2) mechanisms that cause the more ADH, which increases the permeability of the dis- kidneys to conserve water by excreting a concentrated tal tubules and collecting ducts to
