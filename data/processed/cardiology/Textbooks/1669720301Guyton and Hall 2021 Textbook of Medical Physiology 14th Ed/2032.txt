Furthermore, Lung volume 0.50 continual suction of excess fluid into lymphatic channels maintains a slight suction between the visceral surface of the lung pleura and the parietal pleural surface of the tho- 0.25 racic cavity. Therefore, the lungs are held to the thoracic wall as if glued there, except that they are well lubricated 0 and can slide freely as the chest expands and contracts. Pleural Pressure and Its Changes During Respira- +2 Alveolar pressure tion. Pleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the thin space between the lung pleura and chest wall pleura. 0 This pressure is normally a slight suction, which means a slightly negative pressure. The normal pleural pressure –2 at the beginning of inspiration is about −5 centimeters of Transpulmonary pressure water (cm H O), which is the amount of suction required –4 2 to hold the lungs open to their resting
