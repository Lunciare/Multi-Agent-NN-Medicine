because of the pressure diuresis mechanism. Also, The integration of different control systems that regulate the rise in blood pressure causes pressure natriuresis and sodium and fluid excretion under normal conditions can loss of sodium from the extracellular fluid. After several be summarized by examining the homeostatic responses days of ADH infusion, the blood volume and extracellular to progressive increases in dietary sodium intake. As noted fluid volume are elevated by no more than 5% to 10%, and previously, the kidneys have an amazing capability to match the arterial pressure is also elevated by less than 10 mm Hg. The same is true for patients with inappropriate ADH their excretion of salt and water to intakes, which can range syndrome, in which ADH levels may be elevated several- from as low as one tenth of normal to as high as 10 times fold. normal. Thus, high levels of ADH do not cause major increases of body fluid volume or arterial pressure, although high High Sodium Intake Suppresses Antinatriuretic Sys- ADH levels can cause severe reductions in extracellular so- tems and Activates Natriuretic Systems. As sodium dium ion concentration. The reason for this is that increased intake is increased, sodium output
