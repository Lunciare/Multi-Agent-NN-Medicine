Also shown in the figure are several inhibitory in the description of reverberating neuronal circuits in synapses located directly on the axon hillock and initial Chapter 47. axon segment. This location provides especially powerful The mechanism of fatigue is mainly exhaustion or inhibition because it has the direct effect of increasing the partial exhaustion of the stores of transmitters in the threshold for excitation at the very point where the action presynaptic terminals.
