Even large por- tions of the plasma proteins diffuse freely into these spaces. Physiologic Anatomy of the Liver Hepatic Vascular and Lymph Systems The liver is the largest organ in the body, contributing about 2% of the total body weight, or about 1.5 kilograms (3.3 The function of the hepatic vascular system is discussed in pounds) in the average adult human. The basic functional Chapter 15 in connection with the portal veins and can be unit of the liver is the liver lobule, which is a cylindric struc- summarized as follows. ture several millimeters in length and 0.8 to 2 millimeters Blood Flows Through the Liver From the Portal Vein in diameter. The human liver contains 50,000 to 100,000 and Hepatic Artery individual lobules. The Liver Has High Blood Flow and Low Vascular Re- The liver lobule, shown in cut-a way
