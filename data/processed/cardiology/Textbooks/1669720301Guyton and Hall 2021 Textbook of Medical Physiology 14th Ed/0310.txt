The calcium ions initiate attractive forces between myosin cross- bridges and interaction between the heads of the cross- the actin and myosin filaments, causing them to bridges with adjacent actin filaments. slide alongside each other, which is the contractile process. calcium ions, in turn, activate the forces between the myo- 8. After a fraction of a second, the calcium ions are sin and actin filaments, and contraction begins. However, pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by a energy is needed for the contractile process to proceed.
