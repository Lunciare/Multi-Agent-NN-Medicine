To see clearly both in the distance and nearby, an older person must asympathetic nerve signals transmitted to the eye through wear bifocal glasses, with the upper segment focused for the third cranial nerve from the third nerve nucleus in the far- seeing and the lower segment focused for near- seeing brain stem, as explained in Chapter 52. Stimulation of par- (e.g., for reading). asympathetic nerves contracts both sets of ciliary muscle fibers, which relaxes the lens ligaments, thus allowing the PUPILLARY DIAMETER lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. With this increased refractive power, the eye focuses on The major function of the iris is to increase the amount of objects nearer than when the eye has less refractive power. light that enters the eye during darkness and to decrease Consequently, as a distant object moves toward the eye, the amount of light that enters the eye in daylight. The the number of parasympathetic impulses impinging on the reflexes for controlling this mechanism are considered in ciliary muscle must be progressively increased for the eye Chapter 52. 631 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B.
