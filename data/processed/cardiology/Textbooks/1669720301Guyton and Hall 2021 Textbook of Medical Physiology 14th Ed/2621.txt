52. Clinical Method for Stating Visual Acuity. The chart 9 3 for testing eyes usually consists of letters of different siz- es placed 20 feet away from the person being tested. If the person can see well the letters of a size that he or she should be able to see at 20 feet, the person is said to have 4 20/20 vision—that is, normal vision. If the person can see 8 only letters that he or she should be able to see at 200 feet, the person is said to have 20/200 vision. In other words, 7 5 the clinical method for expressing visual acuity is to use a mathematical fraction that expresses the ratio of two dis- 6 tances, which is also the ratio of a person’s visual acuity to Figure 50- 15.
