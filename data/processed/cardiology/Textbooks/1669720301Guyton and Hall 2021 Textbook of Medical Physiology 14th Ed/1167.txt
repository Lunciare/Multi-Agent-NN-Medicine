PATIENTS WITH VALVULAR LESIONS In persons with mitral stenosis, blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle is impeded and, in persons During exercise, increased blood flow is required to provide with mitral regurgitation, much of the blood that has additional oxygen and nutrients to the exercising muscles flowed into the left ventricle during diastole leaks back and remove waste products of increased metabolism. Con- into the left atrium during systole rather than being sequently, increased quantities of venous blood are returned pumped into the aorta. Therefore, either of these condi- to the heart from the peripheral circulation.

For example, in patients with aortic increase in left atrial pressure, eventually resulting in the valvular lesions, exercise can cause acute left ventricular fail- development of serious pulmonary
