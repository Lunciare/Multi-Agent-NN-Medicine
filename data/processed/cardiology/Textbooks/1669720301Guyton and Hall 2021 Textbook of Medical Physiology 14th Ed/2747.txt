Mask- edges by a loose annular ligament so that it can move ing usually removes a major share of the background inward and outward with the sound vibrations. Inward noise and allows a person to concentrate on sounds above movement causes the fluid to move forward in the scala 1000 cycles/sec, where most of the pertinent information vestibuli and scala media, and outward movement causes in voice communication is transmitted. the fluid to move backward. 664 Chapter 53 The Sense of Hearing Helicotrema distal ends, except that the distal ends are embedded in (connection between scala the loose basilar membrane. Because the fibers are stiff vestibuli and scala tympani) Scala vestibuli and free at one end, they can vibrate like the reeds of a harmonica. Stria vascularis The lengths of the basilar fibers increase progressively, beginning at the oval window and going from the base of Scala the cochlea to the apex, increasing from a length of about media 0.04 millimeter near the oval and round windows to 0.5
