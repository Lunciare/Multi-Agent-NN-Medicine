enters the peritubular blood represents a net gain of fluid HCO − by the blood, rather than merely a replacement 3 of filtered HCO −. Therefore, whenever an H+ secreted 3 Na+ NH NH into the tubular lumen combines with a buffer other than 3 3 ATP HCO −, the net effect is the addition of a new HCO − to K+ Cl– 3 3 HCO – + H+ ATP the blood. This process demonstrates one of the mecha- 3 H+ nisms whereby the kidneys can replenish the extracel- lular fluid stores of HCO −. H CO 3 2 3 Carbonic NH + + Cl– Under normal conditions, much of the filtered phos- 4 anhydrase phate is reabsorbed, and only 30 to 40 mEq/day are avail- H 2O able for buffering H+. Therefore, much of the buffering of CO 2 C+ O excess H+ in the tubular fluid in acidosis occurs through 2 the ammonia buffer system. Figure 31- 9.

NH diffuses into the tubular lumen, where it reacts 3 EXCRETION OF EXCESS H+ AND with secreted H+ to form NH 4+, which is then excreted.
