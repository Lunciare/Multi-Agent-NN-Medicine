Presence in the blood of certain chemicals and Two basic but closely allied types of acquired immunity cells that attach to foreign organisms or toxins and occur in the body. In one of these, the body develops destroy them. Some of these are: (1) lysozyme, a circulating antibodies, which are globulin molecules mucolytic polysaccharide that attacks bacteria and in the blood plasma capable of attacking the invading causes them to dissolute; (2) basic polypeptides, agent. This type of immunity is called humoral immu- which react with and inactivate certain types of nity or B-c ell immunity because B lymphocytes produce gram- positive bacteria; (3) the complement com- the antibodies. The second type of acquired immunity plex, described later, a system of about 20 proteins is achieved through formation of large numbers of that can be activated in various ways to destroy activated T lymphocytes, which are specifically crafted bacteria; and (4) natural killer lymphocytes that can in the lymph nodes to destroy the foreign agent. This recognize and destroy foreign cells, tumor cells, and type of immunity is
