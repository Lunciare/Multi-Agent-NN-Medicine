projections inside these canaliculi and is then con- ture of a parietal cell (also called an oxyntic cell), dem- ducted through the canaliculi to the secretory end of the onstrating that it contains large branching intracellular cell. 811 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Thus, the final secretion from the canaliculus con- Interstitial Parietal cell Lumen of fluid canaliculus tains water, hydrochloric acid at a concentration of about 150 to 160 mEq/L, potassium chloride at a CO CO 2 2 concentration of 15 mEq/L, and a small amount of sodium chloride. HCO 3– HCO 3– CO 2 + H+ (155 mEq/L) To produce a concentration of H+ as great as that OH– + H+ Cl– Cl– found in gastric juice requires minimal backleak into the ATP mucosa of the secreted acid. A major part of the stomach's H O 2 ability to prevent backleak of acid can be attributed to the K+ K+ K+ K+ (15 mEq/L) gastric barrier due to the formation of alkaline mucus and ATP to tight junctions between epithelia cells, as described later. If this barrier is damaged by toxic substances, such Na+ Na+ Na+ (3 mEq/L) as occurs with excessive use of aspirin or alcohol,
