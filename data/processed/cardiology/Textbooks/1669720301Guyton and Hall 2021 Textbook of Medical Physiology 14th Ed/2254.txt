Therapy is often entirely 31: HCO− different for these diseases, so it is not satisfactory simply pH=6.1 + log 3 CO to make a diagnosis of “respiratory insufficiency.” 2 USEFUL METHODS FOR STUDYING When the glass electrode is used to measure CO 2 in RESPIRATORY ABNORMALITIES blood, a miniature glass electrode is surrounded by a thin plastic membrane. A solution of sodium bicarbon- In the previous few chapters, we discussed several meth- ate of known concentration is in the space between the ods for studying respiratory abnormalities, including electrode and plastic membrane. Blood is then super- measuring vital capacity, tidal air, functional residual fused onto the outer surface of the plastic membrane, capacity, dead space, physiologic shunt, and physiological allowing CO to diffuse from the blood into the bicar- 2 dead space. This array of measurements is only part of the bonate solution. Only a drop or so of blood is required. armamentarium of the clinical pulmonary physiologist. Next, the pH is measured by the glass electrode, and the Some other tools are
