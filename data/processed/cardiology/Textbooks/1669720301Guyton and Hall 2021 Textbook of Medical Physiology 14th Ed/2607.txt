Consequently, in both eyes, tures on depth of focus. the retina sees two spots of light in perfect focus. If the retina is moved forward or backward to an out of focus po- sition (dashed lines), the size of each spot will not change much in the upper eye, but in the lower eye the size of each spot will increase greatly, becoming a “blur circle.” In other words, the upper lens system has far greater depth of focus than the bottom lens system. When a lens system has Emmetropia great depth of focus, the retina can be displaced consider- ably from the focal plane, or the lens strength can change considerably from normal, and the image will still remain nearly in sharp focus, whereas when a lens system has a “shallow” depth of focus, moving the retina only slightly away from the focal plane causes extreme blurring. The greatest possible depth of focus occurs when the Hyperopia pupil is extremely small. The reason for this is that with a very
