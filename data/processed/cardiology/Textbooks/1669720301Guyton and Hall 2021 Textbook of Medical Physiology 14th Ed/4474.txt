compliance curve, the shape of which compares favorably with that for the normal adult, as Lung Lung shown in Chapter 38. Respiratory Distress Syndrome Occurs When Sur- factant Secretion Is Deficient. In a small number of infants, especially premature infants and infants born of mothers with diabetes mellitus, severe respiratory distress develops Pulmonary artery in the early hours to the first several days after birth, and Inferior vena cava some infants die within the next day or so. The alveoli of Pulmonary vein these infants at death contain large quantities of proteina- ceous fluid, almost as if pure plasma had leaked out of the Foramen ovale capillaries into the alveoli. The fluid also contains desqua- Liver Ductus venosus mated alveolar epithelial cells. This condition is called hya- line membrane disease because microscopic slides of the lung show that the material filling the alveoli looks like a hyaline membrane. A characteristic finding in respiratory distress syndrome is failure of the respiratory epithelium to secrete adequate Gut quantities of surfactant, a substance normally secreted into Umbilical the alveoli that decreases the surface tension of the alveolar vein fluid, therefore allowing the alveoli to open easily during inspiration. The surfactant- secreting cells (type
