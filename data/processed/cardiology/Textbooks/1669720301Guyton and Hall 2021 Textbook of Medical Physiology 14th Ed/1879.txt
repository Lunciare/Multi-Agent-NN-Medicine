This combination of TNF, IL- 1, and colony- stimulating factors provides a TNF powerful feedback mechanism that begins with tissue IL-1 inflammation and proceeds to formation of large num- bers of defensive WBCs that help remove the cause of the inflammation. Endothelial cells, fibroblasts, Formation of Pus TNF lymphocytes IL-1 When neutrophils and macrophages engulf large num- GM-CSF G-CSF bers of bacteria and necrotic tissue, essentially all the GM-CSF M-CSF G-CSF neutrophils and many, if not most, of the macrophages M-CSF eventually die. After several days, a cavity is often exca- vated in the inflamed tissues. This cavity contains varying portions of necrotic tissue, dead neutrophils, dead macro- phages, and tissue fluid. This mixture is commonly known Bone marrow as pus. After the infection has been suppressed, the dead cells and necrotic tissue in the pus gradually autolyze over a period of days,
