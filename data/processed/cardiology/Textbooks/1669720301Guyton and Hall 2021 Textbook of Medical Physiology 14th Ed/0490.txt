potential of the sinus nodal tractions. The figure shows the sinus node (also called fiber between discharges is about –55 to –60 millivolts, sinoatrial [S-A ] node), in which the normal rhythmical in comparison with –85 to –90 millivolts for the ventricu- impulses are generated; the internodal pathways that con- lar muscle fiber. The cause of this lower negativity is that duct impulses from the sinus node to the atrioventricular the cell membranes of the sinus fibers are naturally leaky (A- V) node; the A- V node in which impulses from the to sodium and calcium ions, and positive charges of the atria are delayed before passing into the ventricles; the entering sodium and calcium ions neutralize some of the A- V bundle, which conducts impulses from the atria into intracellular negativity. the ventricles; and the left and right bundle branches of Before we explain the rhythmicity of the sinus nodal Purkinje fibers, which conduct the cardiac impulses to all fibers, first recall from the discussions of Chapters 5 and 9 parts of the ventricles. that cardiac muscle has three main types of membrane ion channels that play important roles in causing the voltage SINUS (SINOATRIAL) NODE changes of the
