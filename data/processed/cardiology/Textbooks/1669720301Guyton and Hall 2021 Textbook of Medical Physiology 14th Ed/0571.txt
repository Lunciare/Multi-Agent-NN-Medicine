In lead I of Figure 12-11, the recording is positive, and in lead III, The vectorcardiogram during ventricular depolarization the recording is mainly positive but negative during part (the QRS vectorcardiogram) shown in Figure 12-10 is of the cycle. If any part of a recording is negative, this that of a normal heart. Note that during most of the cycle negative potential is subtracted from the positive part of 148 Chapter 12 Electrocardiographic Interpretation of Cardiac Muscle and Coronary Blood Flow Abnormalities the potential to determine the net potential for that lead, as shown by the arrow to the right of the QRS complex for lead III. Then, each net potential for leads I and III is plotted on the axes of the respective leads, with the base of the potential at the point of intersection of the axes, as shown in Figure 12-11. To determine the vector of the total QRS ventricular I II III mean electrical potential, one draws perpendicular lines III – (the dashed lines in the figure) from the apices of leads I and III, respectively. The point of intersection of these two perpendicular (dashed) lines represents, by vectorial analysis, the apex of the mean QRS
