from true because much overlap exists from cofugal signals automatically decrease transmission in the segment to segment. relay nuclei. This action does two things: First, it decreases Figure 48- 14 shows that the anal region of the body lies lateral spread of the sensory signals into adjacent neurons in the dermatome of the most distal cord segment, dermat- and, therefore, increases the degree of sharpness in the sig- ome S5. In the embryo, this is the tail region and the most nal pattern. Second, it keeps the sensory system operating distal portion of the body. The legs originate embryologi- in a range of sensitivity that is not so low that the signals are cally from the lumbar and upper sacral segments (L2 to S3), ineffectual nor so high that the system is swamped beyond rather than from the distal sacral segments, which is evi- its capacity to differentiate sensory patterns. This principle dent from the dermatomal map.
