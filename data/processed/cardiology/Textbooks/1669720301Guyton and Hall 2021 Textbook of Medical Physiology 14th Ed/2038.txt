These forces water have an especially strong attraction for one anoth- can be divided into two parts: (1) elastic forces of the lung er. As a result, the water surface is always attempting to tissue; and (2) elastic forces caused by surface tension of contract. This is what holds raindrops together—a tight the fluid that lines the inside walls of the alveoli and other contractile membrane of water molecules around the lung air spaces. entire surface of the raindrop. Now, let us reverse these The elastic forces of the lung tissue are determined principles and see what happens on the inner surfaces of mainly by elastin and collagen fibers interwoven among the alveoli. Here, the water surface is also attempting to the lung parenchyma. In deflated lungs, these fibers contract. This tends to force air out of the alveoli through are in an elastically contracted and kinked state; then, the bronchi and, in doing so, causes the alveoli to try to when the lungs expand, the fibers become stretched and collapse. The net effect is to
