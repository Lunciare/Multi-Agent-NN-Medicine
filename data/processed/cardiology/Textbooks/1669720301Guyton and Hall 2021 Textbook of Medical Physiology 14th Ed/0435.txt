another thousandth of a second. In cardiac muscle, the action potential is caused by Outward iK+ opening of two types of channels: (1) the same voltage- activated fast sodium channels as those in skeletal muscle; Ionic currents and (2) another entirely different population of L- type calcium channels (slow calcium channels), which are also Inward iCa2+ called calcium- sodium channels. This second population of channels differs from the fast sodium channels in that they are slower to open and, even more importantly, remain iNa+ open for several tenths of a second. During this time, a large quantity of both calcium and sodium ions flows through Figure 9- 5. Phases of action potential of cardiac ventricular muscle cell and associated ionic currents for sodium (iNa+), calcium (iCa2+), these channels to the interior of the cardiac muscle fiber, and potassium (iK+). and this activity maintains a prolonged period of depolar- ization, causing the plateau in the action potential. Fur- thermore, the calcium ions that enter during this plateau Phase 0 (Depolarization): Fast Sodium Channels phase activate the muscle contractile process, whereas the Open. When the cardiac cell is stimulated and depolar- calcium ions that cause skeletal muscle contraction are izes, the membrane
