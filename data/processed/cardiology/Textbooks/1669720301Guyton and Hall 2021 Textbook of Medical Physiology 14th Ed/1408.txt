Note that this appearance of glucose in the urine rate of net sodium reabsorption because a significant (at the threshold) occurs before the transport maximum is amount of sodium transported out of the cell leaks back reached. One reason for the difference between the thresh- into the tubular lumen through junctions of the epithe- old and transport maximum is that not all nephrons have lial cells. The rate at which this backleak occurs depends the same transport maximum for glucose, and some of the on (1) the permeability of the tight junctions; and (2) the nephrons therefore begin to excrete glucose before others interstitial physical forces, which determine the rate of have reached their transport maximum.
