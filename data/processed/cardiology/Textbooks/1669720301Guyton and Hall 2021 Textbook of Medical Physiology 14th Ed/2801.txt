taste receptor cell. Sour taste, associated with acidic food or drink, is believed to be sensed by ion channels that are opened by hydrogen ions although the precise mechanisms are Basal cell not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that an acid- Sensory sensitive potassium channel (KIR2.1) and a hydrogen afferent ion–selective ion channel (otopetrin 1) may mediate acid B nerve fiber responses in taste receptor cells.
