and are therefore often called noncoding RNA. The RNA movement miRNAs are processed by the cell into molecules that Figure 3-9. A messenger RNA strand is moving through two ribo- are complementary to mRNA and act to decrease gene somes. As each codon passes through, an amino acid is added to the expression. The generation of miRNAs involves special growing protein chain, which is shown in the right- hand ribosome. The transfer RNA molecule transports each specific amino acid to the processing of longer primary precursor RNAs called pri- newly forming protein. miRNAs, which are the primary transcripts of the gene. 36 Chapter 3 Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis, Cell Function, and Cell Reproduction Another type of miRNA is small interfering RNA Protein-coding gene miRNA (siRNA), also called silencing RNA or short interfering RNA. The siRNAs are short, double- stranded RNA mol- ecules, comprised of 20 to 25 nucleotides, that interfere with expression of specific genes. siRNAs generally refer Transcription Transcription of mRNA of pri-miRNA to synthetic miRNAs and can be administered to silence pri-miRNA expression of specific genes. They are designed to avoid nuclear processing by the microprocessor complex and, Microprocessor after the siRNA enters the cytoplasm, it activates
