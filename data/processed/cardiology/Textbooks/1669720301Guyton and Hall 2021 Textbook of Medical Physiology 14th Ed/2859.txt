Also, prolonged from the stimulus, but the reflex may not be confined to afterdischarge occurs after strong pain stimuli, almost flexor muscles, even though it is basically the same type certainly resulting from recurrent pathways that initiate of reflex. Therefore, the many patterns of these reflexes oscillation in reverberating interneuron circuits.
