balance by two types of neurons of the arcuate nuclei: (1) pro-o piomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that release α–melanocyte- stimulating hormone (α- MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-r egulated transcript (CART), decreasing food intake and increas- ing energy expenditure; and (2) neurons that produce agouti- related protein (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), increasing food intake and reducing energy expenditure. α- MSH released by POMC neurons stimulates melanocortin receptors (MCR-3 and MCR- 4) in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), which then activate neuronal pathways that project to the nucleus tractus solitarius and increase sympathetic activity and energy expenditure. AGRP acts as an antagonist of MCR- 4. Insulin, leptin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) are hormones that inhibit AGRP- NPY neurons and stimulate adjacent POMC- CART neurons, thereby reducing food intake. Ghrelin, a hormone secreted from the stomach, activates AGRP-N PY neurons and stimulates food intake. LepR, Leptin receptor; Y r, neuropeptide Y receptor.
