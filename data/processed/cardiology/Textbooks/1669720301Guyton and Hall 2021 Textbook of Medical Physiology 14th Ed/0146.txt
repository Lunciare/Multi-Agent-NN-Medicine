Conversely, the pyrimidines inhibit their own enzymes but activate the purine enzymes. In this way, there is continual cross- talk between the synthesizing sys- tems for these two substances, resulting in almost exactly C D equal amounts of the two substances in the cells at all times. Summary. There are two principal mechanisms whereby cells control proper proportions and quantities of different cellular constituents: (1) genetic regulation; and (2) enzyme regulation. The genes can be activated or inhibited, and likewise, the enzyme systems can be activated or inhibited. These regulatory mechanisms usually function as feedback E F control systems that continually monitor the cell’s biochem- ical composition and make corrections as needed. However, on occasion, substances from outside the cell (especially some of the hormones discussed in this text) also control the intracellular biochemical reactions by activating or in- hibiting one or more of the intracellular control systems.
