expressed as osmoles per kilogram of water; it is called the radioactivity of a mixed blood sample can be mea- osmolarity when it is expressed as osmoles per liter of solu- sured, and the total blood volume can be calculated using tion. In dilute solutions such as the body fluids, these two the indicator- dilution principle. One substance that can terms can be used almost synonymously because the dif- used to label the red blood cells is radioactive chromium ferences are small. Most of the calculations used clinically (51Cr), which binds tightly with the red blood cells. and the calculations expressed in the next several chap- ters are based on osmolarities rather than osmolalities. FLUID EXCHANGE AND OSMOTIC Calculation of the Osmolarity and Osmotic Pressure EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN INTRACELLULAR AND EXTRACELLULAR of a Solution. Using the van’t Hoff law, one can calcu- FLUID late the potential osmotic pressure of a solution, assuming that the cell membrane is impermeable to the solute. For A frequent problem in treating seriously ill patients is example, the osmotic pressure of a 0.9% sodium chloride maintaining adequate fluids in one or both of the intra- solution is calculated as follows. A 0.9% solution means cellular and
