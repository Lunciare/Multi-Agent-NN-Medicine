The scala media is filled with a fluid called the same frequencies, and these volleys are transmitted by endolymph, in contradistinction to the perilymph present in the cochlear nerve into the cochlear nuclei of the brain. It is the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The scala vestibuli and further suggested that the cochlear nuclei can distinguish scala tympani communicate directly with the subarachnoid the different frequencies of the volleys. In fact, destruction space around the brain, so the perilymph is almost identical of the entire apical half of the cochlea, which destroys the to cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, the endolymph that fills the scala media is an entirely different fluid secreted by the basilar membrane where all lower frequency sounds are stria vascularis, a highly vascular area on the outer wall of normally detected, does not totally eliminate discrimina- the scala media. Endolymph contains a high concentration tion of the lower frequency sounds. of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, which is DETERMINATION OF LOUDNESS exactly opposite to the contents of perilymph. An electrical potential of about +80 millivolts exists all Loudness is determined by the auditory system in at least the time between endolymph and perilymph, with posi- three
