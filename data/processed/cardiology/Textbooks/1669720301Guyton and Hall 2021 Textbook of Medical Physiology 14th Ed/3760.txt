the following equation: the muscle cells, (2) phosphocreatine in the cells, and (3) anaerobic energy released by glycolytic breakdown of gly- Phosphocreatine + ADP cogen to lactic acid. The maximum amount of ATP in muscle is only about 5 ATP + Creatine mmol/L of intracellular fluid, and this amount can maintain maximum muscle contraction for no more than a second The higher energy level of the high- energy phosphate or so. The amount of phosphocreatine in the cells is three bond in phosphocreatine (1000–1500 calories per mole to eight times this amount, but even by using all the phos- greater than that in ATP) causes the reaction between phocreatine, maximum contraction can be maintained for phosphocreatine and ADP to proceed rapidly toward the only 5 to 10 seconds. formation of new ATP whenever the slightest amount of Release of energy by glycolysis can occur much more ATP expends its energy elsewhere. Therefore, the slightest rapidly than can oxidative release of energy. Consequently, usage of ATP by the cells calls forth the energy from the most of the extra energy required during strenuous activity phosphocreatine to synthesize new ATP. This effect keeps that lasts for more than 5 to 10 seconds
