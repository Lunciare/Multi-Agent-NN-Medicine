thyroid gland is composed symporter, which co- transports one iodide ion along of large numbers of closed follicles (100–300 micrometers with two sodium ions across the basolateral (plasma) in diameter) that are filled with a secretory substance membrane into the cell. The energy for transporting called colloid and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells that iodide against a concentration gradient comes from the secrete into the interior of the follicles. The major con- sodium- potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K + stituent of colloid is the large glycoprotein thyroglobulin, ATPase) pump, which pumps sodium out of the cell, 941 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction thereby establishing a low intracellular sodium concen- This process of concentrating the iodide in the cell is tration and a gradient for facilitated diffusion of sodium called iodide trapping. In a normal gland, the iodide pump into the cell. concentrates the iodide to about 30 times its concentra- tion in the blood. When the thyroid gland becomes maxi- mally active, this concentration ratio can rise to as high as 250 times. The rate of iodide trapping by the thyroid is influenced by several factors, the most important being the concentration of TSH; TSH stimulates and hypoph- ysectomy
