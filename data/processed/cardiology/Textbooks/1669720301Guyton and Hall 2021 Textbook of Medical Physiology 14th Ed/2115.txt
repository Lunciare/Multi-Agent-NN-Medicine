Conversely, in the case of Pressure is caused by multiple impacts of moving mole- molecules that are repelled, high partial pressure will devel- cules against a surface. Therefore, the pressure of a gas act- op with fewer dissolved molecules.

At normal body temperature, 37°C (98.6°F), this vapor pressure is 47 mm Hg. Therefore, once the gas mixture has become fully humidified—that is, once it is in equilibrium with the water—the partial pressure of the water vapor in the gas mixture is 47 mm Hg. This partial pressure, like the other partial pressures, is designated as Pho. 2 The vapor pressure of water depends entirely on the tem- perature of the water. The higher the temperature, the great- Figure 40- 1. Diffusion of oxygen from one end of a chamber to the other. The difference between
