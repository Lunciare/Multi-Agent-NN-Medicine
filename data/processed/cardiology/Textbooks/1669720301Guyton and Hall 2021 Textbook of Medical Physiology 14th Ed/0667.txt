P represents the pressure at the origin of the vessel Ordinarily, blood flow is expressed in milliliters per 1 and P is the pressure at the other end. Resistance occurs minute or liters per minute, but it can be expressed in 2 as a result of friction between the flowing blood and the milliliters per second or in any other units of flow and intravascular endothelium all along the inside of the ves- time. sel.
