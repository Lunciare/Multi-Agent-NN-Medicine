100 cycles/sec sound can be detected pathways: (1) in the trapezoid body; (2) in the commissure only if its intensity is 10,000 times as great as this. between the two nuclei of the lateral lemnisci; and (3) in Frequency Range of Hearing. The frequencies of sound the commissure connecting the two inferior colliculi. that a young person can hear are between 20 and 20,000 Second, many collateral fibers from the auditory cycles/sec. However, referring again to Figure 53- 8, we tracts pass directly into the reticular activating system of see that the sound range depends to a great extent on the brain stem. This system projects diffusely upward in loudness.

The Special Senses Firing Rates at Different Levels of the Auditory Pathways. Single nerve fibers entering the cochlear nuclei from the auditory nerve can fire at rates up to at least 1000/ sec, with the rate being determined mainly by the loud- ness of the sound. At sound frequencies up to 2000 to 4000 cycles/sec,
