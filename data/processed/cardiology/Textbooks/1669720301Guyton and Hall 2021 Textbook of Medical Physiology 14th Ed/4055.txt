are controlled by releas- Portal Median ing factors from the hypothalamus, an important releasing vessel eminence (CRF) factor also controls ACTH secretion. This factor is called corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF). It is secreted into the primary capillary plexus of the hypophysial portal system Inhibits Relieves in the median eminence of the hypothalamus and then car- ried to the anterior pituitary gland, where it induces ACTH ACTH secretion. CRF is a peptide composed of 41 amino acids. The cell bodies of the neurons that secrete CRF are located mainly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. This nucleus in turn receives many nervous connections Cortisol Adrenal cortex from the limbic system and lower brain stem. The anterior pituitary gland can secrete only minute quantities of ACTH in the absence of CRF. Instead, most 1. Gluconeogenesis conditions that cause high ACTH secretory rates initiate 2.
