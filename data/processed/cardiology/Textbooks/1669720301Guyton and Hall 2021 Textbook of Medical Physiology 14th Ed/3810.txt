mecha- nism, the panting mechanism, is used by many animals as a means of dissipating heat. 80 The phenomenon of panting is “turned on” by the ther- moregulator centers of the brain. That is, when the blood 70 becomes overheated, the hypothalamus initiates neuro- genic signals to decrease the body temperature. One of these signals initiates panting. The actual panting process 60 30 50 70 90 110 130 150 is controlled by a panting center that is associated with the pneumotaxic respiratory center located in the pons. Atmospheric temperature (°F) When an animal pants, it breathes in and out rapidly, Figure 74- 6.
