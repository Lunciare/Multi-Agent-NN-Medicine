Insensible water loss through the respiratory tract The relative constancy of the body fluids is remarkable, normally averages about 300 to 400 ml/day. As air because there is continuous exchange of fluid and solutes enters the respiratory tract, it becomes saturated with with the external environment, as well as within the dif- moisture to a vapor pressure of about 47 mm Hg before ferent body compartments.
