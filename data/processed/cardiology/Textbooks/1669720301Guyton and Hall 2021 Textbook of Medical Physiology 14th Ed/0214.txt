Primary Active Transport and Secondary Active Transport. Active transport is divided into two types ac- cording to the source of the energy used to facilitate the transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the energy is de- rived directly from the breakdown of adenosine triphos- ATPase phate (ATP) or some other high-e nergy phosphate com- pound. In secondary active transport, the energy is derived 3Na+ ADP ATP + secondarily from energy that has been stored in the form Inside 2K+ Pi of ionic concentration differences of secondary molecular Figure 4-12.
