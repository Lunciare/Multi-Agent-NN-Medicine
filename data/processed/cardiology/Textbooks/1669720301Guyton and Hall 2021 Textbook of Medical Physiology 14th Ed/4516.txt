is clear that a person has the capability of extreme power surges for short periods, such as during a 100-m eter 20 dash that is completed entirely within 10 seconds, whereas for long- term endurance events, the power output of the muscles 10 is only one-fourth as great as during the initial power surge. This does not mean that one’s athletic performance is four times as great during the initial power surge as it is for 0 the next 30 minutes, because the efficiency for translation 8–11 12–15 16–19 20–39 40–59 60–79 ≥80 of muscle power output into athletic performance is often Age group (yrs) much less during rapid activity than during less rapid but Figure 85- 1 Average percentage body fat in males and females at sustained activity.

Another measure of muscle performance is endurance. can readily understand how it is possible for this tendon at Endurance, to
