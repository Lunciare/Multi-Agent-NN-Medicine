the concentration gradient of the chemotactic substance. The concentration is greatest near the source, which directs the unidirectional movement of the WBCs. Chemotaxis Chemotaxis is effective up to 100 micrometers away from an inflamed source tissue. Therefore, because almost no tissue area is more than 50 micrometers away from a capillary, the chemo- tactic signal can easily move hordes of WBCs from the capillaries into the inflamed area. Chemotactic substance PHAGOCYTOSIS Figure 34-2.

Phagocytes must be selective of the material that is phagocytized; otherwise, normal cells and harmful agents. The neutrophils are mature cells that structures of the body might be ingested.
