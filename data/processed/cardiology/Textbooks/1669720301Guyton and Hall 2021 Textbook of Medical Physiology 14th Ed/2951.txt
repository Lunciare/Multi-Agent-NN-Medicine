A pathway that originates in (1) the intermediate zone the functional unit, which is repeated with little varia- of the cerebellar hemisphere and then passes through tion 30 million times in the cerebellum. The output from (2) the interposed nucleus to (3) the ventrolateral and the functional unit is from a deep nuclear cell. This cell ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus and then to (4) the cerebral cortex to (5) several midline structures of is continually under both excitatory and inhibitory influ- the thalamus and then to (6) the basal ganglia and (7) ences. The excitatory influences arise from direct connec- the red nucleus and reticular formation of the upper tions with afferent fibers that enter the cerebellum from 714 xetroC Chapter 57 Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Overall Motor Control clear cells by both the climbing and the mossy fibers ex- the brain or the periphery.
