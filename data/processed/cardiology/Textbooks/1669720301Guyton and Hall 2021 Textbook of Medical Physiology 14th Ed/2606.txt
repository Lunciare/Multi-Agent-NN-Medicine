The Special Senses The amount of light that enters the eye through the pupil is proportional to the area of the pupil or to the square of the diameter of the pupil. The pupil of the human eye can become as small as about 1.5 millimeters Point sources of light and as large as 8 millimeters in diameter. The quantity of light entering the eye can change about 30- fold as a result of changes in pupillary aperture. Lens Focal point “Depth of Focus” of the Lens System Increases With Lens Decreasing Pupillary Diameter. Figure 50- 11 shows two eyes that are exactly alike except for the diameters of the pupillary apertures. In the upper eye, the pupillary aper- Point sources of light ture is small and, in the lower eye, the aperture is large. In front of each of these two eyes are two small point sources of light; light from each passes through the pupillary aper- Figure 50- 11.
