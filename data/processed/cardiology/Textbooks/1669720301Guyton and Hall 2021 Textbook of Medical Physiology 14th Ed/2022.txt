Figure 37- 7 shows the rela- level so much that blood coagulation is blocked. tionship of prothrombin concentration to prothrombin Any substance that deionizes the blood calcium will time. The method for determining prothrombin time is prevent coagulation. The negatively charged citrate ion is the following. especially valuable for this purpose; it is mixed with blood Blood removed from the patient is immediately oxa- usually in the form of sodium, ammonium, or potassium lated so that none of the prothrombin can change into citrate. The citrate ion combines with calcium in the thrombin. Then, a large excess of calcium ion and tis- blood to produce a nonionized calcium compound, and sue factor is quickly mixed with the oxalated blood. The the lack of ionic calcium prevents coagulation. Citrate excess calcium nullifies the effect of the oxalate, and the anticoagulants have an important advantage over the oxa- tissue factor activates the prothrombin to thrombin reac- late anticoagulants because oxalate is toxic to the body, tion by means of the extrinsic clotting pathway.
