Finally, the greater the veloc- partial pressure of the gas is greater in the dissolved state in ity of kinetic movement of the molecules, which is inversely the blood, which is normally true for CO , then net diffu- 2 proportional to the square root of the molecular weight, the sion will occur toward the gas phase in the alveoli. greater the rate of diffusion of the gas. All these factors can Vapor Pressure of Water be expressed in a single formula, as follows: When nonhumidified air is breathed into the respiratory ΔP×A×S D∝ passageways, water immediately evaporates from the surfac- d×√MW es of these passages and humidifies the air. This results from the fact that water molecules, like different dissolved gas in which D is the diffusion rate, ΔP is the partial pres- molecules, are continually escaping from the water surface sure difference between the two ends of the diffusion path- into the gas phase.
