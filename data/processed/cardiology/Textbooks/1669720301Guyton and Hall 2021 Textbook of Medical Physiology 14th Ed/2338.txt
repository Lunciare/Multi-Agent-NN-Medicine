and 9 volumes percent dissolved in the blood 400/121.9 13 500/152.4 16 water. As this blood passes through the tissue capillaries, 1 liter and the tissues use their normal amount of O , about 5 ml 2 Sea level from each 100 ml of blood, the O content on leaving the 2 tissue capillaries is still 24 volumes percent (point B in the 1/2 liter 33 ft figure). At this point, the Po is approximately 1200 mm 2 Hg, which means that O is delivered to the tissues at this 2 extremely high pressure instead of at the normal value of 40 mm Hg. Thus, once the alveolar Po rises above a criti- 2 cal level, the hemoglobin-O buffer mechanism (discussed 2 1/4 liter 100 ft in Chapter 41) is no longer capable of keeping the tissue Po in the normal safe range, between 20 and 60 mm Hg. 2 Acute Oxygen Poisoning. The extremely high tissue Po 2 that occurs when O is breathed at a very high alveolar O 2 2 pressure can be detrimental to many of the body’s tissues. For example, breathing O at 4 atm pressure of O (Po = 2 2 2 3040 mm
