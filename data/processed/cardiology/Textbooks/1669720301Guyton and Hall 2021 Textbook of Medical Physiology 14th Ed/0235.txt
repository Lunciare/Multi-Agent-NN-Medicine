the Ion Concentration Difference Concentration Differences Across a Across a Membrane. The diffusion potential across a Selectively Permeable Membrane membrane that exactly opposes the net diffusion of a par- In Figure 5- 1A, the potassium concentration is great ticular ion through the membrane is called the Nernst po- inside a nerve fiber membrane but very low outside the tential for that ion, a term that was introduced in Chapter membrane. Let us assume that the membrane in this case 4. The magnitude of the Nernst potential is determined is permeable to the potassium ions but not to any other by the ratio of the concentrations of that specific ion on ions. Because of the large potassium concentration gradi- the two sides of the membrane. The greater this ratio, the ent from the inside toward the outside, there is a strong greater the tendency for the ion to diffuse in one direction tendency for potassium ions to diffuse outward through and therefore the greater the Nernst potential required to the membrane. As they do so, they carry positive electri- prevent additional net diffusion. The following equation, cal charges to the outside, thus creating electropositivity called the Nernst equation, can be used
