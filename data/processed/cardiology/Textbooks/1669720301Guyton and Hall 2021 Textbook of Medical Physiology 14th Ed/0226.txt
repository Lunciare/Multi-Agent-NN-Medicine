the carrier Sodium co- transport of glucose and amino acids protein. Once both have become bound, a conformational occurs especially through the epithelial cells of the intes- change occurs, and energy released by the action of the tinal tract and the renal tubules of the kidneys to promote sodium ion moving to the interior causes the other sub- absorption of these substances into the blood. This pro- stance to move to the exterior. cess will be discussed in later chapters. Other important co- transport mechanisms in at least Co- Transport of Glucose and Amino Acids some cells include co- transport of potassium, chloride, Along with Sodium Ions bicarbonate, phosphate, iodine, iron, and urate ions. Glucose and many amino acids are transported into Sodium Counter- Transport of Calcium and most cells against large concentration gradients; the Hydrogen Ions mechanism of this action is entirely by co- transport, as shown in Figure 4-13. Note that the transport carrier Two especially important counter- transporters (i.e., protein has two binding sites on its exterior side, one for transport in a direction opposite to the primary ion) are sodium and one for glucose. Also, the concentration of sodium- calcium counter- transport and sodium- hydrogen sodium
