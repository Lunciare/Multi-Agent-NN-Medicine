at rates up to at least 1000/ sec, with the rate being determined mainly by the loud- ness of the sound. At sound frequencies up to 2000 to 4000 cycles/sec, the auditory nerve impulses are often synchro- nized with the sound waves, but they do not necessarily occur with every wave. In the auditory tracts of the brain stem, the firing is usually no longer synchronized with the sound frequency, Primary auditory except at sound frequencies below 200 cycles/sec. Above cortex the level of the inferior colliculi, even this synchronization Midbrain is mainly lost. These findings demonstrate that the sound Medial geniculate signals are not transmitted unchanged directly from the ear nucleus to the higher levels of the brain; instead, information from (thalamus) the sound signals begins to be dissected from the impulse traffic at levels as low as the cochlear nuclei. We will have more to say about this subject later, especially in relation to Inferior perception of direction from which sound comes. Midbrain colliculus FUNCTION OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IN HEARING The projection area of auditory signals to the cerebral cor- tex is shown in Figure 53- 10, which demonstrates that Nucleus of the auditory cortex lies principally
