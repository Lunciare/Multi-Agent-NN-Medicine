RPF and hematocrit (the per- centage of red blood cells in the blood). If the hema- tocrit is 0.45 and the total RPF is 650 ml/min, the total blood flow through both kidneys is 650/(1 − 0.45), or Renal venous PAH = 1182 ml/min. 0.001 mg/ml FILTRATION FRACTION IS CALCULATED FROM GFR DIVIDED BY RPF U = 5.85 mg/ml PA.H V = 1 ml/min To calculate the filtration fraction, which is the fraction Figure 28- 23 Measurement of renal plasma flow from the renal of plasma that filters through the glomerular membrane, clearance of para- aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is freely filtered by one must first know the RPF (PAH clearance) and the the glomerular capillaries and is also secreted from the peritubular GFR (inulin clearance). If the RPF is 650 ml/min and the capillary blood into the tubular lumen. The amount of PAH in the GFR is 125 ml/min, the filtration fraction (FF) is calcu- plasma of the renal artery is about equal to the amount of PAH ex- creted in the urine. Therefore, the renal plasma flow can be calculat- lated as follows: ed from the clearance of PAH. To be more accurate, one can correct for the
