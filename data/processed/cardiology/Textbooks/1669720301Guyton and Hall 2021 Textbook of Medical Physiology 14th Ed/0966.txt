that reduce the reabsorption of salt and water trol responses, expressed as feedback gain, of eight arterial by the renal tubules include, in particular, drugs that block pressure control mechanisms. These mechanisms can be active transport of sodium through the tubular wall; this divided into three groups: (1) those that react rapidly, blockage in turn also prevents the reabsorption of water, within seconds or minutes; (2) those that respond over an as explained earlier in the chapter. These natriuretic or intermediate time period—that is, minutes or hours; and diuretic drugs are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 32. (3) those that provide long- term arterial pressure regula- tion for days, months, and years.
