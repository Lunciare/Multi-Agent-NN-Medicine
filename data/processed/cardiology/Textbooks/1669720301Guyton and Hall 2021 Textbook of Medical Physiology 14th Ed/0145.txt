Thus, cAMP acts as Nuclear an enzyme activator for the enzyme phosphorylase and membrane thereby helps control intracellular ATP concentration. Another interesting example of both enzyme inhibi- Nucleolus tion and enzyme activation occurs in the formation of the Centriole purines and pyrimidines. These substances are needed by Aster the cell in approximately equal quantities for the formation A B of DNA and RNA. When purines are formed, they inhibit the enzymes that are required for formation of additional purines. However, they activate the enzymes for formation of pyrimidines. Conversely, the pyrimidines inhibit their own enzymes but activate the purine enzymes. In this way, there is continual cross- talk between the synthesizing sys- tems for these two substances, resulting
