or PRIMARY (ESSENTIAL) HYPERTENSION when the tractus solitarius is destroyed in each side of the medulla oblongata. These are the areas where the nerves About 90% to 95% of all people who have hypertension from the carotid and aortic baroreceptors connect in the are said to have primary hypertension, also referred to as brain stem. The sudden cessation of normal nerve signals essential hypertension by many clinicians. These terms from the baroreceptors has the same effect on the nervous simply mean that the hypertension is of unknown origin, in pressure control mechanisms as a sudden reduction of the arterial pressure in the aorta and carotid arteries. That is, contrast to the forms of hypertension that are secondary loss of the normal inhibitory effect on the vasomotor center to known causes, such as renal artery stenosis or mono- caused by normal baroreceptor nervous signals allows the genic forms of hypertension. vasomotor center suddenly to become extremely active and In most patients, excess weight gain and a sedentary life- the mean arterial pressure to increase from 100 mm Hg to style appear to play a major role in causing primary hyper- as high as 160 mm Hg.
