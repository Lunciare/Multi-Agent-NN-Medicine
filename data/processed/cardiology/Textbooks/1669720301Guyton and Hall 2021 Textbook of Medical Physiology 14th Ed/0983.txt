In Chapter 9, we saw that a combination of sympathet- Cardiac output= Total peripheral resistancee ic stimulation and parasympathetic inhibition does two things to increase the pumping effectiveness of the heart: Thus, any time the long- term level of total peripheral (1) it greatly increases the heart rate—sometimes, in resistance changes (but no other functions of the circula- young people, from the normal level of 72 beats/min up to tion change), the cardiac output changes quantitatively in 180 to 200 beats/min—and (2) it increases the strength of exactly the opposite direction. heart contraction (called increased contractility) to twice its normal strength. Combining these two effects, maxi- Limits for the Cardiac Output mal nervous excitation of the heart can raise the plateau There are definite limits to the amount of blood that the level of the cardiac output curve to almost twice the pla- heart can pump, which can be expressed quantitatively in teau of the normal curve, as shown by the 25- L/min level the form of cardiac output curves. of the uppermost curve in Figure 20- 5.
