of Oxygen by the Pulmonary Blood During TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN FROM THE Exercise. During strenuous exercise, a person’s body LUNGS TO THE BODY TISSUES may require as much as 20 times the normal amount In Chapter 40, we pointed out that gases can move from of oxygen. Also, because of increased cardiac output one point to another by diffusion, and that the cause of during exercise, the time that the blood remains in the this movement is always a partial pressure difference from pulmonary capillary may be reduced to less than one- the first point to the next. Thus, O diffuses from the alve- half normal. Yet, because of the great safety factor for 2 oli into the pulmonary capillary blood because the oxygen diffusion of O 2 through the pulmonary membrane, the partial pressure (Po 2) in the alveoli is greater than the Po 2 blood still becomes almost saturated with O 2 by the time in the pulmonary capillary blood. In the other tissues of it leaves the pulmonary capillaries. This can be explained the body, a higher Po in the capillary blood than in the as follows. 2 tissues causes O to diffuse into the surrounding cells.
