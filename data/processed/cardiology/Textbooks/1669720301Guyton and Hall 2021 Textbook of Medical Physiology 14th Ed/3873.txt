Translation P STAT3 of an enzyme-l inked receptor is the leptin receptor (Figure 75- 5). Leptin is a hormone secreted by fat cells and has Target gene Table 75- 2 Hormones That Use Receptor Tyrosine mRNA Kinase Signaling Fibroblast growth factor Figure 75- 5. An enzyme- linked receptor—the leptin receptor. The re- Growth hormone ceptor exists as a homodimer (two identical parts), and leptin binds to Hepatocyte growth factor the extracellular part of the receptor, causing phosphorylation (P) and Insulin activation of the intracellular associated janus kinase 2 (JAK2). This Insulin- like growth factor- 1 mechanism causes phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator Leptin of transcription (STAT) proteins, which then activates the transcription Prolactin of target genes and the synthesis of proteins. JAK2 phosphorylation Vascular endothelial growth factor also activates several other enzyme systems that mediate some of the more rapid effects of leptin.
