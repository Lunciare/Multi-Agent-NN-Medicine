already dissolved in the blood are bouncing randomly in weight of the gas; and (5) the temperature of the fluid. In the fluid of the blood, and some of these bouncing molecules the body, the temperature remains reasonably constant and escape back into the alveoli. The rate at which they escape usually need not be considered. is directly proportional to their partial pressure in the blood. The greater the solubility of the gas, the greater the num- But, in which direction will net diffusion of the gas oc- ber of molecules available to diffuse for any given partial cur? The answer is that net diffusion is determined by the pressure difference. The greater the cross- sectional area of difference between the two partial pressures. If the partial the diffusion pathway, the greater the total number of mol- pressure is greater in the gas phase in the alveoli, as is nor- ecules that diffuse. Conversely, the greater the distance the mally true for oxygen, then more molecules will diffuse into molecules must diffuse, the longer it will take the molecules the blood than in the other direction. Alternatively, if the to diffuse the entire distance. Finally, the greater the veloc- partial
