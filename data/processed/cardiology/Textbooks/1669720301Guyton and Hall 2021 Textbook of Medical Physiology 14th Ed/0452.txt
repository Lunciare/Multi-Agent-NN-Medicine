pressure rises slightly above 8 mm Hg), the ventricular traction; it results from slow flow of blood into the atria pressures push the semilunar valves open. Immediately, from the veins while the A- V valves are closed during ven- blood is ejected out of the ventricles into the aorta and tricular contraction. Then, when ventricular contraction is pulmonary artery. Approximately 60% of the blood in the over, the A- V valves open, allowing this stored atrial blood ventricles at the end of diastole is ejected during systole; to flow rapidly into the ventricles, causing the v wave to about 70% of this portion flows out during the first third disappear. of the ejection period, with the remaining 30% emptying during the next two thirds. Therefore, the first third is FUNCTION OF THE VENTRICLES AS PUMPS called the period of rapid ejection, and the last two thirds is called the period of slow ejection. The Ventricles Fill with Blood During Diastole. During ventricular systole, large amounts of blood Period of Isovolumic (Isometric) Relaxation. At the accumulate in the right and left atria because of the end of systole, ventricular relaxation begins suddenly, al- closed A- V valves. Therefore, as soon as
