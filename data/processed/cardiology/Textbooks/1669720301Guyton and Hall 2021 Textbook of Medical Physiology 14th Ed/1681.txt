The primary 85% (3672 mEq/day) mechanism for removal of these acids from the body is 4320 renal excretion. The kidneys must also prevent the loss of mEq/day bicarbonate in the urine, a task that is quantitatively more important than the excretion of nonvolatile acids. Each day, the kidneys filter about 4320 mEq of HCO 3− (180 L/ >4.9% day × 24 mEq/L); under normal conditions, almost all of (215 10% mEq/day) this is reabsorbed from the tubules, thereby conserving (432 the primary buffer system of the extracellular fluid. mEq/day) As discussed later, both the reabsorption of HCO − 3 and excretion of H+ are accomplished through the pro- cess of H+ secretion by the tubules. Because HCO − must 3 react with a secreted H+ to form H CO before it can be 2 3 reabsorbed, 4320 mEq of H+ must be secreted each day just to reabsorb the filtered HCO −. Then, an additional 3 80 mEq of H+ must be secreted to
