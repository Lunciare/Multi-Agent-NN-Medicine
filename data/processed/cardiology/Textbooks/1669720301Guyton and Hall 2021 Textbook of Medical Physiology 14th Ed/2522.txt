It is POSITION SENSES likely that these are the receptors most responsible for The position senses are frequently also called propriocep- detecting rate of movement. tive senses. They can be divided into two subtypes: (1) Processing of Position Sense Information in the D orsal static position sense, which means conscious perception of the orientation of the different parts of the body with Column–Medial Lemniscal Pathway. Referring to respect to one another; and (2) rate of movement sense, Figure 48- 12, one sees that thalamic neurons responding also called kinesthesia or dynamic proprioception. to joint rotation are of two categories: (1) those maximally stimulated when the joint is at full rotation; and (2) those Position Sensory Receptors. Knowledge of position, maximally stimulated when the joint is at minimal rota- both static and dynamic, depends on knowing the de- tion. Thus, the signals from the individual joint r eceptors grees of angulation of all joints in all planes and their rates are used to tell the psyche how much each joint is rotated. 608 htgnerts sulumits deterpretnI )stinu yrartibra( Chapter 48 Somatic Sensations: I.
