As a result, the legs or long compression stockings on the legs also can be of swell, and the blood volume diminishes; 10% to 20% of considerable assistance in preventing the edema and its the blood volume can be lost from the circulatory system sequelae. 190 Chapter 15 Vascular Distensibility and Functions of the Arterial and Venous Systems Clinical Estimation of Venous Pressure Venous pressure Right ventricle often can be estimated by simply observing the degree of distention of the peripheral veins, especially of the neck veins. For example, in the sitting position, the neck veins are never distended in the normal, quietly resting person. Right atrium However, when the right atrial pressure becomes increased to as much as +10 mm Hg, the lower veins of the neck begin to protrude and, at +15 mm Hg atrial pressure, essentially all the veins in the neck become distended. Direct Measurement of Venous Pressure and Right Atrial Pressure Venous pressure can be measured easily by inserting a needle directly into a vein and connecting it to a pressure Natural reference recorder. The only means whereby right atrial
