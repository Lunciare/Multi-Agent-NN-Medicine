For example, it has long been known that thyroid decreases plasma cholesterol concentration is to increase hormone is essential for the metamorphic change of the significantly cholesterol secretion in the bile and con- tadpole into the frog. sequent loss in the feces. A possible mechanism for the In humans, the effect of thyroid hormone on growth increased cholesterol secretion is that thyroid hormone is manifest mainly in growing children. In children with induces increased numbers of low- density lipoprotein hypothyroidism, the rate of growth is greatly retarded. In receptors on the liver cells, leading to rapid removal of children with hyperthyroidism, excessive skeletal growth low- density lipoproteins from the plasma by the liver and often occurs, causing the child to become considerably subsequent secretion of cholesterol in these lipoproteins taller at an earlier age. However, the bones also mature by the liver cells. 946 Chapter 77 Thyroid Metabolic Hormones +30 more above normal when excessive thyroid hormone is present and falling to only 50% of normal in severe hypo- +20 thyroidism. +10 Hyperthyroid Normal Increased Heart Rate.
