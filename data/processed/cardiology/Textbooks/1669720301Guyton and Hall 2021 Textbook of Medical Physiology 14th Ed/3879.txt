The specific action that occurs in response to increases or decreases of cAMP in each type of target cell depends cAMP ATP on the nature of the intracellular machinery; some cells Active Inactive have one set of enzymes, and other cells have other cAMP- cAMP- enzymes. Therefore, different functions are elicited in dif- dependent dependent protein protein ferent target cells, such as initiating synthesis of specific kinase kinase intracellular chemicals, causing muscle contraction or relaxation, initiating secretion by the cells, and altering Protein – PO + ADP Protein + ATP 4 cell permeability. Thus, a thyroid cell stimulated by cAMP forms the Cell’s response metabolic hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, Figure 75- 7.
