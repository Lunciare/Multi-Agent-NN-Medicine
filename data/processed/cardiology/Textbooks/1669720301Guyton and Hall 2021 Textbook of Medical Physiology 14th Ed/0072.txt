Pinocytosis occurs continually in the cell the coated pits to provide the force for pinching the vesi- membranes of most cells, but is especially rapid in some cles away from the cell membrane. cells. For example, it occurs so rapidly in macrophages that about 3% of the total macrophage membrane is en- Phagocytosis. Phagocytosis occurs in much the same gulfed in the form of vesicles each minute. Even so, the way as pinocytosis, except that it involves large particles pinocytotic vesicles are so small—usually only 100 to 200 rather than molecules. Only certain cells have the capa- nanometers in diameter—that most of them can be seen bility of phagocytosis—notably, tissue macrophages and only with an electron microscope. some white blood cells. 21 UNIT I UNIT I Introduction to Physiology: The Cell and General Physiology Lysosomes proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and other substances in the vesicle. The products of digestion are small molecules of substances such as amino acids, glucose, and phosphates that can diffuse through the membrane of the vesicle into the cytoplasm. What is left of the digestive vesicle, called Pinocytotic or the
