into an active form of oxygen. There are several forms of B active oxygen, called oxygen free radicals. One of the most important of these is the superoxide free radical O −, and 20 2 Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve another is the peroxide radical in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Even when the tissue Po is normal at the level 2 Total O in blood of 40 mm Hg, small amounts of free radicals are continu- 15 2 Combined with Oxygen ally being formed from the dissolved O . Fortunately, the 2 hemoglobin poisoning tissues also contain several enzymes that rapidly remove Dissolved in these free radicals, including peroxidases, catalases, and 10 water of blood Normal alveolar superoxide dismutases. Therefore, as long as the hemo- oxygen pressure globin- O buffering mechanism maintains a normal tis- 2 5 sue Po 2, the oxidizing free radicals are removed rapidly enough that they have little or no effect in the tissues. Above a critical alveolar Po (i.e., > ≈2 atm Po ), the 2 2 0 hemoglobin- O 2 buffering mechanism fails, and the tissue 0 760 1560 2280 3040 Po can then rise to hundreds or thousands of mm Hg.
