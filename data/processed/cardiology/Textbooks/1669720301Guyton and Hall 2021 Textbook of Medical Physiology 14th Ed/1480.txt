cleared from the plasma. of excretion of the substance (U × V) is less than the s Therefore, clearance of PAH can be used to approximate filtered load of the substance (GFR × P), then some s RPF. To be more accurate, one can correct for the percent- of the substance must have been reabsorbed from age of PAH that is still in the blood when it leaves the kid- the renal tubules. Conversely, if the excretion rate of neys. The percentage of PAH removed from the blood is the substance is greater than its filtered load, then the known as the extraction ratio of PAH and averages about rate at which it appears in the urine represents the sum 90% in normal kidneys. In diseased kidneys, this extraction of the rate of glomerular filtration plus tubular ratio may be reduced because of the inability of damaged secretion. tubules to secrete PAH into the tubular fluid. The following example demonstrates the calculation The calculation of RPF can be demonstrated by the fol- of tubular reabsorption. Assume the following laboratory lowing example. Assume that the plasma concentration values for a patient were obtained: of PAH is 0.01 mg/ml, urine concentration is
