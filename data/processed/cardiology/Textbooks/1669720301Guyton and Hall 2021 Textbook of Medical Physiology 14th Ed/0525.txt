Recording the depolarization wave (A and B) and the repolarization wave (C and D) from a cardiac muscle fiber. The atria repolarize about 0.15 to 0.20 second after ter- mination of the P wave, which is also approximately when the QRS complex is being recorded in the ECG. There- fore, the atrial repolarization wave, known as the atrial T wave, is usually obscured by the much larger QRS com- plex. For this reason, an atrial T wave is seldom observed on the ECG. The ventricular repolarization wave is the T wave of the normal ECG. Ordinarily, ventricular muscle begins R to repolarize in some fibers about 0.20 second after the P T beginning of the depolarization wave (the QRS complex), Q but in many other fibers, it
