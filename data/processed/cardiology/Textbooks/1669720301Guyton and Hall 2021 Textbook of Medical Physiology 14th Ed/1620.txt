SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Figure 30- 16 shows the normal distribution of fluid CONTROL OF RENAL EXCRETION: between the interstitial spaces and vascular system and ARTERIAL BARORECEPTOR AND LOW- the distribution that occurs in edema states. When small PRESSURE STRETCH RECEPTOR REFLEXES amounts of fluid accumulate in the blood as a result of too much fluid intake or a decrease in renal output of fluid, Because the kidneys receive extensive sympathetic inner- about 20% to 30% of it stays in the blood and increases vation, changes in sympathetic activity can alter renal the blood volume. The remainder is distributed to the sodium and water excretion, as well as regulation of extra- interstitial spaces. When the extracellular fluid volume cellular fluid volume under some conditions. For example, rises more than 30% to 50% above normal, almost all the when blood volume is reduced by hemorrhage, pressures additional fluid goes into the interstitial spaces, and little in the pulmonary blood vessels and other low- pressure remains in the blood. Once the interstitial fluid pressure regions of the thorax decrease, causing reflex activation of
