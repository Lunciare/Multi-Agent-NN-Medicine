Peripheral nerve bundle heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals. They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation. A Hairy skin Pacinian corpuscle Sixth, Pacinian corpuscles, which were discussed in detail in Chapter 47, lie both immediately beneath the Merkel’s discs skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body. They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tis- Free nerve endings sues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second. Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical Meissner’s state of the tissues. corpuscle Transmission of Tactile Signals in Peripheral Nerve Fibers. Almost all specialized sensory receptors, such as Meissner’s corpuscles, Iggo dome receptors, hair recep- tors, Pacinian corpuscles, and Ruffini’s endings, transmit Peripheral their signals in type Aβ nerve fibers that have transmis- nerve bundle sion velocities ranging from 30 to 70 m/sec. Conversely, free nerve ending tactile receptors transmit signals mainly via the small type Aδ myelinated fibers that conduct at Ruffini Pacinian B Glabrous skin ending corpuscle velocities of only 5 to 30 m/sec. Some tactile free nerve endings transmit via type Figure 48- 1. Mechanoreceptors
