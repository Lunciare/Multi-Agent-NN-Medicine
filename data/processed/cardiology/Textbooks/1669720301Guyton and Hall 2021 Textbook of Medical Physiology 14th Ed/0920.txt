Circulation CHRONIC HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD understanding the role of the renal–body fluid volume PRESSURE) CAUSED BY IMPAIRED RENAL mechanism for arterial pressure regulation. Volume- FUNCTION loading hypertension means hypertension caused by excess accumulation of extracellular fluid in the body, When a person is said to have chronic hypertension (or some examples of which follow. high blood pressure), this means that his or her mean arterial pressure is greater than the upper range of the Experimental Volume- Loading Hypertension accepted normal measure. A mean arterial pressure Caused by Reduced Kidney Mass and Increased Salt greater than 110 mm Hg (normal is ≈90 mm Hg) is con- Intake. Figure 19-7 shows a typical experiment dem- sidered to be hypertensive. (This level of mean pressure onstrating volume- loading hypertension in a group of occurs when the diastolic blood pressure is greater than dogs with 70% of their kidney mass removed. At the first ≈90 mm Hg and the systolic pressure is greater than ≈135 circled point on the curve, the two poles of one of the mm Hg.) In persons with severe hypertension, the mean kidneys were removed, and at the second circled point, arterial pressure can rise to 150 to 170 mm
