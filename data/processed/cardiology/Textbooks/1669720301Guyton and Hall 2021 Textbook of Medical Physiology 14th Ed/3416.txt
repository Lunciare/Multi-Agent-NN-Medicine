small Mucus Secretion. The mucosa of the large intestine, like intestine between the villi, which secretes almost pure extracellular that of the small intestine, has many crypts of Lieberkühn; fluid. however, unlike the small intestine, it contains no villi. The epithelial cells secrete almost no digestive enzymes. The intestinal secretions are formed by the enterocytes Instead, they contain mucous cells that secrete only mu- of the crypts at a rate of about 1800 ml/day. These secre- cus.
