Sodium enters the cell through special interstitial Type B lumen channels and is transported out of the cell by the Na+- K+ ATPase fluid intercalated cell pump. Aldosterone antagonists compete with aldosterone for bind- ing sites in the cell and therefore inhibit the effects of aldosterone to stimulate sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium CCOO CCOO ++ HH OO 22 22 22 channels.
