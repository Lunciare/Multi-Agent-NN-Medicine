to 99% Capillary Plasma colloid as rapidly as it does through free fluid. For the short dis- pressure osmotic pressure tances between the capillaries and tissue cells, this diffu- (Pc) ((cid:31)p) sion allows for rapid transport through the interstitium, not only of water molecules but also of substances such as electrolytes, low- molecular- weight nutrients, cellular excreta, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Interstitial Interstitial fluid fluid pressure colloid osmotic pressure Free Fluid in the Interstitium. Although almost all the (Pif) ((cid:31)if) fluid in the interstitium normally is entrapped within the Figure 16- 5. Fluid pressure and colloid osmotic pressure forces op- tissue gel, occasionally small rivulets of free fluid and small erate at the capillary membrane and tend to move fluid outward or free fluid vesicles are also present, which means fluid that is inward through the membrane pores. free of the proteoglycan molecules and therefore can flow freely. When a dye is injected into the circulating blood, it often can be seen to flow through the interstitium in the 3. The capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure small rivulets, usually coursing along the surfaces of col- (Πp), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward lagen fibers or surfaces of cells.
