For reasons presented the P wave and the beginning of the QRS complex is the in Chapter 5 in the discussion of membrane potentials, as interval between the beginning of electrical excitation of soon as an area of cardiac syncytium becomes depolarized, the atria and the beginning of excitation of the ventricles. negative charges leak to the outsides of the depolarized This period is called the P- Q interval. The normal P- Q muscle fibers, making this part of the surface electronega- interval is about 0.16 second. (Often, this interval is called tive, as represented by the minus signs in Figure 11- 4.

The P- R interval shortens at faster heart rates due represented by the plus signs. Therefore, a meter connected to increased sympathetic or decreased parasympathetic with its negative terminal on the area of depolarization and activity, which increase atrioventricular node conduction its positive terminal on one of the still polarized areas, as speed. Conversely, the P-R interval lengthens with
