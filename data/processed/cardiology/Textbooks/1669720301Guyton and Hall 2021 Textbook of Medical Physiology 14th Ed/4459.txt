However, many physiological principles are peculiar to This is followed 1 week later (at 4–5 weeks) by formation of the infant, and this chapter discusses the more important non- nucleated red blood cells by the fetal mesenchyme and of these principles. also by the endothelium of fetal blood vessels.

Finally, from the third month on, the more rapidly than does the fetus. In fact, during the first bone marrow gradually
