And, finally, if we idly activate multiple mechanisms that cause hunger and ignore the normally small amount of protein metabolism, drive a person to seek food. In athletes and laborers, energy respiratory quotients between 0.70 and 1.0 describe the ap- expenditure for the high level of muscle activity may be as proximate ratios of carbohydrate to fat metabolism. To be high as 10,000 Calories per day, compared with only about more exact, one can first determine the protein utilization 2000 Calories per day for sedentary individuals. Thus, a by measuring nitrogen excretion, as discussed in the next large energy expenditure associated with physical work section. Then, using the appropriate mathematical formula, usually stimulates equally large increases in caloric intake. one can calculate the utilization of the three foodstuffs. What are the physiological mechanisms that sense Some of the important findings from studies of respira- changes in energy balance and influence the quest for tory quotients are the following: 1. Immediately after a mixed meal containing carbohy- food? Maintenance of adequate energy supply in the body drates as well as protein and fat, almost all the food that
