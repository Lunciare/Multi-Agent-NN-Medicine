The mechanisms that maintain proper numbers of the The cells’ chromosomes are capped by telomeres, which, in the ab- sence of telomerase activity, shorten with each cell division until the different types of cells in the body are still poorly under- cell stops replicating. Therefore, most cells of the body cannot repli- stood. However, experiments have shown at least three cate indefinitely. In cancer cells, telomerase is activated, and telomere ways in which growth can be controlled. First, growth length is maintained so that the cells continue to replicate themselves often is controlled by growth factors that come from other uncontrollably. 44 Chapter 3 Genetic Control of Protein Synthesis, Cell Function, and Cell Reproduction Each time a cell divides, an average person loses 30 Therefore, it has become clear that differentiation to 200 base pairs from the ends of that cell’s telomeres. results not from loss of genes but from selective repres- In human blood cells, the
