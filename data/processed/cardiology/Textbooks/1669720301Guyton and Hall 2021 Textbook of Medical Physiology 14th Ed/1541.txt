vasculosum the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, called of the lamina terminalis have vascular supplies that lack the AV3V region. At the upper part of this region is a the typical blood–b rain barrier that impedes the diffusion structure called the subfornical organ and, at the infe- of most ions from the blood into brain tissue. This char- rior part, is another structure called the organum vas- acteristic makes it possible for ions and other solutes to culosum of the lamina terminalis. Between these two cross between the blood and local interstitial fluid in this organs is the median preoptic nucleus, which has mul- region. As a result, the osmoreceptors rapidly respond tiple nerve connections with the two organs, as well as to changes in osmolarity of the extracellular fluid, exert- with the supraoptic nuclei and blood pressure control ing powerful control over the secretion of ADH and over centers in the medulla of the brain.
