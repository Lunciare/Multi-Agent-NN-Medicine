Ischemia causes visceral pain in the same way in the spinal cord on the same second-o rder neurons (1 and as in other tissues, presumably because of the formation of 2) that receive pain signals from the skin. When the visceral acidic metabolic end products or tissue- degenerative prod- pain fibers are stimulated, pain signals from the viscera are ucts such as bradykinin, proteolytic enzymes, or others that conducted through at least some of the same neurons that stimulate pain nerve endings. conduct pain signals from the skin, and the person has the Chemical Stimuli.
