in this forward direction minus the number times as soluble as O . Therefore, the partial pressure of 2 bouncing in the opposite direction, which is proportional to CO for a given concentration is less than one-twentieth 2 the gas partial pressure difference between the two areas, (5%) of that exerted by O . 2 called simply the pressure difference for causing diffusion. Diffusion of Gases Between Gas Phase in Alveoli and Quantifying Net Rate of Diffusion in Fluids. In addition Dissolved Phase in Pulmonary Blood. The partial pressure of to the pressure difference, several other factors affect the each gas in the alveolar respiratory gas mixture tends to force rate of gas diffusion in a fluid: (1) the solubility of the gas in molecules of that gas into solution in the blood of the alveo- the fluid; (2) the cross- sectional area of the fluid; (3) the dis- lar capillaries. Conversely, the molecules of the same gas that tance through which the gas must diffuse; (4) the molecular are already dissolved in the blood are bouncing randomly in weight of the gas; and (5) the temperature of the fluid. In the fluid of the blood, and some of these
