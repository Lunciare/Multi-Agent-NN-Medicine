Basic structure of the heme moiety, showing one of the Oxygen does not combine with the two positive bonds four heme chains that along with globin polypeptide, bind together of the iron in the hemoglobin molecule. Instead, it binds to form the hemoglobin molecule. loosely with one of the so- called coordination bonds of the iron atom. This bond is extremely loose, so the com- composition of the polypeptide portion. The different bination is easily reversible. Furthermore, the oxygen types of chains are designated as alpha (α) chains, beta (β) does not become ionic oxygen but is carried as molecular chains, (γ) gamma chains, and (δ) delta chains. The most oxygen (composed of two oxygen atoms) to the tissues, common form of hemoglobin in adults, hemoglobin A, is where, because of the loose,
