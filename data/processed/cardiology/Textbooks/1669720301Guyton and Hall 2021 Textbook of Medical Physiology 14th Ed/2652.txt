Transducin Phosphodiesterase Current flow Light Na+ 5′-GMP cGMP cGMP gated sodium channel K+ selective Na+ channels ATP K+ Figure 51- 7. Phototransduction in the outer segment of the photo- receptor (rod or cone) membrane. When light hits the photoreceptor (e.g., a rod cell), the light- absorbing retinal portion of rhodopsin is ac- tivated. This activation stimulates transducin, a G protein, which then activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiester- ase. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of cGMP into 5′- GMP. The reduction in cGMP then causes closure of the sodium channels, which, in turn, causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. BB Dark Light of the inner segment. Thus, more sodium ions now leave the rod than leak back in. Because they are positive ions, their loss from inside the rod creates increased negativity Na+ Na+ inside the membrane, and the greater the amount of light energy striking the rod, the greater the electronegativity becomes—that is, the greater is the degree of hyperpo- larization. At maximum light intensity, the membrane potential approaches −70 to −80 millivolts, which is near High (cGMP), Low (cGMP), the equilibrium potential for potassium ions across the open channels closed channels membrane.
