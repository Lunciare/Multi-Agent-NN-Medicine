the involuntary fixation mechanism that holds the eyes firmly Lateral Medial on the object once it has been found. rectus rectus The voluntary fixation movements are controlled by a cortical field located bilaterally in the premotor corti- cal regions of the frontal lobes, as shown in Figure 52- 8. Bilateral dysfunction or destruction of these areas makes Nuclei it difficult for a person to “unlock” the eyes from one point N. III of fixation and move them to another point. It is usually necessary to blink the eyes or put a hand over the eyes for a short time, which then allows the eyes to be moved. N. IV Inferior Inferior Conversely, the involuntary fixation mechanism that rectus oblique causes the eyes to “lock” on the object of attention once Medial longitudinal fasciculus it is found is controlled by secondary visual areas in the occipital cortex, located mainly anterior to the primary N. VI visual cortex. When this fixation area is destroyed bilater- ally in an animal, the animal has difficulty keeping its eyes Figure 52- 7.
