RENAL BLOOD SUPPLY The kidney cannot regenerate new nephrons. Therefore, Blood flow to the two kidneys is normally about 22% of the with renal injury, disease, or normal aging, the number cardiac output, or 1100 ml/min. The renal artery enters the of nephrons gradually decreases. After age 40 years, the kidney through the hilum and then branches progressively number of functioning nephrons usually decreases about to form the interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, interlobular 10% every 10 years; thus, at age 80 years, many people arteries (also called radial arteries), and afferent arterioles, have 40% fewer functioning nephrons than they did at age which lead to the glomerular capillaries, where large amounts 40 years. This loss is not life- threatening because adaptive of fluid and solutes (except the plasma proteins) are filtered to changes in the remaining nephrons allow them to excrete begin urine formation (Figure 26- 3). The distal ends of the the proper amounts of water, electrolytes, and waste capillaries of each glomerulus coalesce to form the efferent products, as discussed in Chapter 32. arteriole, which leads to a second capillary network, the peri- Each nephron contains (1) a tuft of glomerular capil- tubular capillaries, that surrounds the renal
