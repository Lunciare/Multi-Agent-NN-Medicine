Thus, Focal Length of a Lens parallel light rays are bent to a focal line. Conversely, light rays that pass through the spherical lens are refracted at all The distance beyond a convex lens at which parallel rays edges of the lens (in both planes) toward the central ray, converge to a common focal point is called the focal length and all the rays come to a focal point. of the lens.
