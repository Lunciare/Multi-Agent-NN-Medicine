The concentration of TSI is measured by immunoassay. This concentration is usually high in thyrotoxicosis but low in thyroid adenoma. Treatment in Hyperthyroidism. The most direct treat- ment for hyperthyroidism is surgical removal of most of the thyroid gland. In general, it is desirable to prepare the pa- tient for surgical removal of the gland before the operation by administering propylthiouracil, usually for several weeks, until the basal metabolic rate of the patient has returned to normal. Then, administration of high concentrations of io- dides for 1 to 2 weeks immediately before operation causes the gland to recede in size and its blood supply to diminish. With
