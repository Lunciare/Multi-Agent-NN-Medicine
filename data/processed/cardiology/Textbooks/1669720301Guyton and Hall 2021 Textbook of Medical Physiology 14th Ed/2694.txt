The mechanism of this opposing effect of colors is as follows. One color type of cone excites the ganglion cell by 651 UNIT X CHAPTER 5 2 The Eye: III. Central Neurophysiology of Vision VISUAL PATHWAYS light reflex; (3) into the superior colliculus to control rapid Figure 52- 1 shows the principal visual pathways from the directional movements of the two eyes; and (4) into the two retinas to the visual cortex. The visual nerve signals ventral lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and sur- leave the retinas through the optic nerves. At the optic rounding basal regions of the brain, presumably to help chiasm, the optic nerve fibers from the nasal halves of control some of the body’s behavioral functions. the retinas cross to the opposite sides, where they join Thus, the visual pathways can be divided roughly into the fibers from the opposite temporal retinas to form the an old system to the midbrain and base of the forebrain optic tracts. The fibers of each optic tract then synapse and a new system for direct
