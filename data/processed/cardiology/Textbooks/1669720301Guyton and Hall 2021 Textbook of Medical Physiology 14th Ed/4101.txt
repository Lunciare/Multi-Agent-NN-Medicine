Insulin has several effects that lead to fat storage in adi- Insulin Deficiency Increases Use of Fat for pose tissue. First, insulin increases glucose utilization by Energy most of the body’s tissues, which automatically decreases fat utilization, thus functioning as a fat sparer. However, All aspects of fat breakdown and its use for providing insulin also promotes fatty acid synthesis, especially when energy are greatly enhanced in the absence of insulin. This more carbohydrates are ingested than can be used for enhancement occurs even normally between meals when immediate energy, thus providing the substrate for fat secretion of insulin is minimal, but it becomes extreme in synthesis. Almost all this synthesis occurs in the liver persons with diabetes mellitus when secretion of insulin cells, and the fatty acids are then transported from the is almost zero. 977 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction Control Depancreatized in the liver cells, the carnitine transport mechanism for trans- porting fatty acids into the mitochondria becomes increas- Blood glucose ingly activated.
