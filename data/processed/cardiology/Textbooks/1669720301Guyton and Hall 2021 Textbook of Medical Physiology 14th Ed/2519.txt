Graphic demonstration of the “power law” relation- additional 1-g ram increase in weight and, when already ship between actual stimulus strength and strength that the mind holding 300 grams, can barely detect a 10-g ram increase in interprets it to be. Note that the power law does not hold at either weight. Thus, in this case, the ratio of the change in stimu- very weak or very strong stimulus strengths. lus strength required for detection remains essentially con- of change. Therefore, multiple different types of recep- stant, about 1 to 30, which is what the logarithmic principle tors help to determine joint angulation and are used to- means. To express this principle mathematically, gether for position sense. Both skin tactile receptors and Interpretedsignalstrength=Log(Stimulus)+Constant deep receptors near the joints are used. In the case of the fingers, where skin receptors are in great abundance, as More recently, it has become evident that the Weber- much as half of position recognition is believed to be de- Fechner principle is quantitatively accurate only for high- tected through the skin
