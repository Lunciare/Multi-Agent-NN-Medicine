The answer terior and posterior lobes are organized not by lobes but is that it helps sequence and monitor motor activities and along the longitudinal axis, as demonstrated in Figure 57- makes corrective adjustments while activities are being 2, which shows a posterior view of the human cerebellum after the lower end of the posterior cerebellum has been executed so that they will conform to the motor signals rolled downward from its normally hidden position. Note, directed by the cerebral motor cortex and other parts of down the center of the cerebellum, a narrow band called the brain. 711 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C.
