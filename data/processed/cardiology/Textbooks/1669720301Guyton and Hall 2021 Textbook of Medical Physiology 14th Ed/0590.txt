Conversely, When the heart becomes totally depolarized, at the in lead III, the injury potential is below the zero voltage end of the depolarization process (as noted by the next level and therefore is negative. to last stage in Figure 12-17), all the ventricular muscle is At the bottom in Figure 12-18, the respective injury in a negative state. Therefore, at this instant in the ECG, potentials in leads I and III are plotted on the coordi- no current flows from the ventricles to the electrocardio- nates of these leads, and the resultant vector of the injury graphic electrodes because now both the injured heart potential for the whole ventricular muscle mass is deter- muscle and the contracting muscle are depolarized. mined by vectorial analysis as described. In this case, the Next, as repolarization takes place, all the heart finally repolarizes, except the area of permanent depolarization I in the injured base of the left ventricle. Thus, repolariza- +− 0 0 tion causes a return of the current of injury in each lead,
