Components. is required to concentrate substances as they are secreted Among the most important intracellular processes that by the glandular cells. In addition, energy is required to require ATP energy is the formation of peptide linkages synthesize the organic compounds to be secreted. between amino acids during synthesis of proteins. The ATP Energizes Nerve Conduction. The energy used different peptide linkages, depending on which types of during propagation of nerve impulses is derived from the amino acids are linked, require from 500 to 5000 calories potential energy stored in the form of concentration dif- of energy per mole. Recall from Chapter 3 that four high- ferences of ions across the neuronal cell membranes. That energy phosphate bonds are expended during the cascade is, a high concentration of potassium inside the neuron 893 UNIT XIII Unit XIII Metabolism and Temperature Regulation and a low concentration outside the neuron constitute a Anaerobic Versus Aerobic Energy Glycogen Energy for type of energy storage. Likewise, a high concentration of Anaerobic energy means energy that can be derived from Glucose 1. Synthesis and growth sodium on the outside of the membrane and a low con- 2.
