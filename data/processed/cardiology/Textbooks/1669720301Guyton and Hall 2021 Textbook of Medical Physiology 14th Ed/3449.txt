Intestine. In the upper part of the small intestine, chloride ion H2O K+ H2O absorption is rapid and occurs mainly by diffusion (i.e., absorption of sodium ions through the epithelium cre- ates electronegativity in the chyme and electropositivity Figure 66- 8.

Note also osmotic absorption of water (i.e., water “follows” sodium through the epithelial mem- Chloride ions then move along this electrical gradient brane). to “follow” the sodium ions. Chloride is also absorbed across the brush border membrane of parts of the ileum mEq/L (i.e., about equal to that in plasma), sodium moves and large intestine by a brush border membrane chloride- down this steep electrochemical gradient from the chyme bicarbonate exchanger (see Figure 66-8 ). Chloride exits through the brush border of the epithelial cell into the the cell on the basolateral membrane through chloride epithelial cell cytoplasm. Sodium is also co- transported channels. through the brush border membrane by several specific carrier proteins, including the following: (1) the sodium- Absorption of Bicarbonate Ions in the Duodenum glucose co- transporter 1 (SGLT1); (2) sodium–amino and Jejunum.
