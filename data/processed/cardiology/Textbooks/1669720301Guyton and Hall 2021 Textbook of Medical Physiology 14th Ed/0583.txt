Therefore, prolonged conduction of the impulse the heart have caused local delays of impulse conduc- through the ventricles always causes a prolonged QRS tion and reduced voltages due to loss of muscle mass complex. Such prolongation often occurs when one or throughout the ventricles. Infiltrative myocardial dis- both ventricles are hypertrophied or dilated because of eases also cause low ECG voltage.
