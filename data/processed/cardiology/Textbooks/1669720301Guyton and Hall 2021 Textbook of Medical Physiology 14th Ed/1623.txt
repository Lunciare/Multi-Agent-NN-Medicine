natriuresis curve is steep (normal curve), indicating mation, and renal sodium reabsorption that elevate blood that increases in sodium excretion can be achieved pressure. In fact, ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves when the sodium intake is raised with minimal chang- often lowers arterial pressure in hypertension, especially es in arterial pressure. when associated with obesity. In contrast, when Ang II levels cannot be sup- pressed in response to increased sodium intake (high ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN II IN angiotensin II curve), as occurs in some hypertensive CONTROLLING RENAL EXCRETION patients who have an impaired ability to decrease renin secretion and Ang II formation, the pressure One of the body’s most powerful controllers of sodium natriuresis curve is not nearly as steep. Therefore, excretion is Ang II. Changes in sodium intake are asso- when sodium intake is raised, much greater increases ciated with reciprocal changes in Ang II formation, and in arterial pressure are necessary to increase sodium this in turn contributes greatly to the maintenance of excretion and maintain sodium balance. For example, body sodium balances. When sodium intake is elevated in most people, a 10- fold increase in sodium intake above normal, renin secretion and Ang II formation causes
