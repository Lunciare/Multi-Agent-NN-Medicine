When the ovum is expelled from the ovarian follicle scrotal reflexes cause the musculature of the scrotum to into the fallopian tube, it still carries with it multiple contract, pulling the testes close to the body to maintain layers of granulosa cells. Before a sperm can fertilize this 2°C differential. Thus, the scrotum acts as a cooling 1015 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction mechanism for the testes (but a controlled cooling), with- out which spermatogenesis might be deficient during hot weather. Cryptorchidism. Cryptorchidism means failure of a testis to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum at or near the time of birth of a fetus. During development of the male fetus, the testes are derived from the genital ridges in the abdomen. However, at about 3 weeks to 1 month before birth of the baby, the testes normally de- scend through the inguinal canals into the scrotum. Oc- casionally this descent does not occur or occurs incom- pletely, and as a result one or both testes remain in the abdomen, in the inguinal canal, or elsewhere along the route of descent. A testis that remains in the abdominal cavity Figure 81- 5 Abnormal infertile sperm, compared with
