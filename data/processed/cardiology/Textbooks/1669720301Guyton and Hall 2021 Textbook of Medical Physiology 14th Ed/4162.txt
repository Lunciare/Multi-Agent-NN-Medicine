EXTRACELLULAR FLUID AND PLASMA Thus, the plasma and interstitial fluids have a nor- mal calcium ion concentration of about 1.2 mmol/L (or Extracellular fluid calcium concentration is normally regu- 2.4 mEq/L, because it is a divalent ion), a level only one- lated precisely; it seldom rises or falls more than a few per- half the total plasma calcium concentration. This ionic cent from the normal value of about 9.4 mg/dl, which is calcium is the form that is important
