These internal functions are parahippocampal gyrus and uncus. 744 Chapter 59 The Limbic System and the Hypothalamus—Behavioral and Motivational Mechanisms of the Brain limbic system. In turn, the hypothalamus and its closely allied structures send output signals in three directions: Cingulate gyrus (1) backward and downward to the brain stem, mainly into the reticular areas of the mesencephalon, pons, and Portions Anterior Subcallosal medulla, and from these areas into the peripheral nerves Septum of basal nuclei of gyrus of the autonomic nervous system; (2) upward toward area ganglia thalamus many higher areas of the diencephalon and cerebrum, especially to the anterior thalamus and limbic portions Paraolfactory Hypothalamus Orbitofrontal area of the cerebral cortex; and (3) into the hypothalamic cortex Hippocampus infundibulum to control or partially control most of the Uncus secretory functions of both the posterior and the ante- Amygdala rior pituitary glands. Thus, the hypothalamus, which represents less than 1% Parahippocampal gyrus of the brain mass, is
