Pulmonary Venous Pressures. The has only mild systemic circulatory effects. mean pressure in the left atrium and major pulmonary veins averages about 2 mm Hg in the recumbent person, BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE LUNGS varying from as low as 1 mm Hg to as high as 5 mm Hg. AND ITS DISTRIBUTION It usually is not feasible to measure someone’s left atrial pressure using a direct measuring device because it is Blood flow through the lungs is essentially equal to the difficult to pass a catheter through the heart chambers cardiac output. Therefore, the factors that control car- into the left atrium. However, the left atrial pressure can diac output—mainly peripheral factors, as discussed in be estimated with moderate accuracy by measuring the Chapter 20—also control pulmonary blood flow. Under so- called pulmonary wedge pressure. This is measured most conditions, the pulmonary vessels act as distensible by inserting a catheter first through a peripheral vein to tubes that enlarge with increasing pressure and narrow 504 )gH mm( erusserP )gHmm( erusserP Chapter 39 Pulmonary Circulation, Pulmonary Edema, and Pleural Fluid Exercise NORMAL Alveolus Alveolus Standing at rest Increased Top Middle Bottom flow Lung level Vasoconstriction Figure 39- 4.
