In fact, CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SYNAPSES it is the lower brain centers, not the cortex, that initiate wakefulness in the cerebral cortex, thereby opening its Information is transmitted in the central nervous sys- bank of memories to the thinking machinery of the brain. tem mainly in the form of nerve action potentials, Thus, each portion of the nervous system performs spe- called nerve impulses, through a succession of neu- cific functions, but it is the cortex that opens a world of rons, one after another. However, each impulse (1) stored information for use by the mind. may be blocked in its transmission from one neuron to the next; (2) may be changed from a single impulse COMPARISON OF THE NERVOUS into repetitive impulses; or (3) may be integrated with SYSTEM TO A COMPUTER impulses from other neurons to cause highly intricate patterns of impulses in successive neurons. All these It is readily apparent that computers have many features functions can be classified as synaptic functions of in common with the nervous system. First, all computers neurons. have input circuits that can
