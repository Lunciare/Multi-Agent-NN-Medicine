tetanization. At a slightly higher Tetanization frequency, the strength of contraction reaches its maxi- mum, so any additional increase in frequency beyond that point has no further effect in increasing contractile force. Tetany occurs because enough calcium ions are main- tained in the muscle sarcoplasm, even between action po- tentials, so that a full contractile state is sustained without allowing any relaxation between the action potentials. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 Maximum Strength of Contraction. The maximum Rate of stimulation (times per second) strength of tetanic contraction of a muscle operating at a normal muscle length averages between 3 and 4 kg/cm2 of Figure 6-15 Frequency summation and tetanization. muscle, or 50 pounds/inch2. Because a quadriceps muscle can have up to 16 square inches of muscle belly, as much of overall muscle contraction. Summation occurs in two as 800 pounds of tension may be applied to the patellar ways: (1) by increasing the number of motor units con- tendon. Thus, one can readily understand how it is pos- tracting simultaneously, which is called multiple fiber sible for muscles to pull their tendons out of their inser- summation; and (2) by increasing the frequency of
