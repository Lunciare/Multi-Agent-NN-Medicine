passing through the center of the lens strike the lens ex- actly perpendicular to the lens surface and, therefore, pass Refraction of Light through the lens without being refracted. Toward either edge of the lens, however, the light rays strike a progres- Refractive Index of a Transparent Substance. Light rays sively more angulated interface. The outer rays bend more travel through air at a velocity of about 300,000 km/sec, but and more toward the center, which is called convergence of they travel much slower through transparent solids and liq- uids. The refractive index of a transparent substance is the A ratio of the velocity of light in air to the velocity in the sub- stance. The refractive index of air is 1.00. Thus, if light trav- els through a particular type of glass at a velocity of 200,000 km/sec, the refractive index of this glass is 300,000 divided by 200,000, or 1.50. Refraction of Light Rays at an Interface Between Two Media With Different Refractive Indices. When light rays Wave fronts Glass B traveling forward in a beam (as shown in Figure 50- 1A) strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam, the rays enter the second medium without
