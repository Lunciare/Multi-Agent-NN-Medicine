the rate at which plasma itself so many capillaries are present in the tissues that their flows linearly along the capillary. That is, the water of the overall function becomes averaged. That is, there is an av- plasma is exchanged with the water of the interstitial fluid erage rate of blood flow through each tissue capillary bed, 80 times before the plasma can flow the entire distance an average capillary pressure within the capillaries, and an through the capillary. average rate of transfer of substances between the blood of the capillaries and the surrounding interstitial fluid. In the Effect of Molecular Size on Passage Through the remainder of this chapter, we are concerned with these Pores. The width of the capillary intercellular cleft pores, averages, although it should be remembered that the av- 6 to 7 nanometers, is about 20 times the diameter of the erage functions are, in reality, the functions of billions of water molecule, which is the smallest molecule that nor- individual capillaries, each operating intermittently in re- mally passes through the capillary pores. The diameters sponse to local conditions in the tissues. of plasma protein molecules, however, are slightly greater than the width of the pores.
