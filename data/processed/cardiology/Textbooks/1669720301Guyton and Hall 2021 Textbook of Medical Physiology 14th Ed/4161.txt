The extracellular calcium ion concentration, Calcium in the plasma is present in three forms, as shown for example, is determined by the interplay of calcium in Figure 80- 1: (1) About 41% (1 mmol/L) of the calcium absorption from the intestine, renal excretion of calcium, is combined with plasma proteins and in this form is non- and bone uptake and release of calcium, each of which is diffusible through the
