This makes 34 Oxidation of Acetyl- CoA. The acetyl- CoA molecules plus 105, or a total of 139 molecules of ATP formed by the formed by beta-o xidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria oxidation of hydrogen derived from each molecule of stear- enter immediately into the citric acid cycle (see Chapter 68), ic acid. Another 9 molecules of ATP are formed in the citric combining first with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid, acid cycle itself (separate from the ATP released by the oxi- which then is degraded into carbon dioxide and hydrogen dation of hydrogen), 1 for each of the nine acetyl-C oA mol- atoms. The hydrogen is subsequently oxidized by the che- ecules metabolized.
