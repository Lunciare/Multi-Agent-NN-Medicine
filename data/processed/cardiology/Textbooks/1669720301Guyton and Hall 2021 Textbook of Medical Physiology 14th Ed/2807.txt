The olfactory membrane, the histology of which is shown in Figure 54-3 , lies in the superior part of the nasal cav- ity. Medially, the olfactory membrane folds downward along the surface of the superior septum; laterally, it folds over the superior turbinate and even over a small portion of the upper surface of the middle turbinate. The olfac- tory membrane has a total surface area of about 5 square centimeters in
