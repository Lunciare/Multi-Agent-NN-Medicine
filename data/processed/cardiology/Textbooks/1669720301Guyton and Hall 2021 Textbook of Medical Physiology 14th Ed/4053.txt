However, the physiological effects on cell membrane ion transport that may contribute factors that regulate these isoforms of 11β- HSD and their to their therapeutic benefits. role in common diseases such as obesity and dementia are Modulation of Glucocorticoid Effects by 11β- still poorly understood. Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase An important mechanism for modulating the physi- REGULATION OF CORTISOL SECRETION ological effects of cortisol is local tissue expression of BY ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE isoforms of the enzyme 11β-h ydroxysteroid dehydroge- nase (11β- HSD). As discussed previously, one isoform, FROM THE PITUITARY GLAND 11β- HSD2, metabolizes cortisol to inactive cortisone at ACTH Stimulates Cortisol Secretion. Unlike aldosterone the pre- receptor level in the renal tubules and therefore protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from activation secretion by the zona glomerulosa, which is controlled by cortisol. This enzyme is also present in other tissues mainly by potassium and angiotensin II acting directly on such as the colon, sweat glands, salivary glands, and the the adrenocortical cells, secretion of cortisol is controlled placenta (Figure 78-7 ). When 11β- HSD2 is deficient, as almost entirely by ACTH that is secreted by the anterior in apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome due to ge- pituitary gland.
