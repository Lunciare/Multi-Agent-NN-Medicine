this reason, the buffer systems in the 2 4 4 added to a mixture of these two substances, the hydrogen cells help prevent changes in the pH of the extracellular is accepted by the base HPO = and converted to H PO −: fluid but may take several hours to become maximally 4 2 4 effective. HCl+NaHPO →NaHPO +NaCl 2 4 2 4 In the red blood cell, hemoglobin (Hb) is an important buffer, as follows: The result of this reaction is that the strong acid, HCl, is replaced by an additional amount of a weak acid, H++Hb←  →HHb NaH PO , and the decrease in pH is minimized. 2 4 Approximately 60% to 70% of the total chemical buff- When a strong base, such as NaOH, is added to the ering of the body fluids is inside the cells, and most of this buffer system, the OH− is buffered by the H PO − to form 2 4 buffering results from the intracellular proteins. How- additional amounts of HPO = + H O: 4 2 ever, except for the red blood cells, the slow rate at which NaOH+NaH 2PO 4 →Na 2HPO 4+H 2O H+ and HCO 3−
