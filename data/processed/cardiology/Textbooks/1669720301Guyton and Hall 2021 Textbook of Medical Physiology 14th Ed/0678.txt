Movement of the iron to several thousand during the rapid phase of ejection into the coil increases the inductance of the coil, and this by the ventricles, which causes considerable turbulence too can be recorded electronically. in the proximal aorta and pulmonary artery, where many Finally, in Figure 14-7C, a very thin, stretched resist- conditions are appropriate for turbulence, such as the fol- ance wire is connected to the membrane.
