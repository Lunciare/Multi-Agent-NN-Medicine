gas capillary draining the interstitial space between the blood Each of these mechanisms causes rapid leakage of plas- capillary and alveolus. Note the balance of forces at the ma proteins and fluid out of the capillaries and into the lung blood capillary membrane, as follows: interstitial spaces and alveoli. Pulmonary Edema Safety Factor. Experiments in ani- mm Hg mals have shown that the pulmonary capillary pressure Forces tending to cause movement of fluid outward normally must rise to a value at least equal to the colloid from the capillaries and into the pulmonary osmotic pressure of the plasma inside the capillaries before interstitium: significant pulmonary edema will occur. To give an example, • Capillary pressure 7 Figure 39- 8 shows how different levels of left atrial pressure • Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure 14 increase the rate of pulmonary edema formation in dogs. • Negative interstitial fluid pressure 8 Remember that every time the left atrial pressure rises to TOTAL OUTWARD FORCE 29 high values, the pulmonary capillary pressure rises to a level Forces tending to cause absorption of fluid into the 1 to 2 mm Hg greater than the left atrial pressure. In these capillaries: experiments, as soon as
