amount of CO dissolved in the fluid of the blood at 2 45 mm Hg is about 2.7 ml/dl (2.7 volume percent). The Red blood cell amount dissolved at 40 mm Hg is about 2.4 ml, or a dif- ference of 0.3 ml. Therefore, only about 0.3 ml of CO is Hgb – CO Cell 2 2 transported in the dissolved form by each 100 ml of blood Carbonic Hgb flow. This is about 7% of all the CO normally transported. anhydrase + 2 H 2CO 3 H 2O + CO 2 CO 2 CO 2 Transport of CO in the Form of 2 HCO 33– + H+ Bicarbonate Ion + H 2O Hgb CO Carbonic Anhydrase Catalyzes the Reaction of CO Cl 2 2 H 2O Hgb – H+ With Water in Red Blood Cells.
