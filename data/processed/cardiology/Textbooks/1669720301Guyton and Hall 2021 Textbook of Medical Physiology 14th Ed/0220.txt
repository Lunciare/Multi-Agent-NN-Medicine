for every two K+ ions pumped to digestive secretions. At the secretory ends of the gastric the interior. Also, the membrane is far less permeable to gland parietal cells, the hydrogen ion concentration is sodium ions than to potassium ions and, once the sodium increased as much as a million- fold and then is released ions are on the outside, they have a strong tendency to into the stomach, along with chloride ions, to form hydro- stay there. This process thus represents a net loss of ions chloric acid. out the cell, which also initiates osmosis of water out of In the renal tubules, special intercalated cells found in the cell. the late distal tubules and cortical collecting ducts also If a cell begins to swell for any reason, the Na+- K+ transport hydrogen ions by primary active transport. In pump is automatically activated, moving still more ions this case, large amounts of hydrogen ions are secreted to the exterior and carrying water with them. Therefore, from the blood into the renal tubular fluid for the purpose the Na+- K+ pump performs a continual surveillance role of eliminating excess hydrogen ions from the body fluids. in maintaining normal cell volume.
