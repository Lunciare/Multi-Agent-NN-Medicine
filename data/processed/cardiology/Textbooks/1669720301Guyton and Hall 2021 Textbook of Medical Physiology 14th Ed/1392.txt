An example of this mechanism is the sodium- Lumen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump (Na+- K+ ATPase pump) that functions throughout most parts of the renal tubule. Transport that is cou- Paracellular Bulk path pled indirectly to an energy source, such as that due flow Transcellular to an ion gradient, is referred to as secondary active path transport. Reabsorption of glucose by the renal tubule Active ATP is an example of secondary active transport. Although Blood Passive solutes can be reabsorbed by active and/or passive Solutes (diffusion) mechanisms by the tubule, water is always reabsorbed passively across the tubular epithelial
