The nitrogen CO 2 pressure (Pco 2) of about 80 mm Hg, twice that in dissolved in the water of the body comes to almost com- normal alveoli, the diver usually tolerates this buildup by plete equilibrium in less than 1 hour, but the fat tissue, increasing the minute respiratory volume a maximum which requires five times as much transport of nitrogen of 8- to 11- fold to compensate for the increased CO 2. and has a relatively poor blood supply, reaches equilib- Beyond 80 mm Hg alveolar Pco 2, however, the situation rium only after several hours. Thus, if a person remains becomes intolerable, and eventually the respiratory cen- under water at a deep level for only a few minutes, not ter begins to be depressed, rather than excited, because much nitrogen dissolves in the body fluids and tissues, of the negative tissue metabolic effects of high Pco 2.
