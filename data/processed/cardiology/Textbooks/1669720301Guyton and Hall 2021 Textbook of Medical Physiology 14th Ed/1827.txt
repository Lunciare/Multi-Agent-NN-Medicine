First, succinyl-C oA, which deficiency of vitamin B or folic acid causes maturation is formed in the Krebs metabolic cycle (as explained in 12 failure in the process of erythropoiesis. Chapter 68), binds with glycine to form a pyrrole mole- cule. In turn, four pyrroles combine to form protoporphy- Maturation Failure Anemia Caused by Poor Absorp- rin IX, which then combines with iron to form the heme tion of Vitamin B From the Gastrointestinal Tract— molecule.
