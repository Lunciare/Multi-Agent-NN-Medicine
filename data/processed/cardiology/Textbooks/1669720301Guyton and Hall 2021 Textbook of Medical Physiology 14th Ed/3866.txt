causes the subsequent effects on the tors can occur as a result of (1) inactivation of some of postsynaptic cells. Although a few hormones may exert the receptor molecules; (2) inactivation of some of the some of their actions through activation of ion channel intracellular protein signaling molecules; (3) temporary receptors, most hormones that open or close ions chan- sequestration of the receptor to the inside of the cell, away nels do this indirectly by coupling with G protein–linked from the site of action of hormones that interact with cell or enzyme- linked receptors, as discussed next. membrane receptors; (4) destruction of the receptors by G Protein–Linked Hormone Receptors. Many hor- lysosomes after they are internalized; or (5) decreased mones activate receptors that indirectly regulate the ac- production of the receptors. In each case, receptor down- tivity of target proteins (e.g., enzymes or ion channels) by regulation decreases the target tissue’s responsiveness to coupling with groups of cell membrane proteins called the hormone. heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-b inding Some hormones cause up- regulation of receptors proteins (G proteins) (Figure 75- 4). All of the known G and intracellular signaling proteins; that is, the stimulat- protein–coupled receptors (∼1000) have seven trans-
