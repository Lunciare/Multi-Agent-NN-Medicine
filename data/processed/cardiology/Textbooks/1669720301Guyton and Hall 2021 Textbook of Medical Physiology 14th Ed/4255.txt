Tail (flagellum) Hormonal Factors That Stimulate Spermatogenesis The role of hormones in reproduction is discussed later in detail; for now, note that several hormones play essen- tial roles in spermatogenesis. Some of these roles are as follows: 1. Testosterone, secreted by the Leydig cells located in the interstitium of the testis (see Figure 81- 2), is essential for growth and division of the testicu- Figure 81- 4 Structure of the human spermatozoon. lar germinal cells, which is the first stage in forming sperm. 2. Luteinizing hormone, secreted by the anterior pi- tuitary gland, stimulates the Leydig cells to secrete called the female chromosome, and one Y chromosome, testosterone. the male chromosome. During meiotic division, the male 3.
