When this free flow of fluid occurs, the a Safety Factor Against Edema edema is said to be pitting edema because one can press As increased amounts of fluid are filtered into the inter- the thumb against the tissue area and push the fluid out of stitium, the interstitial fluid pressure increases, causing the area. When the thumb is removed, a pit is left in the increased lymph flow. In most tissues, the protein con- skin for a few seconds until the fluid flows back from the centration of the interstitium decreases as lymph flow is surrounding tissues. This type of edema is distinguished increased because larger amounts of protein are carried from nonpitting edema, which occurs when the tissue away than can be filtered out of the capillaries.
