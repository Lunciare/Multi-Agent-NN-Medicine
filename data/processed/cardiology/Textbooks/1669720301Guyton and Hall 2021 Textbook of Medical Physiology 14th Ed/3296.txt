These peristaltic and constric- tive movements are modified in different parts of the gas- trointestinal tract for proper propulsion and mixing, as discussed for each portion of the tract in Chapter 64. Portal Splenic vein GASTROINTESTINAL BLOOD FLOW— vein SPLANCHNIC CIRCULATION The blood vessels of the gastrointestinal system are part of Intestinal vein a more extensive system called the splanchnic circulation, Intestinal artery shown in Figure 63- 6. It includes the blood flow through the gut plus blood flows through the spleen, pancreas, and liver. The design of this system is such that all the blood Capillary that courses through the gut, spleen, and pancreas then flows immediately into the liver by way of the portal vein. Figure 63- 6. Splanchnic circulation. In the liver, the blood passes through millions of minute liver sinusoids and finally leaves the liver via hepatic veins the gut, with the tips of these arteries meeting on the side that empty into the vena cava of the general circulation. of the gut wall opposite the mesenteric attachment. From This flow of blood through the liver, before it empties the circling arteries, still much smaller arteries penetrate into the vena cava, allows the
