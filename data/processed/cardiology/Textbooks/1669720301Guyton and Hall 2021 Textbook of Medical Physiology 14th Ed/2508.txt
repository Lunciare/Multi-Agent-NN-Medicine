General Principles and Sensory Physiology SOMATOSENSORY ASSOCIATION AREAS Strong stimulus Brodmann’s areas 5 and 7 of the cerebral cortex, located in the parietal cortex behind somatosensory area I (see Figure 48- 5), play important roles in deciphering deeper meanings of the sensory information in the somatosen- Moderate stimulus sory areas. Therefore, these areas are called somatosen- sory association areas.
