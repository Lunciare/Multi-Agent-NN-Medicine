Isotonic Contractions Shorten Muscle at a Constant Tension. Muscle contraction is said to be iso- Muscle metric when the muscle does not shorten during contrac- Contracts tion and isotonic when it shortens but the tension on the muscle remains constant throughout the contraction. Systems for recording the two types of muscle contrac- tion are shown in Figure 6-12. In the isometric system, the muscle contracts against Relaxes a force transducer without decreasing the muscle length, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 6-12. In the isotonic system, the muscle shortens against a fixed load, which is illustrated in the top panel of the Low tension High tension figure, showing a muscle lifting a weight. The char- acteristics of isotonic contraction depend on the load Heavy Heavy against which the muscle contracts, as well as the iner- weight weight tia of the load. However, the isometric system records changes in force of muscle contraction independently of load inertia. Therefore, the isometric system is often Figure 6-12 Isotonic and isometric systems for recording muscle con- used when comparing the functional characteristics of tractions. Isotonic contraction occurs when the force of the muscle con- traction is greater than the load, and the
