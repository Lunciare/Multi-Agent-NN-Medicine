Note, however, that there loosely bound protein subunits, each of which plays a are no cross-b ridge heads in the center of the myosin fila- specific role in controlling muscle contraction. One of the ment for a distance of about 0.2 micrometer because the subunits (troponin I) has a strong affinity for actin, an- hinged arms extend away from the center. other (troponin T) for tropomyosin, and a third (troponin Now, to complete the picture, the myosin filament is C) for calcium ions. This complex is believed to attach the twisted so that each successive pair of cross-b ridges is axi- tropomyosin to the actin.

Another feature of the myosin head that is es- sential for muscle contraction is that it functions as an Inhibition of the Actin Filament
