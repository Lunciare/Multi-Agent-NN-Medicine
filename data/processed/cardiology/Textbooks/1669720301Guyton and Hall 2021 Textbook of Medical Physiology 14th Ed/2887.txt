area also causes appropriate respiratory internal capsule function, so respiratory activation of the vocal cords can occur simultaneously with the movements of the mouth and tongue during speech. Thus, the premotor neuronal activities related to speech are highly complex. “Voluntary” Eye Movement Field. In the premotor area immediately above Broca’s area is a locus for controlling voluntary eye movements. Damage to this area prevents a person from voluntarily moving the eyes toward different Basis pedunculi of mesencephalon objects. Instead, the eyes tend to lock involuntarily onto specific objects, an effect controlled by signals from the occipital visual cortex, as explained in Chapter 52. This frontal area also controls eyelid movements such as blink- Longitudinal ing. fascicles of pons Head Rotation Area. Slightly higher in the motor associ- ation area, electrical stimulation elicits head rotation. This area is closely associated with the eye movement field; it directs the head toward different objects. Pyramid of medulla oblongata Area for Hand Skills. In the premotor area immediately anterior to the primary motor cortex for the hands and fingers is a region that is important for “hand skills.” That Lateral corticospinal tract is, when tumors or other lesions cause destruction in this Ventral corticospinal
