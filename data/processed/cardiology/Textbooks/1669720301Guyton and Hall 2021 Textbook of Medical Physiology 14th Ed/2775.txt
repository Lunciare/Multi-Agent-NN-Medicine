Lesions that affect the auditory association areas but not the primary auditory cortex do not decrease a per- sudden onset of sounds, or perhaps special modulations, son’s ability to hear and differentiate sound tones or even such as noise versus pure frequency sounds. to interpret at least simple patterns of sound. However, The frequency range to which each individual neuron the person is often unable to interpret the meaning of the in the auditory cortex responds is much narrower than sound heard. For example, lesions in the posterior portion that in the cochlear and brain stem relay nuclei. Referring of the superior temporal gyrus, which is called Wernicke’s to Figure 53- 5B, note that the basilar membrane near the area and is part of the auditory association cortex, often base of the cochlea is stimulated by sounds of all frequen- make it impossible for a person to interpret the meanings cies and, in the cochlear nuclei, this same breadth of sound of words even though he or she hears them perfectly well representation is found.
