For the same reasons that the ventricles will not pump blood during ventricular fibrillation, neither do the HAND PUMPING OF THE HEART atria pump blood in atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the atria (CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION) become useless as primer pumps for the ventricles. Even AS AN AID TO DEFIBRILLATION so, blood flows passively through the atria into the ven- tricles, and the efficiency of ventricular pumping is de- Unless defibrillated within 1 minute after ventricular creased by only 20% to 30%.
