showing especially the hair cells and the tectorial membrane pressing against the projecting hairs. K+ Excitation of the Hair Cells. Note in Figure 53- 6 that K+ minute hairs, or stereocilia, project upward from the hair Stereocilia cells and either touch or are embedded in the surface gel coating of the tectorial membrane, which lies above the K+ stereocilia in the scala media. These hair cells are similar to the hair cells found in the macula and cristae ampul- laris of the vestibular apparatus, discussed in Chapter 56. Bending of the hairs in one direction depolarizes the hair cells, and bending in the opposite direction hyperpolar- izes them. This in turn excites the auditory nerve fibers K+ K+ K+ K+ synapsing with their bases. Figure 53- 7A shows the mechanism whereby vibra- Membrane tion of the basilar membrane excites the hair endings. The depolarization outer ends of the hair cells are fixed tightly in a rigid struc- ture composed of a flat plate, called the reticular lamina, supported by triangular rods of Corti, which are attached tightly to the basilar fibers. The basilar fibers, the rods of Corti, and the reticular lamina move as a rigid unit. Ca2+ Ca2+ Upward
