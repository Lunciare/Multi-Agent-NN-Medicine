This backup of blood enlarges the veins, and even the collapse points in the veins open up when the right atrial pressure rises above +4 to +6 mm Hg. Then, as the right atrial pressure rises further, the ad- +90 mm Hg ditional increase causes a corresponding rise in periph- eral venous pressure in the limbs and elsewhere. Because heart function must be impaired significantly to cause a Figure 15-10. Effect of gravitational pressure on the venous pres- rise in right atrial pressure as high as +4 to +6 mm Hg, sures throughout the body in the standing person. the peripheral venous pressure is not noticeably elevated, even in the early stages of heart failure, as long as the per- son is at rest. Gravitational pressure also occurs in the vascular sys- tem because of the weight of the blood in the vessels, Effect of Intra- abdominal Pressure on Venous as shown in Figure 15-10. When a person is standing, Pressures of the Leg. The pressure in the abdominal the pressure in the right atrium remains about 0 mm Hg cavity of a recumbent person normally averages about because the
