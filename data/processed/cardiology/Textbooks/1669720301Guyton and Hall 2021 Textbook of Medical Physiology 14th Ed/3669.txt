An average person can maintain normal stores of protein if the Dietary Balances daily intake is greater than 30 to 50 grams. Energy Available in Foods Some proteins have inadequate quantities of certain es- sential amino acids and therefore cannot be used to replace The energy liberated from each gram of carbohydrate as it the degraded proteins.
