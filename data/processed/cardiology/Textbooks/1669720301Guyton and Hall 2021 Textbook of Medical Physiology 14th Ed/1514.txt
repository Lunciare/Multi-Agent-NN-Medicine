Urine Concentration and Dilution 100% remaining Henle, distal tubule, and cortical collecting tubule and back down into the medullary collecting duct again. In Urea 4.5 Urea4.5 this way, urea can recirculate through these terminal parts of the tubular system several times before it is excreted. Each time around the circuit contributes to a higher con- Cortex 7 centration of urea. 100% 50% remaining remaining This urea recirculation provides an additional mecha- 30 30 nism for forming a hyperosmotic renal medulla. Because Outer H O 2 urea is one of the most abundant waste products that medulla 15 must be excreted by the kidneys, this mechanism for Urea concentrating urea before it is excreted is essential to Inner medulla 300 300 the economy of the body fluid when water is in short supply. UT-A2 500 UT-A1 When there is excess water in the body, urine flow rate increases, and therefore the concentration of urea in the UT-A3 Urea 550 inner medullary collecting ducts decreases, causing less diffusion of urea into the renal medullary interstitium. ADH levels are also reduced when there is excess body 20% remaining water, and this reduction, in turn, decreases the perme- ability of the inner medullary collecting
