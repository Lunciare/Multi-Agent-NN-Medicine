to dendrites of If either of these two cones is missing, the person cannot the ganglion cells or to other amacrine cells use this mechanism for distinguishing these four colors; the 5. The ganglion cells, which transmit output signals person is especially unable to distinguish red from green from the retina through the optic nerve into the brain and is therefore said to have red- green color blindness. A sixth type of neuronal cell in the retina, which is A person with loss of red cones is called a protanope; the not very prominent and is not shown in the figure, is the overall visual spectrum is noticeably shortened at the long interplexiform cell. This type of cell transmits signals in wavelength end because of a lack of the red cones. A color- the retrograde direction from the inner plexiform layer blind person who lacks green cones is called a deuteranope; to the outer plexiform layer. These signals are inhibitory this person has a perfectly normal visual spectral width be- cause red cones are available to detect the long wavelength and are believed to control lateral spread of visual signals red color. However, a deuteranope can only distinguish 2 by
