For example, if plasma glucose concentration is 1 g/L, the amount of For a substance to be reabsorbed, it must first be trans- glucose filtered each day is about 180 L/day × 1 g/L, or ported (1) across the tubular epithelial membranes into 180 g/day. Because virtually none of the filtered glucose the renal interstitial fluid and then (2) through the peri- is normally excreted, the rate of glucose reabsorption is tubular capillary membrane back into the blood (Figure also 180 g/day. 28- 1). Thus, reabsorption of water and solutes includes a From Table 28-1 , two things are immediately appar- series of transport steps. Reabsorption across the tubular ent.
