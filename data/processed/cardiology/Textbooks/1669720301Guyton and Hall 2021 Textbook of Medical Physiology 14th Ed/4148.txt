diabetes, insulin administration is usually SGLT2 inhibitors, required to control plasma glucose levels. insulin Incretin drugs that mimic the actions of the GLP- 1 have SGLT2, Sodium glucose co- transporter 2. been developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes. These drugs enhance insulin secretion and are intended to be used in conjunction with other antidiabetic drugs. Another bolic surgery” because many patients who undergo these therapeutic approach is to inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl operations experience complete remission of diabetes and peptidase 4 (DPP- 4), which inactivates GLP-1 and GIP. By no longer require antidiabetic drugs. Improvements of blood blocking the actions of DPP- 4, the incretin effects of GLP-1 glucose, lipids and blood pressure often occur within a few and GIP can be prolonged, leading to increased insulin se- days or weeks after surgery, suggesting that the mechanisms cretion and improved control of blood glucose levels. for these cardiovascular and metabolic benefits may extend Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes by Inhibition of Sodium- beyond weight loss and reductions in adiposity. However, the Glucose Transporter 2 (SGLT2). As discussed in Chapter 28, physiological factors that contribute to the favorable meta- approximately 90% of the glucose filtered by renal glo- bolic effects
