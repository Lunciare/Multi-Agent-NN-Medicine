Next, the active ion pump of centration gradient established by the active pumping of the thick ascending limb on the loop of Henle reduces the ions out of the thick ascending loop of Henle, eventually concentration inside the tubule and raises the interstitial raising the interstitial fluid osmolarity to 1200 to 1400 concentration; this pump establishes a 200-m Osm/L con- mOsm/L, as shown in step 7. centration gradient between the tubular fluid and intersti- Thus, the repetitive reabsorption of sodium chlo- tial fluid (Figure 29-4, step 2).
