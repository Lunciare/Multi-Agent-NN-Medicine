the ovarian cycle, before these two initial hormones can leave the ovaries, almost all the androgens and Progestins. By far the most important of the progestins much of the progesterone are converted into estro- is progesterone. However, small amounts of another pro- gens by the enzyme aromatase in the granulosa cells. gestin, 17α- hydroxyprogesterone, are secreted along with Because the theca cells lack aromatase, they cannot progesterone and have essentially the same effects. Yet, convert androgens to estrogens. However, androgens for practical purposes, progesterone is usually considered diffuse out of the theca cells into the adjacent granu- to be the only important progestin. losa cells, where they are converted to estrogens by In nonpregnant females, progesterone is usually aromatase, the activity of which is stimulated by FSH secreted in significant amounts only during the latter half (Figure 82-8 ).
