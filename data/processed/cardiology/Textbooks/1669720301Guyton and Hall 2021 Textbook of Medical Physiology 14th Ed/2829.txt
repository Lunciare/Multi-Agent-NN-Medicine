Surround- ing Motor Neurons. Also located in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, in close association with the motor neu- Alpha Motor Neurons. The alpha motor neurons give rons, are a large number of small neurons called Renshaw rise to large type A alpha (Aα) motor nerve fibers, aver- cells. Almost immediately after the anterior motor neuron aging 14 micrometers in diameter; these fibers branch axon leaves the body of the neuron, collateral branches many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the from the axon pass to adjacent Renshaw cells. Renshaw cells are inhibitory cells that transmit inhibitory signals to large skeletal muscle fibers. Stimulation of a single alpha the surrounding motor neurons. Thus, stimulation of each nerve fiber excites from three to several hundred skeletal motor neuron tends to inhibit adjacent motor neurons, muscle fibers, which are collectively called the motor unit. an effect called lateral inhibition. The motor system uses Transmission of nerve impulses into skeletal muscles and this lateral inhibition to focus, or sharpen, its signals in the their stimulation of the muscle motor units are discussed same way that the sensory system uses the same principle in Chapters 6 and 7. to allow
