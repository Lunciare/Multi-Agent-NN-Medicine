inhibitory or excitatory influences on the postsyn- aptic target. Different neurons may release different com- binations of fast-a cting transmitters that directly activate B Co-transmission; differential Ca2+ sensitivity postsynaptic receptors, as well as slow- acting transmit- ters that require activation of second messenger cascades Single Multiple and postsynaptic changes in gene expression. action action potential potentials An example of co- release of two small molecule trans- mitters is found in the raphe nucleus, located in the brain stem. These neurons provide innervation to several brain Ca2+ Ca2+ regions, they can co-r elease serotonin and glutamate, and they play an important role in the cycle of sleeping and wakefulness (see Chapters 59 and 60). ELECTRICAL EVENTS DURING NEURONAL EXCITATION The electrical events in neuronal excitation have been studied especially in the large motor neurons of the C Co-transmission; Spatial segregation anterior horns of the spinal cord. Therefore, the events described in the next few sections pertain essentially to these neurons. Except for quantitative differences, they Action also apply to most other neurons of the nervous system. potential Ca2+ Ca2+ Resting Membrane Potential of the Neuronal Soma.
