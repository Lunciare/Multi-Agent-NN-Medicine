In later pregnancy, the permeability increases and fetal hemoglobin, demonstrating that the curve for because of thinning of the membrane diffusion layers fetal hemoglobin is shifted to the left of that for maternal and because the surface area expands many times over, hemoglobin. This means that at the low Po levels in fetal 2 thus giving the tremendous increase in placental diffusion blood, the fetal hemoglobin can carry 20% to 50% more shown in Figure 83- 4. oxygen than can maternal hemoglobin.
