The hinged as explained later. arms allow the heads either to be extended far outward from the body of the myosin filament or brought close to Troponin and Its Role in Muscle Contraction. Attached the body. The hinged heads, in turn, participate in the con- intermittently along the sides of the tropomyosin mol- traction process, as discussed in the following sections. ecules are additional protein molecules called troponin. The total length of each myosin filament is uniform, These protein molecules are actually complexes of three almost exactly 1.6 micrometers. Note, however, that there loosely bound protein subunits, each of which plays a are no cross-b ridge heads in the center of the myosin fila- specific role in
