in foods becomes heat during ATP formation. Additional energy becomes heat as it is transferred from ATP to the functional systems of the cells, so even under optimal conditions, no more than 27% of all the energy from food is finally used by the functional systems. 4 Even when 27% of the energy reaches the functional sys- tems of the cells, most of this energy eventually becomes heat. For example, when proteins are synthesized, large 2 portions of ATP are used to form the peptide linkages, and 1 this action stores energy in these linkages. However, con- tinuous turnover of proteins also occurs—some are being degraded while others are being formed. When proteins Substrate concentration are degraded, the energy stored in the peptide linkages is Figure 73- 2. Effect of substrate and enzyme concentrations on the released in the form of heat into the body. rate of enzyme- catalyzed reaction. Another example is the energy used for muscle activity. Much of this energy simply overcomes the viscosity of the Role of Substrate Concentration in Regulation of Met- muscles or of the tissues so that the limbs can move. This abolic Reactions.
