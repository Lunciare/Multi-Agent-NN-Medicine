Excess aldosterone not only causes loss of potassium ions from the extracellular mmRRNNAA fluid into the urine but also stimulates transport of po- PPrrootteeiinnss tassium from the extracellular fluid into most cells of the body. Therefore, excessive secretion of aldosterone, as EENNaaCC occurs with some types of adrenal tumors, may cause a
