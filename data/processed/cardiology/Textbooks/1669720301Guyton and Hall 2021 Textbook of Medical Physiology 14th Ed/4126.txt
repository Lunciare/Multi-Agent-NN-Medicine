Thus, in hypoglycemia, glucagon is secreted in large amounts; it then greatly increases the output of glucose from the liver and thereby serves the SUMMARY OF BLOOD GLUCOSE important function of correcting the hypoglycemia. REGULATION Increased Blood Amino Acids Stimulate Secretion The blood glucose concentration is narrowly controlled of Glucagon.
