first is the sinus nodal re- the vector becomes stronger because of greater degrees gion, the area that had originally become depolarized first. 147 UNIT III UNIT III The Heart Thus, when repolarization begins, the region around the sinus node becomes positive with respect to the remain- der of the atria. Therefore, the atrial repolarization vector is backward to the vector of depolarization. (Note that this is 1 2 3 4 5 opposite to the effect that occurs in the ventricles.) There- 4 fore, as shown to the right in Figure 12-9, the so-c alled atri- al T wave follows about 0.15 second after the atrial P wave, 5 but this T wave is on the opposite side of the zero reference line from the P wave; that is, it is normally negative rather 1 than positive in the three standard bipolar limb leads. 3 In a normal ECG, the atrial T wave appears at about the same time that the QRS complex of the ventricles appears. Therefore, it is almost always totally obscured by 2 the large ventricular QRS complex, although in some very Depolarization Repolarization QRS T abnormal states it does appear in the recorded ECG.
