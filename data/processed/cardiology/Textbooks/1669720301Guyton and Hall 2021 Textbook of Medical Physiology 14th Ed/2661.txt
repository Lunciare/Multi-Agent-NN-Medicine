An example of maladjust- 10 ment of retinal adaptation occurs when a person leaves a Cone adaptation movie theater and enters the bright sunlight. Then, even the dark spots in the images seem exceedingly bright, and 1 as a consequence, the entire visual image is bleached, with 0 10 20 30 40 50 Minutes in dark little contrast among its different parts. This poor vision remains until the retina has adapted sufficiently so that Figure 51-9 .

Conversely, when a person first enters darkness, the of one- tenth that of the previously required intensity. At sensitivity of the retina is usually so slight that even the the end of 20
