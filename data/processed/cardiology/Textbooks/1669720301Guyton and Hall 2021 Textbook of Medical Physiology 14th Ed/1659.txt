→H 2CO 3← → H++HCO 3− H+ =K′× HC2 O 33 − (2) + Na+ The concentration of undissociated H CO cannot 2 3 be measured in solution because it rapidly dissociates Because of the weak dissociation of H 2CO 3, the H+ into CO and H O or into H+ and HCO −. However, the 2 2 3 concentration is extremely low. CO dissolved in the blood is directly proportional to the 2 When a strong acid such as HCl is added to the bicar- amount of undissociated H CO . Therefore, Equation 2 can 2 3 bonate buffer solution, the increased H+ released from the be rewritten as follows: acid (HCl → H+ + Cl−) is buffered by HCO −: 3 CO H+ =K× 2 ↑H++HCO 3− →H 2CO 3→CO 2+H 2O HCO 3− (3) The dissociation constant (K) for Equation 3 is only As a result, more H 2CO 3 is formed, causing increased about 1/400 of the dissociation constant (K′) of Equation 2 CO 2 and H 2O production. From these reactions, one because the proportionality ratio between H 2CO 3 and CO 2 can see that H+ from the strong acid HCl reacts with is
