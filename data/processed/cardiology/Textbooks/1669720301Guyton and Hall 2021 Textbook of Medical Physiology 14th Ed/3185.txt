Therefore, when secreted into Two Principal Types of Acetylcholine the blood, both norepinephrine and epinephrine remain Receptors—Muscarinic and Nicotinic active for 10 to 30 seconds, but their activity declines to Receptors extinction over 1 minute to several minutes. Acetylcholine activates mainly two types of receptors, RECEPTORS ON THE EFFECTOR ORGANS which are called muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The Before acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine reason for these names is that muscarine, a poison from secreted at an autonomic nerve ending can stimulate an toadstools, activates only muscarinic receptors and will not effector organ, it must first bind with specific receptors on the activate nicotinic receptors, whereas nicotine activates only effector cells. The receptor is on the outside of the cell mem- nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholine activates both of them. brane, bound as a prosthetic group to a protein molecule that Muscarinic receptors, which use G proteins as their penetrates all the way through the cell membrane.
