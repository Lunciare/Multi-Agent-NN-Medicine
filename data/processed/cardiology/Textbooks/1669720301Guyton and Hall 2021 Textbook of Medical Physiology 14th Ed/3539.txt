which represents large amounts of lactic acid are released into the blood only a little over 3% of the total energy in the glucose mol- from the skeletal muscles and consumed as an extra energy ecule. Nevertheless, this release of glycolytic energy to the source by the heart. cells, which is called anaerobic energy, can be a lifesaving Release of Energy From Glucose by the Pentose measure for up to a few minutes when oxygen becomes Phosphate Pathway unavailable. Formation of Lactic Acid During Anaerobic Glycolysis In almost all the body’s muscles, essentially all the carbo- Allows Release of Extra Anaerobic Energy. The law of hydrates utilized for energy are degraded to pyruvic acid mass action states that as the end products of a chemical by glycolysis and then oxidized. However, this glycolytic reaction build up in a reacting medium, the rate of the re- scheme is not the only means by which glucose can be action decreases, approaching zero. The two end products degraded and used to provide energy. A second impor- of the glycolytic reactions (see Figure 68-5 ) are (1) pyruvic tant mechanism for breakdown and oxidation of glucose acid and (2) hydrogen atoms combined with NAD+
