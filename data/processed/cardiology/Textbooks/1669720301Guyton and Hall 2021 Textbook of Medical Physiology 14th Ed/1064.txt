the blood glucose and, at the same time, forms large plaques, which actually protrude into the vessel lumens 264 Chapter 21 Muscle Blood Flow and Cardiac Output During Exercise and block or partially block blood flow. A common site for development of atherosclerotic plaques is the first few Artery centimeters of the major coronary arteries. Acute Coronary Artery Occlusion Acute occlusion of a coronary artery usually occurs in a Vein person who already has underlying atherosclerotic coro- nary heart disease but almost never occurs in a person with a normal coronary circulation. Acute occlusion can have various causes, two of which are the following: 1. The atherosclerotic plaque can cause a local blood clot called a thrombus that occludes the artery. The thrombus usually occurs where the arteriosclerotic plaque has broken through the endothelium, thus coming into direct contact with the flowing blood. Because the plaque presents an unsmooth surface, Artery blood platelets adhere to it, fibrin is deposited, and red blood cells become trapped to form a blood clot that grows until it occludes the vessel. Occasionally, Vein the clot breaks away from its attachment on the ath- Figure 21- 6. Minute anastomoses in the normal coronary arterial erosclerotic
