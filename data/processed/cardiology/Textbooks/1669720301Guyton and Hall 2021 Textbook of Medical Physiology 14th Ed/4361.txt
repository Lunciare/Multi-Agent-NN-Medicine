Dur- ing this period, secretions of FSH and LH by the anterior pituitary gland are at first slightly suppressed. Secretion of LH then increases abruptly 6- fold to 8- fold, and secretion Behavioral effects of FSH increases about 2- fold. The greatly increased LH secretion causes ovulation to occur. The cause of this abrupt surge in LH secretion is not known. However, the following explanations are possible: 1. It has been suggested that at this point in the cycle, estrogen has a peculiar positive feedback effect of stimulating pituitary secretion of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH (see Figure 82- 11), which is in sharp contrast to the normal negative feedback effect of Hypothalamus estrogen that occurs during the remainder of the fe- male monthly cycle. 2. The granulosa cells of the follicles begin to secrete small but increasing quantities of progesterone a day or so before the preovulatory LH surge, and it GnRH has been suggested that this secretion might be the factor that stimulates the excess LH secretion.
