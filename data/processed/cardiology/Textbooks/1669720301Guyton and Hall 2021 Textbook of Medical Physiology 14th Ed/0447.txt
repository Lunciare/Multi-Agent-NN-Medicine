The electrocardiogram in Figure 9-8 shows the P, Q, R, S, Diastole and Systole and T waves, discussed in Chapters 11 and 12. These are The total duration of the cardiac cycle, including systole electrical voltages generated by the heart and recorded and diastole, is the reciprocal of the heart rate. For exam- by the electrocardiogram from the surface of the body. ple, if the heart rate is 72 beats/min, the duration of the The P wave is caused by the spread of depolarization cardiac cycle is 1/72 min/beat—about 0.0139 min/beat, or through the atria and is followed by atrial contraction, 0.833 sec/beat. which causes a slight rise in the atrial pressure curve Figure 9- 8 shows the different events during the car- immediately after the electrocardiographic P wave. diac cycle for the left side of the heart.
