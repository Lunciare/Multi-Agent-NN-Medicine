potential occurs in heart muscle fibers, which activates sodium ion channels, or when the calcium where the plateau lasts for as long as 0.2 to 0.3 second and ion concentration decreases below a critical value, which causes contraction of heart muscle to last for this same increases the sodium permeability of the membrane. long period. The cause of the plateau is a combination of several fac- Re- Excitation Process Necessary for Spontaneous tors. First, in heart muscle, two types of channels contribute Rhythmicity. For spontaneous rhythmicity to occur, the to the depolarization process: (1) the usual voltage-a ctivated membrane—even in its natural state—must be permeable sodium channels, called fast channels; and (2) voltage- enough to sodium ions (or to calcium and sodium ions activated calcium- sodium channels (L-t ype calcium chan- through the slow calcium- sodium channels) to allow auto- nels), which are slow to open and therefore are called slow matic membrane depolarization. Thus, Figure 5- 14 shows channels. Opening of fast channels causes the spike portion that the resting membrane potential in the rhythmical con- of the action potential, whereas the prolonged opening of trol center of the heart is only −60 to −70 millivolts, which is the
