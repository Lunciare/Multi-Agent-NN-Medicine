That is, even slight filling of a segment sues (e.g., a bat wing), these filaments have been observed causes it to contract, and the fluid is pumped through the to cause rhythmical contraction of the lymphatic capillar- next valve into the next lymphatic segment. This fluid fills ies in the same rhythmic way that many of the small blood the subsequent segment and a few seconds later it also vessels and larger lymphatic vessels contract. Therefore, contracts, with the process continuing all along the lymph it is probable that at least part of lymph pumping results vessel until the fluid is finally emptied into the blood cir- from lymph capillary endothelial cell contraction in addi- culation.

Significance of Negative Interstitial From the previous discussion, one can see that the two Fluid Pressure for Holding Body Tissues primary factors that determine lymph flow are (1) the in- Together terstitial fluid pressure and (2) the activity of the lymphat- Traditionally, it has been assumed that the different
