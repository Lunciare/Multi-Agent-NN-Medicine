slow onset of contraction of smooth muscle, as well as its prolonged contraction, is caused by the slow- REGULATION OF CONTRACTION BY ness of attachment and detachment of the cross-b ridges CALCIUM IONS with the actin filaments. In addition, the initiation of con- traction in response to calcium ions is much slower than As is true for skeletal muscle, the initiating stimulus for in skeletal muscle, as will be discussed later. most smooth muscle contraction is an increase in intra- cellular calcium ions. This increase can be caused in dif- Maximum Force of Contraction Is Often Greater in ferent types of smooth muscle by nerve stimulation of Smooth Muscle Than in Skeletal Muscle.
