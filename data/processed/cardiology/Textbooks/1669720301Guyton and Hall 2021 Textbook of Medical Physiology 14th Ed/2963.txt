posterior cerebellum and adjacent of a movement and subsequent excitation at the end of a portions of the vermis. It provides neural circuits movement. for most of the body’s equilibrium movements. 716 Chapter 57 Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia Contributions to Overall Motor Control 2. The spinocerebellum. This level consists of most of Motor cortex the vermis of the posterior and anterior cerebellum plus the adjacent intermediate zones on both sides of the vermis. It provides the circuitry for coordi- nating mainly movements of the distal portions of the limbs, especially the hands and fingers. 3. The cerebrocerebellum. This level consists of the Red nucleus Thalamus large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, lateral to the intermediate zones. It receives virtu- ally all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and Intermediate adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of zone of Mesencephalon, the cerebrum. It transmits its output information in cerebellum pons, and medulla the upward direction back to the brain, function- ing in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements. These movements are Corticospinal tract planned as much as tenths of a second in advance Spinocerebellar of the actual movements. This
