Thus, successive discharges from a threshold for excitation and cause a superimposed action potential. single presynaptic terminal, if they occur rapidly enough, 582 stlovilliM Chapter 46 Organization of the Nervous System, Basic Functions of Synapses, and Neurotransmitters can add to one another; that is, they can summate. This Decrement of Electrotonic Conduction in the type of summation is called temporal summation. Dendrites—Greater Excitatory (or Inhibitory) Effect by Synapses Located Near the Soma. In Figure 46- 12, Simultaneous Summation of Inhibitory and multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses are shown Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials.
