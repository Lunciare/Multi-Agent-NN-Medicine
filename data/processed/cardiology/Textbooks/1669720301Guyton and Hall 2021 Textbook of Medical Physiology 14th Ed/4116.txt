Factors That Stimulate Insulin Secretion centrations are believed to be detected by specialized neu- rons of the hypothalamus and brain stem, as well as by Amino Acids. Some of the amino acids have an effect glucose- sensing cells in peripheral locations such as the liver. similar to excess blood glucose in stimulating insulin secre- tion. The most potent of these amino acids are arginine and lysine. This effect differs from glucose stimulation of insulin THE ROLE OF INSULIN (AND OTHER secretion in the following way: Amino acids administered HORMONES) IN “SWITCHING” BETWEEN in the absence of a rise in blood glucose cause only a small CARBOHYDRATE AND LIPID METABOLISM increase in insulin secretion.
