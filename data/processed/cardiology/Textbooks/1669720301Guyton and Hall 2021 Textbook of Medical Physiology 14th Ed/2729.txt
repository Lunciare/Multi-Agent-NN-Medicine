AUTONOMIC CONTROL OF ACCOMMO- Neural Mechanism of Stereopsis for DATION AND PUPILLARY APERTURE Judging Distances of Visual Objects AUTONOMIC NERVES TO THE EYES Because the two eyes are more than 2 inches apart, the images on the two retinas are not exactly the same. That The eye is innervated by both parasympathetic and sym- is, the right eye sees a little more of the right- hand side of pathetic nerve fibers, as shown in Figure 52- 11. The the object, and the left eye sees a little more of the left- parasympathetic preganglionic fibers arise in the Edinger- hand side; the closer the object, the greater the disparity. Westphal nucleus—the visceral nucleus portion of the Therefore, even when the two eyes are fused with each third cranial nerve—and then pass in the third nerve to other, it is still impossible for all corresponding points in the two visual images to be exactly in register at the same time. Furthermore, the nearer the object is to the eyes, the less the degree of register. This degree of nonregister pro- vides the neural mechanism for stereopsis, an important mechanism for judging the distances of visual objects up to
