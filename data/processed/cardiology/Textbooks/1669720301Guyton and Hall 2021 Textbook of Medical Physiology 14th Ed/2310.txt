the Andes and in the Himalayas ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND HIGH- live at altitudes above 13,000 feet. One group in the Peru- ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA vian Andes lives at an altitude of 17,500 feet and works in a mine at an altitude of 19,000 feet. Many of these natives A small percentage of people who ascend rapidly to high are born at these high altitudes and live there all their altitudes become acutely sick and can die if not given O 2 lives. They are superior to even the best-a cclimatized or rapidly moved to a low altitude. The sickness begins lowlanders in all aspects of acclimatization, even though from a few hours up to about 2 days after ascent. Two the lowlanders might have lived at high altitudes for 10 events frequently occur: or more years. Acclimatization of the natives begins in 1. Acute cerebral edema. This edema is believed to infancy. The chest size, especially, is greatly increased, result from local vasodilation of the cerebral blood whereas the body size is somewhat decreased, giving a vessels, which is caused by the hypoxia.
