concentration of H+, which averages only H+ with less vigor. A strong base is one that reacts rap- 0.00004 mEq/L. Equally important, the normal variation idly and strongly with H+ and, therefore, quickly removes in H+ concentration in extracellular fluid is only about H+ from a solution. A typical example is OH−, which re- one millionth as great as the normal variation in sodium acts with H+ to form water (H O). A typical weak base 2 ion (Na+) concentration. Thus, the precision with which is HCO − because it binds with H+ much more weakly 3 H+ is regulated emphasizes its importance to the various than OH−. Most acids and bases in the extracellular fluid cell functions. that are involved in normal acid– base regulation are weak acids and bases. The most important ones that we discuss ACIDS AND BASES—DEFINITIONS AND are carbonic acid (H 2CO 3) and HCO 3− base.
