For example, one of the large maps in the pri- of the different sound frequencies in the cochlear nuclei, mary auditory cortex almost certainly discriminates the two patterns in the inferior colliculi, one precise pattern sound frequencies and gives the person the psychic sen- for discrete sound frequencies in the auditory cortex, and sation of sound pitches. Another map is probably used to at least five other less precise patterns in the auditory cor- detect the direction from which the sound comes. Other tex and auditory association areas. auditory cortex areas detect special qualities, such as the 670 Chapter 53 The Sense of Hearing Low frequency High frequency Indeed, the parietal portion of the auditory association cortex partly overlaps somatosensory area II, which could provide an opportunity for the association of auditory information with somatosensory information. Discrimination of Sound “Patterns” by the Auditory Cortex. Complete bilateral removal of the auditory cortex does not prevent a cat or monkey from detecting sounds or reacting in a crude manner to sounds. However, it does greatly reduce or sometimes even abolish the animal’s ability to discriminate different sound pitches and espe- cially patterns of sound. For example,
