The vital capacity and the functional residual capacity of Girls the lungs are especially small in relation to the size of the 60 infant. In addition, surfactant secretion is depressed or ab- sent. As a consequence, respiratory distress syndrome is a common cause of death. Also, the low functional residual 50 capacity in the premature infant is often associated with periodic breathing of the Cheyne- Stokes type. Gastrointestinal Function. Another major problem of 40 the premature infant is ingesting and absorbing adequate food. In infants who are more than 2 months premature, the digestive and absorptive systems are almost always in- 30 adequate.
