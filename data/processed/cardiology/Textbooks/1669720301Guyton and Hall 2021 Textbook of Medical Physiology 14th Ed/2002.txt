This further of completion to the final clot is limited only by the blocks the effect of thrombin on the fibrinogen and then amount of tissue factor released from the traumatized also inactivates thrombin itself during the next 12 to 20 tissues and by the quantities of factors X, VII, and V in minutes. 483 UNIT VI UNIT VI Blood Cells, Immunity, and Blood Coagulation Heparin. Heparin is another powerful anticoagulant but, converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn removes because its concentration in the blood is normally low, the remaining unnecessary blood clot. In fact, many small it has significant anticoagulant effects only under special blood vessels in which blood flow has been blocked by physiological conditions. However, heparin is used widely clots are reopened by this mechanism. Thus, an especially as a pharmacological agent in medical practice in much important function of the plasmin system is to remove higher concentrations to prevent intravascular clotting. minute clots from millions of tiny peripheral vessels that The heparin molecule is a highly negatively charged eventually would become occluded were there no way to conjugated polysaccharide. By itself, it has little or no clear them. anticoagulant properties, but when it combines with
