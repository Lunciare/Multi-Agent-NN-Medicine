convection increases accordingly. The rays. All objects that are not at absolute zero temperature cooling effect of wind at low velocities is about propor- radiate such rays. The human body radiates heat rays in tional to the square root of the wind velocity. For example, all directions. Heat rays are also being radiated from the a wind of 4 miles per hour is about twice as effective for walls of rooms and other objects toward the body. If the cooling as a wind of 1 mile per hour. temperature of the body is greater than the temperature Conduction and Convection of Heat From a Person of the surroundings, a greater quantity of heat is radiated Suspended in Water. Water has a specific heat several from the body than is radiated to the body. thousand times as great as that of air, so each unit portion Conductive Heat Loss Occurs by Direct Contact With of water adjacent to the skin can absorb far greater quan- an Object. As shown in Figure 74- 4, only minute quanti- tities of heat than can be absorbed by air. Also, heat con- ties of heat, about 3%, are normally lost from the body by ductivity
