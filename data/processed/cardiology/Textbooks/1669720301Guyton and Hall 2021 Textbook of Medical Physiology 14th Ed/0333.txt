another fraction of a second, which in nutrients) that can be converted into work, even under allows the muscle to continue its contraction. There are the best conditions, is less than 25%, with the remainder three sources of the energy for this rephosphorylation. becoming heat. The reason for this low efficiency is that The first source of energy that is used to reconstitute about one-half of the energy in foodstuffs is lost during the the ATP is the substance phosphocreatine, which carries a formation of ATP and, even then, only 40% to 45% of the high-e nergy phosphate bond similar to the bonds of ATP. energy in ATP itself can later be converted into work. The high- energy phosphate bond of phosphocreatine has Maximum efficiency can be realized only when the a slightly higher amount of free energy than that of each muscle contracts at a moderate velocity. If the muscle con- ATP bond, as discussed in more detail in Chapters 68 and tracts slowly or without any movement, small amounts of 73. Therefore, phosphocreatine is instantly cleaved, and its maintenance heat are released during contraction, even though little or no work is performed, thereby decreasing released energy causes bonding
