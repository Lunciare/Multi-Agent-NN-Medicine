As discussed in Chapter 28, aldosterone increases reabsorption of sodium 100 and simultaneously increases secretion of potassium by the renal tubular epithelial cells, especially in the principal 90 cells of the collecting tubules and, to a lesser extent, in the 400 distal tubules and collecting ducts. Therefore, aldosterone causes sodium to be conserved in the extracellular fluid 300 while increasing potassium excretion in the urine. A high concentration of aldosterone in the plasma can 200 transiently decrease the sodium loss into the urine to as 100 little as a few milliequivalents per day.
