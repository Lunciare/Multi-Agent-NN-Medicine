Chronic reductions in blood pressure and blood flow have the opposite effects, as previously described. the smaller lumen diameter, a process called inward eutrophic remodeling, with no change in the total cross- sectional area of the vascular wall (Figure 17-8 ). pressures than arteries and have much thinner walls, but In larger arteries that do not constrict in response to when a vein is sewn onto the aorta and connected to a the increased pressure, the vessel wall is exposed to coronary artery, it is exposed to increases in intralumi- increased wall tension that stimulates a hypertrophic nal pressure and wall tension.
