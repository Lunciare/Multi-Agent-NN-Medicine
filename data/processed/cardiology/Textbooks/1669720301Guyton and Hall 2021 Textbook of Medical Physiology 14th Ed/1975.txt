local hormones that cular endothelium, and blood platelets; and (3) nervous cause many vascular and other local tissue reactions; (5) reflexes. The nervous reflexes are initiated by pain nerve an important protein called fibrin- stabilizing factor, which impulses or other sensory impulses that originate from the we discuss later in relation to blood coagulation; and (6) traumatized vessel or nearby tissues. However, even more a growth factor that causes vascular endothelial cells, vas- vasoconstriction probably results from local myogenic cular smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to multiply and contraction of the blood vessels initiated by direct dam- grow, thus causing cellular growth that eventually helps age to the vascular wall. And, for the smaller vessels, the repair damaged vascular walls. platelets are responsible for much of the vasoconstriction On the platelet cell membrane surface is a coat of glyco- by releasing a vasoconstrictor substance, thromboxane A 2. proteins that repulses adherence to normal endothelium The more severely a vessel is traumatized, the greater and yet causes adherence to injured areas of the vessel the degree of vascular spasm. The spasm can last for many wall, especially to injured endothelial cells and even more minutes or even hours, during which time
