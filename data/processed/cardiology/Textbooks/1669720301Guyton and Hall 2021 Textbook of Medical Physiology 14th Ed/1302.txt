Figure 26- 1 shows the many important homeostatic functions, including the response of the kidneys to a sudden 10-f old increase in following: sodium intake from a low level of 30 mEq/day to a high • Excretion of metabolic waste products and foreign level of 300 mEq/day. Within 2 to 3 days after raising the chemicals sodium intake, renal excretion also increases to about 300 • Regulation of water and electrolyte balances mEq/day so that the balance between intake and output • Regulation of body fluid osmolality and electrolyte is rapidly re- established.
