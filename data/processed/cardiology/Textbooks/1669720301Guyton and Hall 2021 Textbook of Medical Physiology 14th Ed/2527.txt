T12 C6 S2 L1 L1 Some Special Aspects of Somatosensory Function L2 C8 S4&5 C7 L2 Function of the Thalamus in Somatic Sensation S3 When the somatosensory cortex of a human being is de- L3 stroyed, that person loses most critical tactile sensibilities, L3 S2 but a slight degree of crude tactile sensibility does return. Therefore, it must be assumed that the thalamus (and other lower centers) has a slight ability to discriminate tactile sensation, even though the thalamus normally functions L4 L4 mainly to relay this type of information to the cortex. Conversely, loss of the somatosensory cortex has little ef- fect on one’s perception of pain sensation and only a moder- ate effect on the perception of temperature. Therefore, the lower brain stem, the thalamus, and other associated basal L5 regions of the brain are believed to play dominant roles in discrimination of these sensibilities. It is interesting that L5 S1 L5 S1 these sensibilities appeared very early in the phylogenetic development of animals, whereas the critical tactile sensibil- L4 ities and the somatosensory cortex were late developments.
