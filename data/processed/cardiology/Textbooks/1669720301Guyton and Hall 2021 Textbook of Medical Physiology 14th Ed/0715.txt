In fact, only when the aortic pulsations one begins to hear tapping sounds from the antecubital are extremely large or the arterioles are greatly dilated can artery in synchrony with the heartbeat. As soon as these pulsations be observed in the capillaries. sounds begin to be heard, the pressure level indicated by This progressive diminution of the pulsations in the the manometer connected to the cuff is about equal to the periphery is called damping of the pressure pulses. The systolic pressure. cause of this damping is twofold: (1) resistance to blood As the pressure in the cuff is lowered still more, the movement in the vessels; and (2) compliance of the ves- Korotkoff sounds change in quality, having less of the sels. The resistance damps the pulsations because a small tapping quality and more of a rhythmical and harsher amount of blood must flow forward at the pulse wave quality.
