if consist of mechanisms that increase the intracellular con- loid osmotic pressure. From this equation, one can see centration of sodium and other solutes. that any one of the following changes can increase the cap- illary filtration rate: EDEMA: EXCESS FLUID IN THE TISSUES • Increased capillary filtration coefficient • Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure Edema refers to the presence of excess fluid in the body • Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure tissues. In many cases, edema occurs mainly in the extra- Lymphedema—Failure of Lymph Vessels cellular fluid compartment, but it can also involve intra- to Return Fluid and Protein to the Blood cellular fluid accumulation. When lymphatic function is greatly impaired as a result of INTRACELLULAR EDEMA blockage or loss of the lymph vessels, edema can become especially severe because plasma proteins that leak into Three conditions are especially prone to cause intracel- the interstitium cannot be removed in any other way. The lular swelling: (1) hyponatremia, as discussed earlier; (2) rise in protein concentration raises the colloid osmotic depression of the metabolic systems of the tissues; and pressure of interstitial fluid, which draws even more fluid (3) lack of adequate nutrition to the cells. For example, out of the
