The lens system of the eye (Figure 50- 9) is composed of About two-thirds of the 59 diopters of refractive power four refractive interfaces: (1) the interface between air of the eye is provided by the anterior surface of the cor- and the anterior surface of the cornea; (2) the interface nea (not by the eye lens). The principal reason for this between the posterior surface of the cornea and the aque- phenomenon is that the refractive index of the cornea is ous humor; (3) the interface between the aqueous humor markedly different from that of air, whereas the refractive and the anterior surface of the lens of the eye; and (4) the index of the eye lens is not greatly different from the indi- interface between the
