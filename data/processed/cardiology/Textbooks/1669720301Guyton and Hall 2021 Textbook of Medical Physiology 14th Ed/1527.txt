The early distal tubule has properties highly concentrated urine. similar to those of the thick ascending loop of Henle, so Second, large quantities of dilute urine can be excreted further dilution of the tubular fluid to about 100 mOsm/L without increasing sodium excretion. This feat is accom- occurs as solutes are reabsorbed while water remains in plished by decreasing ADH secretion, which reduces the tubule. water reabsorption in the more distal tubular segments without significantly altering sodium reabsorption. Late Distal Tubule and Cortical Collecting Tubules. Finally, there is an obligatory urine volume dictated In the late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubules, by the maximum concentrating ability of the kidney and the osmolarity of the fluid depends on the level of ADH. amount of solute that must be excreted. Therefore, if With high ADH levels, these tubules are highly perme- large amounts of solute must be excreted, they must be able to water, and significant amounts of water are reab- accompanied by the minimal amount of water necessary sorbed. Urea, however, is not very permeant in this part to excrete them. For example, if 600 milliosmoles of solute of the nephron, resulting in increased urea concentra- must be excreted each
