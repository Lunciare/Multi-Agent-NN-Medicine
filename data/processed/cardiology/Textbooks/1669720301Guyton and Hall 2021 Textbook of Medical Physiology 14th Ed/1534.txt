Osmoreceptors Plasma sodium concentration is normally regulated ADH secretion within close limits of 140 to 145 mEq/L, with an average (posterior pituitary) concentration of about 142 mEq/L. Osmolarity averages about 300 mOsm/L (≈282 mOsm/L when corrected for interionic attraction) and seldom changes more than ±2% to 3%. As discussed in Chapter 25, these variables must Plasma ADH be precisely controlled because they determine the distri- bution of fluid between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. H O
