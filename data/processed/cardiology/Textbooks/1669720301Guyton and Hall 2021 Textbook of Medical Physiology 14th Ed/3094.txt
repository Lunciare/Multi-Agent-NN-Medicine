A center that opposes the desire for food, called the Hormonal Sympathetic Feeding satiety center, is located in the ventromedial nuclei. When regulation Parasympathetic behavior this center is stimulated electrically, an animal that is Core body temperature eating food suddenly stops eating and shows complete indifference to food.

The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus expression contains at least two different types neurons that, when Cardiovascular Renal Metabolism stimulated, lead either to increased or decreased appetite.
