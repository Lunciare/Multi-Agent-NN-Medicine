This process continues throughout Thus, the total delay in the A- V nodal and A- V bundle a person’s life. system is about 0.13 second. This delay, in addition to the initial conduction delay of 0.03 second from the sinus INTERNODAL AND INTERATRIAL PATHWAYS node to the A- V node, makes a total delay of 0.16 second TRANSMIT CARDIAC IMPULSES THROUGH before the excitatory signal finally reaches the contracting THE ATRIA muscle of the ventricles. The ends of the sinus nodal fibers connect directly with Cause of the Slow Conduction. The slow conduction in the surrounding atrial muscle fibers. Therefore, action the transitional, nodal, and penetrating A- V bundle fibers potentials originating in the sinus node travel outward is caused mainly by diminished numbers of gap junctions into these atrial muscle fibers. In this way, the action between successive cells in the conducting pathways, so potential spreads through the entire atrial muscle mass there is great resistance to conduction
