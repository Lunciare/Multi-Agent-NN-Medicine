described later. The Nuclear Chain Fibers—Dynamic and Static Responses end portions that do contract are excited by small gamma of the Muscle Spindle. There are also two types of mus- motor nerve fibers that originate from small type A gamma cle spindle intrafusal fibers: (1) nuclear bag muscle fibers motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, (one to three in each spindle), in which several muscle 687 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C. Motor and Integrative Neurophysiology fiber nuclei are congregated in expanded “bags” in the central portion of the receptor area, as shown by the top fiber in Figure 55- 4, and (2) nuclear chain fibers (three to nine), which are about half as large in diameter and half as long as the nuclear bag fibers and have nuclei aligned in a chain throughout the receptor area, as shown by the bot- tom fiber in the figure. The primary sensory nerve ending is excited by both the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers and the Sensory nerve nuclear chain fibers. Conversely, the secondary ending is usually excited only by nuclear chain fibers. These rela- tions are shown in Figure 55- 4. The Primary and the Secondary
