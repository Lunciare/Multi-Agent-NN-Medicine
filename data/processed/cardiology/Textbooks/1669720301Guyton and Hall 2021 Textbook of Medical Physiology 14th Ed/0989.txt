Thus, maintenance of a normal arterial pressure by High Cardiac Output Caused by Reduced Total Peripheral Resistance the nervous system reflexes, by mechanisms explained in The left side of Figure 20- 7 identifies conditions that cause With nervous control abnormally high cardiac outputs. One of the distinguish- Without nervous control ing features of these conditions is that they all result from 6 Dinitrophenol chronically reduced total peripheral resistance None of 5 them result from excessive excitation of the heart itself, 4 which we will explain subsequently. Let us consider some 3 of the conditions that can decrease the peripheral resist- 2 ance and at the same time increase the cardiac output to 0 above normal. 1. Beriberi.
