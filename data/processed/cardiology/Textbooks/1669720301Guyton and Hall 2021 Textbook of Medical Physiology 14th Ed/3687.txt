UNIT XIII Unit XIII Metabolism and Temperature Regulation orexigenic neurons are activated to release NPY, which are transmitted mainly by way of the vagi to suppress the stimulates appetite. At the same time, firing of the POMC feeding centers, thereby reducing the desire for food and neurons is reduced, thereby decreasing the activity of the providing a negative feedback mechanism to help limit melanocortin pathway and further stimulating appetite. meal size (see Figure 72- 1). Neural Centers That Influence the Mechanical Process Gastrointestinal Hormonal Factors Suppress Feeding. of Feeding. Another aspect of feeding is the mechanical CCK, which is released mainly in response to fat and pro- act of the feeding process. If the brain is sectioned be- teins entering the duodenum, enters the blood and acts as low the hypothalamus but above the mesencephalon, the a hormone to influence several gastrointestinal functions animal can still perform the basic mechanical features of such as gallbladder contraction, gastric emptying, gut the feeding process. It can salivate, lick its lips, chew food, motility, and gastric acid secretion as discussed in Chap- and swallow. Therefore, the actual mechanics of feeding ters 63, 64, and 65.
