of secondary active transport. Although Blood Passive solutes can be reabsorbed by active and/or passive Solutes (diffusion) mechanisms by the tubule, water is always reabsorbed passively across the tubular epithelial membrane by the Osmosis H 2O process of osmosis. Solutes Can Be Transported Through Epithelial Cells REABSORPTION EXCRETION or Between Cells. Renal tubular cells, like other epithe- lial cells, are held together by tight junctions. Lateral inter- Figure 28- 1 Reabsorption of filtered water and solutes from the tu- cellular spaces lie behind the tight junctions and separate bular lumen across the tubular epithelial cells, through the renal inter- the epithelial cells of the tubule. Solutes can be reab- stitium, and back into the blood. Solutes are transported through the sorbed or secreted across the cells through the transcel- cells (transcellular path) by passive diffusion or active transport, or be- tween the cells (paracellular path) by diffusion. Water is transported lular pathway or between the cells by moving across the through the cells and between the tubular cells by osmosis.
