signals. This characteristic is that they Action potential Mitochondria always transmit the signals in one direction—that is, from the neuron that secretes the neurotransmitter, called the presynaptic neuron, to the neuron on which the transmit- Ca2+ ter acts, called the postsynaptic neuron. This phenomenon Synaptic is the principle of one- way conduction at chemical synaps- Presynaptic vesicle es, and it is different from conduction through electrical terminal synapses, which often transmit signals in either direction. A one- way conduction mechanism allows signals to Neurotransmitter be directed toward specific goals. Indeed, it is this spe- cific transmission of signals to discrete and highly focused Synaptic cleft (200-300 Å) areas both within the nervous system and at the terminals of the peripheral nerves that allows the nervous system to Ionotropic Metabotropic perform its myriad functions of sensation, motor control, receptor receptor Ions Second memory, and many other functions. Postsynaptic messenger terminal PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE Cellular response: SYNAPSE • Membrane potential • Biochemical cascades • Regulation of gene expression Figure 46- 6 shows a typical anterior motor neuron in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. It is composed of three major parts—the soma, which is the main body of the B
