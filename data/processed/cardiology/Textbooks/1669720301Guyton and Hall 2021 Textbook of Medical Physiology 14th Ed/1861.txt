antibodies then adhere to the bacterial gaps between endothelial cells of the blood capillaries and membranes and thereby make the bacteria especially sus- postcapillary venules by diapedesis.

To do this, the antibody molecule cellular gaps are much smaller than a cell, a small portion also combines with the C3 product of the complement cas- of the cell slides through the gap at a time; the portion cade, which is an additional part of the immune system dis- sliding through is momentarily constricted to the size of cussed in the next chapter. The C3 molecules, in turn, attach the gap, as shown in Figure 34- 2 (also see Figure 34- 6). to receptors on the phagocyte membrane, thus initiating phagocytosis. This process whereby a pathogen is selected White Blood Cells Move Through Tissue Spaces by for phagocytosis and destruction is called opsonization. Ameboid Motion. Both neutrophils and macrophages can move through the tissues by ameboid motion, described in Phagocytosis by Neutrophils. The neutrophils enter- Chapter 2.
