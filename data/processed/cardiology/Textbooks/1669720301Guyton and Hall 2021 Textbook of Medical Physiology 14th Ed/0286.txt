After another delay of milliseconds or seconds, sodium channels close, and permeability to potassium spontaneous excitability causes depolarization again, and a ions increases. new action potential occurs spontaneously. This cycle con- tinues over and over and causes self-i nduced rhythmical RHYTHMICITY OF SOME EXCITABLE excitation of the excitable tissue. TISSUES—REPETITIVE DISCHARGE Why does the membrane of the heart control center not depolarize immediately after it has become repolarized, Repetitive self- induced discharges occur normally in rather than delaying for nearly 1 second before the onset the heart, in most smooth muscle, and in many of the of the next action potential? The answer can be found by neurons of the central nervous system. These rhythmi- observing the curve labeled “potassium conductance” in cal discharges cause the following: (1) rhythmical beat Figure 5- 14. This curve shows that toward the end of of the heart; (2) rhythmical peristalsis of the intestines; each action potential, and continuing for a short period and (3) neuronal events such as the rhythmical control of thereafter, the membrane becomes more permeable to breathing. potassium ions.
