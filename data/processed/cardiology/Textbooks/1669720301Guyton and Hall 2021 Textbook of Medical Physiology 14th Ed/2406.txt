Therefore, because of the high Pump intracellular potassium ion concentration, there is a net tendency for potassium ions to diffuse to the outside of Axon hillock the neuron, but this action is opposed by continual pump- ing of these potassium ions back to the interior. Finally, the chloride ion gradient, 107 mEq/L outside and 8 mEq/L inside, yields a Nernst potential of −70 mV Figure 46- 9.

Therefore, chloride ions tend to leak very slightly to the interior of somal membrane sodium pump that continually pumps the neuron, but those few that do leak are moved back to sodium out of the neuron. the exterior, perhaps by an active chloride pump.
