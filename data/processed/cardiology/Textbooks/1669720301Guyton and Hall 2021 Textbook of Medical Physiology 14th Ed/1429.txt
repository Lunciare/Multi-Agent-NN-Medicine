This the sodium- chloride co-t ransporter. co- transport protein in the luminal membrane uses the potential energy released by downhill diffusion of sodium LATE DISTAL TUBULES AND CORTICAL into the cell to drive the reabsorption of potassium into COLLECTING TUBULES the cell against a concentration gradient. The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is the The second half of the distal tubule and subsequent site of action of the powerful loop diuretics furosemide, cortical collecting tubule have similar functional char- ethacrynic acid, and bumetanide, all of which inhibit the acteristics. Anatomically, they are composed of two dis- action of the NKCC2 co- transporter. These diuretics are tinct cell types, the principal cells and intercalated cells 351 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys Renal Tubular Early distal tubule interstitial Tubular lumen fluid cells (−10 mV) Na+, Cl–, Ca2+, Mg2+ NNaa++ ATP NNaa++ KK++ − CCll–– CCll–– Late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule TThhiiaazziiddee ddiiuurreettiiccss Principal Na+, Cl– cells Figure 28- 10 Mechanism of sodium chloride transport in the early distal tubule.
