into the interstitial fluid and blood. time, it is essential that new ATP be formed continuously, Therefore, much of the muscle glycogen is transformed to even during the performance of short athletic events. Figure lactic acid, but in doing so, considerable amounts of ATP 85-2 shows the overall metabolic system, demonstrating the are formed entirely without consumption of oxygen. breakdown of ATP first to ADP and then to AMP, with release Another characteristic of the glycogen–lactic acid system of energy to the muscles for contraction. The left-h and side of is that it can form ATP molecules about 2.5 times as rapidly the figure shows the three metabolic systems that provide a as can the oxidative mechanism of mitochondria. Therefore, continuous supply of ATP in the muscle fibers. when large amounts of ATP are required for short to moder- ate periods of muscle contraction, this anaerobic glycolysis Phosphocreatine- Creatine System mechanism can be used as a rapid source of energy. However, Phosphocreatine (also called creatine phosphate) is anoth- it is only about one-half as rapid as the phosphagen system. er chemical compound that has a high-e nergy phosphate Under optimal conditions, the glycogen–lactic acid system bond, with the following formula:
