ADP H C COOH 2H 2 ATP Figure 68- 6 shows the different stages of the chemical H C COOH reactions in the citric acid cycle. The substances to the left 2 (Succinic acid) are added during the chemical reactions, and the products 2H of the chemical reactions are shown to the right. Note at the HC COOH top of the column that the cycle begins with oxaloacetic acid, HOOC CH and at the bottom of the chain of reactions, oxaloacetic acid (Fumaric acid) is formed again. Thus, the cycle can continue repeatedly. H O 2 In the initial stage of the citric acid cycle, acetyl- CoA H combines with oxaloacetic acid to form citric acid. The co- HO C COOH enzyme A portion of the acetyl-C oA is released and can be HC COOH used repeatedly to form additional quantities of acetyl-C oA 2 (Malic acid) from pyruvic acid. The acetyl portion, however, becomes 2H an integral part of the citric acid molecule. During the suc- O C COOH cessive stages of the citric acid cycle, several molecules of H C COOH water
