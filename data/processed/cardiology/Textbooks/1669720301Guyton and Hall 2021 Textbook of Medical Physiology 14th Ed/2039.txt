The net effect is to cause an elastic contractile unkinked, thereby elongating and exerting even more force of the entire lungs, which is called the surface ten- elastic force. sion elastic force. The elastic forces caused by surface tension are much more complex. The significance of surface tension is Surfactant and Its Effect on Surface Tension.
