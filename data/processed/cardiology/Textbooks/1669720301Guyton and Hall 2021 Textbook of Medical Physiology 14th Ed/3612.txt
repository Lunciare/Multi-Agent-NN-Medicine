which is an average of about 2 mg/dl for each of the 20 amino acids, although some are R CH CO present in far greater amounts than are others. Because the amino acids are relatively strong acids, they exist in the NH+ H O blood principally in the ionized state, as a result of the re- 2 moval of one hydrogen atom from the NH radical. They 2 actually account for 2 to 3 milliequivalents of the negative R(cid:31) CH COOH ions in the blood. The precise distribution of the different amino acids in the blood depends to some extent on the Note in this reaction that the nitrogen of the amino types of proteins eaten, but the concentrations of at least radical of one amino acid bonds with the carbon of the some individual amino acids are regulated by selective syn- carboxyl radical of the other amino acid.
