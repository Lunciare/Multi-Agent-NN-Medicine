Another type of flow- meter that can be applied to the outside of the vessel and that has many of the same advantages as the electro- A magnetic flowmeter is the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter, shown in Figure 14-5. A minute piezoelectric crystal is mounted at one end in the wall of the device. This crystal, when energized with an appropriate electronic apparatus, B transmits ultrasound at a frequency of several hundred thousand cycles per second downstream along the flow- ing blood. A portion of the sound is reflected by the red blood cells in the flowing blood. The reflected ultrasound C waves then travel backward from the blood cells toward the crystal. These reflected waves have a lower frequency Figure 14-6. A, Two fluids (one dyed red, and the other clear) before than the transmitted wave because the red blood cells are flow begins. B, The same fluids 1 second after flow begins. C, Turbu- moving away from the
