Almost without exception, a hormone affects its target change the activity of an enzyme in the cytoplasm of the tissues by first forming a hormone- receptor complex. For- cell, or (3) activate gene transcription. mation of this complex alters the function of the receptor, The trimeric G proteins are named for their ability to and the activated receptor initiates the hormonal effects. bind guanosine nucleotides. In their inactive state, the To explain this process, let us give a few examples of the α, β, and γ subunits of G proteins form a complex that different types of interactions. binds guanosine diphosphate (GDP) on the α subunit.

Mechanism of activation of a G protein–coupled receptor. When the hormone activates the receptor, the inactive α, β, and γ G protein complex associates with the receptor and is activated, with an exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for guanosine diphosphate (GDP). This process causes the α subunit (to which the GTP is bound) to dissociate from the β and γ subunits of the G protein
