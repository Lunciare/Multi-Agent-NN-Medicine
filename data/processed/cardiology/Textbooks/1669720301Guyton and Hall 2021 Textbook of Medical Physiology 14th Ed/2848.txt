Any time a person must perform a muscle function that requires a high degree of delicate and exact posi- tioning, excitation of the appropriate muscle spindles by Clonus—Oscillation of Muscle Jerks. Under some signals from the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the conditions, the muscle jerks can oscillate, a phenomenon brain stem stabilizes the positions of the major joints.
