When adequate amounts of en- 1500- meter run ergy are available from oxidative metabolism, removal of 1- mile run lactic acid is achieved in two ways: (1) A small portion of it 400- meter swim is converted back into pyruvic acid and then metabolized Aerobic System oxidatively by the body tissues, and (2) the remaining lactic 10,000- meter skating acid is reconverted into glucose mainly in the liver, and the Cross- country skiing glucose in turn is used to replenish the glycogen stores of Marathon run (26.2 miles, 42.2 kilometers) the muscles. Jogging Recovery of the Aerobic System After Exercise. Even during the early stages of heavy exercise, a portion of one’s aerobic energy capability is depleted. This depletion results When comparing the same systems for endurance, the rela- from two effects: (1) the so- called oxygen debt and (2) de- tive values are the following: pletion of glycogen stores of the muscles.
