When the seminiferous tu- bules fail to produce sperm, secretion of FSH by the ante- rior pituitary gland increases markedly. Conversely, when LH and FSH are glycoproteins. They exert their effects spermatogenesis proceeds too rapidly, pituitary secretion on their target tissues in the testes mainly by activating of FSH diminishes. The cause of this negative feedback the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger sys- effect on the anterior pituitary is believed to be secretion tem, which in turn activates specific enzyme systems in by the Sertoli cells of still another hormone called inhibin the respective target cells.
