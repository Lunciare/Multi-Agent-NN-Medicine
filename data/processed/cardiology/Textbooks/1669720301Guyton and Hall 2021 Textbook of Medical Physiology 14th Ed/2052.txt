Concentration of oxygen in arterial blood be expired into the spirometer, and this volume consti- tutes about half of the FRC. To measure FRC, the spirom- CVo2 Co bn lc oe on dtration of oxygen in mixed venous eter must be used in an indirect manner, usually by means So2 Percentage saturation of hemoglobin with of a helium dilution method, as follows. oxygen A spirometer of known volume is filled with air Sao2 Percentage saturation of hemoglobin with mixed with helium at a known concentration. Before oxygen in arterial blood 496 Chapter 38 Pulmonary Ventilation breathing from the spirometer, the person expires nor- 80 mally. At the end of this expiration, the remaining vol- ume in the lungs is equal to the FRC. At this point, the 60 nitrogen concentration subject immediately begins to breathe from the spirom- d e eter, and the gases of the spirometer mix with the gases ord of the lungs. As a result, the helium becomes diluted by 40 ec R the FRC gases, and the volume of the FRC can be calcu- lated from the degree of dilution of the helium, using the 20 following formula: Ci FRC = He −1 Vi Spir 0
