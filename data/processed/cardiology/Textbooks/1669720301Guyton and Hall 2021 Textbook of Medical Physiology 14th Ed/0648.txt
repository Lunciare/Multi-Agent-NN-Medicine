Because the waves minutes usually causes permanent mental impairment are weak, and many of them are of opposite polarity at any or even destruction of brain tissue. Even if the heart is given time, they usually almost completely electrically neu- revived, the person may die from the effects of brain dam- tralize one another. Therefore, in the ECG, one can see either age or may live with permanent mental impairment. no P waves from the atria or only a fine, high-f requency, very 166 Chapter 13 Cardiac Arrhythmias and Their Electrocardiographic Interpretation Figure 13-21.
