LIFE SPAN OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS NEUTROPHILS AND MACROPHAGES DEFEND AGAINST INFECTIONS The life of the granulocytes after being released from the bone marrow is normally 4 to 8 hours circulating in the It is mainly the neutrophils and tissue macrophages that blood and another 4 to 5 days in tissues where they are attack and destroy invading bacteria, viruses, and other 450 Chapter 34 Resistance of the Body to Infection inflamed area are formed (Video 34-1 ). They include the following: (1) some of the bacterial or viral toxins; (2) de- generative products of the inflamed tissues; (3) several reaction products of the complement complex (discussed in Chapter 35) activated in inflamed tissues; and (4) sev- Increased Margination Diapedesis eral reaction products caused by plasma clotting in the permeability inflamed area, as well as other substances. As shown in Figure 34- 2, chemotaxis depends on the concentration gradient of the chemotactic substance. The concentration is greatest near the source, which directs the unidirectional movement of the WBCs. Chemotaxis Chemotaxis is effective up to 100 micrometers
