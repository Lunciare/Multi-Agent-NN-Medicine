3H O, 2H O, antipyrine 2 2 of dye or other substance contained in the syringe is Extracellular fluid 22Na, 125I- iothalamate, thiosulfate, injected into a chamber, and the substance is allowed to inulin disperse throughout the chamber until it becomes mixed Intracellular fluid (Calculated as total body water— in equal concentrations in all areas. Then a sample of fluid extracellular fluid volume) containing the dispersed substance is removed, and the Plasma volume 125I- albumin, Evans blue dye (T- 1824) concentration is analyzed chemically, photoelectrically, or by other means. If none of the substance leaks out of Blood volume 51Cr- labeled red blood cells, or calculated as blood volume = plasma the compartment, the total mass of substance in the com- volume/(1 − hematocrit) partment (Volume B × Concentration B) will equal the Interstitial fluid Calculated as extracellular fluid total mass of the substance injected (Volume A × Con- volume − plasma volume centration A). By simple rearrangement of the equation, one can calculate the unknown volume of chamber B as follows: Measurement of Extracellular Fluid Volume. The vol- VolumeA×ConcentrationA ume of extracellular fluid can be estimated using any of VolumeB= ConcentrationB several substances that disperse in the plasma and
