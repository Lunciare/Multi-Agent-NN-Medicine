The functions of some types of Glutamic acid GAA GAG RNA, especially those that do not appear to code for pro- Glutamine CAA CAG teins, are still mysterious. The following six types of RNA Glycine GGU GGC GGA GGG play independent and different roles in protein synthesis: Histidine CAU CAC 1. Precursor messenger RNA (pre-m RNA) is a large, immature, single strand of RNA that is processed Isoleucine AUU AUC AUA in the nucleus to form mature messenger RNA Leucine CUU CUC CUA CUG UUA UUG (mRNA). The pre-R NA includes two different types Lysine AAA AAG of segments, called introns, which are removed by Methionine AUG a process called splicing, and exons, which are re- Phenylalanine UUU UUC tained in the final mRNA.
