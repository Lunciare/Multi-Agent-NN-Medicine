Pressure Gradient for Venous Return Is Zero There Is No Venous Return. When the right atrial pres- sure rises to equal the Psf, there is no longer any pres- 10 1/ 2 r sure difference between the peripheral vessels and right esist atrium. Consequently, there can no longer be any blood a nc fl H lyo ow lw o wef vr eo e rr m , t hw ap h ne e r n ti hp t eh h e e Pr sra fil ,g hv be t l os as ote r dl is a fll b opa wrc e k s t s out o r t het efh ae hll esr a i p rg r th ot ig n ra cet rsr esi au iv sm ee s-. 5 2 (cid:31)N ro er sm isa tl a r ne cs eis tance e Psf = 7 proportionately, as can be seen by studying any of the ve- nous return curves in Figure 20- 12.
