Most of these values are approximate reference values used by the University of Mississippi Medical Center Clinical Laboratories; normal ranges may vary among different clinical laboratories. Average “normal” values and units of measure may also differ slightly from those cited in the Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 14th edition. F, female; M, male.
