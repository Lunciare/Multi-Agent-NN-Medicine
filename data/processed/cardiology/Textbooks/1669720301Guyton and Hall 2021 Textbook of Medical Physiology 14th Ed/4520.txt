The maximal power achievable Adenosine Triphosphate. The source of energy actually by all the muscles in the body of a highly trained athlete used to cause muscle contraction is adenosine triphosphate with all the muscles working together is approximately (ATP), which has the following basic formula: the following: Adenosine − PO 3∼PO 3∼PO 3− 1074 )thgiew ydob fo %( taf ydoB Chapter 85 Sports Physiology I.
