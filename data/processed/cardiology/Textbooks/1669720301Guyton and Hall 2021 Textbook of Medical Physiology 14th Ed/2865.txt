The holding the pained area of the body away from the painful locus of the pressure on the pad of the foot determines the object until other nervous reactions cause the entire body direction in which the limb will extend; pressure on one to move away. side causes extension in that direction, an effect called the magnet reaction. This reaction helps keep an animal from RECIPROCAL INHIBITION AND falling to that side. RECIPROCAL INNERVATION Cord “Righting” Reflexes. When a spinal animal is laid We previously pointed out that excitation of one group on its side, it will make uncoordinated movements to try of muscles is often associated with inhibition of another to raise itself to the standing position. This reflex is called group. For instance, when a stretch reflex excites one the cord righting reflex. Such a reflex demonstrates that muscle, it often simultaneously inhibits the antago- some relatively complex reflexes associated with posture nist muscles, which is the phenomenon of reciprocal are integrated in the spinal cord.
