NORMAL Right atrial pressure (mm Hg) EJECTION FRACTION Figure 22- 8 Graphic analysis of two types of conditions that can cause high-o utput cardiac failure—arteriovenous (AV) fistula and Our discussion thus far has focused mainly on cardiac beriberi heart disease. failure due to decreased contractility of the myocardium following a myocardial infarction or impaired coronary abnormalities of ventricular filling as well as impaired blood flow. However, as discussed earlier in the chapter, contractility and impaired systolic function. Most of the heart failure can occur from any condition that decreases neurohumoral changes in heart failure that have been dis- the heart’s ability to pump enough blood to meet the cussed, including activation of the sympathetic and renin- body’s needs. Heart failure associated with impaired angiotensin system, as well as excessive fluid retention by cardiac contractility is often referred to as systolic heart the kidneys, occur regardless of whether there is normal failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or reduced EF. Heart failure is a heterogeneous syndrome, (HFrEF). As discussed in Chapter 9, the ejection fraction rather than a specific disease, and occurs whenever the (EF), often assessed by echocardiography, is the fraction heart is unable to pump enough blood
