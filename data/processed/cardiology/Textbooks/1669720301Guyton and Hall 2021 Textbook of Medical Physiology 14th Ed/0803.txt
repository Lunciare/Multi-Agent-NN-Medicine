Other vasodilator sub- stances, such as carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and potas- sium ions, also tend to increase in the tissues when blood flow is reduced and cell metabolism continues at the same rate, or when cell metabolism is suddenly increased. An increase in the concentration of vasodilator metabolites Tissue cells causes vasodilation of the arterioles, thus increasing the Sidearm capillary tissue blood flow and returning the tissue concentration of the metabolites toward normal. Many physiologists believe that adenosine is an impor- tant local vasodilator for controlling local blood flow. For example, minute quantities of adenosine are released from Relaxation of heart muscle cells when coronary blood flow becomes too O delivery 2 arterioles and little, and this release of adenosine causes enough local or Tissue O 2 precapillary Tissue metabolism vasodilation in the heart to return coronary blood flow to
