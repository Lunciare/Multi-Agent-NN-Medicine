all actions of testosterone depend on this conversion. The intracellular functions are discussed later in this chapter. Secretion of Androgens Elsewhere in the Body. The Degradation and Excretion of Testosterone. The tes- term “androgen” means any steroid hormone that has tosterone that does not become fixed to the tissues is rap- masculinizing effects, including testosterone; it also in- idly converted, mainly by the liver, into androsterone and cludes male sex hormones produced elsewhere in the body dehydroepiandrosterone and simultaneously conjugated as besides the testes. For example, the adrenal glands secrete either glucuronides or sulfates (glucuronides, particularly). at least five androgens, although the total masculinizing These substances are excreted either into the gut by way of activity of all these androgens is normally so slight (<5% the liver bile or into the urine through the kidneys. Production of Estrogen in the Male. In addition to tes- tosterone, small amounts of estrogens are formed in the male (about one fifth the amount in the nonpregnant fe- male), and a reasonable quantity of estrogens can be recov- Interstitial cells of Leydig OH CH Blood vessel 3 OH CH 3 CH 3 Fibroblasts CH 3 O Testosterone Germinal O epithelium H H Dihydrotestosterone Figure
