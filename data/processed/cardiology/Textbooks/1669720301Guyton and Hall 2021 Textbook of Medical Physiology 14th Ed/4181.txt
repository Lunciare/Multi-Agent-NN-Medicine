The mechanism of this of exchangeable calcium that is always in equilibrium with resorption is believed to be the following: The osteoclasts calcium ions in the extracellular fluids. send out villus- like projections toward the bone, form- A small portion of this exchangeable calcium is also ing a ruffled border adjacent to the bone (Figure 80- 6). the calcium found in all tissue
