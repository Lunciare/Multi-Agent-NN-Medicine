Hydrogen peroxide is a elongated and are as large as 1 micrometer in diameter 2 2 highly oxidizing substance and is used in association with and 7 micrometers long. Still others are branching and catalase, another oxidase enzyme present in large quan- filamentous. tities in peroxisomes, to oxidize many substances that The basic structure of the mitochondrion, shown might otherwise be poisonous to the cell. For example, in Figure 2-7, is composed mainly of two lipid bilayer- about half the alcohol that a person drinks is detoxified protein membranes, an outer membrane and an inner into acetaldehyde by the peroxisomes of the liver cells in membrane. Many infoldings of the inner membrane form this manner. A major function of peroxisomes is to catab- shelves or tubules called cristae onto which oxidative olize long- chain fatty acids. enzymes are attached. The cristae provide a large surface area for chemical reactions to occur. In addition, the inner Secretory Vesicles cavity of the mitochondrion is filled with a matrix that One of the important functions of many cells is secretion contains large quantities of dissolved enzymes necessary of special chemical substances.
