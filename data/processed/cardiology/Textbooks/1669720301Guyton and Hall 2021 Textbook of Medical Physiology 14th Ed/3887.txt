As little as billionths or even trillionths of a for accurate, high- throughput measurements of hormones. gram of hormone can often be assayed in this way. Radioimmunoassay Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay The method of performing radioimmunoassay is as follows. Enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) can be First, an antibody that is highly specific for the hormone to used to measure almost any protein, including hormones. be measured is produced. This test combines the specificity of antibodies with the Second, a small quantity of this antibody is (1) mixed sensitivity of simple enzyme assays.
