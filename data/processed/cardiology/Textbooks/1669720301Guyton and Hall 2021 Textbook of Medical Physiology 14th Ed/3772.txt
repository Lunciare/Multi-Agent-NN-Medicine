the body, and the metabolic rate body in a given time. is normally expressed in terms of the rate of heat liberation In determining the metabolic rate by direct calorimetry, during chemical reactions. one measures the quantity of heat liberated from the body Heat Is the End Product of Almost All the Energy Re- in a large, specially constructed calorimeter. The subject is leased in the Body. In discussing many of the metabolic placed in an air chamber that is so well insulated that no heat reactions in the preceding chapters, we noted that not all can leak through the walls of the chamber. Heat formed by the energy in foods is transferred to ATP; instead, a large the subject’s body warms the air of the chamber. However, portion of this energy becomes heat. On average, 35% of the air temperature within the chamber is maintained at a 896 noitcaer fo etaR noitartnecnoc emyznE Chapter 73 Energetics and Metabolic Rate constant level by forcing the air through pipes in a cool wa- 3000 ter bath.
