extruded. some prevents the enclosed hydrolytic enzymes from The Golgi apparatus functions in association with the coming into contact with other substances in the cell and endoplasmic reticulum. As shown in Figure 2-5, small therefore prevents their digestive actions. However, some transport vesicles (also called endoplasmic reticulum conditions of the cell break the membranes of lysosomes, vesicles [ER vesicles]) continually pinch off from the endo- allowing release of the digestive enzymes. These enzymes plasmic reticulum and shortly thereafter fuse with the then split the organic substances with which they come Golgi apparatus. In this way, substances entrapped in ER in contact into small, highly diffusible substances such as 17 UNIT I UNIT I Introduction to Physiology: The Cell and General Physiology Secretory Outer membrane granules Inner membrane Cristae Matrix Oxidative phosphorylation Outer chamber enzymes Figure 2-6.
