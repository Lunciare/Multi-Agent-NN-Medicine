bicarbonate, and diarrhea results in the loss of collecting tubules and, at the same time, stimulates secre- HCO − from the body, which has the same effect as los- 3 tion of H+ and HCO − reabsorption by the intercalated cells 3 ing large amounts of bicarbonate in the urine. This form of the collecting tubules. This increased secretion of H+ and of metabolic acidosis can be serious and can cause death, HCO − reabsorption leads to metabolic alkalosis. 3 especially in young children. Vomiting of Gastric Contents. Vomiting of the gastric Vomiting of Intestinal Contents. Vomiting of gastric contents alone, without vomiting of the lower gastrointesti- contents alone would cause a loss of acid and a tendency nal contents, causes loss of the HCl secreted by the stomach toward alkalosis because the stomach secretions are highly mucosa. The net result is loss of acid from the extracellu- acidic. However, vomiting large amounts from deeper in lar fluid and development of metabolic alkalosis. This type the gastrointestinal tract causes loss of bicarbonate and re- of alkalosis occurs especially in neonates who have pyloric sults in metabolic acidosis in the same way that diarrhea stenosis caused by hypertrophied pyloric sphincter muscles.
