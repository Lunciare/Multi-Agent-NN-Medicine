a few weeks. Diabetes Mellitus Causes Increased Utilization of Fats Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes. Effective treatment of and Metabolic Acidosis. The shift from carbohydrate to fat type 1 diabetes mellitus requires administration of enough metabolism in diabetes increases the release of keto acids, insulin so that the patient will have carbohydrate, fat, and such as acetoacetic acid and β- hydroxybutyric acid, into protein metabolism that is as normal as possible. Insulin is the plasma more rapidly than they can be taken up and available in several forms. “Regular” insulin has a duration oxidized by the tissue cells. As a result, metabolic acidosis of action that lasts from 3 to 8 hours, whereas other forms develops from the excess keto acids, which, in association of insulin (precipitated with zinc or with various protein with dehydration, can cause severe acidosis. This scenario derivatives) are absorbed slowly from the injection site and leads rapidly to diabetic coma and death unless the patient therefore have effects that last as long as 10 to 48 hours. Or- is treated immediately with large amounts of insulin. dinarily, a patient with severe type 1 diabetes is given a sin- All the usual physiological compensations that occur
