muscle begins R to repolarize in some fibers about 0.20 second after the P T beginning of the depolarization wave (the QRS complex), Q but in many other fibers, it takes as long as 0.35 second. S Thus, the process of ventricular repolarization extends over a long period, about 0.15 second. For this reason, the T wave in the normal ECG is a prolonged wave, but the Figure 11- 3.
