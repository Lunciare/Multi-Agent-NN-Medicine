Simultaneously the muscle fibers use the last however, collateral flow begins to increase, doubling bits of the oxygen in the blood, causing the hemoglobin by the second or third day and often reaching normal to become totally deoxygenated. Therefore, the infarcted or almost normal coronary flow within about 1 month. area takes on a bluish- brown hue, and the blood vessels of Because of these developing collateral channels, many the area appear to be engorged, despite lack of blood flow. patients recover almost completely from various degrees In later stages, the vessel walls become highly permeable 265 UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation and leak fluid, the local muscle tissue becomes edema- tous, and the cardiac muscle cells begin to swell because of diminished cellular metabolism. Within a few hours of almost no blood supply, the cardiac muscle cells die. Cardiac muscle requires about 1.3 ml of oxygen/100 g of muscle tissue/min just to remain alive. In compari- son, about 8 ml oxygen/100 g are delivered to the normal resting left ventricle each minute. Therefore, if there is even 15% to 30% of normal resting coronary
