Altering Pressure shift of pressure natriuresis provides the basis for the Natriuresis. The importance of Ang II in regulating chronic blood pressure–lowering effects of the ACE sodium balance and making the pressure natriuresis inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in hyperten- mechanism more effective is shown in Figure 19-1 3 sive patients. 397 tuptuo dna ekatni muidoS )lamron ×( UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys Excessive Angiotensin II Does Not Usually Cause During Chronic Oversecretion of Aldosterone, the Large Increases in Extracellular Fluid Volume Because Kidneys Escape From Sodium Retention as Arterial Pres- Increased Arterial Pressure Counterbalances Angioten- sure Rises. Although aldosterone has powerful effects on sin II– Mediated Sodium Retention.
