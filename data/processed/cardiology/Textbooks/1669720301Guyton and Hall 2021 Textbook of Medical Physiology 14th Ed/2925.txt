These System in the Maintenance of Equilibrium. Because other functions of the cerebellum are discussed in Chap- the semicircular ducts do not detect that the body is off ter 57. balance in the forward direction, in the side direction, or in the backward direction, one might ask, “What is the Vestibular Mechanisms for Stabilizing the Eyes function of the semicircular ducts in the maintenance When a person changes direction of movement rapidly of equilibrium?” All they detect is that the person’s or even leans the head sideways, forward, or backward, it head is beginning or stopping to rotate in one direction would be impossible to maintain a stable image on the reti- or another. Therefore, the function of the semicircular nas unless the person had some automatic control mecha- ducts is not to maintain static equilibrium or to main- nism to stabilize the direction of the eyes’ gaze. In addition, tain equilibrium during steady directional or rotational the eyes would be of little use in
