system, and thus these patients are highly susceptible to infections. Even the protein collagen fibers in the subcutaneous tissue are diminished so that the subcutaneous tissues tear easily, resulting in development of large purplish striae where they have torn apart. In addition, se- verely diminished protein deposition in the bones often causes severe osteoporosis with consequent weakness of the bones. Treatment of People With Cushing’s Syndrome. Treat- ment of people with Cushing’s syndrome consists of remov- ing an adrenal tumor if this is the cause or decreasing the se- cretion of ACTH, if possible. Hypertrophied pituitary glands or even small tumors in the pituitary that oversecrete ACTH can sometimes be surgically removed or destroyed by radia- tion. Drugs that block steroidogenesis, such as metyrapone, ketoconazole, and aminoglutethimide, or that inhibit ACTH secretion, such as serotonin antagonists and GABA- transaminase inhibitors, can also be used when surgery is not feasible. If ACTH secretion cannot easily be decreased, the only satisfactory treatment is usually bilateral partial (or even total) adrenalectomy, followed by administration of adrenal steroids to make up for any insufficiency that develops.
