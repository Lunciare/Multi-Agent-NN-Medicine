The most important antigens for so high that the hemoglobin precipitates and blocks causing graft rejection are a complex called human many of the kidney tubules. Thus, renal vasoconstric- leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. Six of these antigens tion, circulatory shock, and renal tubular blockage are present on the tissue cell membranes of each per- together cause acute renal shutdown. If the shutdown son, but there are about 150 different HLA antigens to is complete and fails to resolve, the patient dies within choose from, representing more than 1 trillion possible 7 to 12 days, as explained in Chapter 32, unless treated combinations. Consequently, it is virtually impossible with an artificial kidney. for two persons, except in the case of identical twins, to have the same six HLA antigens. Development of significant immunity against any of these antigens can TRANSPLANTATION OF TISSUES AND cause graft rejection.

Therefore, tissue typing for Most of the different antigens of RBCs that cause trans- these antigens is done on the membranes of lympho- fusion reactions are also widely present in other cells of cytes that have been separated
