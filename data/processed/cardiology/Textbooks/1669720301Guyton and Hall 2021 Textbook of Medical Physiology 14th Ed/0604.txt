As a result, nonspecific changes, such as T- wave in- at the apex, as it normally does. Instead, the base of the ven- version or biphasic T waves, may occur in one or more of tricles would repolarize ahead of the apex, and the vector of the electrocardiographic leads. A biphasic T wave caused repolarization would point from the apex toward the base by excessive administration of digitalis is shown in Figure of the heart, opposite to the standard vector of repolariza- 12-24. Therefore, changes in the T wave during digitalis tion. Consequently, the T wave in all three standard leads administration are often the earliest signs of digitalis tox- would be negative rather than the usual positive. Thus, icity. the simple fact that the base of the ventricles has a short- ened period of depolarization is sufficient to cause marked Bibliography changes in the T wave, even to the extent of changing the entire T- wave polarity, as shown in Figure 12-23.
