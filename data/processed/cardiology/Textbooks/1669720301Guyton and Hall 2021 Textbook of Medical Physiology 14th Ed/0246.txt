into the cell, and a negative V pre- dipole layer), the potential decreases abruptly to −70 mil- df dicts ion movement out of the cell. When V = V , there livolts. Moving across the center of the fiber, the potential m eq is no net movement of the ion into or out of the cell. Also, remains at a steady −70- millivolt level but reverses back the direction of ion flux through the membrane reverses as to zero the instant it passes through the membrane on the V m becomes greater than or less than V eq; hence, the equi- opposite side of the fiber. librium potential (V ) is also called the reversal potential. eq To create a negative potential inside the membrane, only enough positive ions to develop the electrical dipole layer at the membrane itself must be trans- Measuring the Membrane Potential ported outward. The remaining ions inside the nerve The method for measuring the membrane potential is fiber can be both positive and negative, as shown in simple in theory but often difficult in practice because of the upper panel of Figure 5-3 . Therefore, transfer of the small size of most of the cells
