muscle blood flow can increase from as min; and (2) increased strength of contraction of the heart little as 1 L/min for the whole body during rest to more to as much as twice normal. Without this increased level than 20 L/min during maximal activity. Therefore, it is of cardiac function, the increase in cardiac output would clear that muscle blood flow can increase much more than be limited to the plateau level of the normal heart, which that which occurs in this simple laboratory experiment. would be a maximum increase of cardiac output of only What is the difference? Mainly, the arterial pressure rises about 2.5- fold rather than the 4-fold increase that can during normal exercise. Let us assume, for example, that commonly be achieved by the untrained runner and the the arterial pressure rises by 30% during heavy exercise. 7-fold increase that can be achieved in some marathon This 30% increase causes 30% more force to push blood runners. through the muscle tissue vessels. However, this is not the Now study the venous return curves. If no change only important effect—the extra pressure also stretches occurred from the normal venous return curve, the car- the walls of
