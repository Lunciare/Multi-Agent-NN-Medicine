after another. Thus, the nerve impulse jumps large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmy- along the fiber, which is the origin of the term saltatory. elinated. The average nerve trunk contains about twice as Saltatory conduction is of value for two reasons: many unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers. 1. First, by causing the depolarization process to jump Figure 5- 16 illustrates schematically the features of a long intervals along the axis of the nerve fiber, this typical myelinated fiber. The central core of the fiber is the mechanism increases the velocity of nerve transmis- axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that sion in myelinated fibers as much as 5- to 50-f old. actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millime- ters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner. The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon.
