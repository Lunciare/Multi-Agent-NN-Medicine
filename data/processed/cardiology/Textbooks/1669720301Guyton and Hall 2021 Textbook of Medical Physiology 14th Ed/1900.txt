ANTIBODIES REACT AGAINST SPECIFIC ANTIGENS—ROLE OF LYMPHOCYTE Thymus Gland Preprocesses T Lymphocytes. The T CLONES lymphocytes, after origination in the bone marrow, first mi- grate to the thymus gland. Here they divide rapidly and, at When specific antigens come into contact with T and B the same time, develop extreme diversity for reacting against lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue, some of the T lym- different specific antigens. That is, one thymic lymphocyte phocytes become activated to form activated T cells, and develops specific reactivity against one antigen, and then some of the B lymphocytes become activated to form the next lymphocyte develops specificity against another antibodies. The activated T cells and antibodies, in turn, antigen. This process continues until there are thousands react highly specifically against the particular types of of different types of thymic lymphocytes with specific reac- antigens that initiated their development. The mechanism tivities against many thousands of different antigens. These of this specificity is described next. different types of preprocessed T lymphocytes now leave Millions of Specific Types of Lymphocytes Are Stored the thymus
