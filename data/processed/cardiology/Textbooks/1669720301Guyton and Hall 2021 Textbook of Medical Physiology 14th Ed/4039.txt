Thus, it is possible that many of the effects of cortisol on the metabolic systems EFFECTS OF CORTISOL ON PROTEIN of the body result mainly from this ability of cortisol to METABOLISM mobilize amino acids from the peripheral tissues while at the same time increasing the liver enzymes required for Reduction in Cellular Protein. One of the principal ef- the hepatic effects. fects of cortisol on the metabolic systems of the body is reduction of protein stores in essentially all cells of the EFFECTS OF CORTISOL ON FAT body, except those of the liver. This reduction is caused by METABOLISM both decreased protein synthesis and increased catabo- lism of protein already in the cells. Both these effects may Mobilization of Fatty Acids.
