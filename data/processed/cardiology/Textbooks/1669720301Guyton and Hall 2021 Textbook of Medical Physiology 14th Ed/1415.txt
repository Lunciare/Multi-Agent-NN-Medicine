tubular epithe- Another waste product of metabolism, creatinine, is an lial cell, negative ions such as chloride are transported even larger molecule than urea and is essentially imper- along with sodium because of electrical potentials. That meant to the tubular membrane. Therefore, almost none is, transport of positively charged sodium ions out of the of the creatinine that is filtered is reabsorbed, so virtually lumen leaves the inside of the lumen negatively charged, all the creatinine filtered by the glomerulus is excreted in compared with the interstitial fluid causing chloride ions the urine. 348 Chapter 28 Renal Tubular Reabsorption and Secretion 65% The extensive membrane surface of the epithelial brush border is also loaded with protein carrier molecules that Proximal tubule transport a large fraction of the sodium ions across the luminal membrane linked via the co- transport mecha- nism with multiple organic nutrients such as amino acids Na+, Cl–, HCO –, K+, 3 and glucose.
