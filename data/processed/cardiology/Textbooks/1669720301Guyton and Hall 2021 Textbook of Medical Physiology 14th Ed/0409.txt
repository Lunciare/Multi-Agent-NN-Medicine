The prin- one of the simplest is the following. cipal reason for the difference is that the smooth muscle 105 UNIT II UNIT II Membrane Physiology, Nerve, and Muscle Visceral most of the fine terminal axons have multiple varicosi- Autonomic neuron ties distributed along their axes. At these points, the varicosity Schwann cells that envelop the axons are interrupted so Neurotransmitter that transmitter substance can be secreted through the Receptor walls of the varicosities. In the varicosities are vesicles similar to those in the skeletal muscle end plate that con- Gap junction tain transmitter substance. However, in contrast to the vesicles of skeletal muscle junctions, which always con- tain acetylcholine, the vesicles of the autonomic nerve Multi-unit fiber endings contain acetylcholine in some fibers and norepinephrine in others and occasionally other sub- stances as well. In a few cases, particularly in the multi- unit type of smooth muscle, the varicosities are separated from the muscle cell membrane by as little as 20 to 30 nanome- ters—the same width
