THAT OCCUR AT SUCCESSIVE INTERVALS DURING DEPOLARIZATION OF THE VENTRICLES—THE QRS COMPLEX Figure 12-5 Determination of the projected vector B along the axis When the cardiac impulse enters the ventricles through of lead I when vector A represents the instantaneous potential in the the atrioventricular bundle, the first part of the ventricles ventricles. to become depolarized is the left endocardial surface of the septum. Then, depolarization spreads rapidly to involve both endocardial surfaces of the septum, as shown by the – II III – darker shaded portion of the ventricle in Figure 12-7A. Next, depolarization spreads along the endocardial sur- faces of the remainder of the two ventricles, as shown in Figure 12-7B and C. Finally, it spreads through the ven- tricular muscle to the outside of the heart, as shown pro- I B I gressively in Figure 12-7C to E. – + At each stage in Figure 12-7, A to E, the instantaneous D A mean electrical potential of the ventricles is represented by a red vector superimposed on the ventricle in each fig- C ure. Each of these vectors is then analyzed by the method described in the preceding section to determine the volt- ages that will be
