By applying these princi- ples, one can determine from the ECG in Figure 13-11 onto the QRS- T complex because the cardiac impulse the point of origin of the PVC, as follows. Note that the traveled backward into the atria at the same time that it potentials of the premature contractions in leads II and III traveled forward into the ventricles.
