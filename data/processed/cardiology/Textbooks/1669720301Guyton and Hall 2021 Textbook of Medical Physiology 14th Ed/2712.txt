that lines are 135 60 45 detected—by means of color contrast. For example, a red 50 area is often contrasted against a green area, a blue area 150 40 30 against a red area, or a green area against a yellow area. 30 All these colors can also be contrasted against a white area 165 20 15 10 within the visual scene. In fact, this contrasting against white is believed to be mainly responsible for the phenom- 180 80706050403020 1020304050607080 0 enon called “color constancy”—that is, when the color Optic 10 of an illuminating light changes, the color of the “white” disc 195 20 345 changes with the light, and appropriate computation in the 30 brain allows red to be interpreted as red, even though the 40 330 210 illuminating light has changed the color entering the eyes. 50 The mechanism of color contrast analysis depends on 225 60 315 70 the fact that contrasting colors, called “opponent colors,” 240 80 300 excite specific neuronal cells. It is presumed that the ini- 255 270 285 tial details of color contrast are detected by simple cells, Figure 52- 6. Perimetry chart showing the field of vision for the left whereas more
