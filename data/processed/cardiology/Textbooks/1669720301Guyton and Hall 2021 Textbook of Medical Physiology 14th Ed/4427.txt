First, the renal tubules’ reabsorptive capacity for so- dium, chloride, and water is increased as much as 50% as a consequence of increased production of salt and water- retaining hormones, especially steroid hormones by the placenta and adrenal cortex. Second, the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate increase up to 50% during normal pregnancy as a result Fetal blood vessels of renal vasodilation. Although the mechanisms that cause Figure 83- 9. Remodeling of the spiral arteries of the uterine endo- renal vasodilation in pregnancy are still unclear, some stud- metrium during normal pregnancy and failure of the spiral arteries ies suggest that increased levels of nitric oxide or the ovar- to remodel adequately in preeclampsia. In normal pregnancy, the ian hormone relaxin may contribute to these changes. The trophoblasts migrate into the maternal uterine spiral arteries and increased glomerular filtration rate likely occurs, at least in transform them into much larger, low- resistance, high- flow vessels. part, as a compensation for increased tubular reabsorption In preeclampsia, the trophoblasts fail to invade the endothelium of of salt and water. Thus, the normal pregnant woman
