FOR MOTOR FUNCTIONS Anterior motor neurons The cord gray matter is the integrative area for the cord reflexes. Figure 55- 1 shows the typical organization of the cord gray matter in a single cord segment. Sensory signals enter the cord almost entirely through the sensory roots, also known as the posterior or dorsal roots. After entering the cord, every sensory signal travels to two separate destinations: one branch of the sensory nerve Motor root terminates almost immediately in the gray matter of the Figure 55- 1. Connections of peripheral sensory fibers and corti- cord and elicits local segmental cord reflexes and other cospinal fibers with the interneurons and anterior motor neurons of local effects; another branch transmits signals to higher the spinal cord. 685 UNIT XI UNIT XI The Nervous System: C. Motor and Integrative Neurophysiology Dorsal root ganglion spinal cord that are discussed in the remainder of this Posterior horn chapter. Essentially all the different types of neuronal circuits described in Chapter 47 are found in the interneuron pool Descending of cells of the spinal cord, including diverging, converging, Intermediate zone fibers repetitive- discharge, and other types of circuits. In this chapter, we examine many applications of these different
