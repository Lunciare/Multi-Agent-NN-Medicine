8. Effect of changes in the internal head temperature on the rate of evaporative heat loss from the body (in °C). Note that the body core temperature of about 37.1°C (98.8°F), drastic skin temperature determines the set point level at which sweating changes occur in the rates of both heat loss and heat pro- begins. (Courtesy Dr. T.H. Benzinger.) duction. At temperatures above this level, the rate of heat loss is greater than that of heat production, so the body temperature falls and approaches the 37.1°C level. At tem- heat temperature receptors in the anterior hypothalamic- peratures below this level, the rate of heat production is preoptic area. However, temperature signals from the greater than that of heat loss, so the body temperature peripheral areas of the body, especially from the skin and rises and again approaches the 37.1°C level. This crucial certain deep body tissues (e.g., spinal cord and abdomi- temperature level is called the “set point” of the tempera- nal viscera), also contribute slightly to body temperature ture control mechanism—that is, all the temperature con- regulation by altering the set point of the hypothalamic trol mechanisms continually attempt to bring the body temperature control center. This effect is
