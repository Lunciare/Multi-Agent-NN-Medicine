Myosin, one of in each bond, when liberated by decomposition of ATP, is the important contractile proteins of the muscle fiber, acts enough to cause almost any step of any chemical reaction as an enzyme to cause breakdown of ATP into adenosine in the body to take place if appropriate energy transfer is diphosphate (ADP), thus releasing the energy required to achieved.
