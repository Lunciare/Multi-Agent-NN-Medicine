The curve recorded in EXPIRATORY FLOW this section shows the maximum expiratory flow at all levels of lung volume after a healthy person first inhales In many respiratory diseases, particularly in asthma, the as much air as possible and then expires with maximum resistance to airflow becomes especially great during expiratory effort until he or she can expire at no greater expiration, sometimes causing tremendous difficulty in rate. Note that the person quickly reaches a maximum breathing. This condition has led to the concept called expiratory airflow of more than 400 L/min. However, maximum expiratory flow, which can be defined as fol- regardless of how much additional expiratory effort the lows.
