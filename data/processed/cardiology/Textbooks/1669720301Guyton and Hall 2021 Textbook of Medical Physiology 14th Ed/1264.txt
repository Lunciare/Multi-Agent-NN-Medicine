This calculation yields a The first step is to calculate the initial conditions, concentration of 313.9 mOsm/L. Therefore, all the body including the volume, concentration, and total millios- fluid compartments will have this same concentration moles in each compartment. Assuming that extracellular after osmotic equilibrium. Assuming that no solute or fluid volume is 20% of body weight, and intracellular fluid water has been lost from the body, and that there is no volume is 40% of body weight, the following volumes and movement of sodium chloride into or out of the cells, we concentrations can be calculated. then calculate the volumes of the intracellular and extra- Step 1.

The intracellular fluid volume is calculated by dividing the total milliosmoles in the intra- Volume Concentration Total cellular fluid (7840) by the concentration (313.9 mOsm/L) (liters) (mOsm/L) (mOsm) to yield a volume of 24.98 liters.
