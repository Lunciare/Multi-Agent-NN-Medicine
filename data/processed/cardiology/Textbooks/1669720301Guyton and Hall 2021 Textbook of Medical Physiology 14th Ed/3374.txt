junctions between epithelia cells, as described later. If this barrier is damaged by toxic substances, such Na+ Na+ Na+ (3 mEq/L) as occurs with excessive use of aspirin or alcohol, the secreted acid does leak down an electrochemical gradient Cl– Cl– Cl– Cl– (173 mEq/L) into the mucosa, causing stomach mucosal damage.

In comparison, osmosis.) both gastrin and histamine strongly stimulate acid secre- tion by parietal cells but have little effect on the other cells.
