Secretion of LH by the anterior pituitary gland is also Then it is most often converted, under the influence of cyclical, with LH following fairly faithfully the pulsatile the intracellular enzyme 5α- reductase, to dihydrotestos- release of GnRH. In contrast, FSH secretion increases terone which binds with a cytoplasmic “receptor protein.” and decreases only slightly with each fluctuation of This combination migrates to the cell nucleus where GnRH secretion; instead, it changes more slowly over a it binds with a nuclear protein and induces DNA-R NA period of many hours in response to longer- term changes transcription. Within 30 minutes, RNA polymerase has in GnRH. Because of the much closer relation between become activated, and the concentration of RNA begins GnRH secretion and LH secretion, GnRH is also widely to increase in the prostatic cells, which is followed by a known as LH- releasing hormone. progressive increase in cellular protein.
