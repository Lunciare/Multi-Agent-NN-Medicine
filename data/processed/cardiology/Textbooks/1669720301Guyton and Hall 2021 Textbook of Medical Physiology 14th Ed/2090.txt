apical capillaries during cardiac systole. ZONE 3 Conversely, during diastole, the 8 mm Hg diastolic pres- sure at the level of the heart is not sufficient to push Artery PALV Vein the blood up the 15 mm Hg hydrostatic pressure gradi- ent required to cause diastolic capillary flow. Therefore, blood flow through the apical part of the lung is inter- Ppc mittent, with flow during systole but cessation of flow during diastole; this is called zone 2 blood flow. Zone 2 Figure 39- 5. Mechanics of blood flow in the three blood flow zones blood flow begins in normal lungs about 10 cm above of the lung: zone 1, no flow—alveolar air pressure (PALV) is greater the midlevel of the heart and extends from there to the than arterial pressure; zone 2, intermittent flow—systolic arterial top of the lungs. pressure rises higher than alveolar air pressure, but diastolic arterial In the lower regions of the lungs, from about 10 cm pressure falls below alveolar air pressure; and zone 3, continuous flow—arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc) remain above the level of the heart all the way to the bottom of greater than alveolar air pressure at all times. the
