ini- tially when the concentration gradient is greatest (when dialysis is begun) and slows down as the concentration gradient is dissipated. In a flowing system, as is the case with hemodialysis, in which blood and dialysate fluid flow Fresh dialyzing Constant Used dialyzing through the artificial kidney, the dissipation of the concen- solution temperature solution tration gradient can be reduced, and diffusion of solute bath across the membrane can be optimized, by increasing the Figure 32- 8. Principles of dialysis with an artificial kidney. flow rate of the blood, dialyzing fluid, or both. In normal operation of the artificial kidney, blood flows The effectiveness of the artificial kidney can be ex- continually or intermittently back into the vein. The total pressed in terms of the amount of plasma that is cleared amount of blood in the artificial kidney at any one time is of different substances each minute, which, as discussed in usually less than 500 milliliters, the rate of flow may be sev- Chapter 28, is the primary means for expressing the func- eral hundred milliliters per minute, and the total diffusion tional effectiveness of the kidneys themselves to rid the surface area is between 0.6 and 2.5 m2.
