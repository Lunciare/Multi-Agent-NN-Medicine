trans- porting fatty acids into the mitochondria becomes increas- Blood glucose ingly activated. In the mitochondria, beta oxidation of the fatty acids then proceeds rapidly, releasing extreme amounts of acetyl-C oA. A large part of this excess acetyl-C oA is then condensed to form acetoacetic acid, which is then released Free fatty acids into the circulating blood. Most of this acetoacetic acid passes to the peripheral cells, where it is again converted into acetyl-C oA and used for energy in the usual manner. At the same time, the absence of insulin also depresses utilization of acetoacetic acid in peripheral tissues. Thus, so much acetoacetic acid is released from the liver that Acetoacetic acid it cannot all be metabolized by the tissues.
