For example, sodium pentobarbital depresses the respiratory center considerably more than many other anesthetics, such Depth of as halothane. At one time, morphine was used as an anes- respiration thetic, but this drug is now used only as an adjunct to an- esthetics because it greatly depresses the respiratory center while having less ability to anesthetize the cerebral cortex.
