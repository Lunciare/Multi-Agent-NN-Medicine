of inspiration is about −5 centimeters of Transpulmonary pressure water (cm H O), which is the amount of suction required –4 2 to hold the lungs open to their resting level. During nor- –6 mal inspiration, expansion of the chest cage pulls outward on the lungs with greater force and creates more negative Pleural pressure –8 pressure to an average of about −7.5 cm H O. 2 These relationships between pleural pressure and Inspiration Expiration changing lung volume are demonstrated in Figure 38- 2; in the lower panel shows the increasing negativity of the Figure 38- 2 Changes in lung volume, alveolar pressure, pleural pres- pleural pressure from −5 to −7.5 cm H O during inspira- sure, and transpulmonary pressure during normal breathing. 2 tion and in the upper panel an increase in lung volume of 0.5 liter.
