Because the bulboreticular facilitatory area is particu- ROLE OF THE MUSCLE SPINDLE IN larly concerned with antigravity contractions, and because VOLUNTARY MOTOR ACTIVITY the antigravity muscles have an especially high density of muscle spindles, the gamma efferent mechanism is To understand the importance of the gamma efferent believed to be important for damping the movements of system, one should recognize that 31% of all the motor the different body parts during walking and running. nerve fibers to the muscle are the small type A gamma efferent fibers rather than large type A alpha motor fibers.
