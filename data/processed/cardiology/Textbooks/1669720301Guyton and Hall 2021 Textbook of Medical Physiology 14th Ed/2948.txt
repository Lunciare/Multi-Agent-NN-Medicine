its three layers. Deep Cerebellar Nuclei and the Efferent Pathways. Lo- cated deep in the cerebellar mass on each side are three deep cerebellar nuclei—the dentate, interposed, and fas- portion of the brain stem. This complex circuit mainly tigial. (The vestibular nuclei in the medulla also function helps coordinate the reciprocal contractions of agonist in some respects as if they were deep cerebellar nuclei and antagonist muscles in the peripheral portions of the because of their direct connections with the cortex of the limbs, especially in the hands, fingers, and thumbs. flocculonodular lobe.)

This pathway plays an important role in the cerebellar deep nuclei and (2) to a corresponding area helping coordinate sequential motor
