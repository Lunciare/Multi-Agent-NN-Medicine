use a sphygmoma- nometer cuff, like the auscultatory method, but with an 80 C electronic pressure sensor to detect cuff pressure oscil- lations that occur when blood flows through an artery, D 60 often the brachial artery. Oscillometric arterial pressure devices use specific electronic algorithms to inflate and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 deflate the cuff automatically and interpret the cuff pres- Time (sec) sure oscillations. When the cuff is inflated, and its pres- sure exceeds systolic pressure, there is no blood flow in the artery and no oscillation of the cuff pressure. As the A B C D cuff is slowly deflated, blood begins to spurt through the Sounds artery, and the cuff pressure then oscillates in synchrony with the cyclic expansion and contraction of the artery. As the cuff pressure declines, the oscillations increase in amplitude to a maximum, which corresponds to the mean arterial pressure. The oscillation amplitude then declines as the cuff pressure falls below the patient’s diastolic pres- sure and blood flows smoothly through the artery. Using device- specific algorithms, the cuff pressure oscillations are automatically converted into digital systolic and dias- tolic pressures signals, as well as heart rate, and displayed.
