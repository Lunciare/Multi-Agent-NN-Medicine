gravity to a height of 10 centimeters. One millimeter of mercury pressure equals 1.36 centimeters of water pressure because the specific gravity of mercury is 13.6 times that of water, and 1 centimeter is 10 times as great as 1 millimeter. High-F idelity Methods for Measuring Blood Pres- sure. The mercury in a manometer has so much inertia that it cannot rise and fall rapidly. For this reason, the mercury manometer, although excellent for recording steady pres- sures, cannot respond to pressure changes that occur more rapidly than about one cycle every 2 to 3 seconds. When- ever it is desired to record rapidly changing pressures, some other type of pressure recorder is necessary. Figure 14-7 demonstrates the basic principles of three electronic pressure C transducers commonly used for converting blood pressure and/ Figure 14-7.
