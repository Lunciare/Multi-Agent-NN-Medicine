Cessation of oxygen for only a few seconds different neurons respond differently, have different can cause complete inexcitability of some neurons. This thresholds for excitation, and have widely differing effect is observed when the brain’s blood flow is tempo- maximum frequencies of discharge.

Many drugs functions of the nervous system. are known to increase the excitability of neurons, and 584 dnoces rep egrahcsid fo ycneuqerF Chapter 46 Organization of the Nervous System, Basic Functions of Synapses, and Neurotransmitters others are known to decrease excitability. For example, urement of delay time, one can then estimate the number caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, which are found of series neurons in the circuit. in coffee, tea, and cocoa, respectively, all increase neu- ronal excitability, presumably by reducing the threshold Bibliography for excitation of neurons.
