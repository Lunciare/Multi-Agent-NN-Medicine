increased only about threefold to 6.8. Under normal conditions, the urine is slightly acidic, fourfold and the tubular fluid pH can be reduced to only and the urine pH is near the pK of the phosphate buf- about 6.7, although large amounts of H+ are secreted by fer system. Therefore, in the tubules, the phosphate buf- this nephron segment. However, H+ concentration can be fer system normally functions near its most effective pH increased as much as 900-f old in the collecting tubules. range. This mechanism decreases the pH of the tubular fluid Figure 31- 7 shows the sequence of events whereby H+ to about 4.5, which is the lower limit of pH that can be is excreted in combination with phosphate buffer and the achieved in normal kidneys. mechanism whereby new HCO − is added to the blood. 3 The process of H+ secretion into the tubules is the same COMBINATION OF EXCESS H+ WITH as described earlier.
