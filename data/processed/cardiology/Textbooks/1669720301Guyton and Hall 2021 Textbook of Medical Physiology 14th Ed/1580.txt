In this feedback system, an increase in A second effect of aldosterone is to increase the num- plasma potassium concentration stimulates aldosterone ber of potassium channels in the luminal membrane and secretion and, therefore, increases plasma aldosterone therefore its permeability for potassium, further adding to concentration (block 1). The increase in plasma aldoste- the effectiveness of aldosterone in stimulating potassium rone then causes a marked increase in potassium excre- secretion. Therefore, aldosterone has a powerful effect to tion by the kidneys (block 2). The increased potassium increase potassium excretion, as shown in Figure 30- 4. excretion then reduces the extracellular fluid potassium concentration back toward normal (circle 3 and block 4).
