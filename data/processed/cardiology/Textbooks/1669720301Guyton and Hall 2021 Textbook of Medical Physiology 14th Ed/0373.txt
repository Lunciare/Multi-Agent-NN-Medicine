away to the interior each impulse that arrives at the neuromuscular junction of the membrane, thus forming new vesicles. Within another few seconds, acetylcholine is transported to the causes about three times as much end plate potential as interior of these vesicles, and they are then ready for a that required to stimulate the muscle fiber. Therefore, new cycle of acetylcholine release. the normal neuromuscular junction is said to have a high safety factor. However, stimulation of the nerve fiber at Drugs That Enhance or Block Transmission at the rates greater than 100 times per second for several min- Neuromuscular Junction utes may diminish the number of acetylcholine vesicles so Drugs That Stimulate the Muscle Fiber by Acetylcholine- much that impulses fail to pass into the muscle fiber. This Like Action. Several compounds, including methacholine, situation is called fatigue of the neuromuscular junction, carbachol, and nicotine, have nearly the same effect on the and it is the same effect that causes fatigue of synapses in muscle fiber as acetylcholine. The main differences be- the central nervous system when the synapses are overex- tween these drugs and acetylcholine are that the drugs are cited.
