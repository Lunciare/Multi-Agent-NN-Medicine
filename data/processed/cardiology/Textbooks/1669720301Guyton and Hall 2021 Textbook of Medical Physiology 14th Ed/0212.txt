Consequently, the factor that determines the osmotic At times, a large concentration of a substance is required pressure of a solution is the concentration of the solution in the intracellular fluid, even though the extracellular in terms of the number of particles (which is the same as fluid contains only a small concentration. This situation its molar concentration if it is a nondissociated molecule), is true, for example, for potassium ions. Conversely, it is not in terms of mass of the solute. important to keep the concentrations of other ions very low inside the cell, even though their concentrations in the Osmolality—The Osmole. To express the concentration extracellular fluid are high. This situation is especially true of a solution in terms of numbers of particles, a unit called for sodium ions. Neither of these two effects could occur by the osmole is used in place of grams. simple diffusion because simple diffusion eventually equil- One osmole is 1 gram molecular weight of osmotically ibrates concentrations on the two sides of the membrane. active solute.
