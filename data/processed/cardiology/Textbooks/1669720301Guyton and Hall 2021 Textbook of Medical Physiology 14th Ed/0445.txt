is initiated by the spontane- into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and T tubule–extra- ous generation of an action potential in the sinus node, cellular fluid space. Transport of calcium back into the as explained in Chapter 10. This node is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is achieved with the help of a superior lateral wall of the right atrium near the open- calcium–adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) pump (the ing of the superior vena cava, and the action potential sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, travels from here rapidly through both atria and then SERCA2; see Figure 9- 7). Calcium ions are also removed through the A- V bundle into the ventricles. Because of from the cell by a sodium-c alcium exchanger. The sodium this special arrangement of the conducting system from that enters the cell during this exchange is then trans- the atria into the ventricles, there is a delay of more than ported out of the cell by the sodium- potassium ATPase 0.1 second during passage of the cardiac impulse from pump. As a result, the contraction ceases until a new the atria into the ventricles. This delay allows the atria action potential comes along. to contract ahead of ventricular contraction, thereby
