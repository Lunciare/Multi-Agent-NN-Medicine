at their venous ends, fluid is reabsorbed back into the capillaries Effect of the Different Plasma Proteins on Colloid Osmotic (see Figure 16-3 ). Thus, a small amount of fluid actually Pressure. The plasma proteins are a mixture that contains al- “flows” through the tissues from the arterial ends of the bumin, globulins, and fibrinogen, with an average molecular capillaries to the venous ends. The dynamics of this flow weight of 69,000, 140,000, and 400,000, respectively. Thus, 1 are as follows. gram of globulin contains only half as many molecules as 1 gram of albumin, and 1 gram of fibrinogen contains only one Analysis of the Forces Causing Filtration at the sixth as many molecules as 1 gram of albumin. It should be Arterial End of the Capillary. The approximate average recalled from the discussion of osmotic pressure in Chapter 4 that osmotic pressure is determined by the number of mol- forces operative at the arterial end of the capillary that ecules dissolved in a fluid rather than by the mass of these mol- cause movement through the capillary membrane are ecules. The following chart gives both the relative mass con- shown as follows: centrations (g/dl) of the different types
