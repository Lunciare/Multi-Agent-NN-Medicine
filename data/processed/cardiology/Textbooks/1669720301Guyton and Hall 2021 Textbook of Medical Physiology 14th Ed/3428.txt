almost identical in its function to the α- amylase of saliva but is several times as powerful. Therefore, within 15 to 30 R CH C N CH COOH + H O 2 minutes after the chyme empties from the stomach into the duodenum and mixes with pancreatic juice, virtually O R all the carbohydrates will have become digested. In general, the carbohydrates are almost totally con- verted into maltose and/or other small glucose polymers The characteristics of each protein are determined by before passing beyond the duodenum or upper jejunum. the types of amino acids in the protein molecule and by the sequential arrangements of these amino acids. The Hydrolysis of Disaccharides and Small Glucose Poly- physical and chemical characteristics of different proteins mers Into Monosaccharides by Intestinal Epithelial important in human tissues are discussed in Chapter 70. Enzymes. The enterocytes lining the villi of the small in- testine contain four enzymes (lactase, sucrase, maltase, Digestion of Proteins in the Stomach. Pepsin, an im- and α-d extrinase), which are capable of splitting the di- portant peptic enzyme of the stomach, is most active at saccharides lactose, sucrose, and maltose, plus other small a pH of 2.0 to 3.0 and is
