There is one point in the circulatory system at which after as much as 20% of the total blood volume has been gravitational pressure factors caused by changes in body lost, the circulatory system often functions almost normally position of a healthy person usually do not affect the pressure because of this variable reservoir function of the veins. measurement by more than 1 to 2 mm Hg. This is at or near the level of the tricuspid valve, as shown by the crossed SPECIFIC BLOOD RESERVOIRS axes in Figure 15-12. Therefore, all circulatory pressure measurements discussed in this text are referred to this level, Certain portions of the circulatory system are so extensive which is called the reference level for pressure measurement. and/or so compliant that they are called specific blood reser- The reason for the lack of gravitational effects at the tri- voirs.
