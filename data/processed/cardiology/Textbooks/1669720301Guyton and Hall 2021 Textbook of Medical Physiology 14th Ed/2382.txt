It excites the postsynaptic neu- is a molecule that protrudes into the cell cytoplasm and ron if the neuronal membrane contains excitatory recep- activates one or more substances inside the postsynaptic tors, and it inhibits the neuron if the membrane contains neuron. These second messengers increase or decrease inhibitory receptors. The mitochondria provide adenosine specific cellular functions. triphosphate (ATP), which in turn supplies the energy for Neurotransmitter receptors that directly gate ion synthesizing new transmitter substances. channels are often called ionotropic receptors, whereas When an action potential spreads over a presynaptic those that act through second messenger systems are terminal, depolarization of its membrane causes a small called metabotropic receptors. number of vesicles to empty into the cleft.
