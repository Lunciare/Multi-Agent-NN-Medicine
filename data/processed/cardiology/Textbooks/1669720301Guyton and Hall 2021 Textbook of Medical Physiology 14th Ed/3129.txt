Role of Orexin Neurons in Arousal and Wakefulness. Another substance that has similar effects in causing Orexin (also called hypocretin) is produced by neurons in sleep is delta sleep–inducing peptide, a nonapeptide found the hypothalamus that provide excitatory input to many in the cerebrospinal fluid after electrical stimulation of the other areas of the brain where there are orexin receptors. thalamus to induce sleep. Several other potential sleep Orexin neurons are most active during waking and almost factors, mostly peptides, have been isolated from the stop firing during slow wave and REM sleep.
