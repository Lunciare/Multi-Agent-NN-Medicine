Among the many substances that cross cell mem- branes by facilitated diffusion are glucose and most of the Piston P P 1 2 amino acids. In the case of glucose, at least 14 members of a family of membrane proteins (called GLUT) that trans- port glucose molecules have been discovered in various C tissues. Some of these GLUT proteins transport other Figure 4-9. Effect of concentration difference (A), electrical poten- monosaccharides that have structures similar to that of tial difference affecting negative ions (B), and pressure difference (C) glucose, including galactose and fructose. One of these, to cause diffusion of molecules and ions through a cell membrane. C , concentration outside the cell; C, concentration inside the cell; glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), is activated by insulin, o i P pressure 1; P pressure 2 . which can increase the rate of facilitated diffusion of glu- 1 2 cose as much as 10- to 20- fold in insulin- sensitive tissues. in which C is the concentration outside and C
