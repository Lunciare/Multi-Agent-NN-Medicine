Thus, in Figure 46- 10B, the resting 580 Chapter 46 Organization of the Nervous System, Basic Functions of Synapses, and Neurotransmitters A main reason for this point of origin of the action potential is that the soma has relatively few voltage- gated sodium channels in its membrane, which makes it difficult for the (cid:31)65 mV EPSP to open the required number of sodium channels to elicit an action potential. Conversely, the membrane of the initial segment has seven times as great a concentration Resting neuron of voltage-g ated sodium channels as the soma and, there- fore, can generate an action potential with much greater B Initial segment of axon ease than can the soma. The EPSP that will elicit an ac- Excitatory tion potential in the axon initial segment is between +10 and +20 mV,
