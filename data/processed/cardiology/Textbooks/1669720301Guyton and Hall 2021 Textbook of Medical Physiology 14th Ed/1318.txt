Its muscle fibers extend in all directions and, ral tone normally keeps the bladder neck and posterior when contracted, can increase the pressure in the blad- urethra empty of urine and, therefore, prevents emptying der to 40 to 60 mm Hg. Thus, contraction of the detrusor of the bladder until the pressure in the main part of the muscle is a major step in emptying the bladder. Smooth bladder rises above a critical threshold. muscle cells of the detrusor muscle fuse with one another Beyond the posterior urethra, the urethra passes so that low-r esistance electrical pathways exist from one through the urogenital diaphragm, which contains a layer muscle cell to the other. Therefore, an action potential can of muscle called the external sphincter of the bladder. This spread throughout the detrusor muscle, from one muscle muscle is a voluntary skeletal muscle, in contrast to the cell to the next, to cause contraction of the entire bladder muscle of the bladder body and bladder neck, which is at once. entirely smooth muscle.
