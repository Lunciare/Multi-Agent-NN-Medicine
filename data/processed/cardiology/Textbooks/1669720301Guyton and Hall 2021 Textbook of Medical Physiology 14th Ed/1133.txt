produce known diuretic effect of digitalis, permits the kidneys to the curve labeled “autonomic compensation.” Thus, the eliminate some of the excess fluid. new venous return curve equates with the cardiac output The progressive loss of fluid over a period of several curve at point B. The cardiac output has been improved to days reduces mean systemic filling pressure down to a level of 4 L/min but at the expense of an additional rise 11.5 mm Hg, and the new venous return curve becomes in right atrial pressure to 5 mm Hg. the curve labeled “Several days later.” This curve equates The cardiac output of 4 L/min is still too low for the kid- with the cardiac output curve of the digitalized heart neys to function normally. Therefore, fluid continues to be at point H, at an output of 5 L/min and a right atrial retained and the mean systemic filling pressure rises from pressure of 4.6 mm Hg. This cardiac output is precisely 10.5 to almost 13 mm Hg. Now the venous return curve is that required for normal fluid balance. Therefore, no labeled “2nd day” and equilibrates with the cardiac output additional fluid will be lost, and none
