Am J Physiol 256:F932, 1989.) 4.6 Note that in the normal animals, a sevenfold increase 4.4 in potassium intake caused only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentration, from 4.2 to 4.3 mEq/L. NNoorrmmaall Thus, when the aldosterone feedback system is function- 4.2 ing normally, potassium concentration is precisely con- trolled, despite large changes in potassium intake.
