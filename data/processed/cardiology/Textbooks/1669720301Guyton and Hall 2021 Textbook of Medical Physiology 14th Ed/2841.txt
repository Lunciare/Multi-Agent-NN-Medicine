A branch of this fiber then goes directly motor nerves to the muscle spindle can be divided into to the anterior horn of the cord gray matter and synapses two types: gamma- dynamic (gamma- d) and gamma- with anterior motor neurons that send motor nerve fibers static (gamma- s). The first of these gamma motor nerves back to the same muscle from which the muscle spindle excites mainly the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers, and the fiber originated. Thus, this monosynaptic pathway allows second excites mainly the nuclear chain intrafusal fibers. a reflex signal to return with the shortest possible time When the gamma- d fibers excite the nuclear bag fibers, delay back to the muscle after excitation of the spindle. the dynamic response of the muscle spindle becomes tre- Most type II fibers from the muscle spindle terminate on mendously enhanced, whereas the static response is hard- multiple interneurons in the cord gray matter, and these ly affected.
