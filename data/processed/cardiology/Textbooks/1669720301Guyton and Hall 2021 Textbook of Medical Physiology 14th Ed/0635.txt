However, three dif- ferent conditions can cause this impulse to continue to moving in a circle, as shown in Figure 13-15. Instead, travel around the circle—that is, cause re- entry of the they have degenerated into a series of multiple wave impulse into muscle that has already been excited (circus fronts that have the appearance of a chain reaction.
