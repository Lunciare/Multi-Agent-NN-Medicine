adrenal medullae and the pituitary gland secrete their hormones primarily in response to CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND SYNTHESIS neural stimuli. The neuroendocrine cells, located in the OF HORMONES hypothalamus, have axons that terminate in the posterior pituitary gland and median eminence and secrete several Three general classes of hormones exist: neurohormones, including antidiuretic hormone, oxyto- 1.

In general, polypeptides with 100 or more amino acids are called proteins, and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as peptides. Pineal gland Pituitary gland Protein and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough end of the endoplasmic reticulum of the different endocrine cells, in the same fashion as most other pro- teins (Figure 75- 2). They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins that are not biologically active (preprohor- Parathyroid glands (behind thyroid gland) Thyroid gland mones)
