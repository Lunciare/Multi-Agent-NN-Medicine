only one DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF RECEPTORS modality of sensation is called the labeled line principle. How do two types of sensory receptors detect different types of sensory stimuli? The answer is “by differential TRANSDUCTION OF SENSORY STIMULI sensitivities.” That is, each type of receptor is highly sensi- INTO NERVE IMPULSES tive to one type of stimulus for which it is designed and yet is almost nonresponsive to other types of sensory LOCAL ELECTRICAL CURRENTS AT NERVE stimuli.
