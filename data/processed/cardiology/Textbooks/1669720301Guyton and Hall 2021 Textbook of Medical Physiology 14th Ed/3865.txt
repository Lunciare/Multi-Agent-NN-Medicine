and Sensitivity of Hormone Receptors Ion Channel–Linked Receptors. Virtually all the neu- Are Regulated. The number of receptors in a target cell rotransmitter substances, such as acetylcholine and nor- usually does not remain constant from day to day or even epinephrine, combine with receptors in the postsynap- from minute to minute. Receptor proteins are often inac- tic membrane. This combination almost always causes a tivated or destroyed during the course of their function, change in the structure of the receptor, usually opening or and at other times they are reactivated or new ones are closing a channel for one or more ions. Some of these ion manufactured by the cell. For example, increased hor- channel–linked receptors open (or close) channels for so- mone concentration and increased binding with its target dium ions, others for potassium ions, others for calcium cell receptors sometimes cause the number of active re- ions, and so forth. The altered movement of these ions ceptors to decrease. This down- regulation of the recep- through the channels causes the subsequent effects on the tors can occur as a result of (1) inactivation of some of postsynaptic cells. Although a few hormones may exert the receptor molecules; (2)
