First, glycolytic reactions can occur even in the absence of the muscle to the external load to lift an object to a greater oxygen, so muscle contraction can be sustained for many height or to overcome resistance to movement. seconds and sometimes up to more than 1 minute, even In mathematical terms, work is defined by the follow- when oxygen delivery from the blood is not available. Sec- ing equation: ond, the rate of ATP formation by glycolysis is about 2.5 W=L×D times as rapid as ATP formation in response to cellular foodstuffs reacting with oxygen. However, so many end in which W is the work output, L is the load, and D is products of glycolysis accumulate in the muscle cells that the distance of movement against the load.
