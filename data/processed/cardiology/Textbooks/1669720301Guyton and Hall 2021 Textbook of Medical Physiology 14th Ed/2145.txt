factor of 1.23 because the Because the blood that perfuses the capillaries is venous blood diffusion coefficient for O 2 is 1.23 times that for CO. Thus, returning to the lungs from the systemic circulation, it is the the average diffusing capacity for CO in healthy young men gases in this blood with which the alveolar gases equilibrate. at rest is 17 ml/min per mm Hg, and the diffusing capacity In Chapter 41, we describe how the normal venous blood (V) for O 2 is 1.23 times this, or 21 ml/min per mm Hg. has a Po 2 of 40 mm Hg and a Pco 2 of 45 mm Hg. Therefore, these are also the normal partial pressures of these two gases Effect of Ventilation-P erfusion Ratio on Alveolar Gas in alveoli that have blood flow but no ventilation. Concentration Alveolar Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressures Earlier in this chapter, we learned that two factors deter- When V˙ A/Q˙ Equals Infinity.
