When an extra amount of blood flows into the creased, inducing thickening of the left ventricular walls, ventricles, the cardiac muscle is stretched to a greater which can reduce the ventricular chamber radius (concen- length. This stretching causes the muscle to contract with tric hypertrophy) and at least partially relieve the increased increased force because the actin and myosin filaments wall tension. Also, much more chemical energy is expend- are brought to a more nearly optimal degree of overlap ed, even at normal systolic pressures, when the ventricle is abnormally dilated (eccentric hypertrophy) because the for force generation. Therefore, the ventricle, because of heart muscle tension during contraction is proportional to its increased pumping, automatically pumps the extra pressure times the radius of the ventricle. This becomes es- blood into the arteries. This ability of stretched muscle, pecially important in heart failure when the heart ventricle up to an optimal length, to contract with increased work is dilated and, paradoxically, the amount of chemical en- output is characteristic of all striated muscle, as
