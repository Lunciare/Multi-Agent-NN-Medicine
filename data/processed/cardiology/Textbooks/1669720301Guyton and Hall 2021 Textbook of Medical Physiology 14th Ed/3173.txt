sympathetic nerves to each organ is determined partly by the locus in the embryo from which Inferior mesenteric the organ originated. For example, the heart receives many ganglion Colon sympathetic nerve fibers from the neck portion of the sym- S1 pathetic chain because the heart originated in the neck of the embryo before translocating into the thorax. Likewise, the abdominal organs receive most of their sympathetic Anal innervation from the lower thoracic spinal cord segments sphincter because most of the primitive gut originated in this area. Hypogastric Special Sympathetic Nerve Endings in the Adrenal Me- Dorsal plexus Ureter dullae. Preganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers pass, with- root out synapsing, all the way from the intermediolateral horn Detrusor Gray cells of the spinal cord, through the sympathetic chains, ramus Trigone then through the splanchnic nerves, and finally into the two Genitalia Bladder adrenal medullae. There they end directly on modified neu- ronal cells that secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine into Ventral Preganglionic neuron root the blood stream. These secretory cells embryologically are White derived from nervous tissue and are actually postganglionic Postganglionic neuron ramus Chain neurons; indeed, they even have rudimentary nerve fibers, and it is the endings of these fibers that secrete
