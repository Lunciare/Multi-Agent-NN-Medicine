Also, the axis of the vector is Thus, the QRS complexes are completed in the three beginning to shift toward the left side of the chest because standard bipolar limb leads. the left ventricle is slightly slower to depolarize than the Sometimes the QRS complex has a slight negative right ventricle. Therefore, the ratio of the voltage in lead I depression at its beginning in one or more of the leads, to that in lead III is increasing. which is not shown in Figure 12-7; this depression is In Figure 12-7D, about 0.05 second after onset of depo- the Q wave.
