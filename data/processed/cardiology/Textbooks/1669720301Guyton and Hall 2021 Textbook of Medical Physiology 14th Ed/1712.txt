there is sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules and increases increased production of NH +, which further contributes 4 H+ secretion and HCO − reabsorption through multiple to excretion of H+ and addition of new HCO − to the 3 3 mechanisms, including the following: (1) increased Ang extracellular fluid. With severe chronic acidosis, as much II levels, which directly stimulate activity of the Na+- as 500 mEq/day of H+ can be excreted in the urine, mainly H+ exchanger in the renal tubules; and (2) increased in the form of NH +; this excretion, in turn, contributes up 4 aldosterone levels, which stimulate H+ secretion by to 500 mEq/day of new HCO − that is added to the blood. 3 the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubules. Thus, with chronic acidosis, increased secretion of H+ Therefore, extracellular fluid volume depletion tends by the tubules helps eliminate excess H+ from the body to cause alkalosis due to excess H+ secretion and and increases the quantity of HCO − in the extracellu- 3 HCO − reabsorption. lar fluid. This process increases the HCO − part of the 3 3 Changes in plasma potassium concentration can bicarbonate buffer system, which, in accordance
