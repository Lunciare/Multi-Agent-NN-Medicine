Furthermore, the ani- 3.0 mal cannot resist different types of physical or even mental stress, and minor illnesses such as respiratory tract infections can lead to death. Therefore, the glu- 2.0 cocorticoids have functions just as important to the long- continued life of the animal as those of the min- 1.0 eralocorticoids. These functions are explained in the following sections. At least 95% of the glucocorticoid activity of the adre- 0.0 Control ACE ACE inhibitor nocortical secretions results from the secretion of corti- inhibitor + sol, known also as hydrocortisone.
