For sure, thus returning the renin-a ngiotensin system toward example, aldosterone has been shown to increase forma- its normal level of activity. These feedback control mecha- tion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in vas- nisms are essential for maintaining life, and the reader is cular smooth muscle cells and in epithelial cells of the referred again to Chapters 28 and 30 for a more complete renal collecting tubules in less than 2 minutes, a period description of their functions. 961 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV Endocrinology and Reproduction 50 play a “permissive” role in regulation of aldosterone secretion. 40 FUNCTIONS OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS Even though mineralocorticoids can save the life of an 30 acutely adrenalectomized animal, the animal still is far from normal. Instead, the animal’s metabolic sys- 20 tems for utilization of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats remain considerably deranged. Furthermore, the ani- 3.0 mal cannot resist different types of physical or even mental stress, and minor illnesses such as respiratory tract infections can lead to death.
