tonotopic maps have been body described in the primary auditory cortex and auditory association areas. In each of these maps, high-f requency sounds excite neurons at one end of the map, whereas Figure 53- 9. Auditory nervous pathways.

In most maps, the low-f requency sounds are located ante- activates the entire nervous system in response to loud riorly, as shown in Figure 53- 10, and the high- frequency sounds.

Why does the auditory cortex have so many different Third, a high degree of spatial orientation is maintained tonotopic maps? The answer, presumably, is that each of in the fiber tracts from the cochlea all the way to the cor- the separate areas dissects out some specific feature of tex.
