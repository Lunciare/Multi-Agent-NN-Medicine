of the cardiac rier, a portion of which is shown in Figure 10- 3. This impulse through the human heart. The numbers on the barrier normally acts as an insulator to prevent passage of the cardiac impulse between atrial and ventricular muscle through any other route besides forward conduc- tion through the A- V bundle. In rare cases, an abnormal muscle bridge, or accessory pathway, does penetrate the fibrous barrier elsewhere besides at the A- V bundle. Under such conditions, the cardiac impulse can re-e nter the atria from the ventricles and cause serious cardiac arrhythmias. Distribution of the Purkinje Fibers in the Ventricles— Left and Right Bundle Branches. After penetrating the fibrous tissue between the atrial and ventricular muscle, the .07 distal portion of the A- V bundle passes downward in the ven- S-A tricular septum for 5 to 15 mm toward the apex of the heart, .04 .06 as shown in Figures 10-1 and 10-3. Then, the bundle divides .03 .09 into left and right bundle branches that lie beneath the endo- A-V .00 .22 cardium on the two respective sides of the ventricular sep- .07 .19 tum. Each branch spreads downward toward the apex of the .03
