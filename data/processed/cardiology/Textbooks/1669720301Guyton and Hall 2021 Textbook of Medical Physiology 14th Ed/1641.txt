An increase in vascular capacity initially reduces mean retention, the plasma protein concentration becomes fur- circulatory filling pressure (see Figure 30- 14), which leads ther diluted, causing still more fluid to leak into the tissues to decreased cardiac output and decreased arterial pres- of the body. The net result is massive fluid retention by sure. The fall in pressure causes salt and water retention the kidneys until tremendous extracellular edema occurs, by the kidneys until blood volume increases sufficiently to unless treatment is instituted to restore the plasma fill the extra capacity. proteins. 400 Chapter 30 Renal Regulation of Potassium, Calcium, Phosphate, and Magnesium Curry JN, Yu ASL: Magnesium handling in
