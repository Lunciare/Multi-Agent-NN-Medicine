To measure compliance, air is forced into the Quantitatively, the surface tension of different water lungs a little at a time while recording lung pressures and fluids is approximately the following: pure water, 72 volumes. To inflate this total pulmonary system, almost dynes/cm; normal fluids lining the alveoli but without twice as much pressure is required compared with the surfactant, 50 dynes/cm; normal fluids lining the alveoli same lungs after removal from the chest cage. Therefore, and with normal amounts of surfactant included, between the compliance of the combined lung- thorax system is 5 and 30 dynes/cm. almost exactly half that of the lungs alone—110 ml/cm H O pressure for the combined system, compared with Pressure in Occluded Alveoli Caused by Surface Ten- 2 sion. If the air passages leading from the alveoli of the lungs 200 ml/cm H 2O for the lungs alone. Furthermore, when the lungs are expanded to high volumes or compressed are blocked, the surface tension in the alveoli tends to col- to low volumes, the limitations of the chest become lapse
