shown in Figure 69- 3, is called beta- blood, and redeposited as triglycerides in the liver, where oxidation of fatty acids. the initial stages of much of fat degradation begin. Thus, To understand the essential steps in the beta- oxidation under normal physiological conditions, the total amount process, note that in Equation 1 in Figure 69- 3, the first step of triglycerides in the liver is determined to a great extent is combination of the fatty acid molecule with coenzyme 856 Chapter 69 Lipid Metabolism Thiokinase (1) RCH CH CH COOH + CoA + ATP RCH CH CH COCoA + AMP + Pyrophosphate 2 2 2 2 2 2 (Fatty acid) (Fatty acyl-CoA) Acyl dehydrogenase (2) RCH CH CH COCoA + FAD RCH CH=CHCOCoA + FADH 2 2 2 2 2 (Fatty acyl-CoA) Enoyl hydrase (3) RCH CH=CHCOCoA + H O RCH CHOHCH COCoA 2 2 2 2 (cid:31)-Hydroxyacyl (4) RCH CHOHCH COCoA + NAD+ RCH COCH COCoA + NADH + H+ 2 2 2 2 dehydrogenase Thiolase (5) RCH COCH COCoA + CoA RCH COCoA + CH COCoA 2 2 2 3 (Fatty acyl-CoA)(Acetyl-CoA) Figure 69- 3.
