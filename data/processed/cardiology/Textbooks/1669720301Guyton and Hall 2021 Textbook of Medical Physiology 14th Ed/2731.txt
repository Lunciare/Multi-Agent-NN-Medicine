acuity of vision within less than 1 second. Although the precise control mecha- N. II nism that causes this rapid and accurate focusing of the eye is not fully understood, the following features are known. Pons First, when the eyes suddenly change distance of the N. V fixation point, the lens changes its strength in the proper direction to achieve a new state of focus within a fraction of a second. Second, different types of clues help change Carotid plexus the lens strength in the proper direction, as follows: 1. Chromatic aberration appears to be important. That is, red light rays focus slightly posteriorly to blue Superior cervical ganglion light rays because the lens bends blue rays more than red rays. The eyes appear to be able to detect Cervical which of these two types of rays is in better focus, sympathetic and this clue relays information to the accommoda- trunk tion mechanism with regard to whether to make the lens stronger or weaker.
