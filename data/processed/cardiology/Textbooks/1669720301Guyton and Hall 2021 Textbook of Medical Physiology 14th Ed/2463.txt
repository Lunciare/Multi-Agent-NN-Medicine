For example, the interneurons of the spinal cord receive converging signals from the follow- ing: (1) peripheral nerve fibers entering the cord; (2) pro- priospinal fibers passing from one segment of the cord to Source Source #2 #3 another; (3) corticospinal fibers from the cerebral cortex; and (4) several other long pathways descending from the brain into the spinal cord. Then, the signals from the interneurons converge on the anterior motor neurons to control muscle function. Convergence from a Convergence from single source multiple separate sources Such convergence allows summation of information from different sources, and the resulting response is a Figure 47- 12 Convergence of multiple input fibers onto a single neuron.
