record momen- each heart. tarily being recorded in the ECG of lead I is positive. The instantaneous recorded voltage will be equal to the length of B divided by the length of A times 2 millivolts, or about 1 millivolt. – – – Figure 12-5 shows another example of vectorial analy- sis. In this example, vector A represents the electrical potential and its axis at a given instant during ventricular + aVR aVL + depolarization in a heart in which the left side of the heart 210° depolarizes more rapidly than the right side. In this case, –30° the instantaneous vector has a direction of 100 degrees, 0° I and its voltage is again 2 millivolts. To determine the – + potential actually recorded in lead I, we draw a perpen- dicular line from the tip of vector A to the lead I axis and find projected vector B. Vector B is very short, and this – 60° – time it is in the negative direction, indicating that at this III II particular instant, the recording in lead I will be negative 120° 90° (below the zero line in the ECG), and the voltage recorded + aVF + will be
