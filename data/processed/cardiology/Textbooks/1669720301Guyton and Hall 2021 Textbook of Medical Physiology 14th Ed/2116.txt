The difference between the lengths of the arrows represents er the kinetic activity of the molecules and, therefore, the net diffusion. greater the likelihood that the water molecules will escape from the surface of the water into the gas phase. For example, the water vapor pressure at 0°C is 5 mm Hg, and at 100°C it expressed by the following formula, which is Henry’s law: is 760 mm Hg. The most important value to remember is the vapor pressure at body temperature, 47 mm Hg. This value Partial pressure=Concentration of dissolved gas appears in many of our subsequent discussions. Solubility coefficient Pressure Difference Causes Net Diffusion of Gases Through Fluids When partial pressure is expressed in atmospheres (1 atmosphere [1 atm] pressure equals 760 mm Hg) and con- From the preceding discussion, it is clear that when the par- centration is expressed in volume of gas dissolved in each tial pressure of a gas is greater in one area than in another volume of water, the solubility coefficients for important area, there will
