The greatly increased cardiac output 15 caused by increased blood volume lasts for only a few B minutes because several compensatory effects immedi- ately begin to occur: 10 1. The increased cardiac output increases the capillary pressure so that fluid begins to transude out of the 5 A Psf = 7 Psf = 16 capillaries into the tissues, thereby returning the blood volume toward normal. 2. The increased pressure in the veins causes the veins 0 to continue distending gradually by the mechanism −4 0 +4 +8 +12 +16 called stress-
