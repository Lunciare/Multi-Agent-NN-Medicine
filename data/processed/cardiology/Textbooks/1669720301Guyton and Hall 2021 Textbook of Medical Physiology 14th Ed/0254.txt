the 0 membrane of +61 millivolts. Also shown in Figure 5-5 B on R is the Nernst potential for potassium diffusion of −94 zati e p o millivolts. How do these interact with each other, and olari la ri z what will be the summated potential? This question can ep ati be answered by using the Goldman equation described D o n –70 previously. Intuitively, one can see that if the membrane Resting is highly permeable to potassium but only slightly per- 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 meable to sodium, the diffusion of potassium contributes Milliseconds far more to the membrane potential than the diffusion of sodium. In the normal nerve fiber, the permeability of Figure 5- 6 Typical action potential recorded by the method shown in the upper panel. the membrane to potassium is about 100 times as great as its permeability to sodium. Using this value in the Goldman equation, and considering only sodium and varies in different cells from as low as around −10 mil- potassium, gives a potential inside the membrane of −86 livolts in erythrocytes to as high as −90 millivolts in skel- millivolts, which is near the potassium potential shown etal
