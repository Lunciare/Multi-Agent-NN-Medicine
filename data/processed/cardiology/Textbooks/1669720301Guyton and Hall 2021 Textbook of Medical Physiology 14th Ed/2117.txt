volume of gas dissolved in each tial pressure of a gas is greater in one area than in another volume of water, the solubility coefficients for important area, there will be net diffusion from the high- pressure area respiratory gases at body temperature are the following: toward the low- pressure area. For example, returning to Figure 40- 1, one can readily see that the molecules in the Oxygen: 0.024 area of high pressure, because of their greater number, have a Carbon dioxide: 0.57 greater chance of moving randomly into the area of low pres- Carbon monoxide: 0.018 sure than do molecules attempting to go in the other direc- tion. However, some molecules do bounce randomly from Nitrogen: 0.012 the low- pressure area toward the high- pressure area. There- Helium: 0.008 fore, the net diffusion of gas from the area of high pressure to the area of low pressure is equal to the number of mol- From this list, one can see that CO is more than 20 2 ecules bouncing in this forward direction minus the number times as soluble as O . Therefore, the partial pressure of 2 bouncing in the opposite direction, which is proportional to CO for
