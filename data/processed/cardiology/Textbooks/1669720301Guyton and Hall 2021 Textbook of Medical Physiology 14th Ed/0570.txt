ventricles ly swinging slightly to one side. Thus, vector 2 of Figure 12- is 59 degrees. In many pathological conditions of the heart, 10 represents the state of depolarization of the ventricles this direction changes markedly, sometimes even to opposite about 0.02 second after vector 1. After another 0.02 second, poles of the heart. vector 3 represents the potential, and vector 4 occurs in another 0.01 second. Finally, the ventricles become totally DETERMINING THE ELECTRICAL AXIS FROM depolarized, and the vector becomes zero once again, as shown at point 5. STANDARD LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS The elliptical figure generated by the positive ends of the Clinically, the electrical axis of the heart is usually vectors is called the QRS vectorcardiogram. estimated from the standard bipolar limb lead ECGs rather than from the vectorcardiogram. Figure 12-11 shows a MEAN ELECTRICAL AXIS OF method for performing this estimation. After recording THE VENTRICULAR QRS AND ITS the standard leads, one determines the net potential and SIGNIFICANCE polarity of the recordings in leads I and III. In lead I of Figure 12-11, the recording is positive, and in lead III, The vectorcardiogram during ventricular depolarization the recording is mainly positive but negative during part (the QRS
