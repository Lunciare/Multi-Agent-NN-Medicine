Then, when the second phosphate acid molecules, and energy is released to form four ATP radical is removed, still another 7300 calories become avail- molecules for each original glucose molecule, as explained able. Removal of the first phosphate converts the ATP into in Chapter 68. Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid then enters the adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and removal of the second mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts with oxygen to converts this ADP into adenosine monophosphate (AMP). form still many more ATP molecules. However, when there The amount of ATP present in the muscles, even in a well- is insufficient oxygen for this second stage (the oxidative trained athlete, is sufficient to sustain maximal muscle power stage) of glucose metabolism to occur, most of the pyru- for only about 3 seconds, which might be enough for one half vic acid then is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses of a 50- meter dash. Therefore, except for a few seconds at a out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and blood. time, it is essential that new ATP be formed continuously, Therefore, much of the muscle glycogen is transformed to even during the performance of
