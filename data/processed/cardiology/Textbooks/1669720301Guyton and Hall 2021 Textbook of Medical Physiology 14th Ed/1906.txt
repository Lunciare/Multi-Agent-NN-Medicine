to it. Role of Macrophages in the Activation Process. Aside B 2 from the lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue, literally mil- lions of macrophages are also present in the same tissue. Proliferation and These macrophages line the sinusoids of the lymph nodes, differentiation of B lymphocytes spleen, and other lymphoid tissue, and they lie in apposi- 2 tion to many of the lymph node lymphocytes. Most invad- ing organisms are first phagocytized and partially digest- ed by the macrophages, and the antigenic products are B B B B 2 2 2 2 liberated into the macrophage cytosol. The macrophages then pass these antigens by cell to cell contact directly to the lymphocytes, thus leading to activation of the speci- fied lymphocytic clones. The macrophages, in addition, Antibodies secrete a special activating substance, interleukin- 1, that secreted promotes still further growth and reproduction of the specific lymphocytes. Role of T Cells in Activation of B Lymphocytes. Most antigens activate both T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes Figure 35- 2. An antigen activates only the lymphocytes that have at the same time. Some of the T cells that are formed, cell surface receptors that are complementary and recognize a spe- called T- helper cells,
