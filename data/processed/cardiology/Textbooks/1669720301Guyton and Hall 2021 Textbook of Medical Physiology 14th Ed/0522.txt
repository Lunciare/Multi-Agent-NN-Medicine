During depolarization, single ventricular muscle fiber. The upsweep of this action the normal negative potential inside the fiber reverses and potential is caused by depolarization, and the return of becomes slightly positive inside and negative outside. the potential to the baseline is caused by repolarization. 135 UNIT III UNIT III The Heart Atria Ventricles RR interval +1.0 R +0.5 S-T T segment P 0 Q P-R interval = 0.16 sec S Q-T interval –0.5 Figure 11- 1.
