In the central fovea, there are only slen- been studied most extensively in primates, including der cones—about 35,000 of them—and no rods. Also, humans, are designated as magnocellular (M) and par- the number of optic nerve fibers leading from this part vocellular (P) cells. of the retina is almost exactly equal to the number of The P cells (also known as beta cells or, in the central cones, as shown at the right in Figure 51- 12. This phe- retina, as midget ganglion cells) project to the parvocel- nomenon explains the high degree of visual acuity in the lular (small cells) layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus of central retina in comparison with the much poorer acuity the thalamus. The M cells (also called alpha or parasol peripherally. cells) project to the magnocellular (large cells) layer of the Another difference between the peripheral and central lateral geniculate nucleus, which, in turn, relays informa- portions of the retina is the much greater sensitivity of tion from the optic tract to the visual cortex, as discussed the peripheral retina to
