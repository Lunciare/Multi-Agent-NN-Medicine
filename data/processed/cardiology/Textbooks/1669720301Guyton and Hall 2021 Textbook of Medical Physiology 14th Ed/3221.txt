They inhibit acetylcholinesterase, thus preventing rapid de- struction of the acetylcholine liberated at parasympathetic nerve endings. As a consequence, the quantity of acetyl- Bibliography choline increases with successive stimuli, and the degree of Alba BK, Castellani JW, Charkoudian N: Cold-i nduced cutaneous vaso- action also increases. constriction in humans: Function, dysfunction and the distinctly coun- Drugs That Block Cholinergic Activity at Effector Or- terproductive.
