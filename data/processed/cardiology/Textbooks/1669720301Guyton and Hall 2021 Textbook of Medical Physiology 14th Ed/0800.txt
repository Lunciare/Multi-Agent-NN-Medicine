Figure 17- 2 shows that as the arterial oxygen saturation decreases to about 25% of normal, the blood flow through an isolated leg increases about three- 4 fold; that is, the blood flow increases almost enough, but not quite enough, to make up for the decreased amount of oxygen in the blood, thus almost maintaining a relatively 3 constant supply of oxygen to the tissues.
