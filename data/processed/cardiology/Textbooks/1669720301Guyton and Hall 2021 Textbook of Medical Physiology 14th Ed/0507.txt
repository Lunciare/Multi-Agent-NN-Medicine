CONTROL OF EXCITATION AND When A- V block occurs—that is, when the cardiac CONDUCTION IN THE HEART impulse fails to pass from the atria into the ventricles through the A- V nodal and bundle system—the atria con- THE SINUS NODE IS THE NORMAL PACE- tinue to beat at the normal rate of rhythm of the sinus MAKER OF THE HEART node while a new pacemaker usually develops in the Pur- kinje system of the ventricles and drives the ventricular In discussing the genesis and transmission of the cardiac muscle at a new rate, somewhere between 15 and 40 beats impulse through the heart, we have noted that the impulse per minute. After sudden A- V bundle block, the Purkinje normally arises in the sinus node. In some abnormal con- system does not begin to emit its intrinsic rhythmical ditions, this is not the case. Other parts of the heart can impulses until 5 to 20 seconds later because, before the also exhibit intrinsic rhythmical excitation in the same blockage, the Purkinje fibers had been “overdriven” by way as the sinus nodal fibers; this is particularly true of the rapid
