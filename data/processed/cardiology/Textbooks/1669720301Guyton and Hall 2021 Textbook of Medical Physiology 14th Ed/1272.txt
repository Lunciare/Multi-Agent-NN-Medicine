K+, Na+ Causes of Hypernatremia: Water Loss or Organic Excess Sodium solutes H O 2 An increased plasma sodium concentration, which also causes increased osmolarity, can be due to loss of water from the extracellular fluid, which concentrates the sodium ions, or excess sodium in the extracellular fluid. Primary loss of water from the extracellular fluid results Normonatremia in hypernatremia and dehydration. This condition can 2 occur from an inability to
