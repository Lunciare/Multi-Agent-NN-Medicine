Analysis of Arterial Pressure Changes independent effects, reduce the rate of renin secretion and Caused by Angiotensin II. Figure 19- 11 shows a quanti- angiotensin II formation, which then helps eliminate the tative analysis of the effect of angiotensin in arterial pres- additional salt with minimal increases in extracellular fluid sure control. This figure shows two renal function curves, volume or arterial pressure. Thus, the renin-a ngiotensin as well as a line depicting a normal level of sodium intake. The left- hand renal function curve is that measured in dogs system is an automatic feedback mechanism that helps whose renin-a ngiotensin system had been blocked by an maintain the arterial pressure at or near the normal level, ACE inhibitor drug that blocks the conversion of angioten- even when salt intake is increased. When salt intake is sin I to angiotensin II.
