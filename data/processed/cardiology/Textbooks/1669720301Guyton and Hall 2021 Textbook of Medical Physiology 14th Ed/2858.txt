reflex, an interval of fatigue and, finally, afterdischarge after the Inhibited input stimulus is over. Polysynaptic circuit Excited Inhibited after a pain sensory nerve begins to be stimulated, the flexor response appears. Then, in the next few seconds, the reflex begins to fatigue, which is characteristic of Painful essentially all complex integrative reflexes of the spinal stimulus from hand cord. Finally, after the stimulus is over, the contraction of the muscle returns toward the baseline, but because of afterdischarge, it takes many milliseconds for this con- traction to occur. The duration of afterdischarge depends on the intensity of the sensory stimulus that elicited the reflex; a weak tactile stimulus causes almost no afterdis- charge, but after a strong pain stimulus, the afterdischarge FLEXOR CROSSED EXTENSOR may last for a second or more. REFLEX REFLEX The afterdischarge that occurs in the flexor reflex Figure 55- 9. Flexor reflex, crossed extensor reflex, and reciprocal almost certainly results from both types of repetitive inhibition. discharge circuits discussed in Chapter 47. Electrophysi- ological studies indicate that immediate afterdischarge, If some part of the body other than one of the limbs is lasting for about 6 to 8 milliseconds, results from repeti- painfully stimulated, that
