When sodium is the only permeant Channels. The original research that led to quantitative ion in the solutions inside and outside the squid axon, the understanding of the sodium and potassium channels was voltage clamp measures current flow only through the so ingenious that it led to Nobel Prizes for the scientists sodium channels. When potassium is the only permeant responsible, Hodgkin and Huxley, in 1963. The essence of ion, current flow only through the potassium channels is these studies is shown in Figures. 5-8 and 5- 9. measured. Figure 5- 8 shows the voltage clamp method, which Another means for studying the flow of ions through is used to measure the flow of ions through the different an individual type of channel is to block one type of chan- channels. In using this apparatus, two electrodes are in- nel at a time. For example, the sodium channels can be serted into the nerve fiber. One of these electrodes is used blocked by
