Between meals, plasma potassium usually ranges between 50 and 200 mEq/day; therefore, concentration also remains nearly constant as potassium failure to rapidly rid the extracellular fluid of the ingested potassium could cause life- threatening hyperkalemia (increased plasma potassium concentration). Likewise, a K+ intake small loss of potassium from the extracellular fluid could 100 mEq/day cause severe hypokalemia (low plasma potassium con- centration) in the absence of rapid and appropriate com- Extracellular Intracellular fluid K+ fluid K+ pensatory responses. Maintenance of a balance between intake and output of 4.2 mEq/L 140 mEq/L potassium depends primarily on excretion by the kidneys × 14 L × 28 L because the amount excreted in the feces is only about 5% to 10% of the potassium intake. Thus, the maintenance 59 mEq 3920 mEq of a normal potassium balance requires the kidneys to adjust their potassium excretion rapidly and precisely in response to wide variations in intake, as is also true for K+ output Urine 92 mEq/day most other electrolytes.
