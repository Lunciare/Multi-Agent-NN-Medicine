only about one-half as rapid as the phosphagen system. er chemical compound that has a high-e nergy phosphate Under optimal conditions, the glycogen–lactic acid system bond, with the following formula: can provide 1.3 to 1.6 minutes of maximal muscle activity in addition to the 8 to 10 seconds provided by the phosphagen Creatine ∼ PO 3− system, although at somewhat reduced muscle power. Phosphocreatine can decompose to creatine and phos- Aerobic System. The aerobic system is the oxidation phate ion, as shown in Figure 85-2 , and in doing so releases of foodstuffs in the mitochondria to provide energy. As large amounts of energy. In fact, the high- energy phosphate shown to the left in Figure 85-2 , glucose, fatty acids, and bond of phosphocreatine has more energy than the bond amino acids from the foodstuffs—after some intermediate of ATP: 10,300 calories per mole compared with 7300 for processing—combine with oxygen to release tremendous the ATP bond. Therefore, phosphocreatine can easily pro- amounts of energy that are used to convert AMP and ADP vide enough energy to reconstitute the high- energy bond into ATP, as discussed in Chapter 68. of ATP. Furthermore, most muscle cells have two to four In
