the other extreme, to cause a vast increase in flow. sels to a circuit reduces the total vascular resistance. Many Ranges of blood flow of more than 100- fold in separate parallel blood vessels, however, make it easier for blood to tissue areas have been recorded between the limits of flow through the circuit because each parallel vessel pro- maximum arteriolar constriction and maximum arteri- vides another pathway, or conductance, for blood flow. olar dilation. The total conductance (C ) for blood flow is the sum of total the conductance of each parallel pathway: Resistance to Blood Flow in Series and Parallel Vas- cular Circuits. Blood pumped by the heart flows from the high- pressure part of the systemic circulation (i.e., For example, brain, kidney, muscle, gastrointestinal, aorta) to the low- pressure side (i.e., vena cava) through skin, and coronary circulations are arranged in parallel, many miles of blood vessels arranged in series and in and each tissue contributes to the overall conductance parallel. The arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, of the systemic circulation. Blood flow through each and veins are collectively arranged in series. When tissue is a fraction of the total blood flow (cardiac out- blood vessels are arranged
