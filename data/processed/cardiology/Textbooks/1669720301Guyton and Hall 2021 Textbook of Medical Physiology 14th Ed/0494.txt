channels ceases, while 10,000ths of a second is responsible for the rapid upstroke at the same time large quantities of positive potassium spike of the action potential observed in ventricular mus- ions diffuse out of the fiber. Both these effects reduce the cle because of rapid influx of positive sodium ions to the intracellular potential back to its negative resting level and interior of the fiber. Then, the plateau of the ventricular therefore terminate the action potential. Furthermore, the action potential is caused primarily by slower opening of potassium channels remain open for another few tenths the slow sodium- calcium channels, which lasts for about of a second, temporarily continuing movement of posi- 0.3 second. Finally, opening of potassium channels allows tive charges out of the cell, with resultant excess negativity for the diffusion of large amounts of positive potassium inside the fiber; this process is called hyperpolarization. ions in the outward direction through the fiber membrane The hyperpolarization state initially carries the resting and returns the membrane potential to its resting level. membrane potential down to about –55 to –60 millivolts However, there is a difference in the function of these at the termination of the action potential. channels
