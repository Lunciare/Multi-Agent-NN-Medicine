a key mechanism for attached to the vesicle and empty their acid hydrolases to tissue development, cell survival when nutrients are the inside of the vesicle, as shown in Figure 2-12. Thus, scarce, and maintenance of homeostasis. In liver cells, a digestive vesicle is formed inside the cell cytoplasm in for example, the average mitochondrion normally has which the vesicular hydrolases begin hydrolyzing the a life span of only about 10 days before it is destroyed. 22 Chapter 2 The Cell and Its Functions Proteins Synthesis by the Rough Endoplasmic Reticu- lum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is characterized by large numbers of ribosomes attached to the outer surfaces of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As discussed in Chapter 3, protein molecules are synthesized within the Isolation membrane structures of the ribosomes. The ribosomes extrude some VESICLE NUCLEATION of the synthesized protein molecules directly into the cy- tosol, but they also extrude many more through the wall of the endoplasmic reticulum to the interior of the endo- plasmic vesicles and tubules into the endoplasmic matrix. Lipid Synthesis by the Smooth Endoplasmic Reticu- lum. The endoplasmic reticulum also synthesizes lipids, AUTOSOME especially phospholipids and cholesterol. These lipids are FORMATION rapidly incorporated into the
