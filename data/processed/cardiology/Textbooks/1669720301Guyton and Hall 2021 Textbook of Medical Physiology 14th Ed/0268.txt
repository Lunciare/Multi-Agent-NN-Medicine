Furthermore, once the potassium channels open, they remain open for the entire duration of the positive lisecond or more delay. membrane potential and do not close again until after the The middle portion of Figure 5- 10 shows the ratio of membrane potential is decreased back to a negative value. sodium to potassium conductance at each instant dur- ing the action potential, and above this depiction is the SUMMARY OF EVENTS THAT CAUSE THE action potential itself. During the early portion of the ACTION POTENTIAL action potential, the ratio of sodium to potassium con- ductance increases more than 1000-f old. Therefore, far Figure 5-1 0 summarizes the sequential events that more sodium ions flow to the interior of the fiber than occur during and shortly after the action potential.

This is what causes the bottom of the figure shows the changes in membrane membrane potential to become positive at the action conductance for sodium and potassium ions. During potential onset. Then, the sodium channels begin to close, the resting state, before the action potential begins, the and the potassium channels begin to
