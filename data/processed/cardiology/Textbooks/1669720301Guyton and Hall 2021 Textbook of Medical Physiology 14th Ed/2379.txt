General Principles and Sensory Physiology depolarizes the presynaptic membrane, these calcium channels open and allow large numbers of calcium ions to flow into the terminal (Figure 46- 5A). The quantity of neurotransmitter that is then released from the terminal into the synaptic cleft is directly related to the number of calcium ions that enter (Video 46- 2). The precise mecha- nism whereby the calcium ions cause this release is not known, but it is believed to be the following. Dendrites When the calcium ions enter the presynaptic termi- nal, they bind with special
