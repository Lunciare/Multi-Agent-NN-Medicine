to the chromatids Several nonhistone proteins are also major components at the centromeres, where the paired chromatids are still of chromosomes, functioning as chromosomal structural bound to each other. The tubules then pull one chromatid proteins and, in connection with the genetic regulatory of each pair toward one cellular pole and its partner to- machinery, as activators, inhibitors, and enzymes. ward the opposite pole. Replication of the chromosomes in their entirety occurs Metaphase. During the metaphase stage (see Figure during the next few minutes after replication of the DNA 3-14E), the two asters of the mitotic apparatus are pushed helixes has been completed; the new DNA helixes collect farther apart. This pushing is believed to occur because new protein molecules as needed. The two newly formed the microtubular spines from the two asters, where they chromosomes remain attached to each other (until time interdigitate with each other to form the mitotic spindle, 43 UNIT I UNIT I Introduction to Physiology: The Cell and General Physiology push each other away.

Some of these growth factors circulate ecules called “molecular motors,” which may be composed in the blood, but others originate in adjacent tissues.
