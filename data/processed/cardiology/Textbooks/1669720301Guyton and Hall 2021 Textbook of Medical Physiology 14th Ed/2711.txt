Note that the areas of maximum excitation ders of specific lengths, by specific angulated shapes, or occur along the sharp borders of the visual pattern. Thus, by images that have other characteristics. That is, these the visual signal in the primary visual cortex is concerned neurons detect still higher orders of information from the mainly with contrasts in the visual scene, rather than with visual scene. Thus, as one goes farther into the analytical noncontrasting areas. We noted in Chapter 51 that this is pathway of the visual cortex, progressively more charac- also true of most of the retinal ganglion because equally teristics of each visual scene are deciphered. 656 CHAPTER 52 The Eye: III.
