Fortunately, the vasomotor center usually does bolic factor occurring in shock. not fail in the early stages of shock if the arterial pressure Among the damaging cellular effects that are known to remains above 30 mm Hg. occur in most body tissues are the following: 1. Active transport of sodium and potassium through Blockage of Very Small Vessels by Sludged Blood. In the cell membrane is greatly diminished. As a re- time, blockage occurs in many of the very small blood sult, sodium and chloride accumulate in the cells, vessels in the circulatory system, and this blockage also and potassium is lost from the cells. In addition, the causes the shock to progress. The initiating cause of cells begin to swell. this blockage is sluggish blood flow in the microvessels. Because tissue metabolism continues despite the low flow, large amounts of acid, both carbonic acid and lac- tic acid, continue to empty into the local blood vessels
