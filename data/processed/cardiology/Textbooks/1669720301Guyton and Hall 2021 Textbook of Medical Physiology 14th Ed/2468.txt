output neuron sends a collateral nerve fiber back to its own dendrites or soma to restimulate itself. Although the importance of this type of circuit is not clear, theo- retically, once the neuron discharges, the feedback stimuli Facilitated could keep the neuron discharging for a protracted time thereafter. Figure 47- 14B shows a few additional neurons in the Normal feedback circuit, which causes a longer delay between initial discharge and the feedback signal. Figure 47- 14C Inhibited shows a more complex system in which both facilitatory and inhibitory fibers impinge on the reverberating circuit.
