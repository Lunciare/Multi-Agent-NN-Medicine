Activates one or more transcription intracellular enzymes Proteins and Specific cellular structural changes chemical activators Figure 46- 7. The second messenger system whereby a transmitter substance from an initial neuron can activate a second neuron by first caus- ing a transformational change in the receptor that releases the activated alpha (α) subunit of the G protein into the second neuron’s cytoplasm. Four subsequent possible effects of the G protein are shown, including the following: 1, opening an ion channel in the membrane of the second neuron; 2, activating an enzyme system in the neuron’s membrane; 3, activating an intracellular enzyme system; and/or 4, causing gene tran- scription in the second neuron. Return of the G protein to the inactive state occurs when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound to the α subunit is hydrolyzed to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and the β and γ subunits are reattached to the α subunit. The cation channels that conduct sodium ions are “Second Messenger” System in the Postsynaptic lined with negative charges. These charges attract the Neuron. Many functions of the nervous system—for positively charged sodium ions into the channel when the example, the process of memory—require prolonged channel diameter increases to a size larger than
