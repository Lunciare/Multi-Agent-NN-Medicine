Figure 48- 5), play important roles in deciphering deeper meanings of the sensory information in the somatosen- Moderate stimulus sory areas. Therefore, these areas are called somatosen- sory association areas. Electrical stimulation in a somatosensory association area can occasionally cause an awake person to experi- Weak ence a complex body sensation, sometimes even the “feel- stimulus ing” of an object such as a knife or a ball. Therefore, it seems clear that the somatosensory association area combines information arriving from multiple points in the primary somatosensory area to decipher its meaning. Cortex This occurrence also fits with the anatomical arrangement of the neuronal tracts that enter the somatosensory asso- ciation area because it receives signals from the following: (1) somatosensory area I; (2) the ventrobasal nuclei of the thalamus; (3) other areas of the thalamus; (4) the visual Thalamus cortex; and (5) the auditory cortex. Amorphosynthesis Effect of Removing the Soma- tosensory Association Area. When the somatosensory association area is removed on one side of the brain, the Dorsal column nuclei person loses the ability to recognize complex objects and complex forms felt on the opposite side of the body. In addition, the person loses most of the sense of
