When ACTH and glucocorticoids HC O C (CH ) CH are secreted in excessive amounts for long periods, as oc- 216 3 curs in the endocrine condition called Cushing’s syndrome, O fats are frequently mobilized to such a great extent that H C O P O CH CH N+H ketosis results.

Growth hormone has an effect simi- OH lar to but weaker than that of ACTH and glucocorticoids A cephalin in activating hormone- sensitive lipase. Therefore, growth hormone can also have a mild ketogenic effect.
