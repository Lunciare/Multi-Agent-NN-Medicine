this carrier wave system allows a Continuous Signal Output From Some decrease in signal intensity, as well as an increase, whereas Neuronal Circuits up to this point, the types of information transmission we Some neuronal circuits emit output signals continuously, have discussed have been mainly positive information even without excitatory input signals. At least two mech- rather than negative information. This type of informa- anisms can cause this effect: (1) continuous intrinsic neu- tion transmission is used by the autonomic nervous sys- ronal discharge; and (2) continuous reverberatory signals. tem to control such functions as vascular tone, gut tone, degree of constriction of the iris in the eye, and heart rate.
