type of vision based on rod vision and a the existence of many types of amacrine cells that secrete new type of vision based on cone vision. The neurons and at least eight types of transmitter substances, including nerve fibers that conduct the visual signals for cone vision gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, dopamine, are considerably larger than those that conduct the visual acetylcholine, and indolamine, all of which normally func- signals for rod vision, and the signals are conducted to the tion as inhibitory transmitters. The transmitters of the 647 UNIT X UNIT X The Nervous System: B. The Special Senses bipolar, horizontal, and interplexiform cells are unclear, but at least some of the horizontal cells release inhibitory transmitters. Transmission of Most Signals Occurs in the Retinal Neurons by Electrotonic Conduction, Not by Action Light beam Potentials. The only retinal neurons that always transmit visual signals via action potentials are the ganglion cells, and they send their signals all the way to the brain through Excited area the optic nerve. Occasionally, action potentials have also been recorded in amacrine cells, although the importance of these action potentials is questionable. Otherwise, all Neither excited the retinal neurons conduct their visual
