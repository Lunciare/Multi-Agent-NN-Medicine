Determine the momentary pumping ability of the minutes, the cardiac output returns almost to normal. heart, and depict this ability in the form of a cardiac output curve. Effect of Sympathetic Stimulation on Cardiac Output. 2. Determine the momentary state of flow from the Sympathetic stimulation affects the heart and systemic systemic circulation into the heart, and depict this circulation: (1) it makes the heart a stronger pump; and (2) state of flow in the form of a venous return curve. in the systemic circulation, it increases the Psf because of 3. Equate these curves against each other, as shown in contraction of the peripheral vessels, especially the veins, Figure 20- 15. and it increases the resistance to venous return. Two curves in the figure depict the normal cardiac out- In Figure 20- 16, the normal cardiac output and put curve (red line) and the normal venous return curve venous return curves are depicted; these equate with (blue line). There is only one point on the graph, point A, each other at point A, which represents a normal venous at which the venous return equals the cardiac
