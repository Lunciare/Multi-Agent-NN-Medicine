turbinate and even over a small portion of the upper surface of the middle turbinate. The olfac- tory membrane has a total surface area of about 5 square centimeters in humans. Olfactory Cells Are the Receptor Cells for Smell Sen- sation. The olfactory cells (see Figure 53- 3) are actually bipolar nerve cells derived originally from the central nervous system. There are about 100 million of these cells in the olfactory epithelium interspersed among sus- Extracellular side Adenyl tentacular cells, as shown in Figure 54- 3. The mucosal Odorant cyclase end of the olfactory cell forms a knob from which 4 to Odorant Na+ receptor 25 olfactory hairs (also called olfactory cilia), measuring 0.3 micrometer in diameter and up to 200 micrometers in length, project into the mucus that coats the inner surface of the nasal cavity. These projecting olfactory cilia form a dense mat in the mucus, and it is these cilia that react to odors in the air and stimulate the olfactory cells, as dis- cussed later. Spaced among the olfactory cells in the olfac- γ α tory membrane are many small Bowman glands that se- β Na+ crete mucus onto the surface of the olfactory membrane. G-protein
