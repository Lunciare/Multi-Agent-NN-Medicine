The mechanism of this hormone itself with 84 amino acids, and it is finally pack- action of vitamin D is not fully understood but is believed aged in secretory granules in the cytoplasm of the cells. The to result from the effect of 1,25-d ihydroxycholecalciferol final hormone has a molecular weight of about 9500. Small- to increase calcium transport through cellular mem- er compounds with as few as 34 amino acids adjacent to the N terminus of the molecule have also been isolated from branes. the parathyroid glands that exhibit full PTH activity. In fact, Vitamin D in smaller quantities promotes bone calcifi- because the kidneys rapidly remove the whole 84–amino cation. One of the ways it promotes this calcification is to acid hormone within minutes but fail to remove many of increase calcium and phosphate absorption from the intes- the fragments for hours, a large share of the hormonal ac- tines. However, even in the absence of such an increase, tivity is caused by the fragments. it enhances the mineralization of bone. Here again, the 999 UNIT XIV UNIT XIV
