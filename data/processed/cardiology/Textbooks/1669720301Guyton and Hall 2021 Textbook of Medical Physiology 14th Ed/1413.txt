The most important of the second- hormone (ADH) greatly increases the water permeability ary active transport processes for chloride reabsorption in the distal and collecting tubules. involves the co- transport of chloride with sodium across Thus, water movement across the tubular epithelium the luminal membrane. can occur only if the membrane is permeable to water, no Urea is also passively reabsorbed from the tubule, matter how large the osmotic gradient. In the proximal but to a much lesser extent than chloride ions. As water tubule and descending loop of Henle, water permeability is reabsorbed from the tubules (by osmosis coupled to is always high, and water is rapidly reabsorbed to reach sodium reabsorption), urea concentration in the tubu- osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial lar lumen increases (see Figure 28- 5).

However, urea does not permeate the tubule luminal and basolateral membranes. In the ascending as readily as water. In some parts of the nephron, espe- loop of Henle, water permeability is always low, so
