Pressure Venous pressure can be measured easily by inserting a needle directly into a vein and connecting it to a pressure Natural reference recorder. The only means whereby right atrial pressure can point be measured accurately is by inserting a catheter through the peripheral veins and into the right atrium. Pressures Figure 15-12. Reference point for circulatory pressure measurement measured through such central venous catheters are often (located near the tricuspid valve). used in some types of hospitalized cardiac patients to provide a constant assessment of the heart- pumping ability. circulation, as discussed in Chapter 18. These signals, in Pressure Reference Level for Measuring Venous and Other Circulatory Pressures Although we have spoken of turn, elicit nerve signals from the brain and spinal cord, mainly through sympathetic nerves to the veins, causing right atrial pressure as being 0 mm Hg and arterial pressure them to constrict. This process takes up much of the slack as being 100 mm Hg, we have not stated the gravitational level in the circulatory system to which this pressure is in the circulatory system caused by the lost blood. Even referred. There is one point in the circulatory system at which after as much as
