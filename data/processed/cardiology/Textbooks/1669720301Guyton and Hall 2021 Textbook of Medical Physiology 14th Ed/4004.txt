They have additional effects on protein and fat metabolism that are equally as important to body function as their effects on carbohydrate metabolism. More than 30 steroids have been isolated from the Zona glomerulosa adrenal cortex, but two are of exceptional importance to aldosterone the normal endocrine function of the human body: aldo- sterone, which is the principal mineralocorticoid, and cor- Zona fasciculata Cortisol tisol, which is the principal glucocorticoid. and androgens Zona reticularis SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF ADRENOCORTICAL HORMONES Medulla (catecholamines) Cortex THE ADRENAL CORTEX HAS THREE DIS- TINCT LAYERS Figure 78- 1 shows that the adrenal cortex is composed of three relatively distinct layers: 1. The zona glomerulosa, a thin layer of cells that lies just underneath the capsule, constitutes about 15% Magnified section of the adrenal cortex. These cells are the only ones in the adrenal gland capable of secreting significant amounts of aldosterone because they contain the Figure 78- 1. Secretion of adrenocortical hormones by the different zones of the adrenal cortex and secretion of catecholamines by the enzyme aldosterone synthase, which is
