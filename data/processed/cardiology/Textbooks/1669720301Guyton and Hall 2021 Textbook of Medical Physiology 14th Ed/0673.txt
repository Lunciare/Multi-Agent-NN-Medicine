a small distance, and reflected wave is received back onto the crystal and greatly amplified by the electronic apparatus. Another portion of the portion in the center of the vessel has moved a long the electronic apparatus determines the frequency difference distance. This effect is called the parabolic profile for between the transmitted wave and the reflected wave, thus velocity of blood flow. determining the velocity of blood flow. As long as the diam- The cause of the parabolic profile is as follows. The eter of a blood vessel does not change, changes in blood flow fluid molecules touching the wall move slowly because in the vessel are directly related to changes in flow velocity. of adherence to the vessel wall. The next layer of mol- Like the electromagnetic flowmeter, the ultrasonic ecules slips over these, the third layer over the second, Doppler flowmeter is capable of recording rapid pulsatile the fourth layer over the third, and so forth. Therefore, changes in flow, as well as steady flow. the fluid in the middle of the vessel can move rapidly because many layers of slipping molecules exist between Laminar Flow of Blood in Vessels. When blood flows at the middle of
