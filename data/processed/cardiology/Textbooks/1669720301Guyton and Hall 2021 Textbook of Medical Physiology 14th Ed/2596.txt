give the same point focus as that spherical lens that converges parallel light rays to a focal obtained with a single spherical convex lens. point 1 meter beyond the lens has a refractive power of +1 diopter, as shown in Figure 50-8 . If the lens is capable of bending parallel light rays twice as much as a lens with a power of +1 diopter, it is said to have a strength of +2 diopters, and the light rays come to a focal point 0.5 me- ter beyond the lens. A lens capable of converging parallel light rays to a focal point only 10 centimeters (0.10 meter) beyond the lens has a refractive power of +10 diopters. The refractive power of concave lenses cannot be stated in terms of the focal distance beyond the lens because the light rays diverge rather than focus to a point. However, if a concave lens diverges light rays at the same rate that a 1-d iopter convex lens converges them, the concave lens is said to have a dioptric Light from distant source strength of −1. Likewise, if the concave lens diverges light rays as much as a +10-d iopter lens converges them, this
