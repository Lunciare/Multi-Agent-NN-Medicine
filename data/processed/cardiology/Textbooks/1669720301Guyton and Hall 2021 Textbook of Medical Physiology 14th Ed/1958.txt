There are fetalis, the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh six common types of Rh antigens, each of which is called positive. The baby has inherited the Rh- positive antigen an Rh factor. These types are designated C, D, E, c, d, and from the father, and the mother develops anti-R h aggluti- e. A person who has a C antigen does not have the c anti- nins from exposure to the fetus’s Rh antigen. In turn, the gen, but the person missing the C antigen always has the mother’s agglutinins diffuse through the placenta into the c antigen. The same is true for the D-d and E-e antigens. fetus and cause RBC agglutination.
