This sensa- lary crest are projected into the cupula. The kinocilia of tion automatically causes the person to lean forward until these hair cells are all oriented in the same direction in the the resulting anterior shift of the statoconia exactly equals cupula, and bending the cupula in that direction causes the tendency for the statoconia to fall backward because of depolarization of the hair cells, whereas bending it in the the acceleration. At this point, the nervous system senses a opposite direction hyperpolarizes the cells. Then, from state of proper equilibrium and leans the body forward no the hair cells, appropriate signals are sent via the vestibu- farther. Thus, the maculae operate to maintain equilibrium lar nerve to apprise the central nervous system of a change during linear acceleration in exactly the same manner as they in rotation of the head and the rate of change in each of operate during static equilibrium. the three
