To prevent accu- mulation of excess fluid in these spaces would require 68 Almost all tissues of the body have special lymph chan- times the normal flow of fluid into the lymphatic system, an nels that drain excess fluid directly from the interstitial amount that is 2 to 5 times too much for the lymphatics to spaces. The exceptions include the superficial portions carry away. As a result, fluid will begin to accumulate in the of the skin, central nervous system, endomysium of mus- interstitial spaces and edema will result. cles, and bones. However, even these tissues have minute Conversely, if the capillary pressure falls very low, net interstitial channels called prelymphatics through which reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries will occur instead interstitial fluid can flow; this fluid eventually empties of net filtration, and the blood volume will increase at the into lymphatic vessels or, in the case of the brain, into expense of the interstitial fluid volume. These effects of the cerebrospinal fluid and then directly back into the imbalance at the capillary membrane in relationship to blood. the development of the different types of edema are dis- Essentially all the lymph vessels
