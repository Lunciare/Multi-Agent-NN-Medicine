Also, the circuitry for the two systems is slightly different. To the right in Figure 51- 12 is the visual pathway from the foveal portion of the retina, representing the new, fast cone system. This illustration shows three neurons in the direct pathway: (1) cones; (2) bipolar cells; and (3) gan- glion cells. In addition, horizontal cells transmit inhibitory signals laterally in the outer plexiform layer, and amacrine cells
