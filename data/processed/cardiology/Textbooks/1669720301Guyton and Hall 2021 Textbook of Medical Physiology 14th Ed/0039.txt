These proteins can be divided into structure that can survive for months or years, provided two types, structural proteins and functional proteins. its surrounding fluids contain appropriate nutrients. Cells Structural proteins are present in the cell mainly in the are the building blocks of the body, providing structure form of long filaments that are polymers of many indi- for the body’s tissues and organs, ingesting nutrients and vidual protein molecules. A prominent use of such intra- converting them to energy, and performing specialized cellular filaments is to form microtubules, which provide functions. Cells also contain the
