Coronary arteries. Most of the coronary venous blood flow from the In response to the changes in both the venous return left ventricular muscle returns to the right atrium of the curve and cardiac output curve, the new equilibrium heart by way of the coronary sinus, which is about 75% of point in Figure 21- 2 for cardiac output and right atrial the total coronary blood flow. On the other hand, most pressure is now point B, in contrast to the normal level at of the coronary venous blood from the right ventricu- point A. Note especially that the right atrial pressure has lar muscle returns through small anterior cardiac veins hardly changed, having risen only 1.5 mm Hg. In fact, in a that flow directly into the right atrium, not by way of the person with a strong heart, the right atrial pressure often coronary sinus. A very small amount of coronary venous falls below normal during very heavy exercise because blood also flows back into the heart through very minute of the greatly increased sympathetic stimulation of the thebesian veins, which empty directly into all chambers heart. In contrast, even a moderate level of exercise may of the
