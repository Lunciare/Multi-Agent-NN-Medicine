a protein molecule is formed, a process called translation. Thus, the ribo- some reads the codons of the mRNA in much the same mRNA way that a tape is read as it passes through the playback RISC-miRNA head of a tape recorder. Then, when a “stop” (or “chain- complex terminating”) codon slips past the ribosome, the end of a protein molecule is signaled, and the protein molecule is freed into the cytoplasm. mRNA degradation Translational repression Polyribosomes. A single mRNA molecule can form Figure 3-10.
