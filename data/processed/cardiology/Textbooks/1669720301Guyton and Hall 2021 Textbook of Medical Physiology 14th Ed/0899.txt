excess volume, thus edly increased urine output as the pressure rises. This returning the pressure back toward normal. increased urinary output is the phenomenon of pressure In the phylogenetic history of animal development, this diuresis. The curve in this figure is called a renal urinary renal–body fluid system for pressure control is a primitive output curve or a renal function curve. In humans, at an one. It is fully operative in one of the lowest of vertebrates, arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg, the urine output is essen- the hagfish. This animal has a low arterial pressure, only 8 tially zero. At 100 mm Hg, it is normal and, at 200 mm to 14 mm Hg, and this pressure increases almost directly Hg, it is 4 to 6 times normal. Furthermore, not only does in proportion to its blood volume. The hagfish continually increasing the arterial pressure increase urine volume drinks sea water, which is absorbed into its blood, increas- output, but it also causes an approximately equal increase ing the blood volume and blood pressure. However, when in sodium output, which is the phenomenon of pressure the pressure rises too high, the kidney excretes the excess natriuresis. volume into
