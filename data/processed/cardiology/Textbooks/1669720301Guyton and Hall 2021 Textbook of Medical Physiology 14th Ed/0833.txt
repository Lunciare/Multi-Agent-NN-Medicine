or Blood Pressure Vascular growth and remodeling are critical compo- Outward nents of tissue development and growth and occur as an remodeling adaptive response to long- term changes in blood pres- sure or blood flow. For example, after several months of chronic exercise training, vascularity of the trained muscles increases to accommodate their higher blood flow requirements. In addition to changes in capillary density, there may also be changes in the structure of Outward large blood vessels in response to long- term changes hypertrophic in blood pressure and blood flow. When blood pres- remodeling sure is chronically elevated above normal, for example, the large and small arteries and arterioles remodel to accommodate the increased mechanical wall stress of Figure 17- 8. Vascular remodeling in response to a chronic increase the higher blood pressure. In most tissues, the small in blood pressure or blood flow. In small arteries and arterioles that arteries and arterioles rapidly respond (within sec- constrict in response to increased blood pressure, inward eutrophic onds) to increased arterial pressure with vasoconstric- remodeling typically occurs because the lumen diameter is smaller and the vascular wall is thicker, but the total cross- sectional area of tion, which helps autoregulate tissue
