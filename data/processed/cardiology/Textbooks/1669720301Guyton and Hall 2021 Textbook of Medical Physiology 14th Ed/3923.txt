dopamine, and serotonin, each of which is released by a different neuronal system in the hypothalamus, all increase the rate of GH secretion. 20 Most of the control of GH secretion is probably medi- ated through GHRH rather than through the inhibitory hormone somatostatin. GHRH stimulates GH secretion 10 by attaching to specific cell membrane receptors on the outer surfaces of the GH cells in the pituitary gland. The receptors activate the adenylyl cyclase system inside the 0 cell membrane, increasing the intracellular level of cyclic Protein Carbohydrate Protein Protein adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
