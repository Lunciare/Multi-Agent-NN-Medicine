II constricts the efferent arterioles, which in turn, stimulates movement of an intracellular protein, has two effects on peritubular capillary dynamics called aquaporin- 2 (AQP- 2), to the luminal side of the cell that increase sodium and water reabsorption. First, membranes. The molecules of AQP- 2 cluster together and efferent arteriolar constriction reduces peritubular fuse with the cell membrane by exocytosis to form water capillary hydrostatic pressure, which increases net channels that permit rapid diffusion of water through the tubular reabsorption, especially from the proximal cells. There are other aquaporins, AQP- 3 and AQP- 4, in tubules. Second, efferent arteriolar constriction, by the basolateral side of the cell membrane that provide a reducing renal blood flow, raises filtration fraction path for water to exit the cells rapidly, although these aqua- in the glomerulus and increases the concentration of porins are not regulated by ADH. Chronic increases in proteins and colloid osmotic pressure in the peritu- ADH levels also increase the formation of AQP- 2 protein bular capillaries. This mechanism also increases the in the renal tubular cells by stimulating AQP-2 gene tran- reabsorptive force at the peritubular capillaries and scription. When the concentration of ADH decreases, the raises tubular reabsorption
