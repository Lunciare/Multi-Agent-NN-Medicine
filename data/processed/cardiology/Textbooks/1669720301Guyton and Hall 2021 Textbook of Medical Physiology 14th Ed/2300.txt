2 when breathing air (see Table 44- 1). ACCLIMATIZATION TO LOW Po2 The red curve of Figure 44- 1 shows arterial blood hemoglobin O saturation at different altitudes when A person remaining at high altitudes for days, weeks, or 2 a person is breathing pure O . Note that the saturation years becomes more and more acclimatized to the low 2 remains above 90% until the aviator ascends to about Po , so it causes fewer deleterious effects on the body. 2 39,000 feet; then it falls rapidly to about 50% at about After acclimatization, it becomes possible for the person 47,000 feet. to work harder without hypoxic effects or to ascend to still higher altitudes. The “Ceiling” When Breathing Air and When Breath- The principal means whereby acclimatization comes ing Oxygen in an Unpressurized Airplane. When about are as follows: (1) a great increase in pulmonary comparing the two arterial blood O saturation curves ventilation; (2) increased numbers of red blood cells; (3) 2 in Figure 44- 1, one notes that an aviator breathing pure increased diffusing capacity of the lungs; (4) increased O in an unpressurized airplane can ascend to far higher vascularity of the peripheral tissues; and
