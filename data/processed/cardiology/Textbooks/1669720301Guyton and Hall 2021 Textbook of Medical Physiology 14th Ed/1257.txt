Solutions of sodium chloride with a concen- ant solute (one that will not permeate the cell membrane), tration of less than 0.9% are hypotonic and cause cells to about 19.3 mm Hg of osmotic pressure is exerted across swell. the cell membrane. If the cell membrane is exposed to If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution having a higher pure water, and the osmolarity of intracellular fluid is 282 concentration of impermeant solutes, water will flow out mOsm/L, the potential osmotic pressure that can develop of the cell into the extracellular fluid, concentrating the across the cell membrane is more than 5400 mm Hg. This intracellular fluid and diluting the extracellular fluid. In demonstrates the large force that can move water across this case, the cell will shrink until the two concentrations the cell membrane when the intracellular and extracellu- become equal. Sodium chloride solutions of more than lar fluids are not in osmotic equilibrium. As a result of 0.9% are hypertonic. these forces, relatively small changes in the
