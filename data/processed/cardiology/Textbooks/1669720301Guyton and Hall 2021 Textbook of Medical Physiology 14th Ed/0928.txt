Artificial Kidney Days Figure 19- 8. Progressive changes in important circulatory system When a patient is maintained with an artificial kidney, variables during the first few weeks of volume- loading hypertension. it is especially important to keep the patient’s body fluid Note especially the initial increase in cardiac output as the basic cause volume at a normal level by removing the appropriate of the hypertension. Subsequently, the autoregulation mechanism amount of water and salt each time the patient undergoes returns the cardiac output almost to normal while simultaneously dialysis. If this step is not performed, and extracellular causing a secondary increase in total peripheral resistance. (Modified from Guyton AC: Arterial Pressure and Hypertension. Philadelphia: fluid volume is allowed to increase, hypertension almost WB Saunders, 1980.) invariably develops in exactly the same way as shown 235 latoT ralullecartxE doolB larehpirep lairetrA emulov diulf emulov tuptuo caidraC ecnatsiser erusserp )sretil( )sretil( )nim/L( )nim/L/gH mm( )gH mm( UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation in Figure 19- 8.
