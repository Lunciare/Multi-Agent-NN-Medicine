A myopic person has a definite limit- ing “far point” for clear vision. Correction of Myopia and Hyperopia Through Use of Lenses. If the refractive surfaces of the eye have too much refractive power, as in myopia, this excessive refractive power can be neutralized by placing a concave spherical lens in front of the eye, which will diverge rays. Such cor- rection is shown in the upper diagram of Figure 50- 13. Conversely, in a person who has hyperopia—that is, someone who has too weak a lens system—the abnormal vision can be corrected by adding refractive power using a convex lens in front of the eye. This correction is demon- strated in the lower diagram of Figure 50- 13. One usually determines the strength of the concave or Figure 50- 13. Correction of myopia with a concave lens (top) and convex lens needed for clear vision by “trial and error”— correction of hyperopia with a convex lens (bottom). that is, by first trying a strong lens and then a stronger or weaker lens until the one that gives the best visual acuity Point source is found. of light Astigmatism. Astigmatism is a refractive error of the eye that causes the
