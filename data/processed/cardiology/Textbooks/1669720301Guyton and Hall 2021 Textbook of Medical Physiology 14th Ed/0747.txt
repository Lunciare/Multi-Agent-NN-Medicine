smooth muscle fiber usually encircles the edges of the endothelial cells, they usually represent no capillary. This structure is called the precapillary sphinc- more than 1/1000 of the total surface area of the capillary ter. This sphincter can open and close the entrance to the wall. Nevertheless, the rate of thermal motion of water capillary. molecules, as well as most water- soluble ions and small The venules are larger than the arterioles and have solutes, is so rapid that all these substances diffuse with a much weaker muscular coat. Yet, the pressure in the ease between the interior and exterior of the capillaries venules is much less than that in the arterioles, so the through these slit pores, the intercellular clefts. 193 UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation Arteriole Venule Intercellular cleft Basement membrane Precapillary sphincters Capillaries Caveolae (Plasmalemmal vesicles) Vesicular Endothelial channel?? cell Caveolin Smooth muscle cells Phospholipid Sphingolipid Cholesterol Metarteriole Figure 16- 2.
