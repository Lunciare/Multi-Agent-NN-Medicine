In heart failure, the heart teins and often allowing large quantities of these proteins fails to pump blood normally from the veins into the ar- to pass into the urine. When this loss exceeds the ability teries, which raises venous and capillary pressures, caus- of the body to synthesize proteins, a reduction in plasma ing increased capillary filtration. In addition, the arterial protein concentration occurs. Serious generalized edema pressure tends to fall, causing decreased excretion of salt occurs when the plasma protein concentration falls below and water by the kidneys, which causes still more edema. 2.5 g/100 ml. Also, blood flow to the kidneys is reduced in persons with Cirrhosis of the liver is another condition that reduces heart failure, and this reduced blood flow stimulates se- plasma protein concentration. Cirrhosis means the devel- cretion of renin, causing increased formation of angioten- opment of large amounts of fibrous tissue among the liver sin II and aldosterone, which both cause additional salt parenchymal cells. One result is failure of these cells to and water retention by the kidneys. In advanced heart produce sufficient plasma
