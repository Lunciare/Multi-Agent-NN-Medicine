of RBC production. This result well as from other studies, it has been determined that is especially apparent in prolonged cardiac failure and in the important effect of erythropoietin is to stimulate many lung diseases because the tissue hypoxia resulting production of proerythroblasts from hematopoietic from these conditions increases RBC production, with a stem cells in the bone marrow. In addition, once the resultant increase in hematocrit and, usually, total blood proerythroblasts are formed, the erythropoietin causes volume. these cells to pass more rapidly through the different erythroblastic stages than they normally do, further Hypoxia Increases Formation of Erythropoietin Which speeding up the production of new RBCs. The rapid Stimulates Red Blood Cell Production. The principal production of cells continues as long as the person re- stimulus for RBC production in a low oxygen state is a mains in a low oxygen state or until enough RBCs have circulating hormone called erythropoietin, a glycoprotein been produced to carry adequate amounts of oxygen with a molecular weight of about 34,000. In the absence to the tissues despite the low level of oxygen; at this of erythropoietin, hypoxia has little or no effect to stimu- time, the rate of erythropoietin production decreases
