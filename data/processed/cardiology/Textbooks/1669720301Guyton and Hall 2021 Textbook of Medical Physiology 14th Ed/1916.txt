It also obeys the thermodynamic mass action law: Figure 35- 5 shows antibodies (designated by the red Y- shaped bars) reacting with antigens (designated by the k =Concentrationofboundantibody‐antigen shaded objects). Because of the bivalent nature of the an- a Concentrationofantibody tibodies and the multiple antigen sites on most invading × Concentrationofantigen agents, the antibodies can inactivate the invading agent in one of several ways, as follows: K is called the affinity constant and is a measure of how a 1.
