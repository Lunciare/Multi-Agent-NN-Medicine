liter instead of 2 liters, the normal negative Bled 1 liter feedback mechanisms for controlling cardiac output and 3 arterial pressure can counterbalance the positive feedback and the person can recover, as shown by the dashed curve Bled 2 liters of Figure 1-4. 2 Positive Feedback Can Sometimes Be Useful. The body 1 sometimes uses positive feedback to its advantage. Blood clotting is an example of a valuable use of positive feed- Death back. When a blood vessel is ruptured, and a clot begins to 0 form, multiple enzymes called clotting factors are activated 1 2 3 within the clot. Some of these enzymes act on other inac- Hours tivated enzymes of the immediately adjacent blood, thus Figure 1-4. Recovery of heart pumping caused by negative feedback causing more blood clotting. This process continues until after 1 liter of blood is removed from the circulation. Death is caused by positive feedback when 2 liters or more blood is removed. the hole in the vessel is plugged and bleeding no longer occurs. On occasion, this mechanism can get out of hand for control of arterial pressure is −50 divided by +25, or and cause formation of unwanted clots. In fact, this
