These neurons are results from a slight decrease in sodium chloride concen- believed to function as temperature sensors for control- tration in the extracellular fluid and plasma.

Loss of Heat by Panting 110 Many animals have little ability to lose heat from the sur- faces of their bodies, for two reasons: (1) the surfaces are 100 often covered with fur, and (2) the skin of most animals is not supplied with sweat glands, which prevents most of the 90 evaporative loss of heat from the skin. A substitute mecha- nism, the panting mechanism, is used by many animals as a means of dissipating heat. 80 The phenomenon of panting is “turned on” by the ther- moregulator centers of
