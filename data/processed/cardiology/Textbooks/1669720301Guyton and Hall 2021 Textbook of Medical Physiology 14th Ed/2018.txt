As 486 Chapter 37 Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation discussed previously, this enzyme converts the inactive, polymerized into glucose or metabolized directly for oxidized form of vitamin K to its active, reduced form. energy. Consequently, 500 milliliters of blood that has By inhibiting VKORC1, warfarin decreases the avail- been rendered noncoagulable by citrate can ordinarily be able active form of vitamin K in the tissues.

However, if the liver is damaged, or boxylated and are biologically inactive. Over several days, if large quantities of citrated blood or plasma are given the body stores of the active coagulation factors degrade too rapidly (within fractions of a minute), the citrate ion and are replaced by inactive factors.
