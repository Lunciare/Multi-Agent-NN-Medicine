Then, on expiration, the air cannot go back into DIVING the tank but, instead, is expired into the water. The most important problem with SCUBA is the lim- Before the 1940s, almost all diving was done using a diving ited amount of time a diver can remain beneath the water helmet connected to a hose through which air was pumped surface; For example, only a few minutes are possible at to the diver from the surface. Then, in 1943, the French a 200- foot depth. The reason for this limitation is that explorer Jacques Cousteau popularized a self- contained tremendous airflow from the tanks is required to wash underwater breathing apparatus, known as SCUBA. The CO out of the lungs—the greater the depth, the greater 2 type of SCUBA used in more than 99% of all sports and the airflow in terms of quantity of air per minute required
