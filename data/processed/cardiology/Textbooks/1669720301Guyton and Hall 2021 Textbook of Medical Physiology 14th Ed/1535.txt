3%. As discussed in Chapter 25, these variables must Plasma ADH be precisely controlled because they determine the distri- bution of fluid between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. H O permeability in 2 distal tubules, Estimating Plasma Osmolarity From collecting ducts Plasma Sodium Concentration In most clinical laboratories, plasma osmolarity is not routinely measured. However, because sodium and its H O reabsorption 2 associated anions account for about 94% of the solute in the extracellular compartment, plasma osmolarity (P ) osm can be roughly estimated from the plasma sodium con- centration (P +) as follows: H 2O excreted Na P osm=2.1×P Na+(mmol/L) Figure 29-9. Osmoreceptor- antidiuretic hormone (ADH) feedback mechanism for regulating extracellular fluid osmolarity in response For example, with a plasma sodium concentration of to a water deficit. 142 mEq/L, the plasma osmolarity would be estimated from this formula to be about 298 mOsm/L. To be more OSMORECEPTOR- ADH FEEDBACK exact, especially in conditions associated with renal dis- SYSTEM ease, the contribution of the plasma concentrations (in units of mmol/L) of two other solutes, glucose and urea, Figure 29-9 shows the basic components of the are usually included: osmoreceptor- ADH feedback system for control of extra- P osm=2× [P
