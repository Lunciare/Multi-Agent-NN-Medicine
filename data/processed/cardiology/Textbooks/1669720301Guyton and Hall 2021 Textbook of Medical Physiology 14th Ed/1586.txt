hydrogen ion concentration (alkalosis) increases Fractional proximal Aldosterone GFR tubular Na+ potassium secretion. The primary mechanism whereby reabsorption increased hydrogen ion concentration inhibits potassium secretion is by reducing activity of the Na+- K+ ATPase pump. This reduction in turn decreases intracellular po- Distal tubular tassium concentration and subsequent passive diffusion flow rate of potassium across the luminal membrane into the tu- bule. Acidosis may also reduce the number of potassium channels in the luminal membrane. − K+ secretion + With more prolonged acidosis, lasting over a period Cortical collecting of several days, there is an increase in urinary potas- ducts sium excretion. The mechanism for this effect is due in part to an effect of chronic acidosis to inhibit proxi- mal tubular sodium chloride and water reabsorption, Unchanged K+ which increases distal volume delivery, thereby stimu- excretion lating potassium secretion. This effect overrides the Figure 30-10. Effect of high sodium intake on renal excretion of inhibitory effect of hydrogen ions on the Na+-K + ATPase potassium. Note that a high- sodium diet decreases plasma aldos- pump. Thus, chronic acidosis leads to a loss of potassium, terone, which tends to decrease potassium secretion by the corti- whereas acute acidosis leads to
