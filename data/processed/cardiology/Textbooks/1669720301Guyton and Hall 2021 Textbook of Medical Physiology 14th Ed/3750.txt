This Currency” in Metabolism expenditure provides a total of 48,000 calories of energy, Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins can all be used by cells far more than the 500 to 5000 calories eventually stored in to synthesize large quantities of adenosine triphosphate each of the peptide linkages. (ATP), which is used as an energy source for almost all other ATP energy is also used for synthesizing glucose from cellular functions. For this reason, ATP has been called an lactic acid and for synthesizing fatty acids from acetyl co- energy “currency” in cell metabolism. Indeed, the transfer enzyme A. In addition, ATP energy is used for the synthe- of energy from foodstuffs to most functional systems of the sis of cholesterol, phospholipids, the hormones, and almost cells can be performed only through this medium of ATP all other substances of the body. Even the urea excreted by (or the similar nucleotide guanosine triphosphate [GTP]). the kidneys requires ATP for its formation from ammonia. Many of the attributes of ATP are presented in Chapter 2. One might wonder why energy is expended to form urea, An attribute of ATP that makes it highly valuable as which is simply discarded by the body. However,
