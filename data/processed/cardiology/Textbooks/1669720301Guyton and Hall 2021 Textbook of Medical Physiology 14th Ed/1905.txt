In the case of the B lymphocytes, each of these has on its cell surface mem- brane about 100,000 antibody molecules that will react highly specifically with only one type of antigen. There- Different B Cells fore, when the appropriate antigen comes along, it imme- (clones) diately attaches to the antibody in the cell membrane; this leads to the activation process, described in more detail B B B 1 2 3 subsequently. In the case of the T lymphocytes, molecules similar to antibodies, called surface receptor proteins (or T- cell receptors), are on the surface of the T-c ell mem- brane, and these are also highly specific for one specified Antigen binding to activating antigen. An antigen therefore stimulates only specific B 2 cell Antigens those cells that have complementary receptors for the antigen and are already committed to respond to it. Role of Macrophages in the Activation Process. Aside B 2 from the lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue, literally mil- lions of macrophages are also present in the same tissue.
