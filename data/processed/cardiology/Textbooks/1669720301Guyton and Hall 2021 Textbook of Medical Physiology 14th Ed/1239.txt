in a 70-k g man. The two largest compartments of the extracellular Na+ Ca2+ Cl− fluid are the interstitial fluid, which makes up more than 0 K+ Mg2+ three-fourths (11 liters) of the extracellular fluid, and the plasma, which makes up almost one-fourth of the extra- 50 cellular fluid, or about 3 liters. The plasma is the noncellu- lar part of the blood; it exchanges substances continuously with the interstitial fluid through the pores of the capillary 100 membranes. These pores are highly permeable to almost all solutes in the extracellular fluid, except the proteins. Therefore, the extracellular fluids are constantly mixing, 150 so the plasma and interstitial fluids have about the same composition, except for proteins, which have a higher Figure 25- 2. Major cations and anions of the intracellular and ex- tracellular fluids. The concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ represent the concentration in the plasma. sum of these two ions. The concentrations shown represent the total of free ions and complexed ions. BLOOD VOLUME Blood contains extracellular fluid (the fluid in plasma) and intracellular fluid (the fluid in the red blood cells). How- ever, blood is considered to be a separate fluid compart- ment because it is contained
