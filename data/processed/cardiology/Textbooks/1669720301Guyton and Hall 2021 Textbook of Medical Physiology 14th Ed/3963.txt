enter the cell membrane by a carrier- mediated 4 3 adenosine triphosphate–dependent transport process. Much of the T is deiodinated to form T , which interacts with the thyroid hormone 4 3 receptor, bound as a heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor, of the thyroid hormone response element of the gene. This action causes either increases or decreases in transcription of genes that lead to the formation of proteins, thus producing the thyroid hormone response of the cell. The actions of thyroid hormone on cells of several different systems are shown. BMR, Basal metabolic rate; CNS, central nervous system; mRNA, messenger ribonucleic acid; Na+- K+- ATPase, sodium–potassium–adenosine triphosphatase. heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) at specific Thyroid hormones also appear to have nongenomic cel- thyroid hormone response elements on the DNA. After lular effects that are independent of their effects on gene binding with thyroid hormone, the receptors become transcription. For example, some effects of thyroid hor- activated and initiate the transcription process. Large mones occur within minutes, too rapidly to be explained numbers of different types of messenger RNA are then by changes in protein synthesis, and are not affected by formed, followed within another few minutes or hours
