In addition, the sympathetic likrein, which is present in the blood and tissue fluids in nerves to the adrenal medullae cause these glands to an inactive form. This inactive kallikrein is activated by 214 Chapter 17 Local and Humoral Control of Tissue Blood Flow maceration of the blood, tissue inflammation, or other 4.
