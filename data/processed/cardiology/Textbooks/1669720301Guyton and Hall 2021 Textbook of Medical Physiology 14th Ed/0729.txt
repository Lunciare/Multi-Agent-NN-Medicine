This pressure results from Hg pressure in the veins of the hand. the weight of the water and therefore is called gravita- The neck veins of a person standing upright collapse tional pressure or hydrostatic pressure. almost completely all the way to the skull because of 189 UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation atmospheric pressure on the outside of the neck. This Deep vein collapse causes the pressure in these veins to remain at zero along their entire extent. Any tendency for the pres- Perforating sure to rise above this level opens the veins and allows the vein pressure to fall back to zero because of flow of the blood. Conversely, any tendency for the neck vein pressure to fall Superficial below zero collapses the veins still more, which further vein increases their resistance and again returns the pressure back to zero. The veins inside the skull, on the other hand, are in a chamber (the skull cavity) that cannot collapse. Conse- quently, negative pressure can exist in the dural sinuses Valve of the head; in the standing position, the venous pressure in the sagittal sinus at the top of the brain is about −10
