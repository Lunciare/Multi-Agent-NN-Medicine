Other factors that control growth hormone secretion are described in Table 76- 3. Enhancement of Amino Acid Transport Through the Cell Membranes. GH directly enhances transport of most amino acids through cell membranes to the interior of the cells. This increases amino acid concentrations in Table 76- 3 Factors That Stimulate or Inhibit Secretion the cells and
