Therefore, the rhythm of contraction potentials of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle and of the body of the stomach, the duodenum, and the il- those of nerve fibers is the manner in which they are 788 )stlovillim( laitnetop enarbmeM Chapter 63 General Principles of Gastrointestinal Function—Motility, Nervous Control, and Blood Circulation generated. In nerve fibers, the action potentials are Tonic Contraction of Some Gastrointestinal Smooth caused almost entirely by rapid entry of sodium ions Muscle. Some smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract through sodium channels to the interior of the fibers. exhibits tonic contraction as well as, or instead of, rhythmic In gastrointestinal smooth muscle fibers, the channels contractions. Tonic contraction is continuous; it is not asso- responsible for the action potentials are somewhat dif- ciated with the basic electrical rhythm of the slow waves but ferent; they allow especially large numbers of calcium often lasts several minutes or even hours.
