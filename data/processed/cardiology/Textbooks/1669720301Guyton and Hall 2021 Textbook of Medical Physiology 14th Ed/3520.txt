The next stage in the degradation of glucose is a two- one specific protein enzyme. Note that glucose is first step conversion of the two pyruvic acid molecules converted into fructose- 1,6-d iphosphate and then split (shown in Figure 68-5 ) into two molecules of acetyl 846 Chapter 68 Metabolism of Carbohydrates and Formation of Adenosine Triphosphate coenzyme A (acetyl- CoA), in accordance with the fol- O C COOH CH 3 CO CoA (Acetyl coenzyme A) lowing reaction: HC COOH 2 O (Oxaloacetic acid) H O CoA 2 H C COOH 2CH C COOH + 2CoA SH 2 3 (Pyruvic acid) (Coenzyme A) HOC COOH H C COOH 2 O (Citric acid) H O 2 H C COOH 2 2CH 3 C S CoA + 2CO 2 + 4H C COOH (Acetyl-CoA) HC COOH (cis-Aconitic acid) Two carbon dioxide molecules and four hydrogen atoms H O 2 are released from this reaction, while the remaining portions H C COOH 2 of the two pyruvic acid molecules combine with coenzyme A, HC COOH a derivative of the vitamin pantothenic acid, to form two mol- ecules of acetyl- CoA. In this conversion, no ATP is formed, HOC COOH but up to six
