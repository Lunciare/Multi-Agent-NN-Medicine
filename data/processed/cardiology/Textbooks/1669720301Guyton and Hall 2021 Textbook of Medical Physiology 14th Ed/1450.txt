Hg, there is a positive hydrostatic pressure peritubular capillary reabsorption rate. Because filtration gradient from the peritubular capillary to the interstitial fraction is defined as the ratio of GFR/RPF, an increased fluid of about 7 mm Hg, which opposes fluid reabsorption. filtration fraction can occur as a result of increased GFR This opposition to fluid reabsorption is more than coun- or decreased RPF. Some renal vasoconstrictors, such as terbalanced by the colloid osmotic pressures that favor angiotensin II, increase peritubular capillary reabsorption reabsorption. The plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which by decreasing RPF and increasing filtration fraction, as favors reabsorption, is about 32 mm Hg, and the colloid discussed later. osmotic pressure of the interstitium, which opposes reab- Changes in the peritubular capillary K can also influ- f sorption, is 15 mm Hg, causing a net colloid osmotic force ence the reabsorption rate because K is a measure of the f of about 17 mm Hg, favoring reabsorption.

Increases tracting the net hydrostatic forces that oppose reabsorption in K raise reabsorption, whereas decreases in K lower f f (7 mm Hg) from the net colloid osmotic forces that favor peritubular capillary reabsorption.
