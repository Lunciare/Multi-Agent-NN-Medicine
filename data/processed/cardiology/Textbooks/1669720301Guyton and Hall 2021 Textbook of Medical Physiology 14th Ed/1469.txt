this substance is also excreted into the sodium and water by the renal tubules, especially in the urine each minute, then 1 ml/min of the plasma is cleared collecting ducts. ANP also inhibits renin secretion and of the substance. Clearance refers to the volume of plasma therefore angiotensin II formation, which in turn reduces that would be necessary to supply the amount of substance renal tubular reabsorption. This decreased sodium and excreted in the urine per unit of time. Stated mathematically: water reabsorption increases urinary excretion, which C s×P s=U s×V helps return the blood volume back toward normal. where C is the clearance rate of a substance s, P is ANP levels are greatly elevated in congestive heart fail- s s the plasma concentration of the substance, U is the ure when the cardiac atria are stretched because of impaired s urine concentration of that substance, and V is the urine pumping of the ventricles. The increased ANP level helps flow rate. Rearranging this equation, clearance can be attenuate sodium and water retention in heart failure. expressed as: U s×V C = Parathyroid Hormone Increases Calcium Reabsorp- s P s tion. Parathyroid hormone is one of the most important
