mm Hg, called the “error,” which means Negative Feedback Nature of Most that the control system is not 100% effective in preventing Control Systems change. The gain of the system is then calculated by using Most control systems of the body act by negative feed- the following formula: Correction back, which can be explained by reviewing some of the Gain = homeostatic control systems mentioned previously. In Error the regulation of carbon dioxide concentration, a high Thus, in the baroreceptor system example, the correc- concentration of carbon dioxide in the extracellular fluid tion is −50 mm Hg, and the error persisting is +25 mm Hg. increases pulmonary ventilation. This, in turn, decreases Therefore, the gain of the person’s baroreceptor system 8 Chapter 1 Functional Organization of the Human Body and Control of the “Internal Environment” 5 overcome by the negative feedback control mechanisms of the body, and the vicious cycle then fails to develop. Return to For example, if the person in the aforementioned example 4 normal bleeds only 1 liter instead of 2 liters, the normal negative Bled 1 liter feedback mechanisms for controlling cardiac output and 3 arterial pressure can counterbalance the positive feedback and the person can
