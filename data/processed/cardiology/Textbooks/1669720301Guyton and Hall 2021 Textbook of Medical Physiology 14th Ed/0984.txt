This means that the normal human heart, For example, the hearts of marathon runners may be in- functioning without any special stimulation, can pump a creased in mass by 50% to 75%. This factor increases the venous return up to about 2.5 times the normal venous plateau level of the cardiac output curve, sometimes 60% to return before the heart becomes a limiting factor in the 100%, and therefore allows the heart to pump much greater control of cardiac output. than the usual amounts of
