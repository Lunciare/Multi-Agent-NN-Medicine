is the following: When the blow is 780 Chapter 62 Cerebral Blood Flow, Cerebrospinal Fluid, and Brain Metabolism struck, the fluid on the struck side is so incompressible that as the skull moves, the fluid pushes the brain at the same time in unison with the skull. On the side opposite to the area that is struck, the sudden movement of the whole skull Artery causes the skull to pull away from the brain momentarily because of the brain’s inertia, creating for a split second a Ependyma vacuum space in the cranial vault in the area opposite to the Vein blow. Then, when the skull is no longer being accelerated by the blow, the vacuum suddenly collapses and the brain strikes the inner surface of the skull. Taenia The poles and the inferior surfaces of the frontal and fornicis temporal lobes, where the brain comes into contact with bony protuberances in the base of the skull, are often the Tela sites of injury and contusions (bruises) after a severe blow choroidea to the head, such as that experienced by a boxer. If the con- tusion occurs on the same side as the impact injury, it is a Taenia choroidea coup
