exchange of gases through the membrane is 516 Chapter 40 Principles of Gas Exchange; Diffusion of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Through the Respiratory Membrane substantially impeded, even under resting conditions, and 1300 Resting during competitive sports and other strenuous exercise, 1200 Exercise even the slightest decrease in surface area of the lungs can 1100 be a serious detriment to respiratory exchange of gases. The diffusion coefficient for transfer of each gas through 1000 the respiratory membrane depends on the gas’s solubility 900 in the membrane and, inversely, on the square root of the gas’s molecular weight. The rate of diffusion in the respira- 800 tory membrane is almost exactly the same as that in water, 700 for reasons explained earlier. Therefore, for a given pres- sure difference, CO diffuses about 20 times as rapidly as 600 2 O . Oxygen diffuses about twice as rapidly as nitrogen. 2 500 The pressure difference across the respiratory membrane is the difference between the partial pressure of the gas in 400 the alveoli and the partial pressure of the gas in the pul- 300 monary capillary blood. Therefore, the difference between these two pressures is a measure of the net tendency for the
