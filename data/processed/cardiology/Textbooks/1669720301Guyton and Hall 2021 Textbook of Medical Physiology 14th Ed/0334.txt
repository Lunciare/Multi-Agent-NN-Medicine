amounts of 73. Therefore, phosphocreatine is instantly cleaved, and its maintenance heat are released during contraction, even though little or no work is performed, thereby decreasing released energy causes bonding of a new phosphate ion to 86 )ces/mc( noitcartnoc fo yticoleV Chapter 6 Contraction of Skeletal Muscle the conversion efficiency to as little as zero. Conversely, if Isotonic contraction contraction is too rapid, much of the energy is used to over- come viscous friction within the muscle itself, and this too reduces the efficiency of contraction. Ordinarily, maximum efficiency occurs when the velocity of contraction is about Muscle 30% of maximum. Contracts CHARACTERISTICS OF WHOLE MUSCLE CONTRACTION Relaxes Many features of muscle contraction can be demonstrated Weight by eliciting single muscle twitches. This can be accom- plished by electrical excitation of the nerve to a muscle or by passing a short electrical stimulus through the muscle Weight itself, giving rise to a single sudden contraction lasting a fraction of a second. Isometric contraction Isometric Contractions Do Not Shorten Muscle, Whereas Isotonic Contractions Shorten Muscle at a Constant Tension. Muscle contraction is said to be iso- Muscle metric when the muscle does not shorten during contrac- Contracts tion and isotonic when
