SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF THE Fate of Ingested Iodides. Iodides ingested orally are THYROID METABOLIC HORMONES absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood in about the same manner as chlorides. Normally, most of About 93% of the metabolically active hormones secreted the iodides are rapidly excreted by the kidneys, but only by the thyroid gland is thyroxine and 7% is triiodothy- after about one fifth are selectively removed from the cir- ronine. However, almost all the thyroxine is eventually culating blood by the cells of the thyroid gland and used converted to triiodothyronine in the tissues, so both
