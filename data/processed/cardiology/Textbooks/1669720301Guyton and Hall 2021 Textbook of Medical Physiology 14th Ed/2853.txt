This reflex is entire- ly inhibitory. Thus, this reflex provides a negative feedback Excess mechanism that prevents the development of too much tension tension on the muscle. Spinal cord When tension on the muscle—and therefore on the Sensory nerve tendon—becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect from fiber (16 mm) the tendon organ can be so great that it leads to a sud- den reaction in the spinal cord that causes instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle. This effect is called the Inhibitory lengthening reaction; it is probably a protective mecha- interneuron nism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the Muscle tendon from its attachments to the bone. Possible Role of the Tendon Reflex to Equalize Contractile Force Among the Muscle Fibers. Another Anterior motor likely function of the Golgi tendon reflex is to equalize neuron inhibited contractile forces of the separate muscle fibers. That is, the fibers that exert excess tension become inhibited by
