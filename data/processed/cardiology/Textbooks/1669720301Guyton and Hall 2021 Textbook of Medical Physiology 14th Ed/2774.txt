a crude manner to sounds. However, it does greatly reduce or sometimes even abolish the animal’s ability to discriminate different sound pitches and espe- cially patterns of sound. For example, an animal that has Association Primary been trained to recognize a combination or sequence of tones, one following the other in a particular pattern, los- es this ability when the auditory cortex is destroyed; fur- thermore, the animal cannot relearn this type of response. Therefore, the auditory cortex is especially important in the discrimination of tonal and sequential sound patterns. Destruction of both primary auditory cortices in the Association human being greatly reduces one’s sensitivity for hear- Primary ing. Destruction of one side only slightly reduces hearing in the opposite ear; it does not cause deafness in the ear because of many crossover connections from side to side in the auditory neural pathway. However, it does affect one’s ability to localize the source of a sound because comparative signals in both cortices are required for sound localization. Figure 53- 10. Auditory cortex. Lesions that affect the auditory association areas but not the primary auditory cortex do not decrease a per- sudden onset of sounds, or perhaps special modulations, son’s ability
