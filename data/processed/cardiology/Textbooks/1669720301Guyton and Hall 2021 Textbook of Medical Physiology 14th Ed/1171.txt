even though the results in the same dynamic effects as aortic valve stenosis left atrial pressure is rising. caused by other valvular lesions, namely, cardiac hyper- As the left atrial pressure rises, blood begins to dam up trophy, heart muscle ischemia, reduced cardiac output, in the lungs, eventually all the way back to the pulmonary and a tendency to develop serious pulmonary edema. artery. In addition, incipient edema of the lungs causes Another type of congenital stenosis is coarctation of the pulmonary arteriolar constriction. These two effects aorta, often occurring above the level of the diaphragm. This together increase systolic pulmonary arterial pressure stenosis causes the arterial pressure in the upper part of the and also right ventricular pressure, sometimes to as high body (above the level of the coarctation) to be much greater as 60 mm Hg, which is more than double normal. This than the pressure in the lower body because of the great increased pressure, in turn, causes hypertrophy of the resistance to blood flow through the coarctation to the lower right side of the heart, which partially compensates for its body; part of the blood must go around the coarctation increased workload. through small collateral arteries,
