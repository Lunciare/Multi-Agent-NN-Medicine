The shaded areas represent the net sodium retention or net sodium loss, determined by the difference between sodium intake in the body to cause death within a few days unless clinical and sodium excretion. interventions such as hemodialysis are initiated to restore, at least partially, the body fluid and electrolyte balances. other electrolytes, such as chloride, potassium, calcium, hydrogen, magnesium, and phosphate ions. In the next PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE few chapters, we discuss the specific mechanisms that KIDNEYS permit the kidneys to perform these amazing feats of homeostasis. GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE KIDNEYS AND URINARY TRACT Regulation of Arterial Pressure. As discussed in Chapter 19, the kidneys play a dominant role in long- The two kidneys lie on the posterior wall of the abdo- term regulation of arterial pressure by
