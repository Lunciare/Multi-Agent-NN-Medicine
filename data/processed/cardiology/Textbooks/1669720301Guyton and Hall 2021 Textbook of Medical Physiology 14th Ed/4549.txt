In this disease, the following dilation caused by the direct effects of increased muscle mechanisms occur: (1) chronic bronchitis, (2) obstruction metabolism, as explained in Chapter 21.

In persons with severe emphysema, of which is probably the moderate increase in arterial blood as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be pressure that occurs in exercise, which is usually about a destroyed; then even the slightest exercise can cause res- 30% increase. The increase in pressure not only forces more piratory distress.
