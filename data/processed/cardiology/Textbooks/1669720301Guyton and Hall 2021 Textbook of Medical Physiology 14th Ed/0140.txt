vary from gene to gene to give rise each chromosome, the DNA is wound around small to the different expression patterns of genes in different proteins called histones, which in turn are held tissues. tightly together in a compacted state by still other Transcription of genes in eukaryotes is also influenced proteins. As long as the DNA is in this compacted by enhancers, which are regions of DNA that can bind state, it cannot function to form RNA. However, transcription factors. Enhancers can be located a great multiple control mechanisms are being discovered distance from the gene they act on or even on a differ- that can cause selected areas of chromosomes to ent chromosome. They can also be located upstream or become decompacted one part at a time, so that downstream of the gene that they regulate. Although partial RNA transcription can occur. Even then, enhancers may be located far from their target gene, they specific transcriptor factors control the actual rate may be relatively close when DNA is coiled in the nucleus. of transcription by the promoter in the chromo- It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 gene some.
