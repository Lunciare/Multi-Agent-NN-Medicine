than for maintaining cardiac output. They output first and later the arterial pressure, both of which increase the arterial pressure mainly by increasing the to- tal peripheral resistance, which has no beneficial effect on cardiac output. However, the sympathetic constriction of the veins is important to keep venous return and cardiac Arterial output from falling too much, in addition to their role in 100 pressure maintaining arterial pressure. Especially interesting is the second plateau occur- ring at about 50 mm Hg in the arterial pressure curve of 50 Cardiac Figure 24- 1. This second plateau results from activation output of the central nervous system ischemic response, which causes extreme stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system when the brain begins to experience lack of oxy- 0 gen or excess buildup of carbon dioxide, as discussed in 0 10 20 30 40 50 Chapter 18. This effect of the central nervous system isch- % of total blood removed emic response can be called the “last- ditch stand” of the Figure 24- 1 Effect of hemorrhage on cardiac output and arterial sympathetic reflexes in their attempt to keep the arterial pressure. pressure from falling too low. 294 dna tuptuo caidraC erusserp lairetra )lamron
