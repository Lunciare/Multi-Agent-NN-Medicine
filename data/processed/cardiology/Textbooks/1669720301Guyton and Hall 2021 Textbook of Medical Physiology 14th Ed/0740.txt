as part of a cleansing system for the blood, acting in concert with a similar system of reticulo- Pulp endothelial cells in the venous sinuses of the liver. When the blood is invaded by infectious agents, the reticuloendothelial Capillaries cells of the spleen rapidly remove substances such as debris, bacteria, and parasites. Also, in many chronic infections, Venous sinuses the spleen enlarges in the same manner as lymph nodes and then performs its cleansing function even more avidly.
