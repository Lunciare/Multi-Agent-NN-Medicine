To summarize, constriction of afferent arterioles and the arterial- venous extraction of oxygen is relatively reduces GFR. However, the effect of efferent arteriolar low compared with that of most other tissues. constriction depends on the severity of the constriction; A large fraction of the oxygen consumed by the kid- modest efferent constriction raises GFR, but severe effer- neys is related to the high rate of active sodium reabsorp- ent constriction (more than a threefold increase in resis- tion by the renal tubules.
