Also, because of the obstruction of the airways, and this value decreases to only 47%. In persons with serious because they collapse more easily than normal airways, the airway obstruction, as often occurs with acute asthma, maximum expiratory flow rate is greatly reduced. this value can decrease to less than 20%. The classic disease that causes severe airway obstruc- tion is asthma. Serious airway obstruction also occurs in PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SPECIFIC some stages of emphysema.
