and Resistance RESISTANCE TO BLOOD FLOW d = 1 1 ml/min Units of Resistance. Resistance is the impediment to P = d = 2 blood flow in a vessel, but it cannot be measured by any 100 mm 16 ml/min Hg direct means. Instead, resistance must be calculated from d = 4 256 ml/min measurements of blood flow and pressure difference be- A tween two points in the vessel. If the pressure difference between two points is 1 mm Hg and the flow is 1 ml/sec, the resistance is said to be 1 peripheral resistance unit, usually abbreviated PRU. Small vessel Expression of Resistance in CGS Units. Occasionally, a basic physical unit called the CGS (centimeters, grams, seconds) unit is used to express resistance. This unit is B Large vessel dyne sec/cm5. Resistance in these units can be calculated Figure 14-8. A, Demonstration of the effect of vessel diameter on by the following formula: blood flow.
