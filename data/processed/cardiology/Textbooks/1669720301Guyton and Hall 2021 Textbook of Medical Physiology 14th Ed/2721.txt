Washington, DC: trained to move by means of several successive saccades American Physiological Society, 1960.) across the visual scene to extract the important informa- tion. Similar saccades occur when a person observes a To summarize, posterior “involuntary” occipital corti- painting, except that the saccades occur in upward, side- cal eye fields automatically “lock” the eyes on a given spot ways, downward, and angulated directions one after an- of the visual field and thereby prevent movement of the other from one highlight of the painting to another, and image across the retinas. To unlock this visual fixation, so forth. voluntary signals must be transmitted from cortical “vol- untary” eye fields located in the frontal cortices. Fixation on Moving Objects—“Pursuit Movement.” The eyes can also remain fixed on a moving object, which Mechanism of Involuntary Locking Fixation—Role is called pursuit movement.

The involuntary locking mechanism automatically detects the course of move- type of fixation discussed in the previous section re- ment of an object and then rapidly develops a similar sults from a negative feedback mechanism that pre- course of movement for the eyes.
