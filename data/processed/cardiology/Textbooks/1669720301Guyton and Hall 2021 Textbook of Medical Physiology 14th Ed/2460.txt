Therefore, Figure 47-9 is a schematic diagram of several neurons this is said to be the discharge zone of the incoming fiber, in a neuronal pool, showing input fibers to the left and also called the excited zone or liminal zone. To each side, “output” fibers to the right. Each input fiber divides the neurons are facilitated but not excited; these areas are hundreds to thousands of times, providing a thousand called the facilitated zone, also called the subthreshold or more terminal fibrils that spread into a large area in zone or subliminal zone. the pool to synapse with dendrites or cell bodies of the Inhibition of a Neuronal Pool.
