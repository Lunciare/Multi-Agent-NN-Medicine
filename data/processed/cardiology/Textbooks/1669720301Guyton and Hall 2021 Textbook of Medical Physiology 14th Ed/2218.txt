These reactions are shown in Figure 42- 2. DIRECT CONTROL OF RESPIRATORY Why does blood CO 2 have a more potent effect in CENTER ACTIVITY BY CO AND H+ stimulating the chemosensitive neurons than blood H+? 2 The answer is that the blood–b rain barrier is not very Chemosensitive Area of the Respiratory Center Be- permeable to H+, but CO passes through this barrier 2 neath the Medulla’s Ventral Surface.
