oating phagocytic vesicle (also called 451 UNIT VI UNIT VI Blood Cells, Immunity, and Blood Coagulation Microbe Both neutrophils and macrophages contain an abun- Antibodies dance of lysosomes filled with proteolytic enzymes espe- cially geared for digesting bacteria and other foreign protein matter. The lysosomes of macrophages (but not of neutrophils) also contain large amounts of lipases, which PHAGOCYTOSIS digest the thick lipid membranes possessed by some bac- teria, such as the tuberculosis bacillus. Receptors Neutrophils and Macrophages Can Kill Bacteria. Pseudopod Phagosome In addition to the digestion of ingested bacteria in phago- somes, neutrophils and macrophages contain bactericidal agents that kill most bacteria, even when the lysosomal enzymes fail to digest them. This characteristic is espe- Lysosome cially important because some bacteria have protective coats or other factors that prevent their destruction by Phagolysosome digestive enzymes. Much of the killing effect results from several powerful oxidizing agents formed by enzymes in EXOCYTOSIS the membrane of the phagosome or by a special organelle called the peroxisome. These oxidizing agents include Digestion large quantities of superoxide (O 2−), hydrogen peroxide of microbe (H O ), and hydroxyl ions (OH−), which are lethal to most 2 2 bacteria, even in small quantities.
