diseases that result from autoimmunity body. have been described and include: (1) rheumatic fever, in which the body becomes immunized against tissues Regulatory T Cells in the joints and heart, especially the heart valves, after Much less is known about the regulatory T cells than exposure to a specific type of streptococcal toxin that about the others, but they are capable of suppressing has an epitope in its molecular structure similar to the the functions of both cytotoxic and T- helper cells. These structure of some of the body’s own self- antigens; (2) suppressor functions of the CD4+ regulatory T cells one type of glomerulonephritis, in which the person are believed to prevent the cytotoxic cells from causing becomes immunized against the basement membranes excessive immune reactions that might damage the body’s of glomeruli; (3) myasthenia gravis, in which immunity own tissues. It is probable that the suppressor T-c ell sys- develops against the acetylcholine receptor proteins of tem plays an important role in limiting the ability of the the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis; (4) mul- immune system to attack a person’s own body tissues, tiple sclerosis (MS), in which the immune system attacks called immune tolerance, as discussed in
