9 parts of the ventricles. that cardiac muscle has three main types of membrane ion channels that play important roles in causing the voltage SINUS (SINOATRIAL) NODE changes of the action potential. They are (1) fast sodium channels, (2) calcium channels (particularly L- type or The sinus node is a small, flattened, ellipsoid strip of spe- “slow” calcium channels), and (3) potassium channels (see cialized cardiac muscle about 3 mm wide, 15 mm long, Figure 9- 5). 127 UNIT III UNIT III The Heart for more than a few milliseconds, the inactivation gates on the inside of the cell membrane that close the fast sodium channels become closed and remain so. There- fore, only the slow sodium-c alcium channels can open (i.e., can become activated) and thereby cause the action potential. As a result, the atrial nodal action potential is Sinus A-V bundle slower to develop than the action potential of the ventric- node ular muscle. Also, after the action potential does occur, return of the potential to its negative state occurs slowly Internodal Left as well, rather than the abrupt return that occurs for the pathways bundle ventricular fiber. branch A-V node Leakiness of Sinus Nodal Fibers to Sodium
