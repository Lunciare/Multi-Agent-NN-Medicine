2. Transmission of both fast-s harp and slow- chronic pain few fibers also terminate in the posterior nuclear group of signals into and through the spinal cord on their way to the brain. the thalamus. From these thalamic areas, the signals are Aδ fibers transmit fast- sharp pain, and C fibers transmit slow- chronic transmitted to other basal areas of the brain, as well as to pain. the somatosensory cortex. The Nervous System Can Localize Fast Pain in the To somatosensory areas Body. The fast- sharp type of pain can be localized much more exactly in the different parts of the body than can slow- chronic pain. However, when only pain Thalamus receptors are stimulated, without the simultaneous stimulation of tactile receptors, even fast pain may be poorly localized, often only within 10 centimeters or Ventrobasal complex and Intralaminar so of the stimulated area. Yet, when tactile receptors posterior nuclei that excite the dorsal column–medial lemniscal system nuclear are simultaneously stimulated, the localization can be group Slow pain nearly exact. Fast pain fibers fibers Glutamate, the Probable Neurotransmitter of the Reticular Type Aδ Fast Pain Fibers. It is believed that glutamate formation is the neurotransmitter substance secreted in the spinal
