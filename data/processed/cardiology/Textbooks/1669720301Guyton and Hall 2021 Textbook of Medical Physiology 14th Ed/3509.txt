In liver cells, appropriate enzymes are available to pro- Glucose Transport Through Cell Membranes mote interconversions among the monosaccharides—glu- cose, fructose, and galactose—as shown in Figure 68-3 . Before glucose can be used by the body’s tissue cells, it must Furthermore, the dynamics of the reactions are such that be transported through the cell membrane into the cellular when the liver releases monosaccharides back into the cytoplasm. However, glucose cannot easily diffuse through blood, the final product is almost entirely glucose.
