Note that the events described in Figure 22- 5 are the Thus, decompensation results from the fact that the same as those presented in Figure 22- 1, although in a cardiac output curve never rises to the critical level of 5 more quantitative manner. L/min needed to re- establish the normal renal excretion of fluid required to result in a balance between fluid input Graphic Analysis of Decompensated and output. Cardiac Failure The black cardiac output curve in Figure 22- 6 is the same Treatment of Decompensated Heart Disease With as the curve shown in Figure 22- 2—a greatly depressed Digitalis. Assume that the stage of decompensation has curve that has already reached a degree of recovery as already reached point E in Figure 22- 6, and then proceed much as this heart can achieve. In this figure, we have to the same point E in Figure 22- 7. At this time, digitalis is added venous return curves that occur during successive given to strengthen the heart. This intervention raises the days after the acute fall of the cardiac output curve to this cardiac
