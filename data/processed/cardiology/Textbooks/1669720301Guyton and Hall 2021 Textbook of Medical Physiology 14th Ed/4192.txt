This figure shows 3 concentration of 25-h ydroxycholecalciferol. This figure shows that in- that a slight decrease in calcium concentration below normal causes creases in vitamin D intake, up to 2.5 times normal, have little effect on increased formation of activated vitamin D, which in turn leads to the final quantity of activated vitamin D that is formed. Deficiency of greatly increased absorption of calcium from the intestine. activated vitamin D occurs only at very low levels of vitamin D intake. the 25-h ydroxycholecalciferol has a feedback inhibitory concentration of calcium in the plasma.
