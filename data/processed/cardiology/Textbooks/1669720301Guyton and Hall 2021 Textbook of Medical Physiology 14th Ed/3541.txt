NADH + H+ 3 multiple cellular synthetic processes. (Pyruvic acid) Release of Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen by the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Figure 68-8 shows most OH of the basic chemical reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway. It demonstrates that glucose, during several stages CH C COOH + NAD+ of conversion, can release one molecule of carbon dioxide 3 and four atoms of hydrogen, with the resultant formation of a five- carbon sugar, d- ribulose. This substance can change H progressively into several other five-, four-, seven- , and (Lactic acid) three- carbon sugars. Finally, various combinations of these Thus, under anaerobic conditions, the major portion of sugars can resynthesize glucose. However, only five mol- the pyruvic acid is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses ecules of glucose are resynthesized for every six molecules readily out of the cells into the extracellular fluids and even of glucose that initially enter into the reactions. That is, the into the intracellular fluids of other less active cells. There- pentose phosphate pathway is a cyclical process in which fore, lactic acid represents a type of “sinkhole” into which one molecule of glucose is metabolized for each revolution 850 Chapter 68 Metabolism of Carbohydrates and
