Convergence of Signals second output pathway from the pool. This type of Convergence means signals from multiple inputs uniting to circuit is also important in preventing overactivity in excite a single neuron. Figure 47- 12A shows convergence many parts of the brain. 594 Chapter 47 Sensory Receptors, Neuronal Circuits for Processing Information PROLONGATION OF A SIGNAL BY A A NEURONAL POOL—AFTERDISCHARGE Input Output Thus far, we have considered signals that are merely relayed through neuronal pools. However, in many cases, B a signal entering a pool causes a prolonged output dis- Input Output charge, called afterdischarge, lasting a few milliseconds to as long as many minutes after the incoming signal is over. The most important mechanisms whereby afterdischarge occurs are described in the following sections. Facilitation Synaptic Afterdischarge. When excitatory synapses dis- C charge on the surfaces of dendrites or soma of a neuron, Input Output a postsynaptic electrical potential develops in the neuron and lasts for many milliseconds, especially when some of the long-a cting synaptic transmitter substances are involved. As long as this potential lasts, it can continue to excite the neuron, causing it to transmit a continuous train of output impulses, as was explained in Chapter 46.
