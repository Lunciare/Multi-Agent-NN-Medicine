Within about 1 second, another enzyme, rhodopsin rhodopsin of the rods, with a peak at 505 nanometers. kinase, which is always present in the rod, inacti- vates the activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II), AUTOMATIC REGULATION OF RETINAL and the entire cascade reverses back to the normal SENSITIVITY—LIGHT AND DARK state with open sodium channels. ADAPTATION Thus, the rods have developed an important chemi- cal cascade that amplifies the effect of a single photon of If a person has been in bright light for hours, large por- light to cause movement of millions of sodium ions. This tions of the photochemicals in both the rods and the cones mechanism explains the extreme sensitivity of the rods will have been reduced to retinal and opsins. Furthermore, under dark conditions. much of the retinal of both the rods and the cones will The cones are about 30 to 300 times less sensitive than the have been converted into vitamin A. Because of these two rods, but even this degree of sensitivity allows color vision effects, the concentrations of the photosensitive chemicals at any intensity of light greater than extremely dim twilight. remaining in the rods and cones are considerably reduced, and the sensitivity of
