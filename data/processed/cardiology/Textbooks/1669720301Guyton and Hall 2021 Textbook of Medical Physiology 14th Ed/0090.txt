In summary, ATP is readily available to release its energy rapidly wherever it is needed in the cell. To replace Uses of ATP for Cellular Function. Energy from ATP ATP used by the cell, much slower chemical reactions is used to promote three major categories of cellular break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and use the functions: (1) transport of substances through multiple energy derived from these processes to form new ATP. cell membranes; (2) synthesis of chemical compounds More than 95% of this ATP is formed
