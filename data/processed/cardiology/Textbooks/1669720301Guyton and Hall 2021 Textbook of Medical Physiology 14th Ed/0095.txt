At the opposite end of the cell, the receptors pull away from their ligands and form new endocytotic vesicles. CILIA AND CILIARY MOVEMENTS Then, inside the cell, these vesicles stream toward the pseudopodial end of the cell, where they are used to form There are two types of cilia, motile and nonmotile, or pri- new membrane for the pseudopodium. mary, cilia.
