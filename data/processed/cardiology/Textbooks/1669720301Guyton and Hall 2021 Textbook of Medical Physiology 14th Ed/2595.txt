the lens, one can see an image of the object, as demonstrat- ed in Figure 50- 7B. However, this image is upside down B with respect to the original object, and the two lateral sides Point source of light of the image are reversed. The lens of a camera focuses im- ages on film via this method. Point focus Measurement of the Refractive Power of a Lens— Diopter Figure 50-5 . A, Focusing of light from a point source to a line focus The more a lens bends light rays, the greater is its “refrac- by a cylindrical lens. B, Two cylindrical convex lenses at right angles to tive power.” This refractive power is measured in terms each other, demonstrating that one lens converges light rays in one of diopters. The refractive power in diopters of a convex plane, and the other lens converges light rays in the plane at a right lens is equal to 1 meter divided by its focal length. Thus, a angle. The two lenses combined give the same point focus as that spherical lens that converges parallel light rays to a focal obtained with a single spherical convex lens. point 1 meter beyond the lens
