Usually less than 10% of steroid or thyroid membrane hormone- receptor complex; the hormone is hormones in the plasma exist free in solution. For then metabolized in the cell, and the receptors are usually example, more than 99% of the thyroxine in the blood recycled back to the cell membrane. is bound to plasma proteins.
