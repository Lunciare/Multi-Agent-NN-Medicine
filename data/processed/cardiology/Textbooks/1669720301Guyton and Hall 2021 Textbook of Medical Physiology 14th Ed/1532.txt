In either case, large volumes of dilute ml/min and osmolar clearance is 2 ml/min, free water clear- urine are formed, which causes dehydration unless fluid ance would be –1 ml/min. This means that instead of water intake is increased by the same amount as urine volume being cleared from the kidneys in excess of solutes, the kid- is increased. neys are actually returning water to the systemic circulation, Many types of renal diseases can impair the concen- as occurs during water deficits.
