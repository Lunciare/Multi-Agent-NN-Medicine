called the node of Ranvier. the threshold for excitation. Then, suddenly, a new action potential results and the process occurs again and again. Saltatory Conduction in Myelinated Fibers from Node to Node. Even though almost no ions can flow through SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SIGNAL the thick myelin sheaths of myelinated nerves, they can TRANSMISSION IN NERVE TRUNKS flow with ease through the nodes of Ranvier. Therefore, action potentials occur only at the nodes. Yet, the action potentials are conducted from node to node by saltatory Myelinated and Unmyelinated Nerve Fibers. Figure conduction, as shown in Figure 5- 17. That is, electrical 5- 15 shows a cross section of a typical small nerve, re- current flows through the surrounding extracellular fluid vealing many large nerve fibers that constitute most of the outside the myelin sheath, as well as through the axoplasm cross- sectional area. However, a more careful look reveals inside the axon from node to node, exciting successive many more small fibers lying between the large ones. The nodes one after another. Thus, the nerve impulse jumps large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmy- along the fiber, which is the origin of the term saltatory. elinated. The
