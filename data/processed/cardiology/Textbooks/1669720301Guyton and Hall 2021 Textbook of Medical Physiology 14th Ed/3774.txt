For the average diet, the quantity of energy liberated per lit- er of oxygen used in the body averages about 4.825 Calories, which is called the energy equivalent of oxygen. By using performed. For example, walking up stairs requires about this energy equivalent, one can calculate with a high degree 17 times as much energy as lying in bed asleep. In general, of precision the rate of heat liberation in the body from the over a 24-h our period, a person performing heavy labor quantity of oxygen used in a given period. can achieve a maximal rate of energy utilization as great as If a person metabolizes only carbohydrates during the 6000 to 7000 Calories, or as much as 3.5 times the energy period of the metabolic rate determination, the calculated used under conditions of no physical activity. quantity of energy liberated, based on the value for the Basal Metabolic Rate—The Minimum Energy Expendi- average energy equivalent of oxygen (4.825 Calories/L), ture for
