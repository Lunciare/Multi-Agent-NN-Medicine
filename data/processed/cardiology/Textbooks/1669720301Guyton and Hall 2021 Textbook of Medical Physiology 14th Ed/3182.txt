Synthesis of norepinephrine begins in the axoplasm of the terminal nerve endings of adren- HO ergic nerve fibers but is completed inside the secretory vesicles. The basic steps are the following: Hydroxylation HO CH CH 2 NH 2 1. Tyrosine Dopa Decarboxylation OH 2. Dopa Dopamine Norepinephrine 3.

Dopamine Hydroxylation Norepinephrine hibits the cell because loss of electropositive potassium ions creates hypernegativity inside the cell. In some cells, In the adrenal mtexedulla, this reaction goes still one the changed intracellular ion environment will cause an step further to transform about 80% of the norepineph- internal cell action, such as a direct effect of calcium ions rine into epinephrine, as follows: to promote smooth muscle contraction.
