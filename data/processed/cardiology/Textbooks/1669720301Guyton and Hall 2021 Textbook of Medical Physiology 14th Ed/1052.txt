output of the heart under severe conditions may increase 6-fold to 9-fold. PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE At the same time, the coronary blood flow increases CORONARY BLOOD SUPPLY 3-fold to 4-fold to supply the extra nutrients needed by the heart. This increase is not as much as the increase in Figure 21- 3 shows the heart and its coronary blood sup- workload, which means that the ratio of energy expendi- ply. Note that the main coronary arteries lie on the surface ture by the heart to coronary blood flow increases. Thus, of the heart, and smaller arteries then penetrate from the the efficiency of cardiac utilization of energy increases surface into the cardiac muscle mass. It is almost entirely to make up for the relative deficiency of coronary blood through these arteries that the heart receives its nutri- supply. tive blood supply. Only the inner one- tenth millimeter of the endocardial surface can obtain significant nutrition Cardiac Muscle Compression Causes Phasic Changes directly from the blood inside the cardiac chambers, so in Coronary Blood Flow During Systole and Diastole. this source of muscle nutrition is minuscule.
