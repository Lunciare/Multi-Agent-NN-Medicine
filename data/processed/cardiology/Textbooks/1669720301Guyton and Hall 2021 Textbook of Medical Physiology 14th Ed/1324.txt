These pres- sure peaks are called micturition waves in the cystometro- In some people, the distance that the ureter courses gram and are caused by the micturition reflex. through the bladder wall is less than normal, and thus con- traction of the bladder during micturition does not always lead to complete occlusion of the ureter. As a result, some MICTURITION REFLEX of the urine in the bladder is propelled backward into the ureter, a condition called vesicoureteral reflux. Such reflux Referring again to Figure 26- 8, one can see that as the can lead to enlargement of the ureters and, if severe, can bladder fills, many superimposed micturition contractions increase the pressure in the renal calyces and structures of begin to appear, as shown by the
