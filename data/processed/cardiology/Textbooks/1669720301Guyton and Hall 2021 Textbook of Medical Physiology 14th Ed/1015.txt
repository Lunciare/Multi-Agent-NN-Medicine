In the complete circulation, the heart and the systemic in which VR is venous return, Psf is mean systemic filling circulation must operate together. This requirement pressure, PRA is right atrial pressure, and RVR is resis- means that (1) the venous return from the systemic circu- tance to venous return. In the healthy adult, the approxi- lation must equal the cardiac output from the heart and mate values for these are as follows: venous return = 5 (2) the right atrial pressure is the same for the heart and L/min, Psf = 7 mm Hg, right atrial pressure = 0 mm Hg, systemic circulation. and resistance to venous return = 1.4 mm Hg/L/min of Therefore, one can predict the cardiac output and right blood flow. atrial pressure in the following way: 253 )nim/L( nruter suoneV UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation heart and systemic circulation. Therefore, in the normal Normal resistance circulation, the right atrial pressure, cardiac output, and 15 2 (cid:31) resistance venous return are all depicted by point A, called the equi- 1/2 resistance librium point, giving a normal value for cardiac output of 1/3 resistance 5 L/min and a right atrial pressure of 0 mm Hg. 10
