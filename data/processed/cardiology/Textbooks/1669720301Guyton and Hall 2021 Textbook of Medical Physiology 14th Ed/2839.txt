Even spindles can send to the spinal cord either positive signals when the length of a spindle receptor increases only a (increased numbers of impulses to indicate stretch of a fraction of a micrometer for only a fraction of a second, muscle) or negative signals (reduced numbers of impuls- the primary receptor transmits tremendous numbers of es) to indicate that the muscle is unstretched. excess impulses to the large 17-m icrometer sensory nerve MUSCLE STRETCH REFLEX fiber, but only while the length is actually
