The human body has many sizes of when it contracts, but the overall length of the muscle does not change. skeletal muscles—from the small stapedius muscle in the middle ear, measuring only a few millimeters long and 1 Duration of millimeter or so in diameter, up to the large quadriceps depolarization muscle, a half- million times as large as the stapedius. Fur- thermore, the fibers may be as small as 10 micrometers Soleus in diameter or as large as 80 micrometers. Finally, the energetics of muscle contraction vary considerably from one muscle to another. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Gastrocnemius mechanical characteristics of muscle contraction differ among muscles. Ocular muscle Figure 6-13 shows records of isometric contractions of
