cool wa- 3000 ter bath. The rate of heat gain by the water bath, which can be measured with an accurate thermometer, is equal to the Excercise and nonexercise physical rate at which heat is liberated by the subject’s body. activity thermogenesis (32%) 2250 Direct calorimetry is physically difficult to perform and is used only for research purposes. Thermic effect of food (8%) Indirect Calorimetry—The “Energy Equivalent” of Arousal Oxygen. Because more than 95% of the energy expended 1500 in the body is derived from reactions of oxygen with the different foods, the whole- body metabolic rate can also be Resting energy Sleeping expenditure calculated with a high degree of accuracy from the rate of 750 metabolic (60%) oxygen utilization. When 1 liter of oxygen is metabolized rate with glucose, 5.01 Calories of energy are released; when metabolized with starches, 5.06 Calories are released; with fat, 4.70 Calories; and with protein, 4.60 Calories. 0 These figures clearly demonstrate that the quantities of Figure 73- 3. Average daily energy expenditure and components of energy liberated per liter of oxygen consumed are nearly energy usage in a 70- kg person in energy balance and ingesting ap- equivalent when different types of food
