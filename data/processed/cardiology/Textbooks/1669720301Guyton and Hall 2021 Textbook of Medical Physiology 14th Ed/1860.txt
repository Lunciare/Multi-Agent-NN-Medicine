3). blood monocytes, which are immature cells while still in First, most natural structures in the tissues have the blood and have little ability to fight infectious agents smooth surfaces, which resist phagocytosis. However, at that time. However, once they enter the tissues, they if the surface is rough, the likelihood of phagocytosis is begin to swell—sometimes increasing their diameters as increased. much as fivefold—to as great as 60 to 80 micrometers, Second, most natural substances of the body have pro- a size that can barely be seen with the naked eye. These tective protein coats that repel the phagocytes. Conversely, cells are now called macrophages, and they are extremely most dead tissues and foreign particles have no protective capable of combating disease agents in the tissues. coats, which makes them subject to phagocytosis. Third, the immune system of the body (described in White Blood Cells Enter the Tissue Spaces by Diape- Chapter 35) develops antibodies against infectious agents desis. Neutrophils and monocytes can squeeze through such as bacteria. The antibodies then adhere to the bacterial gaps between endothelial cells of the blood capillaries and membranes and thereby make the bacteria especially sus- postcapillary venules by diapedesis.
