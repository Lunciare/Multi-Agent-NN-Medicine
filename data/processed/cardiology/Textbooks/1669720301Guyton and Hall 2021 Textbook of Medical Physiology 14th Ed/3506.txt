This coupling i is accomplished by special cellular enzymes and energy transfer systems, some of which are explained in this and subsequent chapters. Energy utilization “Free Energy.”The amount of energy liberated by com- • Active ion transport • Muscle contraction plete oxidation of a food is called the free energy of food • Synthesis of molecules oxidation and is generally represented by the symbol ΔG. • Cell division and growth Free energy is usually expressed in terms of calories per mole of substance. For example, the amount of free energy Figure 68- 1.
