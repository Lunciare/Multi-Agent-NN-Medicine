cades, and the movements are called opticokinetic move- ments. The saccades occur so rapidly that no more than 10% of the total time is spent moving the eyes, with 90% Voluntary movement to of the time being allocated to the fixation sites. Also, the fixation site brain suppresses the visual image during saccades, so the person is not conscious of the movements from point to point. Figure 52-9 . Movements of a spot of light on the fovea, showing sudden “flicking” eye movements that move the spot back toward Saccadic Movements During Reading. During the the center of the fovea whenever it drifts to the foveal edge. The dashed lines represent slow drifting movements, and the solid lines process of reading, a person usually makes several sac- represent sudden flicking movements.
