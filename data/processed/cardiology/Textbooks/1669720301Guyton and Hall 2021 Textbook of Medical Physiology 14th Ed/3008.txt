By way of review, CEREBRAL CORTEX I The functional part of the cerebral cortex is a thin layer of neurons covering the surface of all the convolutions of the cerebrum. This layer is only 2 to 5 millimeters thick, II with a total area of about 25% of a square meter. The total cerebral cortex has been estimated to contain over 80 bil- lion neurons. Figure 58- 1 shows the typical histological structure of III the neuronal surface of the cerebral cortex, with its suc- cessive layers of different types of neurons. Most of the neurons are of three types: (1) granular (also called stel- late); (2) fusiform; and (3) pyramidal, the latter named for IV their characteristic pyramidal
