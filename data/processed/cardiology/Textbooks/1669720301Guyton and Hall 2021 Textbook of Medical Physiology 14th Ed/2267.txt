Both hypoxia and hypercapnia develop because of hypoventilation of many alveoli plus loss of alveolar walls. The net result of all these effects is severe, prolonged, devastating air hunger that can last for years until the hypoxia and hypercapnia cause death—a high penalty to pay for smoking. PNEUMONIA—LUNG INFLAMMATION AND FLUID IN ALVEOLI The term pneumonia includes any inflammatory condi- tion of the lung in which some or all of the alveoli are filled with fluid and blood cells, as shown in Figure 43- 5. A common type of pneumonia is bacterial
