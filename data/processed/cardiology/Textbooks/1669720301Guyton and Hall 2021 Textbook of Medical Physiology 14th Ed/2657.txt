in a way that “splints” it in the open state. However, in light, hydrolyzation of the cGMP by phosphodies- pigment, green- sensitive pigment, and red- sensitive pig- terase removes the splinting and allows the sodium ment. The absorption characteristics of the pigments in channels to close. Several hundred channels close for the three types of cones show peak absorbencies at light each originally activated molecule of rhodopsin. Be- wavelengths of 445, 535, and 570 nanometers, respectively. cause the sodium flux through each of these channels These wavelengths are also the wavelengths for peak light has been extremely rapid, flow of more than 1 million sensitivity for each type of cone, which begins to explain sodium ions is blocked by the channel closure before how the retina differentiates the colors. The approximate the channel opens again. This diminution of sodium absorption curves for these three pigments are shown in ion flow is what excites the rod, as already discussed. Figure 51- 8. Also shown is the absorption curve for the 5. Within about 1 second, another enzyme, rhodopsin rhodopsin of the rods, with a peak at 505 nanometers. kinase, which is always present in the rod, inacti- vates the activated rhodopsin
