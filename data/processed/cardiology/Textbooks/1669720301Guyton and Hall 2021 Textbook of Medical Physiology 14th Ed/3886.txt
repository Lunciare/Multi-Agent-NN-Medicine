Standard curve for radioimmunoassay of aldosterone. Blood (Courtesy Dr. Manis Smith.) Most hormones are present in the blood in extremely min- ute quantities; some concentrations are as low as one bil- Fourth, to make the assay highly quantitative, the radio- lionth of a milligram (1 picogram) per milliliter. Therefore, immunoassay procedure is also performed for “standard” it was difficult to measure these concentrations by the usual solutions of untagged hormone at several concentration chemical means. However, an extremely sensitive method, levels. Then a “standard curve” is plotted, as shown in Fig- called radioimmunoassay, was developed by Rosalyn Yalow ure 75- 9. By comparing the radioactive counts recorded and Solomon Berson in 1959 and revolutionized the meas- from the “unknown” assay procedures with the standard urement of hormones, their precursors, and their metabolic curve, one can determine within an error of 10% to 15%, end products. More recently, additional methods, such as the concentration of the hormone in the “unknown” as- enzyme-l inked immunosorbent assays, have been developed sayed fluid.
