These laminae are where many of the dorsal root sensory nerve fibers terminate after entering the cord. As shown in Figure 48- 13, the anterolateral fibers cross immediately in the anterior commissure of the cord to the opposite anterior and lateral white columns, where they turn upward toward the brain via the anterior spinotha- lamic and lateral spinothalamic tracts. The upper terminus of the two spinothalamic tracts is mainly twofold: (1) throughout the reticular nuclei of the brain stem; and (2) in two different nuclear complexes of the thalamus, the ventrobasal complex and the intralaminar nu- clei. In general, the tactile signals are transmitted mainly into the ventrobasal complex, terminating in some of the same Figure 48- 13. Anterior and lateral divisions of the anterolateral
