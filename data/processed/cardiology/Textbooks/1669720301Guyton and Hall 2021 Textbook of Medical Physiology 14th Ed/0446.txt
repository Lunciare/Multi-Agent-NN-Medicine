As a result, the contraction ceases until a new the atria into the ventricles. This delay allows the atria action potential comes along. to contract ahead of ventricular contraction, thereby pumping blood into the ventricles before the strong ven- Duration of Contraction. Cardiac muscle begins to con- tricular contraction begins. Thus, the atria act as primer tract a few milliseconds after the action potential begins pumps for the ventricles, and the ventricles in turn 117 UNIT III UNIT III The Heart Isovolumic relaxation Isovolumic Ejection Rapid inflow Atrial systole Diastasis contraction 120 Aortic Aortic valve valve closes 100 opens Aortic pressure 80 60 A-V valve A-V valve 40 closes opens 20 Atrial pressure a c v 0 Ventricular pressure 130 Ventricular volume 90 R Figure 9- 8.
