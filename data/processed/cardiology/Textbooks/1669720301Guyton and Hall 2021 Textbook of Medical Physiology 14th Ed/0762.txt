to force fluid and its dissolved substances through the capillary pores into As discussed later, the NFP is slightly positive under the interstitial spaces. Conversely, osmotic pressure caused normal conditions, resulting in a net filtration of fluid by the plasma proteins (called colloid osmotic pressure) across the capillaries into the interstitial space in most tends to cause fluid movement by osmosis from the inter- organs. The rate of fluid filtration in a tissue is also deter- stitial spaces into the blood. This osmotic pressure exerted mined by the number and size of the pores in each capil- by the plasma proteins normally prevents significant loss of lary, as well as the number of capillaries in which blood is fluid volume from the blood into the interstitial spaces. flowing. These factors are usually expressed together as Also important is the lymphatic system, which returns the capillary filtration coefficient (K). The K is therefore f f to the circulation the small amounts of excess protein and a measure of the capacity of the capillary membranes to fluid that leak from the blood into the interstitial spaces. filter water for a given NFP and is usually expressed as ml/ In the remainder of
