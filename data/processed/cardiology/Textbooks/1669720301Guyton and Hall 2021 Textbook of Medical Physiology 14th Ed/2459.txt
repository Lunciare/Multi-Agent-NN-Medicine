1 also contributes terminals to neurons b and c, but not enough to cause excitation. Nevertheless, discharge of these terminals makes both these neurons more likely to be excited by signals arriving through other Figure 47- 9 Basic organization of a neuronal pool. See text for incoming nerve fibers. Therefore, the stimuli to these details. neurons are said to be subthreshold, and the neurons are said to be facilitated. Similarly, for input fiber 2, the stimulus to neuron d is a multitude of functions of the nervous system. Yet, despite suprathreshold stimulus, and the stimuli to neurons b and their differences in function, the pools also have many c are subthreshold, but facilitating, stimuli. similar principles of function, described in the following Figure 47- 9 represents a highly condensed version of sections. a neuronal pool because each input nerve fiber usually provides massive numbers of branching terminals to hun- dreds or thousands of neurons in its distribution “field,” RELAYING OF SIGNALS THROUGH NEURONAL POOLS as shown in Figure 47- 10. In the central portion of the field in this figure, designated by the circled area, all the Organization of Neurons for Relaying Signals. neurons are stimulated by the incoming fiber.
