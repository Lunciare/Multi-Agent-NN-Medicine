make pressure natriuresis and diuresis extremely pressure, as discussed in the next section. powerful factors for long- term control of arterial pressure and body fluid volumes. Chronic Renal Output Curve Much Steeper Than the The importance of neural and hormonal influences Acute Curve. An important characteristic of pressure on pressure natriuresis is especially evident during natriuresis (and pressure diuresis) is that chronic changes chronic changes in sodium intake. If the kidneys and in arterial pressure, lasting for days or months, have a nervous and hormonal mechanisms are functioning 231 )lamron ×( tuptuo ro ekatnI )lamron ×( tuptuo ro ekatnI UNIT IV UNIT IV The Circulation normally, chronic increases in intakes of salt and water to as high as six times normal are usually associated with little effect on arterial pressure. Note that the blood pressure equilibrium point B on the curve is 200 nearly the same as point A, the equilibrium point at normal salt intake. Conversely, decreases in salt and water intake to as low as one- sixth normal typically 150 Cardiac have little effect on arterial pressure. Thus, many per- sons are said to be salt-i nsensitive because large varia- 100 tions in salt intake do not change
