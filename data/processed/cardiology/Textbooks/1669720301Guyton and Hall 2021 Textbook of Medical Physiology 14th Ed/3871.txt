Phosphorylation of JAK2 also i stimulatory G proteins (denoted as G proteins). Thus, leads to activation of other intracellular enzyme pathways s depending on the coupling of a hormone receptor to an such as mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPK) and inhibitory or stimulatory G protein, a hormone can either phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K).

Another example, one widely used in hormonal con- trol of cell function, is for the hormone to bind with a Enzyme- Linked Hormone Receptors. Some receptors, when activated, function directly as enzymes or are closely associated with enzymes that they activate. These enzyme- Leptin linked receptors are proteins that pass through the mem- brane only once, in contrast to
