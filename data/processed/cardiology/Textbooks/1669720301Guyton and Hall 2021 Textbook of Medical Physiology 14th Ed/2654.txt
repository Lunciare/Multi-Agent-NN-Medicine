This characteristic is exceedingly impor- cess (Figure 51- 7): (1) light is absorbed by the rhodop- tant because it allows the eye to discriminate light inten- sin, causing photoactivation of the electrons in the retinal sities through a range many thousand times as great as portion, as previously described; (2) the activated rho- would be possible otherwise. dopsin stimulates a G protein called transducin, which then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that Mechanism Whereby Rhodopsin Decomposition De- catalyzes the breakdown of cGMP to 5′- GMP; and (3) the creases Membrane Sodium Conductance—The Ex- reduction in cGMP closes the cGMP- gated sodium chan- citation “Cascade.” Under optimal
