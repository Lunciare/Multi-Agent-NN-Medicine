If there is a higher and (2) slow development of abnormal concentrations of degree of excitation than inhibition of the neuron at any ions inside the postsynaptic neuronal cell. given instant, it is in an excitatory state. Conversely, if there is more inhibition than excitation, the neuron is in Effect of Acidosis or Alkalosis on Synaptic an inhibitory state. Transmission. Most neurons are highly responsive to When the excitatory state of a neuron rises above the changes in pH of the surrounding interstitial fluids.
