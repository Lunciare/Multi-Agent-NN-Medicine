These arterioles help regulate the hydrostatic pressure in The glomerulus contains a network of branching and both sets of capillaries. High hydrostatic pressure in the glo- anastomosing glomerular capillaries that, compared with merular capillaries (≈60 mm Hg) causes rapid fluid filtration, other capillaries, have high hydrostatic pressure (≈60 mm whereas a much lower hydrostatic pressure in the peritubular Hg). The glomerular capillaries are covered by epithelial capillaries (≈13 mm Hg) permits rapid fluid reabsorption. By cells, and the total glomerulus is encased in Bowman’s adjusting the resistance of the afferent and efferent arterioles, capsule. the kidneys can regulate the hydrostatic
