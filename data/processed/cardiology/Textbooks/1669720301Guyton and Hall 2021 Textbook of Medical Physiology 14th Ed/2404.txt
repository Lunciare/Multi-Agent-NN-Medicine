negative value makes the ent calcium ion (Ca2+) sensitivities; a single action potential might neuron less excitable. This mechanism is the basis for the release one set of vesicles (green), whereas multiple action potentials two modes of function of the neuron—either excitation might be required to release both sets of vesicles (green and purple). or inhibition—as explained in the next sections. C, Co- transmission can also rely on the spatial segregation of vesicle populations to different boutons, allowing uniform information to be Concentration Differences of Ions Across the transmitted to different postsynaptic targets.

Figure 46- 9 also shows the concentration differences across the neuronal somal transmitters are often stored and released from the same membrane of the three ions that are most important neurons. In some cases, two or more of these transmit- for neuronal function—sodium ions, potassium ions, ters are co- localized in the same synaptic vesicles and and chloride ions.
