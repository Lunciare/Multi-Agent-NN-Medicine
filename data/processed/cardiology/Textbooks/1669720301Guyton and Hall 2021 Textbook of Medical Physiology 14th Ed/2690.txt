Receptor and Neural Function of the Retina the direct excitatory route through a depolarizing bipolar cell, whereas the other color type inhibits the ganglion cell by the indirect inhibitory route through a hyperpolarizing bipolar cell. The importance of these color contrast mechanisms is that they represent a means whereby the retina begins to differentiate colors. Thus, each color contrast type of ganglion cell is excited by one color but inhibited by the Excitation “opponent” color. Therefore, color analysis begins in the retina and is not entirely a function of the brain.
