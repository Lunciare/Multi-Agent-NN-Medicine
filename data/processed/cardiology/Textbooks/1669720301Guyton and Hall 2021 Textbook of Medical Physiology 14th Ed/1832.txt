The total quantity of iron in the body averages 4 The types of hemoglobin chains in the hemoglobin to 5 grams, about 65% of which is in the form of hemo- molecule determine the binding affinity of the hemoglo- globin. About 4% is in the form of myoglobin, 1% is in bin for oxygen. Abnormalities of the chains can alter the the form of the various heme compounds that promote physical characteristics of the hemoglobin molecule as intracellular oxidation, 0.1% is combined with the pro- well. For example, in sickle cell anemia, the amino acid tein transferrin in the blood plasma, and 15% to 30% is valine is substituted for glutamic acid at one point in each stored for later use, mainly in the reticuloendothelial of the two beta chains. When this type of hemoglobin is system and liver parenchymal cells, principally in the exposed to low oxygen, it forms elongated crystals inside form of ferritin. the RBCs that are sometimes 15 micrometers in length. These crystals make it almost impossible for the cells to Transport and Storage of Iron. Transport, storage, and pass through many small capillaries, and
