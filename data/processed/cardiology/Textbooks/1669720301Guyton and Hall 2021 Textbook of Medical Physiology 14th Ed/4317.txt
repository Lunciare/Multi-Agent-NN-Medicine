Half of the sister chromatids remain in the fertilized ovum, and the OOGENESIS AND FOLLICULAR other half are released in a second polar body, which then DEVELOPMENT IN THE OVARIES disintegrates. At puberty, only about 300,000 oocytes remain in the A developing egg (oocyte) differentiates into a mature ovaries, and only a small percentage of these oocytes egg (ovum) through a series of steps called oogenesis become mature. The many thousands of oocytes that do (Figure 82- 3). During early embryonic development, pri- not mature degenerate. During all the reproductive years mordial germ cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk of adult life, between about 13 and 46 years of age on aver- sac migrate along the mesentery of the hindgut to the outer age, only 400 to 500 of the primordial follicles develop surface of the ovary, which is covered by a germinal epi- enough to expel their ova, one each month;
