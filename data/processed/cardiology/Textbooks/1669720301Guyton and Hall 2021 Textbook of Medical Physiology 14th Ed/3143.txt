In contrast to symptomatic seizures, epilepsy is a chronic Effect of Varying Levels of Cerebral Activity on the condition of recurrent seizures that can also vary from brief Frequency of the EEG and nearly undetectable symptoms to periods of vigorous There is a general correlation between level of cerebral ac- shaking and convulsions. Epilepsy is not a single disease. tivity and average frequency of the EEG rhythm, with the Its clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and reflect multi- average frequency increasing progressively with higher ple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that cause degrees of activity. This is demonstrated in Figure 60- 4, cerebral dysfunction and injury, such as trauma, stroke, which shows the existence of delta waves in surgical anes- tumors, infection, or degenerative changes.
