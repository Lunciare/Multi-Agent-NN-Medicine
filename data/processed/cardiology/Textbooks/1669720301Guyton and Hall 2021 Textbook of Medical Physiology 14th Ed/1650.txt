H+ concentration in these cells is about 4 million times Because H+ concentration normally is low, and because greater than the hydrogen concentration in blood, with a these small numbers are cumbersome, it is customary to pH of 0.8. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss the express H+ concentration on a logarithm scale using pH regulation of extracellular fluid H+ concentration. units. pH is related to the actual H+ concentration by the following formula (H+ concentration
