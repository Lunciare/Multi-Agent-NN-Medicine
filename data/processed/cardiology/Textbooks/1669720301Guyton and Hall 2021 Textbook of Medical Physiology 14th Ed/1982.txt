antihemophilic globulin (AHG); Figure 37- 3 Schema for conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and antihemophilic factor A polymerization of fibrinogen to form fibrin fibers. Factor IX Plasma thromboplastin component (PTC); Christmas factor; antihemophilic factor B in the blood vessels. However, when a vessel is ruptured, Factor X Stuart factor; Stuart- Prower factor procoagulants from the area of tissue damage become Factor XI Plasma thromboplastin antecedent activated and override the anticoagulants, and then a clot (PTA); antihemophilic factor C does develop. Factor XII Hageman factor Clotting takes place in three essential steps: Factor XIII Fibrin- stabilizing factor 1. In response to rupture of the vessel or damage to the blood itself, a complex cascade of chemical re- Prekallikrein Fletcher factor actions occurs in the blood involving more than 12 High- molecular- Fitzgerald factor; high-m olecular- blood coagulation factors. The net result is the for- weight kininogen weight kininogen (HMWK) mation of a complex of activated substances collec- Platelets tively called prothrombin activator. aThese are listed here mainly for historical interest. 2. The prothrombin activator catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin. 3. The thrombin acts as an enzyme to convert fibrino- subsequently form connective tissue all through the clot; gen into
