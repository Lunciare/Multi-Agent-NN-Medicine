is hydrochloric acid (HCl), which some ways to the regulation of other ions in the body. For ionizes in water to form hydrogen ions (H+) and chloride example, there must be a balance between the intake or ions (Cl−). Likewise, carbonic acid (H CO ) ionizes in 2 3 production of H+ and the net removal of H+ from the body water to form H+ and bicarbonate ions (HCO −). 3 to achieve homeostasis. And, as is true for other ions, the A base is an ion or a molecule that can accept an kidneys play a key role in regulating H+ removal from the H+. For example, HCO − is a base because it can com- 3 body. However, precise control of extracellular fluid H+ bine with H+ to form H CO . Likewise, HPO = is a base 2 3 4 concentration involves much more than the simple elimi- because it can accept an H+ to form H PO −. The pro- 2 4 nation of H+ by the kidneys. Multiple acid–b ase buffer- teins in the body also function as bases because some of ing mechanisms involving the blood, cells, and lungs also the amino acids that
