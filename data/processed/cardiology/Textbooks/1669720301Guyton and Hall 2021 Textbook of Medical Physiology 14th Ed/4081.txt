an important role in storing their hormones. The islets contain three major types of cells— the excess energy. In the case of excess carbohydrates, it alpha, beta, and delta cells—that are distinguished from one causes them to be stored as glycogen, mainly in the liver another by their morphological and staining characteristics. and muscles. Furthermore, all the excess carbohydrates The beta cells, constituting about 60% of all the cells of that cannot be stored as glycogen are converted under the islets, lie mainly in the middle of each islet and secrete the stimulus of insulin into fats and stored in adipose insulin and amylin, a hormone that is often secreted in tissue. In the case of proteins, insulin has a direct effect parallel with insulin, although its function is not well un- derstood. The alpha cells, about 25% of the total, secrete glucagon, and the delta cells, about 10% of the total, secrete Islet of Pancreatic Langerhans acini somatostatin. In addition, at least one other type of cell, the PP cell, is present in small numbers in the islets and se- cretes a hormone called pancreatic polypeptide. Delta cell The close interrelations among these cell types in the islets of
