ventricles is depolarized ahead of another beat with a long Q- T interval, which may trigger the other, which causes large electrical potentials, as arrhythmias, tachycardia and, in some cases, ventricular shown for the PVCs in Figure 13-11. fibrillation. 161 UNIT III UNIT III The Heart Premature depolarization Repetitive premature depolarization Torsades de pointes Pause Pause Postpause QT Postpause QT Figure 13-12. Development of arrhythmias in long QT syndrome (LQTS). When the ventricular muscle fiber action potential is prolonged as a result of delayed repolarization, a premature depolarization (dashed line in top left figure) may occur before complete repolarization. Repeti- tive premature depolarizations (top right figure) may lead to multiple depolarizations under certain conditions. In torsades de pointes (bottom figure), premature ventricular beats lead pauses, postpause prolongation of the Q-T interval, and arrhythmias. (Modified from Murray KT, Roden DM: Disorders of cardiac repolarization: the long QT syndromes. In: Crawford MG, DiMarco JP [eds]: Cardiology. London: Mosby, 2001.) Disorders of cardiac repolarization that lead to LQTS that spread in all directions throughout the heart. This may be inherited or acquired. The congenital forms of phenomenon is believed to be caused most frequently by LQTS are rare disorders caused by mutations of
