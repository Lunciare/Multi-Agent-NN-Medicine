then spread anteriorly, directly to the motor cor- tex located immediately forward of the central fissure. These signals play a major role in controlling the efflu- IV ent motor signals that activate sequences of muscle contraction. Moving posteriorly in somatosensory area I, more and V more of the vertical columns respond to slowly adapt- ing cutaneous receptors; still farther posteriorly, greater numbers of the columns are sensitive to deep pressure. In the most posterior portion of somatosensory area VIa I, about 6% of the vertical columns respond only when a stimulus moves across the skin in a particular direc- tion. Thus, this is a still higher order of interpretation VIb of sensory signals; the process becomes even more complex as the signals spread farther backward from somatosensory area I into the parietal cortex, an area called the somatosensory association area, as we discuss subsequently.
