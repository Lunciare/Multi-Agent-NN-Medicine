Orexin neurons are most active during waking and almost factors, mostly peptides, have been isolated from the stop firing during slow wave and REM sleep.

It is possible that prolonged struction of orexin- producing neurons causes narcolepsy, wakefulness causes progressive accumulation of a sleep a sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime factor or factors in the brain stem or cerebrospinal fluid drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep that can occur, even when a person is talking or working. Patients with that lead(s) to sleep. narcolepsy may also experience a sudden loss of muscle Possible Cause of REM Sleep. It is not understood why tone (cataplexy) that can be partial or even severe enough slow- wave sleep is broken periodically by REM sleep. to cause paralysis during the attack.
