This condition, after a large infarction, but fibrillation can sometimes called coronary shock, cardiogenic shock, cardiac shock, or occur after small occlusions as well. Some patients with low cardiac output failure, is discussed more fully in the chronic coronary insufficiency die suddenly of fibrillation next chapter.
