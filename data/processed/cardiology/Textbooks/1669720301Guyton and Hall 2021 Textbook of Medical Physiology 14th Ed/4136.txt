the extracellular fluids causes osmotic transfer of 155 mEq water out of the cells. Total cations 130 mEq In addition to the direct cellular dehydrating effect of excessive glucose, loss of glucose in the urine causes osmot- 27 mEq HCO – ic diuresis—that is, the osmotic effect of glucose in the renal 3 5 mEq tubules greatly decreases tubular reabsorption of fluid. The overall effect is massive loss of fluid in the urine, causing 103 mEq Cl– dehydration of the extracellular fluid, which in turn causes 90 mEq compensatory dehydration of the intracellular fluid. Thus, polyuria (excessive urine excretion), intracellular and ex- 7.4 pH tracellular dehydration, and increased thirst are classic 6.9 symptoms of diabetes.

This situation in turn leads to increased risk for heart attack, stroke, end-
