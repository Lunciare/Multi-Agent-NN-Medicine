The neurons are of two types, ply sends command signals to the spinal cord to set into alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons. motion the walking process. Let us not belittle the role of the brain. The brain gives directions that control the sequential cord activities—for Solitary cell Sensory root example, to promote turning movements when they are required, to lean the body forward during acceleration, to change the movements from walking to jumping as needed, and to monitor continuously and control equi- External basal cells librium. All this is done through “analytical” and “com- mand” signals generated in the brain. However, the many Corticospinal tract neuronal circuits of the spinal cord that are the objects of the commands are also required. These circuits provide all but a small fraction of the direct control of the muscles.
