DISTAL AND at variable rates, depending on the potassium intake. CORTICAL COLLECTING TUBULES SECRETE POTASSIUM Variable Potassium Secretion in Distal and Collecting Tubules Mediates Most Daily Changes in Potassium The cells in the late distal and cortical collecting tubules Excretion. The most important sites for regulating po- that secrete potassium are called principal cells and tassium excretion are the principal cells of the late distal make up most of the epithelial cells in these regions. tubules and cortical collecting tubules. In these tubular Figure 30-3 shows the basic cellular mechanisms of segments, potassium can at times be reabsorbed or at potassium secretion by the principal cells. 385 UNIT V UNIT V The Body Fluids and Kidneys Secretion of potassium from the blood into the tubu- 4 lar lumen is a two- step process, beginning with uptake from the interstitium into the cell by the Na+- K+ ATPase 3 pump in the basolateral cell membrane. This pump moves EEffffeecctt ooff aallddoosstteerroonnee sodium out of the cell into the interstitium and, at the same time, moves potassium to the interior of the cell. 2 The second step of the process is passive diffusion of potassium from the interior of the cell into
