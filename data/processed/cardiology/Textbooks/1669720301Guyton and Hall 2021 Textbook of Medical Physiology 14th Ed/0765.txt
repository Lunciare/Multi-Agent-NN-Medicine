Using this method, capillary pressures have been sheaths around the muscles, and the sclera around the measured in exposed tissues of animals and in large capillary eye. In most of these tissues, regardless of the method loops of the eponychium at the base of the fingernail in hu- used for measurement, the interstitial fluid pressures are mans. These measurements have given pressures of 30 to 40 positive. However, these interstitial fluid pressures al- mm Hg in the arterial ends of the capillaries, 10 to 15 mm most invariably are still less than the pressures exerted Hg in the venous ends, and about 25 mm Hg in the middle. on the outsides of the tissues by their encasements. For In some capillaries, such as the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys, the pressures measured by the micropipette example, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure surrounding the method are much higher, averaging about 60 mm Hg. The brain of an animal lying on its side averages about +10 peritubular capillaries of the kidneys, in contrast, have a mm Hg, whereas the brain interstitial fluid pressure aver- hydrostatic pressure that averages only about 13 mm Hg. ages about +4 to +6 mm Hg. In the kidneys,
