causing a slower rise in the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and less inhibitory effect on R E the GFR. Consequently, even with a constant glomerular P G hydrostatic pressure, a greater rate of blood flow into the RReennaall glomerulus tends to increase the GFR and a lower rate of bblloooodd blood flow into the glomerulus tends to decrease the GFR. ffllooww GFR INCREASED GLOMERULAR CAPILLARY HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE INCREASES GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE Figure 27- 6.
