into The mechanism whereby most stimulating substances the “primary” categories. react with the taste villi to initiate the receptor potential is by binding of the taste chemical to a protein receptor molecule that lies on the outer surface of the taste recep- Chorda tympani (VII) tor cell, near to or protruding through a villus membrane. This action, in turn, opens ion channels, which allows Glossopharyngeal n. (IX) positively charged sodium ions or hydrogen ions to enter and depolarize the normal negativity of the cell. Then, the Epiglottis taste chemical is gradually washed away from the taste Root of tongue villus by the saliva, which removes the stimulus. Foliate papilla The type of receptor protein in each taste villus deter- mines the type of taste that will be perceived. For sodium ions and hydrogen ions, which elicit salty and sour taste sensations, respectively, the receptor proteins open spe- cific ion channels, likely the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in the apical membranes of the taste cells, thereby IX activating the receptors. However, for the sweet and bit- Circumvallate papilla ter taste sensations, the portions of the G- protein coupled receptors that protrude through the apical membranes Taste bud activate second- messenger transmitter
