critical for cell account for as much as 95% of the cell mass. The fat stored function. For example, without one of the organelles, the in these cells represents the body’s main storehouse of mitochondria, more than 95% of the cell’s energy release energy- giving nutrients that can later be used to provide from nutrients would cease immediately. The most energy wherever it is needed in the body. important organelles and other structures of the cell are shown in Figure 2-2. Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play a major role in cell nutrition and, as parts of glycoprotein molecules, have MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES OF THE CELL structural functions. Most human cells do not maintain large stores of carbohydrates; the amount usually averages Most organelles of the cell are covered by membranes only about 1% of their total mass but increases to as much composed primarily of lipids and proteins. These mem- as 3% in muscle cells and, occasionally, to 6% in liver cells. branes include the cell membrane, nuclear membrane, However, carbohydrate in the form of dissolved glucose membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and membranes is always present in the surrounding extracellular fluid so of the mitochondria, lysosomes, and Golgi apparatus. 14 Chapter 2
