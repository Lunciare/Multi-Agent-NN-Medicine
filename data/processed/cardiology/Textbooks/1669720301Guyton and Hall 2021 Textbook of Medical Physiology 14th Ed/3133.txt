Motor and Integrative Neurophysiology Lack of sleep certainly affects the functions of the Alpha central nervous system. Prolonged wakefulness is often associated with progressive malfunction of the thought processes and sometimes even causes abnormal behav- Beta ioral activities. We are all familiar with the increased sluggishness of thought that occurs toward the end of a prolonged wakeful period, but in addition, a person can Theta become irritable or even psychotic after forced wake- fulness. Therefore, we can assume that sleep in multiple ways restores both normal levels of brain activity and nor- mal “balance” among the different functions of the central 50 µV Delta nervous system. Sleep has been postulated to serve many
