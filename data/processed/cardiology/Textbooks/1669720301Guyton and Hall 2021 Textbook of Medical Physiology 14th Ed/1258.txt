The terms isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic refer to whether solutions will cause a change in cell volume. The Isotonic, Hypotonic, and Hypertonic Fluids. The ef- tonicity of solutions depends on the concentration of im- fects of different concentrations of impermeant solutes in permeant solutes. Some solutes, however, can permeate the extracellular fluid on cell volume are shown in Figure the cell membrane. Solutions with an osmolarity the same 25- 5. If a cell is placed in a solution of impermeant solutes as the cell are called isosmotic, regardless of whether the having an osmolarity of 282 mOsm/L, the cells will not solute can penetrate the cell membrane. The terms hyperosmotic and hypo- osmotic refer to solu- tions that have a higher or lower osmolarity, respectively, compared with the normal extracellular fluid, without regard for whether the solute permeates the cell mem- A brane.
