subunits pro- machinery for protein synthesis, as explained in Chapter 3, truding into the cell become autophosphorylated. Thus, beginning with translation of the insulin RNA by ribo- the insulin receptor is an example of an enzyme- linked somes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum to form receptor, discussed in Chapter 75. Autophosphorylation preproinsulin. This initial preproinsulin has a molecular of the beta subunits of the receptor activates a local tyro- weight of about 11,500, but it is then cleaved in the endo- sine kinase, which in turn causes phosphorylation of mul- plasmic reticulum to form a proinsulin with a molecular tiple other intracellular enzymes, including a group called weight of about 9000 and consisting of three chains of insulin- receptor substrates (IRS). Different types of IRS peptides, A, B, and C. Most of the proinsulin is further (e.g., IRS- 1, IRS- 2, and IRS-3 ) are expressed in different cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to form insulin, which tissues. The net effect is to activate some of these enzymes is composed of the A and B chains connected by disul- while inactivating others. In this way, insulin directs the fide linkages, and the C chain peptide, called connecting intracellular metabolic machinery
