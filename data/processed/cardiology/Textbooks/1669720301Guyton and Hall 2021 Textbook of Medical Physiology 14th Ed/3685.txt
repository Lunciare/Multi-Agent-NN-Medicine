uremia. hormone AGRP released from the orexigenic neurons of the Insulin Galanin hypothalamus is a natural antagonist of MCR- 3 and Cholecystokinin Amino acids (glutamate and MCR- 4 and probably increases feeding by inhibiting the γ- aminobutyric acid) effects of α- MSH to stimulate melanocortin receptors Glucagon-l ike peptide Cortisol (see Figure 72- 2). Although the role of AGRP in normal Cocaine- and Ghrelin physiological control of food intake is unclear, excessive amphetamine- formation of AGRP in mice and humans due to gene regulated transcript mutations is associated with increased food intake and Peptide YY Endocannabinoids obesity.
