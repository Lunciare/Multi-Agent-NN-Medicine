In addition, the gation of muscle fiber action potentials. importance of the different mechanisms of energy release The concentration of ATP in the muscle fiber, about during performance of different sports is discussed in 4 millimolar, is sufficient to maintain full contraction Chapter 85. for only 1 to 2 seconds at most. The ATP is split to form ADP, which transfers energy from the ATP molecule to Efficiency of Muscle Contraction. The efficiency of an the contracting machinery of the muscle fiber. Then, as engine or a motor is calculated as the percentage of energy input that is converted into work instead of heat. The per- described in Chapter 2, the ADP is rephosphorylated to centage of the input energy to muscle (the chemical energy form new ATP within another fraction of a second, which in nutrients) that can be converted into work, even under allows the muscle to continue its contraction.
