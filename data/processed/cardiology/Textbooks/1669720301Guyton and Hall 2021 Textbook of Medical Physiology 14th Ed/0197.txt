Effect of concentration of a substance on the rate of diffusion through a membrane by simple diffusion and facilitated Recorder diffusion. This graph shows that facilitated diffusion approaches a maximum rate, called the V . max FACILITATED DIFFUSION REQUIRES MEMBRANE CARRIER PROTEINS Facilitated diffusion is also called carrier- mediated diffu- sion because a substance transported in this manner dif- To recorder fuses through the membrane with the help of a specific carrier protein. That is, the carrier facilitates diffusion of the substance to the other side. Facilitated diffusion differs from simple diffusion in the following important way. Although the rate of simple dif- fusion through an open channel increases proportionately with the concentration of the diffusing substance, in facili- tated diffusion the rate of diffusion approaches
