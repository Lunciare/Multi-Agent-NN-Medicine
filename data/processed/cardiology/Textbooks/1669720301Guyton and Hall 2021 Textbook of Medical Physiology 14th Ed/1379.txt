Studies of individual blood vessels (especially reabsorption small arterioles) throughout the body have shown that they respond to increased wall tension or wall stretch by contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. Stretch of the Proximal tubular vascular wall allows increased movement of calcium ions NaCl reabsorption from the extracellular fluid into the cells, causing them to contract through the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 8. This contraction prevents excessive stretch of the vessel Macula densa NaCl and, at the same time, by raising
