or excess sodium in the extracellular fluid. Primary loss of water from the extracellular fluid results Normonatremia in hypernatremia and dehydration. This condition can 2 occur from an inability to secrete ADH, which is needed 1 3 for the kidneys to conserve water. As a result of lack of Na+/ H O 2 ADH, the kidneys excrete large amounts of dilute urine (a disorder referred to as central diabetes insipidus), causing dehydration and increased concentration of sodium chlo- K+, Na+ ride in the extracellular fluid. In certain types of renal dis- Organic eases, the kidneys cannot respond to ADH, causing a type solutes H 2O of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A more common cause of hypernatremia associated with decreased extracellular fluid volume is simple dehydration caused by water intake that is less than water loss, as can occur with sweating during prolonged heavy exercise. Hypernatremia can also occur when excessive sodium Acute hyponatremia chloride is added to the extracellular fluid. This often results in hypernatremia- overhydration because excess Na+/ H O extracellular sodium chloride is also usually associated 2 with at least some degree of water retention by the kid- neys. For example, excessive secretion of the sodium- K+, Na+ retaining
