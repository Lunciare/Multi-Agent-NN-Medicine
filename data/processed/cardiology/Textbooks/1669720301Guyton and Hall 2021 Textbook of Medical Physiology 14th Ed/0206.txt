all solution is actually a mixture of permeant water mole- the forces of the molecules striking the channels on that side cules and nonpermeant sodium and chloride ions, and of the membrane is greater than on the other side. In most the membrane is said to be selectively permeable to water cases, this situation is caused by greater numbers of mole- but much less so to sodium and chloride ions. Yet, the cules striking the membrane per second on one side than on presence of the sodium and chloride has displaced some the other side. The result is that increased amounts of energy of the water molecules on the side of the membrane are available to cause a net movement of molecules from where these ions are present and, therefore, has reduced the high- pressure side toward the low- pressure side. This the concentration of water molecules to less than that of effect is demonstrated in Figure 4-9C, which shows a pis- pure water. As a result, in the example shown in Figure ton developing high pressure on one side of a pore, thereby 4-10, more water molecules strike the channels on the causing more molecules to strike the pore
