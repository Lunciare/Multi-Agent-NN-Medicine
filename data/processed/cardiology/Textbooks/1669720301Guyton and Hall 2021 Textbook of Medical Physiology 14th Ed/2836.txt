However, the central region of each of these fibers— cles the intrafusal fibers in the same way as the type Ia that is, the area midway between its two ends—has few fiber, but often it spreads like branches on a bush. or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion does not contract when the ends do. Instead, it Division of the Intrafusal Fibers Into Nuclear Bag and functions as a sensory receptor, as described later. The Nuclear Chain Fibers—Dynamic and Static Responses end portions that do contract are excited by small gamma of the Muscle Spindle. There are also two types of mus-
