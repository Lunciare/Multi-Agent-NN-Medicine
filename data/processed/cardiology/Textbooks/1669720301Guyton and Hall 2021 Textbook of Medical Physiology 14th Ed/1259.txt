Highly permeating substances, such as urea, can cause transient shifts in fluid volume between the intra- cellular and extracellular fluids but, given enough time, the concentrations of these substances eventually become 280 mOsm/L equal in the two compartments and have little effect on B ISOTONIC intracellular volume under steady- state conditions.

Transfer of fluid across the cell membrane occurs so rapidly that any differences in osmolarities between these two compart- ments are usually corrected within seconds or, at the most, minutes.
