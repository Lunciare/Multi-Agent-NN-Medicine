changing pressure than to sure in the upper body is important when a person stands a stationary pressure. That is, if the mean arterial pressure up after lying down. Immediately on standing, the arterial is 150 mm Hg but at that moment is rising rapidly, the pressure in the head and upper part of the body tends to rate of impulse transmission may be as much as twice that fall, and marked reduction of this pressure could cause when the pressure is stationary at 150 mm Hg. loss of consciousness. However, the falling pressure at the baroreceptors elicits an immediate reflex, resulting in Circulatory Reflex Initiated by the Baroreceptors. strong sympathetic discharge throughout the body that After the baroreceptor signals have entered the nucleus minimizes the decrease in pressure in the head and up- tractus solitarius of the medulla, secondary signals inhibit per body. 222 ditorac morf seslupmi fo rebmuN dnoces rep sevren sunis )gH mm( erusserp lairetrA Chapter 18 Nervous Regulation of the Circulation and Rapid Control of Arterial Pressure Normal 200 6 5 Normal 100 4 3 0 2 24 1 Denervated Baroreceptors denervated 200 0 0 50 100 150 200 250 Mean arterial pressure (mm Hg) Figure
