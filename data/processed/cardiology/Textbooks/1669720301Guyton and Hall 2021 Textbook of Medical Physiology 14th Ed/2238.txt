about the final adjustment of respiration required to keep normal value. The upper curve of Figure 42- 11 also shows the O , CO , and H+ concentrations of the body fluids as that if during exercise the arterial Pco does change from 2 2 2 nearly normal as possible. its normal value of 40 mm Hg, it has an extra stimulatory This process is demonstrated in Figure 42- 10. The effect on ventilation at a Pco 2 value greater than 40 mm Hg lower curve shows changes in alveolar ventilation during and a depressant effect at a Pco value less than 40 mm Hg. 2 1 minute of exercise, and the upper curve shows changes in arterial Pco . Note that at the onset of exercise, the Neurogenic Control of Ventilation During Exercise 2 alveolar ventilation increases almost instantaneously, May Be Partly a Learned Response. Many experiments without an initial increase in arterial Pco .
