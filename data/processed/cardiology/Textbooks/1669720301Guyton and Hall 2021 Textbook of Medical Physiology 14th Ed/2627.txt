OUTFLOW OF AQUEOUS HUMOR FROM THE EYE Ciliary processes Formation of aqueous After aqueous humor is formed by the ciliary processes, it humor first flows, as shown in Figure 50- 18, through the pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye. From here, the fluid flows anterior to the lens and into the angle between the cornea and the iris, then through a meshwork of trabeculae, and finally entering the canal of Schlemm, which empties into extra- ocular veins. Figure 50- 20 demonstrates the anatomical structures at this iridocorneal angle, showing that the spaces between the trabeculae extend all the way from the anterior chamber to the canal of Schlemm. The canal of Schlemm is a thin- walled vein that extends circumferentially all the way around the eye. Its endothelial membrane is so porous that even large protein molecules, as well as
