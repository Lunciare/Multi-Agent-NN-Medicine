l is length of the vessel, and η is viscosity of the blood. A Note particularly in this equation that the rate of blood flow is directly proportional to the fourth power of the R 1 R 2 radius of the vessel, which demonstrates once again that the diameter of a blood vessel (which is equal to twice the radius) plays the greatest role of all factors in determining the rate of blood flow through a vessel.

In the systemic circulation, about two thirds of the total sys- temic resistance to blood flow is resistance in the small arterioles. The internal diameters of the arterioles range from as little as 4 micrometers to as much as 25 mi- It is obvious that for a given pressure gradient, far crometers. However, their strong vascular walls allow greater amounts of blood will flow through this parallel the internal diameters to change tremendously, often as system than through any of the individual blood vessels. much as fourfold.
