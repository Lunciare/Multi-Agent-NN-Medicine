This represents a high degree of au- fixation mechanism. tomatic subconscious computational ability by the pursuit When a spot of light becomes fixed on the foveal system for controlling eye movements. region of the retina, the tremulous movements cause the spot to move back and forth at a rapid rate across the Superior Colliculi Are Mainly Responsible for Turn- cones, and the drifting movements cause the spot to drift ing the Eyes and Head Toward a Visual Disturbance. slowly across the cones. Each time the spot drifts as far Even after the visual cortex has been destroyed, a sudden as the edge of the fovea, a sudden reflex reaction occurs, visual disturbance in a lateral area of the visual field often producing a flicking movement that moves the spot away causes immediate turning of the eyes in that direction. from this edge back toward the center of the fovea. Thus, This turning does not occur if the superior colliculi have an automatic response moves the image back toward the also been destroyed. To support this function, the various central point of vision.
