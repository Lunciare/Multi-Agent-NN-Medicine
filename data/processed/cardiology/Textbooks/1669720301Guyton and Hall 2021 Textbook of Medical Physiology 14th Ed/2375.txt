The fact that the basic com- interior of one cell to the interior of the next cell. Such ponents of the general purpose computer are analogous junctions were discussed in Chapter 4, and it is by way to those of the human nervous system demonstrates that of gap junctions and other similar junctions that action the brain has many features of a computer, continuously potentials are transmitted from one smooth muscle fiber collecting sensory information and using this, along with to the next in visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 8) and stored information, to compute the daily course of bodily from one cardiac muscle cell to the next in cardiac muscle activity.

This characteristic is that they Action potential Mitochondria always transmit the signals in one direction—that is, from the neuron that secretes the neurotransmitter, called the presynaptic neuron, to the
