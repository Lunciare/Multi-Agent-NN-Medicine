This mechanism explains how only a few micrograms of glucagon can cause the blood glucose level to GLUCAGON AND ITS FUNCTIONS double or increase even more within a few minutes. Infusion of glucagon for about 4 hours can cause such Glucagon, a hormone secreted by the alpha cells of the intensive liver glycogenolysis that all the liver stores of islets of Langerhans when blood glucose concentration glycogen become depleted. falls, has several functions that are diametrically opposed Glucagon Increases Gluconeogenesis to those of insulin. The most important of these functions is to increase the blood glucose concentration, an effect Even after all the glycogen in the liver has been exhausted that is opposite to that of insulin. under the influence of glucagon, continued infusion of Like insulin, glucagon is a large polypeptide. It has a this hormone still
