Thus, excretion of 8 grams of nitrogen in Centers. Several neuronal centers of the hypothalamus the urine each day means that about 55 grams of protein participate in the control of food intake. The lateral nuclei breakdown has occurred. If the daily intake of protein is of the hypothalamus serve as a feeding center, and stim- less than the daily breakdown of protein, the person is said to have a negative nitrogen balance, which means that his or ulation of this area causes an animal to eat voraciously her body stores of protein are decreasing daily.

Conversely, destruction of the lateral hy- pothalamus causes lack of desire for food and progressive inanition, a condition characterized by marked weight REGULATION OF FOOD INTAKE AND loss, muscle weakness, and decreased metabolism.
