of transferrin in the plasma to When RBCs are delivered from the bone marrow into the areas of the body where it is needed. A unique charac- the circulatory system, they normally circulate an average teristic of the transferrin molecule is that it binds strongly of 120 days before being destroyed. Even though mature with receptors in the cell membranes of erythroblasts in RBCs do not have a nucleus, mitochondria, or endoplasmic the bone marrow. Then, along with its bound iron, it is reticulum, they do have cytoplasmic enzymes that are capa- ingested into the erythroblasts by endocytosis. There the ble of metabolizing glucose and forming small amounts of transferrin delivers the iron directly to the mitochondria, adenosine triphosphate. These enzymes also do the follow- where heme is synthesized. In people who do not have ing: (1) maintain pliability of the cell membrane; (2) main- adequate quantities of transferrin in their blood, failure tain membrane transport of ions; (3) keep the iron of the to transport iron to the erythroblasts in this manner can cells’ hemoglobin in the ferrous form rather than the ferric cause severe hypochromic anemia (i.e., RBCs that contain form; and (4) prevent oxidation of the proteins
