At point B, the stimu- lus is greater, but the intensity is still not enough. The Inhibition of Excitability—Stabilizers and Local Anesthetics stimulus does, however, disturb the membrane potential locally for as long as 1 millisecond or more after both In contrast to the factors that increase nerve excitability, of these weak stimuli. These local potential changes are membrane- stabilizing factors can decrease excitability. For called acute local potentials and, when they fail to elicit example, a high extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration an action potential, they are called acute subthreshold decreases membrane permeability to sodium ions and potentials. simultaneously reduces excitability. Therefore, calcium ions At point C in Figure 5- 18, the stimulus is even stronger. are said to be what is called a stabilizer. Now, the local potential has barely reached the threshold Local Anesthetics. Among the most important sta- bilizers are the many substances used clinically as local level required to elicit an action potential, but this occurs anesthetics, including procaine and tetracaine.
