In addition to inflammatory effects caused by activation of the mast cells and T cell basophils, several other complement products con- tribute to local inflammation. These products cause (1) the already increased blood flow to increase still Cell-cell T-cell receptor further; (2) the capillary leakage of proteins to be adhesion Foreign protein proteins increased; and (3) the interstitial fluid proteins MHC protein to coagulate in the tissue spaces, thus preventing movement of the invading organism through the tissues.
