For this reason and other reasons, in many 795 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Importance of Nervous Depression of Gastrointesti- nal Blood Flow When Other Parts of the Body Need Extra Blood Flow. A major value of sympathetic vaso- constriction in the gut is that it allows shutoff of gastroin- testinal and other splanchnic blood flow for short periods during heavy exercise when the skeletal muscle and heart need increased flow. Also, in circulatory shock, when all Central lacteal the body’s vital tissues are in danger of cellular death for lack of blood flow—especially the brain and the heart— sympathetic stimulation can
