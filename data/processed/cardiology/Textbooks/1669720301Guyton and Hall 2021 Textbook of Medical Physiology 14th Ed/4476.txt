In addition, circulatory adjustments right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and then mainly during the first few hours of life cause more and more blood through the ductus arteriosus into the descending aorta, flow through the baby’s liver, which up to this point has had then through the two umbilical arteries into the placenta, little blood flow. To describe these readjustments, we first where the deoxygenated blood becomes oxygenated. consider the anatomical structure of the fetal circulation.
