18. These reflex pathways example, nausea is a potent stimulus for ADH release, originate in high- pressure regions of the circulation, such which may increase to as much as 100 times normal after as the aortic arch and carotid sinus, and in low- pressure vomiting. Also, drugs such as nicotine and morphine stim- regions, especially in the cardiac atria. Afferent stimuli are ulate ADH release, whereas some drugs, such as alcohol, carried by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, with inhibit ADH release. The marked diuresis that occurs synapses in the nuclei of the tractus solitarius. Projections after ingestion of alcohol is due in part to the inhibition from these nuclei relay signals to the hypothalamic nuclei of ADH release. that control ADH synthesis and secretion. Thus, in addition to increased osmolarity, two other IMPORTANCE OF THIRST IN stimuli increase ADH secretion: (1) decreased arterial CONTROLLING EXTRACELLULAR pressure; and (2) decreased blood volume. Whenever FLUID OSMOLARITY AND SODIUM blood pressure and blood volume are reduced, such as CONCENTRATION during hemorrhage, increased ADH secretion causes increased fluid reabsorption by the kidneys, helping The kidneys minimize fluid loss during water deficits restore blood pressure and blood volume toward normal. through the osmoreceptor- ADH
