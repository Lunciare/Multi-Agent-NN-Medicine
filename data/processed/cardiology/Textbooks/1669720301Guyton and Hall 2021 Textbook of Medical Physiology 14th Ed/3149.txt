two halves of the cerebrum simultaneously. Electrical recordings from the thalamus, as well as from Generalized tonic-clonic seizure the reticular formation of the brain stem during the gen- eralized tonic- clonic seizure, show typical high- voltage ac- 50 µV tivity in both of these areas similar to that recorded from the cerebral cortex. Therefore, a generalized tonic- clonic seizure presumably involves not only abnormal activation Absence seizure of the thalamus and cerebral cortex but also abnormal acti- vation in the subthalamic brain stem portions of the brain- 50 µV activating system.
