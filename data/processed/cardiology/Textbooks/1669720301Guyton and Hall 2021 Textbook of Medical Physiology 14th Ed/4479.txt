in the other di- 2277 rection, as in fetal life. However, after only a few hours, the LLuunnggss muscle wall of the ductus arteriosus constricts markedly 5588 and, within 1 to 8 days, the constriction is usually sufficient 7733 to stop all blood flow. This is called functional closure of LLeefftt LLeefftt the ductus arteriosus. Then, during the next 1 to 4 months, aattrriiuumm vveennttrriiccllee the ductus arteriosus ordinarily becomes anatomically oc- 4466 cluded by growth of fibrous tissue into its lumen. The cause of ductus arteriosus closure relates to the 7733 FFoorraammeenn 1122 increased oxygenation of the blood flowing through the oovvaallee ductus, as well as loss of the vascular relaxing effects of HHiinnddqquuaarrtteerrss 1188 prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In fetal life, the partial pressure of oxygen (Po ) of the ductus blood is only 15 to 20 mm 2 Hg, but it increases to about 100 mm Hg within a few hours PPllaacceennttaa 5555 after birth. Furthermore, experiments have shown that the degree of contraction of the smooth muscle in the ductus Figure 84-5 .
