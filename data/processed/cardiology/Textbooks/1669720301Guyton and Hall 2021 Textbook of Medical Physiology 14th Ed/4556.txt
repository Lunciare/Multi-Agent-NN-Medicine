Because of the critical limitation that the rates of all intracellular chemical reactions, thus liberating cardiovascular system places on maximal performance in still more heat. endurance athletics, one can readily understand that any The treatment of heatstroke is to reduce the body tem- type of heart disease that reduces maximal cardiac output perature as rapidly as possible.
