This effect is demonstrated one focal distance in one focal plane (plane AC) and at another focal distance in the plane at a right angle (plane BD). in Figure 50- 14, which shows rays of light originating from a point source and passing through an oblong, astigmatic lens. The light rays in the vertical plane, indicated by plane the astigmatic lens. Then, an additional cylindrical lens is BD, are refracted greatly by the astigmatic lens because of used to correct the remaining error in the remaining plane. the greater curvature in the vertical direction than in the To do this, both the axis and the strength of the required horizontal direction. By contrast, the light rays in the hori- cylindrical lens must be determined. zontal plane, indicated by plane AC, are not bent nearly as Several methods exist for determining the axis of the much as the light rays in vertical plane BD.
