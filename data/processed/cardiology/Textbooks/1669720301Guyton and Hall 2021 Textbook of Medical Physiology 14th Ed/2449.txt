the that when a distorting force is suddenly applied to one pressure continues. Later, however, it transmits a signal side of the corpuscle, this force is instantly transmitted again when the pressure is released. In other words, the by the viscous component of the corpuscle directly to the Pacinian corpuscle is exceedingly important in apprising same side of the central nerve fiber, thus eliciting a recep- the nervous system of rapid tissue deformations, but it is tor potential. However, within a few hundredths of a sec- useless for transmitting information about constant con- ond, the fluid within the corpuscle redistributes, and the ditions in the body. 590 dnoces rep seslupmI Chapter 47 Sensory Receptors, Neuronal Circuits for Processing Information Predictive Function of the Rate Receptors.
