HEPARIN—INTRAVENOUS ANTICOAGULANT FEMORAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS AND MASSIVE PULMONARY EMBOLISM Commercial heparin is extracted from several differ- ent animal tissues and prepared in almost pure form. Because clotting almost always occurs when blood flow Injection of relatively small quantities, about 0.5 to 1 is blocked for many hours in any vessel of the body, the mg/kg of body weight, causes the blood- clotting time immobility of patients confined to bed, plus the practice to increase from a normal of about 6 minutes to 30 or of propping the knees up with pillows, often causes intra- more minutes. Furthermore, this change in clotting time vascular clotting because of blood stasis in one or more occurs instantaneously, thereby immediately preventing of the leg veins for hours at a time.
