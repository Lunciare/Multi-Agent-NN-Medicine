CONTRACTILE MECHANISM IN SMOOTH MUSCLE Multi- Unit Smooth Muscle. Multi- unit smooth muscle Chemical Basis for Smooth Muscle is composed of discrete, separate, smooth muscle fibers. Contraction Each fiber operates independently of the others and often is innervated by a single nerve ending, as occurs for skele- Smooth muscle contains both actin and myosin filaments, tal muscle fibers. Furthermore, the outer surfaces of these having chemical characteristics similar to those of the fibers, like those of skeletal muscle fibers, are covered by a actin and myosin filaments in skeletal muscle.
