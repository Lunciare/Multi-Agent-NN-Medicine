calcium ions cause this release is not known, but it is believed to be the following. Dendrites When the calcium ions enter the presynaptic termi- nal, they bind with special protein molecules on the inside surface of the presynaptic membrane, called release sites. This binding in turn causes the release sites to open Axon through the membrane, allowing a few transmitter ves- icles to release their transmitter into the cleft after each single action potential. For the vesicles that store the neu- Soma rotransmitter acetylcholine, between 2,000 and 10,000 molecules of acetylcholine are present in each vesicle, and there are enough vesicles in the presynaptic terminal to transmit from a few hundred to more than 10,000 action potentials. Transmitter Actions on Postsynaptic Neurons—Function of Receptor Proteins The membrane of the postsynaptic neuron contains large numbers of receptor proteins, also shown in Figure 46- Figure 46- 6. Typical anterior motor neuron showing presynaptic 5A. The molecules of these receptors have two important terminals on the neuronal soma and dendrites. Note also the single components: (1) a binding component that protrudes out- axon. ward from the membrane into the synaptic cleft, where it binds the neurotransmitter coming from the presynaptic membrane surface
