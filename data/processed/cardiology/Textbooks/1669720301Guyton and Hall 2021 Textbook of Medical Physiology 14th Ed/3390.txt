for of trypsin inhibitor is often overwhelmed, in which case digesting all of the three major types of food—proteins, the pancreatic secretions rapidly become activated and carbohydrates, and fats. It also contains large quantities of can literally digest the entire pancreas within a few hours, HCO −, which play an important role in neutralizing the 3 giving rise to the condition called acute pancreatitis. This acidity of the chyme emptied from the stomach into the condition is sometimes lethal because of accompanying duodenum. circulatory shock; even if it is not lethal, it usually leads to The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for a lifetime of pancreatic insufficiency. digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and car- boxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is SECRETION OF BICARBONATE IONS trypsin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially Although the enzymes of the pancreatic juice are secreted digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not entirely by the acini of the pancreatic glands, the other cause release of individual amino acids. However, car- two important components of pancreatic juice, HCO − 3 boxypolypeptidase splits some peptides into individual and water, are secreted mainly by the epithelial cells of amino acids,
