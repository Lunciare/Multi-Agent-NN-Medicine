Then, it diminishes much Note the extreme variability of pressure in the denervated more slowly during the next 1 to 2 days, at the end of which dog caused by simple events of the day, such as lying down, time the rate of firing will have returned to nearly normal, standing, excitement, eating, defecation, and noises. despite the fact that the mean arterial pressure still remains Figure 18- 9 shows the frequency distributions of the at 160 mm Hg.
