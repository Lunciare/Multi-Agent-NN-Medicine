also present in the usual diet. The phospholipids and cholesterol esters contain fatty acid Digestion of Peptides by Peptidases in the Entero- and therefore can be considered fats. Cholesterol is a cytes That Line the Small Intestinal Villi. The last diges- sterol compound that contains no fatty acid, but it does tive stage of proteins in the intestinal lumen is achieved by exhibit some of the physical and chemical characteristics enterocytes that line the villi of the small intestine, mainly of fats. In addition, it is derived from fats and is metabo- in the duodenum and jejunum. These cells have a brush lized similarly to fats. Therefore, cholesterol is considered, border that consists of hundreds of microvilli projecting from a dietary point of view, to be a fat. 825 UNIT XII UNIT XII Gastrointestinal Physiology Digestion of Fats Occurs Mainly in the Small Intes- (Bile + agitation) Fat Emulsified fat tine. A small amount of triglycerides is digested in the stomach by lingual lipase secreted by lingual glands in Pancreatic lipase Emulsified fat Fatty acids and the mouth and swallowed with the saliva. This amount of 2-monoglycerides digestion is less than 10% and is generally unimportant. Figure 66- 4. Digestion
