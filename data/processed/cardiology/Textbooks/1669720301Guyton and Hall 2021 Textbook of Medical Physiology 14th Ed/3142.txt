De- lamic activation of the cortex and thereby eliminates the pending on the distribution of neuronal discharges, seizure alpha waves, nevertheless does not block delta waves in the manifestations can range from experiential phenomena cortex. This indicates that some synchronizing mechanism that are barely noticeable to dramatic convulsions. These can occur in the cortical neuronal system by itself—mainly temporary symptomatic seizures usually do not persist if independent of lower structures in the brain—to cause the the underlying disorder is corrected. They can be caused by delta waves. multiple neurological or medical conditions, such as acute Delta waves also occur during deep slow- wave sleep, electrolyte disorders, hypoglycemia, drugs (e.g., cocaine), which suggests that the cortex then is mainly released from eclampsia, kidney failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, the activating influences of the thalamus and other lower meningitis, and so forth. Approximately 5% to 10% of the centers. population will have at least one seizure in their lifetime. In contrast to symptomatic seizures, epilepsy is a chronic Effect of Varying Levels of Cerebral Activity on the condition of recurrent seizures that can also vary from brief Frequency of
