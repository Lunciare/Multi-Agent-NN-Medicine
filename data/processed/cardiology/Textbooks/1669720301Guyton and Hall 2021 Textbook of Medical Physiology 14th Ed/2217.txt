is to discuss this control of ventilation in accord with the respiratory needs of the body. CHEMICAL CONTROL OF RESPIRATION Inspiratory area H+ + HCO – 3 The ultimate goal of respiration is to maintain proper concentrations of O , CO , and H+ in the tissues. It is 2 2 fortunate, therefore, that respiratory activity is highly H 2CO 3 responsive to changes in each of these substances. Excess CO or excess H+ in the blood mainly act directly 2 CO 2 + H 2O on the respiratory center, causing greatly increased strength of both the inspiratory and the expiratory motor signals to the respiratory muscles. Oxygen, in contrast, Figure 42- 2. Stimulation of the brain stem inspiratory area by signals does not have a major direct effect on the respiratory cen- from the chemosensitive area located bilaterally in the medulla, lying ter of the brain in controlling respiration. Instead, it acts only a fraction of a millimeter beneath the ventral medullary surface. almost entirely on peripheral chemoreceptors located in Note also that H+ stimulates the chemosensitive area, but carbon di- the carotid and aortic bodies, and these chemoreceptors oxide in the fluid gives rise to most of the
