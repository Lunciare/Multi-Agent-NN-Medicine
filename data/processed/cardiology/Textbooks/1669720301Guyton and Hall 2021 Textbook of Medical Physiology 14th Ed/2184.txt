The exercising Figure 41-10 Shift of the oxygen- hemoglobin dissociation curve to 2 the right caused by an increase in H+ concentration (decrease in pH). muscles, in turn, release large quantities of CO 2; this and BPG, 2,3- Biphosphoglycerate. several other acids released by the muscles increase the H+ concentration in the muscle capillary blood. In addition, the temperature of the muscle often rises 2° to 3°C, which 2,3-b iphosphoglycerate (BPG), a metabolically important can increase O delivery to the muscle fibers even more.
