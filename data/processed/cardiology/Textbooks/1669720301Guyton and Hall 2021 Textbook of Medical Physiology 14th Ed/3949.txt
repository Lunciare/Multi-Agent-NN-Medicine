from the cir- ronine. However, almost all the thyroxine is eventually culating blood by the cells of the thyroid gland and used converted to triiodothyronine in the tissues, so both are for synthesis of the thyroid hormones. functionally important. The functions of these two hor- IODIDE PUMP—THE SODIUM- IODIDE mones are qualitatively the same, but they differ in rapid- SYMPORTER (IODIDE TRAPPING) ity and intensity of action. Triiodothyronine is about four times as potent as thyroxine, but it is present in the blood The first stage in formation of thyroid hormones, shown in much smaller quantities and persists for a much shorter in Figure 77-2 , is transport of iodides from the blood time compared with thyroxine. into the thyroid glandular cells and follicles. The basal membrane of the thyroid cell has the specific ability to PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE pump the iodide actively to the interior of the cell. This THYROID GLAND pumping is achieved by the action of a sodium-i odide As shown in Figure 77- 1, the thyroid gland is composed symporter, which co- transports one iodide ion along of large numbers of closed follicles (100–300 micrometers with two sodium ions across the basolateral (plasma) in diameter)
