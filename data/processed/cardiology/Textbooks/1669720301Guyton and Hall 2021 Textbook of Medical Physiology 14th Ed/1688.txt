2O. Therefore, it is said that thick ascending segment of the loop of Henle, and early distal tubule. HCO 3− and H+ normally “titrate” each other in the tubules. The titration process is not quite exact because there is usually a slight excess of H+ in the tubules to be excreted carrier protein in the luminal border of the cell membrane; in the urine. This excess H+ (≈80 mEq/day) rids the body at the same time, a H+ in the interior of the cells combines of nonvolatile acids produced by metabolism. As dis- with the carrier protein. The Na+ moves into the cell down cussed later, most of this H+ is not excreted as free H+ but a concentration gradient that has been established by the is in combination with other urinary buffers, especially Na+- K+ ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane. The phosphate and ammonia. gradient for Na+ movement into the cell then provides the When there is an excess of HCO − over H+ in the urine, energy for moving H+ in the opposite direction from the 3 as occurs in metabolic alkalosis, the excess HCO − can- 3 interior of the cell to the tubular lumen. not
