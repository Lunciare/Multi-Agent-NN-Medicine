fibrillation. After ingestion of a potassium- rich meal, extracellular A special difficulty in regulating extracellular potas- fluid potassium concentration would rise to a danger- sium concentration is the fact that more than 98% of the ous level if the ingested potassium did not move into the total body potassium is contained in the cells, and only cells rapidly. For example, absorption of 40 mEq of potas- 2% is contained in the extracellular fluid (Figure 30- 1). sium (the amount contained in a meal rich in vegetables For a 70- kg adult, who has about 28 liters of intracellular and fruit) into an extracellular fluid volume of 14 liters fluid (40% of body weight) and 14 liters of extracellular would raise plasma potassium concentration by about 2.9 fluid (20% of body weight), about 3920 mEq of potas- mEq/L if all the potassium remained in the extracellular sium are inside the cells, and only about 59 mEq are in compartment. Fortunately, most of the ingested potas- the extracellular fluid. Also, the potassium contained in a sium rapidly moves into the cells until the kidneys can single meal may be as high as 50 mEq, and the daily intake eliminate the excess. Between
