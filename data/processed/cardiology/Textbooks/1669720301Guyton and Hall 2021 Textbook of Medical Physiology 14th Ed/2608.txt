from the focal plane causes extreme blurring. The greatest possible depth of focus occurs when the Hyperopia pupil is extremely small. The reason for this is that with a very small aperture, almost all the rays pass through the center of the lens, and the central most rays are always in focus, as explained earlier. Errors of Refraction See Video 50-1 . Myopia Emmetropia (Normal Vision). As shown in Figure 50- 12, Figure 50- 12. Parallel light rays focus on the retina in emmetropia, the eye is considered to be normal, or emmetropic, if parallel behind the retina in hyperopia, and in front of the retina in myopia. light rays from distant objects are in sharp focus on the retina when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed. This means that the emmetropic eye can see all distant objects clearly closer and closer to the eye can also be focused sharply un- with its ciliary muscle relaxed. However, to focus objects til the ciliary muscle has contracted to its limit. In old age, at close range, the eye must contract its ciliary muscle and when the lens becomes “presbyopic,” a farsighted person is thereby provide an appropriate degree of accommodation. often
