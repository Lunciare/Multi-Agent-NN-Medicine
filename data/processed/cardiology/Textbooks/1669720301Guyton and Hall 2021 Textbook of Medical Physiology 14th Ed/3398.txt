pancreatic juice that contains abundant amounts of sodium bicarbonate. The net result is then the following reaction in the duodenum: HCI Soap Peptone HCl+NaHCO 3→NaCl+H 2CO 3 Figure 65- 9. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO ), water, and enzyme se- 3 The carbonic acid then immediately dissociates into cretion by the pancreas, caused by the presence of acid (HCl), fat CO and water. The CO is absorbed into the blood and (soap), or peptone solutions in the duodenum. 2 2 expired through the lungs, thus leaving a neutral solu- tion of sodium chloride in the duodenum. In this way, the Acid from stomach acid contents that are emptied into the duodenum from releases secretin from the stomach become neutralized, and thus further peptic wall of duodenum; digestive activity by the gastric juices in the duodenum fats and amino acids cause release of is immediately blocked. Because the mucosa of the small cholecystokinin intestine cannot withstand the digestive action of acid Common gastric juice, this protective mechanism is essential to bile duct prevent the development of duodenal ulcers, as discussed in Chapter 67. Bicarbonate ion secretion by the pancreas provides Vagal stimulation an appropriate pH for action of the pancreatic digestive releases enzymes,
