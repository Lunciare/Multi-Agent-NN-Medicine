renin, which, in turn—by completely understood, ischemia of the placenta and sub- acting through the formation of angiotensin II—causes sequent release by the placenta of toxic factors are believed 240 Chapter 19 Role of the Kidneys in Long-T erm Control of Arterial Pressure and in Hypertension to play a role in causing many of the manifestations of this ment of the hypertension, the sympathetic nervous system disorder, including hypertension in the mother. Substances is considerably more active than in normal rats. In the later released by the ischemic placenta, in turn, cause dysfunc- stages of this type of hypertension, structural changes have tion of vascular endothelial cells throughout the body, in- been observed in the nephrons of the kidneys: (1) increased cluding the blood vessels of the kidneys. This endothelial preglomerular renal arterial resistance; and (2) decreased dysfunction decreases release of nitric oxide and other vaso- permeability of the glomerular membranes. These struc- dilator substances, causing vasoconstriction, decreased tural changes could also contribute to the long- term con- rate of fluid filtration from the glomeruli into the renal tu- tinuance of the hypertension. In other strains of hyperten- bules, impaired renal pressure natriuresis, and the develop- sive rats, impaired renal
