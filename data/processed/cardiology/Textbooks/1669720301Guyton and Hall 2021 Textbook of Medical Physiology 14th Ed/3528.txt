The first step in oxidative phos- of Hydrogen—The Process of Oxidative Phosphor- phorylation in the mitochondria is to ionize the hydrogen ylation atoms that have been removed from the food substrates. Despite all the complexities of (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric As described earlier, these hydrogen atoms are removed in acid cycle, (3) dehydrogenation, and (4) decarboxylation, pairs: one immediately becomes a hydrogen ion, H+, the pitifully small amounts of ATP are formed during all these other combines with NAD+ to form reduced nicotinamide processes—only 2 ATP molecules in the glycolysis scheme adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The upper portion of Fig- and another 2 in the citric acid cycle for each molecule of ure 68-7 shows the subsequent fate of the NADH and H+. glucose metabolized. Instead, almost 90% of the total ATP The initial effect is to release the other hydrogen atom from created through glucose metabolism is formed during sub- the NADH to form another hydrogen ion, H+; this process sequent oxidation of the hydrogen atoms that were released also reconstitutes NAD+ that will be reused repeatedly. at
