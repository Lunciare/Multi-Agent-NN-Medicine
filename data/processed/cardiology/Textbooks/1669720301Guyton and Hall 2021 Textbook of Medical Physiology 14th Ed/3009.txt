types of neurons. Most of the neurons are of three types: (1) granular (also called stel- late); (2) fusiform; and (3) pyramidal, the latter named for IV their characteristic pyramidal shape. The granular neurons generally have short axons and, therefore, function mainly as interneurons that transmit V neural signals only short distances in the cortex. Some are excitatory, releasing mainly the excitatory neurotrans- mitter glutamate, whereas others are inhibitory and release mainly the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma- VIa aminobutyric acid (GABA). The sensory areas of the cor- tex, as well as the association areas between sensory and motor areas, have large concentrations of these granule VIb cells, suggesting a high degree of intracortical processing of incoming sensory signals within the sensory areas and association areas. The pyramidal and fusiform cells give rise to almost Figure 58- 1. Structure of the cerebral cortex, showing the following all the output fibers from the cortex. The pyramidal cells, layers: I, molecular layer; II, external granular layer; III, layer of pyramidal which are larger and more numerous than the fusiform cells; IV, internal granular layer; V, large pyramidal cell layer; and VI, cells, are the source of the long, large nerve fibers that go layer
