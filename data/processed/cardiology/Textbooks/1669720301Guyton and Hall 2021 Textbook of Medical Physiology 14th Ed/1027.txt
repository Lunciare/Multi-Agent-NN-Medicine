Systemic arterial blood can then be obtained from on the aorta or pulmonary artery to measure cardiac out- any systemic artery in the body. The rate of oxygen absorp- put.

Pulsatile Output of the Heart Measured by Electromagnetic or Ultrasonic Indicator Dilution Method Flowmeter To measure cardiac output by the indicator dilution Figure 20- 18 shows a recording in a dog of blood flow method, a small amount of indicator, such as a dye, is in the root of the aorta; this recording was made using injected into a large systemic vein or, preferably, into the an electromagnetic flowmeter. It demonstrates that the right atrium. This indicator passes rapidly through the blood flow rises rapidly to a peak during systole and then, right side of the heart, then through the blood vessels of at the end of systole, it reverses
