This rapid initial transmission of the wave allows the high-f requency sounds to travel far enough into the cochlea The organ of Corti, shown in Figure 53- 2 and Figure to spread out and separate from one another on the basilar 53- 6, is the receptor organ that generates nerve impulses membrane. Without this rapid initial transmission, all the in response to vibration of the basilar membrane. Note high-f requency waves would be bunched together within that the organ of Corti lies on the surface of the basilar the first millimeter or so of the basilar membrane, and their fibers and basilar membrane. The actual sensory recep- frequencies could not be discriminated. tors in the organ of Corti are two specialized types of Vibration Amplitude Pattern of the Basilar nerve cells called hair cells—a single row of internal (or Membrane. The dashed curves of Figure 53- 5A show “inner”) hair cells, numbering about 3500 and measuring the position of a sound wave on the basilar membrane about 12 micrometers in diameter, and three or four
