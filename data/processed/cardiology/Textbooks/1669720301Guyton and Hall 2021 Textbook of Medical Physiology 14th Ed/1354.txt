Because the filtration fraction increase markedly, causing serious reduction of GFR. For is defined as the GFR divided by the renal plasma flow, the example, precipitation of calcium or of uric acid may lead filtration fraction can be increased by raising the GFR or 334 diolloc raluremolG erusserp citomso )gH mm( Chapter 27 Glomerular Filtration, Renal Blood Flow, and Their Control by reducing renal plasma flow. For example, a reduction R A in renal plasma flow with no initial change in GFR would tend to increase the filtration fraction, which would raise P G the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and RReennaall tend to reduce the GFR. For this reason, changes in renal bblloooodd ffllooww blood flow can influence GFR independently of changes GFR in glomerular hydrostatic pressure. With increasing renal blood flow, a lower fraction of the plasma is initially filtered out of the glomerular cap- illaries, causing a slower rise in the glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure and less inhibitory effect on R E the GFR. Consequently, even with a constant glomerular P G hydrostatic pressure,
