However, the fetal heart must whereas immediately after birth, virtually all the blood pump large quantities of blood through the placenta. flows through the lungs. Therefore, special anatomical arrangements cause the fetal Changes in Fetal Circulation at Birth circulatory system to operate much differently from that of the newborn baby. The basic changes in fetal circulation at birth are discussed First, as shown in Figure 84- 4, blood returning from in Chapter 23 in relation to congenital anomalies of the the placenta through the umbilical vein passes through the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale that persist through- ductus venosus, mainly bypassing the liver.
