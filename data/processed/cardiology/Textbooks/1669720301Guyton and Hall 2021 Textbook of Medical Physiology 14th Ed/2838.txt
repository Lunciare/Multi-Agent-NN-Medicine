The Primary and the Secondary Endings Both Respond Motor nerve to the Length of the Receptor—“Static” Response.

This effect is called the static response of the spin- dle receptor, meaning that both the primary and secondary response while having little influence on the dynamic re- endings continue to transmit their signals for at least sev- sponse. Subsequent paragraphs illustrate that these two eral minutes if the muscle spindle remains stretched. types of muscle spindle responses are important in differ- ent types of muscle control.
