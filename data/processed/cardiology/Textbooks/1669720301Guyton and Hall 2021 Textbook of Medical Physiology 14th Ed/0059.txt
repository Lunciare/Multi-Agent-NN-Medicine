of the mitochondrion is filled with a matrix that One of the important functions of many cells is secretion contains large quantities of dissolved enzymes necessary of special chemical substances. Almost all such secretory for extracting energy from nutrients. These enzymes oper- substances are formed by the endoplasmic reticulum– ate in association with oxidative enzymes on the cristae Golgi apparatus system and are then released from the to cause oxidation of nutrients, thereby forming carbon Golgi apparatus into the cytoplasm in the form of stor- dioxide and water and, at the same time, releasing energy. age vesicles called secretory vesicles or secretory granules. The liberated energy is used to synthesize a high-e nergy Figure 2-6 shows typical secretory vesicles inside pancre- substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is atic acinar cells; these vesicles store protein proenzymes then transported out of the mitochondrion and diffuses (enzymes that are not yet activated). The proenzymes are throughout the cell to release its own energy wherever it secreted later through the outer cell membrane into the is needed for performing cellular functions.
