muscle. When an action Ca2+ Ca2+ Na+ potential is transmitted into the caveolae, this is believed Extracellular fluid to excite calcium ion release from the abutting sarcoplas- ATP mic tubules in the same way that action potentials in skel- etal muscle transverse tubules cause release of calcium Sarcoplasmic reticulum ions from the skeletal muscle longitudinal sarcoplasmic Na+ tubules. In general, the more extensive the sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATP Ca2+ reticulum in the smooth muscle fiber, the more rapidly it contracts. CaM Smooth Muscle Contraction Is Dependent on Extra- cellular Calcium Ion Concentration. Whereas chang- Ca2+ CaM ing the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration from normal has little effect on the force of contraction of Myosin skeletal muscle, this is not true for most smooth muscle. P P phosphatase When the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration P decreases to about 1/3 to 1/10 normal, smooth muscle P contraction usually ceases. Therefore, the force of con- traction of smooth muscle is usually highly dependent on Inactive myosin Phosphorylated myosin decreases the extracellular fluid calcium ion concentration. A Calcium Pump Is Required to Cause Smooth Muscle Relaxation. To cause relaxation of smooth muscle after it Muscle has contracted, the calcium ions must be removed
