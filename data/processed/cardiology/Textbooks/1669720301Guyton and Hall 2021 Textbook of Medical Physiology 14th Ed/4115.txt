The importance of the stimulatory effects of these hormones is that prolonged 15 secretion of any one of them in large quantities can occa- sionally lead to exhaustion of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and thereby increase the risk for development 10 of diabetes mellitus. Indeed, diabetes often occurs in peo- ple who receive high pharmacological maintenance doses 5 of some of these hormones. Diabetes is particularly com- mon in giants or in acromegalic people who have tumors X 0 that secrete growth hormone, as well as in people whose 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 adrenal glands secrete excess glucocorticoids.
