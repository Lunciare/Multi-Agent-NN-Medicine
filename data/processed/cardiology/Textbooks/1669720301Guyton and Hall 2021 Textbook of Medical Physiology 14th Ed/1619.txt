the pressure natriuresis and pressure diure- ume and extracellular fluid volume usually are controlled sis mechanisms, making them more effective in mini- simultaneously. mizing the changes in blood volume, extracellular fluid There are circumstances, however, in which the dis- volume, and arterial pressure that occur in response to tribution of extracellular fluid between the interstitial daily challenges. In many cases, nervous and hormonal spaces and blood can vary greatly. As discussed in Chap- mechanisms can regulate renal sodium and water excre- ter 25, the principal factors that can cause accumulation tion and maintain balance between intake and output of fluid in the interstitial spaces include the following: (1) without significant changes in blood pressure. However, increased capillary hydrostatic pressure; (2) decreased abnormalities of kidney function or of the various ner- plasma colloid osmotic pressure; (3) increased permeabil- vous and hormonal factors that influence the kidneys can ity of the capillaries; and (4) obstruction of lymphatic ves- lead to serious changes in blood pressure and body fluid sels. In all these conditions, an unusually high proportion volumes, as discussed later. of the extracellular fluid becomes distributed to the inter- stitial spaces.
