behavior. Some of these inputs to the hypothalamus are shown in Figure 72- 1. The hypothalamic feeding and satiety centers have a high density of receptors for neurotransmitters and hormones that influence feeding behavior. A few of the many substances that have been shown to alter appetite and feeding behavior in experimental studies are listed in Table 72- 2 and are gen- Vagus nerve erally categorized as (1) orexigenic substances that stimulate feeding or (2) anorexigenic substances that inhibit feeding. Neurons and Neurotransmitters in the Hypothalamus That Stimulate or Inhibit Feeding. Two distinct types of neurons in the arcuate nuclei of the hypothal- amus are especially important as controllers of both appetite and energy expenditure (Figure 72- 2): (1) pro- opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that produce α– Stomach Fat melanocyte- stimulating hormone (α- MSH) together with Ghrelin cocaine- and amphetamine- related transcript (CART); Leptin Pancreas and (2) neurons that produce the orexigenic substances Insulin neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti- related protein (AGRP). Activation of the POMC neurons decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure, whereas activation of PYY CCK the NPY-A GRP neurons has the opposite effects, increas- ing food intake and reducing energy expenditure.
