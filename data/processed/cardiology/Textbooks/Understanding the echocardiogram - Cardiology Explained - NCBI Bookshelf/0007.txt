of the A wave (see Figure 5). However, in conditions that limit the compliance of the LV, two abnormalities are possible: Figure 5 E and A waves representing mitral flow in a healthy heart (E>A). reversal – in which the A wave is greater than the E wave. This indicates slow filling caused by older age, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or diastolic dysfunction exaggeration of normal – a tall, thin E wave with a small or absent A wave. This indicates restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, or infiltrative cardiac disease (eg, amyloidosis) Diastolic dysfunction A normal LV ejection fraction in the presence of the heart failure syndrome leads to a search for diastolic dysfunction. Typical echo findings in diastolic dysfunction are normal LV cavity size, 3/5 thickened ventricle, and reversed E/A ratio. Wall-motion abnormality When ischemia occurs, contractile abnormalities of segments of the myocardium can be detected by echo prior to the appearance of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or symptoms. Therefore, echo can be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of both stable coronary artery disease (via stress echo) and acute myocardial infarction. In the former situation, it offers localization of the ischemic region where the ECG cannot; in the latter,
