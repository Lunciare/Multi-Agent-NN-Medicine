heart: two-dimensional (2D) imaging M-mode imaging Doppler imaging Two-dimensional imaging 2D imaging is the mainstay of echo imaging and allows structures to be viewed moving in real time in a cross-section of the heart (two dimensions). It is used for detecting abnormal anatomy or abnormal movement of structures. The most common cross-sectional views are the parasternal long axis, the parasternal short axis, and the apical view (see Figure 1). The gastric or subcostal and suprasternal views are also commonly used. Figure 1 The most common two-dimensional imaging echo views. The first line illustrates the three planes (think of them as three plates of glass intersecting at 90°), the second line shows these three planes separated, and the third line shows the accompanying (more...) M-mode imaging The M-mode echo, which provides a 1D view, is used for fine measurements. Temporal and spatial resolutions are higher because the focus is on only one of the lines from the 2D trace (see Figure 2). Figure 2 M-mode image of (a) the aorta/left atrium and (b) the mitral valve, both in a healthy heart. Doppler imaging The concept of Doppler imaging is familiar to all those who have heard the note of a police
