the aorta (which is reduced already compared with normal) are measured. Mitral stenosis With mitral stenosis (MS), as with AS, calcified, immobile MV leaflets can be demonstrated with 2D and M-mode echo. Anterior motion of the posterior MV leaflet in diastole (caused by commissural fusion) is characteristic in MS. Doppler demonstrates increased flow velocity and can be used to estimate the effective orifice area (see Table 3). Table 3 Echo characteristics of mitral stenosis. Mitral regurgitation As with aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation is assessed using CFM. The severity of mitral regurgitation is commonly reported as the area of the regurgitant jet expressed as a percentage of the area of the left atrium. Mitral valve prolapse The criteria for the diagnosis of MV prolapse (MVP) from an echo have changed over the years. Initial reports using the 4-chamber view suggested a population prevalence of almost 20%. However, a more accurate figure of approximately 5% results from stricter criteria. Most diagnose only on the basis of the parasternal long axis view. Some go so far as to suggest it is invalid to diagnose MVP on the 4-chamber view at all.
