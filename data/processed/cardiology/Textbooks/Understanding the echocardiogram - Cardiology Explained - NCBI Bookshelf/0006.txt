Understanding the echocardiogram - Cardiology Explained

a right-to-left shunt. Applications Echo is the cheapest and least invasive method available for screening cardiac anatomy. Generalists most commonly request an echo to assess left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, to rule out the heart as a thromboembolic source, and to characterize murmurs. The approximate normal values for various cardiac structures are described in Table 1. Table 1 The approximate normal values for various cardiac structures. IV: interventricular; LV: left ventricular. Systolic dysfunction LV systolic dysfunction is assessed using the ejection fraction (the percentage of the end diastolic volume ejected during systole). In most cases, this is estimated by eye from all the available echo views. A normal ejection fraction is 50%–80%, but values as low as 5% are compatible with life (end-stage heart failure). The E/A ratio When flow across the MV is assessed with PW Doppler, two waves are characteristically seen. These represent passive filling of the ventricle (early [E] wave) and active filling with atrial systole (atrial [A] wave). Classically, the E-wave velocity is slightly greater than that of the A wave (see Figure 5). However, in conditions that limit the compliance of the LV, two abnormalities are possible: Figure 5 E and A waves representing mitral flow
