Understanding the echocardiogram - Cardiology Explained

until it is level with the heart. This position provides especially clear views. It is particularly useful for imaging posterior cardiac structures. The key indications for TEE are: infective endocarditis – if vegetations are not seen on transthoracic echo, but suspicion is high, or with prosthetic valves to rule out an embolic source (especially in atrial fibrillation) 2/5 acute dissection mitral valve (MV) disease preoperatively Contrast echocardiography Contrast echo can be useful for confirming a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD). Agitating saline or synthetic contrast create microbubbles. These are very reflective, and when injected intravenously can be seen as opacification in the echo window. They are normally seen on the right side of the heart before being trapped and absorbed by the pulmonary capillaries, so have no route to the left side of the heart. The contrast created by the bubbles allows a left-to-right shunt to be seen as a jet "interrupting" the opacification of the right atrium. However, there is a theoretical risk of systemic air embolism with a right-to-left shunt. Applications Echo is the cheapest and least invasive method available for screening cardiac anatomy. Generalists most commonly request an echo to assess left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, to
