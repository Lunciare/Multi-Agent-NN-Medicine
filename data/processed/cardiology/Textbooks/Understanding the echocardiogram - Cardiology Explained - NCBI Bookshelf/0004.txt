signal. Pulsed-wave Doppler PW Doppler was developed because of the need to make localized velocity measurements of turbulent flow (it measures the blood-flow velocity within a small area at a specified tissue depth). It is used to assess ventricular in-flow patterns, intracardiac shunts, and to make precise measurements of blood flow at valve orifices. Color-flow mapping CFM uses measurements of the velocity and direction of blood flow to superimpose a color pattern onto a section of a 2D image (see Figure 4). Traditionally, flow towards the transducer is red, flow away from the transducer is blue, and higher velocities are shown in lighter shades. To aid observation of turbulent flow there is a threshold velocity, above which the color changes (in some systems to green). This leads to a "mosaic" pattern at the site of turbulent flow and enables sensitive screening for regurgitant flow. Figure 4 Color-flow mapping. Transesophageal echocardiography Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is usually carried out under mild sedation with midazolam. A thin probe is passed down the esophagus until it is level with the heart. This position provides especially clear views. It is particularly useful for imaging posterior cardiac structures. The key indications for TEE are: infective endocarditis
