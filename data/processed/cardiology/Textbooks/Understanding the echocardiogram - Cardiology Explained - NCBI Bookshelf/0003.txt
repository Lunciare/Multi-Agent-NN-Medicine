and (b) the mitral valve, both in a healthy heart. Doppler imaging The concept of Doppler imaging is familiar to all those who have heard the note of a police siren change as it moves past them – as the police siren travels towards you, the frequency of the wave (pitch) appears to be higher than if it was stationary; as the siren travels away, the pitch appears to be lower. Estimates of blood-flow velocity can be made by comparing the frequency change between the transmitted and reflected sound waves. In cardiac ultrasound, Doppler is used in three ways: continuous-wave (CW) Doppler pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler color-flow mapping (CFM) Continuous-wave Doppler CW Doppler is sensitive, but, because it measures velocity along the entire length of the ultrasound beam and not at a specific depth, it does not localize velocity measurements of blood flow. It is used to estimate the severity of valve stenosis or regurgitation by assessing the shape or density of the output (see Figure 3). Figure 3 Continuous-wave Doppler signal. Pulsed-wave Doppler PW Doppler was developed because of the need to make localized velocity measurements of turbulent flow (it measures the blood-flow velocity within a small area at a
