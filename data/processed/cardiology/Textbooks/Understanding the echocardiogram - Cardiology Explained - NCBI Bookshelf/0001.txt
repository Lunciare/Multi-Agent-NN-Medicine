Chapter 4 Understanding the echocardiogram Although few generalists actually perform echocardiograms, most order or have to interpret them at some stage. Our aim then is not to explain how to carry out echocardiography, but how to realize its potential and limitations. Background "Ultra" sound has a frequency above the range audible by humans (ie, >20,000 Hz). For adult cardiac imaging, ultrasound waves in the range of 4–7 MHz are used (intravascular ultrasound uses frequencies as high as 30 MHz). These are created within the ultrasound probe by striking piezo-electric crystals with an electric pulse, which stimulates the crystals to release sound waves. The central principle of ultrasound imaging is that, while most waves are absorbed by the body, those at interfaces between different tissue densities are reflected. In addition to emitting the ultrasound waves, the transducer detects the returning waves, processes the information, and displays it as characteristic images. Higher frequency ultrasound waves increase resolution, but decrease tissue penetration. Imaging modes There are three basic "modes" used to image the heart: two-dimensional (2D) imaging M-mode imaging Doppler imaging Two-dimensional imaging 2D imaging is the mainstay of echo imaging and allows structures to be viewed moving in real time in a
