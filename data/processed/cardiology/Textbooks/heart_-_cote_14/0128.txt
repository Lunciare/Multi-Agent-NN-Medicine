Report the application of the following formula: . Pressure Data Qs (L/min) = Vo 2 (L/min)/Sao 2 content − MVo 2 content Atrial pressure tracings are characterized by several waves (a, c, where Vo = oxygen consumption (assumed or measured), Sao 2 2 and v waves) and descents (x and y). Th e right atrial pressure is = systemic arterial O content, MVo = mixed venous O content, 2 2 2 typically “a” wave dominant. Th e mean right atrial pressure is and O content = O saturation × (1.36 × 10 × hemoglobin 2 2 normally less than 5 mm Hg. In the presence of signifi cant tri- concentration). cuspid valve regurgitation or a junctional rhythm, the “v” wave becomes the dominant wave. Th e left atrial pressure tracing in Vascular Resistances contrast to the right atrium, displays “v” wave dominance, which Resistance represents the change in pressure in the systemic or is accentuated during mitral regurgitation. Th e mean left atrial pulmonary circulation with respect to fl ow. Th is is expressed as pressure rarely exceeds 8 mm Hg. Th e reported values for atrial mm Hg/L/min (Wood units) and is usually normalized for body pressures correspond to
