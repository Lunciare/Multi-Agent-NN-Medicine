10-year-old child. The typical left-sided heart dominant confi guration of children this age is noted (gradual RS progression with tall R waves in the left precordial leads [V and V]). This is in contrast to the right ventricular dominant pattern seen 5 6 during infancy and early childhood. The tracing demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, as documented by positive P waves in leads I and aVF. 309 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children I aVR V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-13. Biatrial enlargement. The tracing was obtained in the emergency department setting in a child subsequently found to have restrictive cardiomyopathy. There is evidence of biatrial enlargement as determined by the tall and wide P waves in leads II and V, 1 respectively. with prolongation of the QRS duration include ventricular pre- gestive of myocardial ischemia and require further evaluation. excitation and ventricular pacing. An additional, relatively rare but crucial, fi nding occurs in In addition to the QRS duration, the components of the QRS infants with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising complex should be examined. Q waves are often present in the from the pulmonary
