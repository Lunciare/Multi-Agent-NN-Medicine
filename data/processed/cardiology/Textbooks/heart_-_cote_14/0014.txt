as well as ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The recording is displayed at full standard (10 mm/mV, meaning that the ECG was not reduced in size to fi t on the paper) as are all other ECG tracings in this chapter for reference. 296 14 agents for outpatient drug therapy.51 Long-term treatment is individualized and based on the degree of hypertrophy, presence of ventricular ectopy, symptomatology (including syncope and congestive heart failure), family history, and genetic mutation analysis when available. Th erapies range widely and include longitudinal observation with medical management of heart failure and arrhythmias, implantation of cardioverter-defi brilla- tors, surgical myotomy/myectomy, transcatheter alcohol septal ablation, and cardiac transplantation. Patients with HCM are usually restricted from participating in competitive sports activities.50 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), also known as congestive cardiomyopathy, is characterized by thinning of the left ven- tricular myocardium, dilation of the ventricular cavity, and impaired systolic function.52-54 Th ere is a broader range of etiologies than with HCM, ranging from genetic/familial forms with multiple types of inheritance patterns to those caused by infections (adenovirus, coxsackievirus, human immunodefi - ciency virus55), metabolic derangements (thyroid disorders, mitochondrial disorders, carnitine defi ciency), toxic exposures A (anthracyclines), and degenerative disorders (Becker and Du-
