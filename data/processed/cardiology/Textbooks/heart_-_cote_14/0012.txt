primary cardiomyopathies or other forms of thickness, ventricular dimensions, presence and severity of acquired heart disease such as myocarditis are characterized as obstruction, systolic and diastolic function, valve competence, having heart muscle disease (see later). Th ey frequently have and response to therapy. Other diagnostic approaches such as impaired ventricular function, either systolic or diastolic, and cardiac catheterization and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefi t from therapies tailored to their particular disease process. may add helpful information in some cases. Th e care of children with HCM includes maintenance of Acquired Heart Disease adequate preload, particularly in those with dynamic obstruc- tion.
