cardiovascular pathology Also known as Edwards syndrome, trisomy 18 is recognized as includes valvar and supravalvular aortic stenosis (Fig. 14-7) and the second most common chromosomal trisomy (incidence of coarctation of the aorta.183,184 Th e arteriopathy found in these 303 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children is overwhelmingly associated with the deletion, it should be considered in any child with a conotruncal anomaly, neonatal hypocalcemia, or any of the less common features when seen in association with dysmorphic facial features. Cardiac anomalies are often described as conotruncal anom- alies; however, outfl ow tract anomalies are also frequently seen.191 Th e remainder of the cardiac defects crosses an enor- Asc Ao mous spectrum, ranging from hypoplastic left ventricle to vas- cular rings. Only a minority of children with this chromosomal Ao V deletion have a normal cardiovascular system. Th e immune system is aff ected in a signifi cant number of children. As a con- sequence of thymic hypoplasia, children typically have dimin- ished T-cell numbers and function. Th e immunodefi ciency requires the use of irradiated blood products and strict aseptic precautions during vascular access. Neurodevelopmental fea- tures include primarily speech delay as well as attention-defi cit disorders.
