Measurements of Cardiac Chambers and Vessel Dimensions Pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler represent spectral A number of measurements are routinely performed during an modalities that complement the color fl ow data and provide echocardiographic examination. Th ese generally include ven- quantitative information. Pulsed-wave interrogation is advanta- tricular dimensions such as left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) geous in localizing specifi c sites of stenosis or turbulence but is and end-systolic (LVES) dimensions, thickness of the interven- limited in the magnitude of velocities it can detect. Continuous- tricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall, as well as wave Doppler, on the other hand, allows for quantifi cation measurements of valve sizes and great artery dimensions.
