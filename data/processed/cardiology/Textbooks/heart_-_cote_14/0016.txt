Management may include inotropic support (including phosphodiesterase inhibition) and mechani- cal ventilation. Unlike children with HCM, those with DCM have a volume-loaded, poorly contractile ventricle(s); therefore, gentle diuresis is benefi cial. Th e infusion of large fl uid boluses B might be poorly tolerated and result in hemodynamic decom- pensation and cardiovascular collapse. Th e outcome of children with dilated cardiomyopathy is variable. In most, recovery of left Figure 14-3. Chest radiographs in a young child with dilated ventricular systolic function occurs; however, others eventually cardiomyopathy in the posteroanterior (A) and lateral (B) projec- require cardiac transplantation.62 In a subset of children with tions demonstrating moderate to severe cardiomegaly and severe disease, mechanical circulatory support may be neces- pulmonary vascular congestion. The lateral fi lm shows the heart sary as a bridge to recovery or cardiac transplantation (Fig. 14-4, bulging anteriorly against the sternum. see Chapter 19).63-65 Once initial stabilization is achieved, the treatment strategy typically switches to β blockade and afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least common of syncopal or near sudden death event. Th e physical examination the major subsets of cardiomyopathies (5%) and portends a may demonstrate hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, and
