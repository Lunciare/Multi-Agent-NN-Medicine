Atrioventricular Block common in infants and small children. On the ECG the early P Th ird-degree AV block is characterized by total failure of con- waves exhibit a morphology and axis that diff er from those in duction of atrial impulses to the ventricle. It can be either con- normal sinus rhythm. Premature atrial contractions may be con- genital or acquired. Th ere is complete AV dissociation, with ducted to the ventricles normally, blocked at the AV node, or more atrial than ventricular contractions, and the ventricular conduct aberrantly (abnormal QRS morphology). Th ese are rate is usually slow and regular (Fig. 14-20). Temporary pacing usually benign and require no therapy. If a central venous cath- may be indicated in the acute setting. eter is present, the tip position should be evaluated. 315 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children II Figure 14-20. Surface ECG tracing demonstrates independent atrial and ventricular activity (atrioventricular dissociation) and failure of any atrial impulses to conduct to the ventricles. These are features of complete atrioventricular block. Supraventricular Tachycardia maneuvers should also be obtained. Th e management of SVT Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common signifi - depends on the clinical status of
