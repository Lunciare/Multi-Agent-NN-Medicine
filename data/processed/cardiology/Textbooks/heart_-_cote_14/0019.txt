treatment is controversial because no cifi c viral syndrome. A large 10-year population-based study on specifi c agents or strategies have been shown to signifi cantly cardiomyopathy found an annual incidence of 1.24 per 100,000 alter outcomes.71 Similar to children with HCM, diuretics often children younger than 10 years of age, only a fraction of which cause a decrease in the needed preload with detrimental eff ects represented those with myocarditis.77 Th e diagnosis is made on hemodynamics. Inotropic agents are not benefi cial because utilizing clinical history, physical examination, and imaging systolic function is typically preserved and the arrhythmogenic modalities. A child with new-onset congestive heart failure or properties of inotropic drugs can induce a terminal event. In many ventricular arrhythmias without evidence of structural heart centers cardiac transplantation has been eff ectively utilized.72,73 disease should be considered to have myocarditis until proven otherwise. An ECG will typically demonstrate low-voltage QRS Myocarditis complexes with tachycardia, sometimes ventricular in origin. Myocarditis is defi ned as infl ammation of the myocardium, Chest radiography often shows cardiomegaly with pulmonary often associated with necrosis and myocyte degeneration.
