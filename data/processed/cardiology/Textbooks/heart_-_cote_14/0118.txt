Slow heart rates the ventricles, implying that the defect is pressure restrictive and and low respiratory rates facilitate this process. MRI, in contrast the right ventricular and pulmonary artery systolic pressures are to CT, does not involve radiation exposure, making it preferable relatively low. for serial examinations that many young children with cardio- 323 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children vascular pathology require.
