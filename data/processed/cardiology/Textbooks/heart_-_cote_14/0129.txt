Ventricular pressures are recorded and reported during Th e systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) systole, at end systole, and at end diastole. For the right ventricle are derived as follows: the systolic pressure is normally in the 25- to 30-mm Hg range, . with end-diastolic pressure of 5 to 7 mm Hg.

Th e pulmonary artery pressure is reported in terms of systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures. Th e systolic pulmonary artery pressure in a normal child should be equal to the right ventricular systolic pressure, and the mean Considerations in the Perioperative pulmonary artery pressure should not exceed 20 mm
