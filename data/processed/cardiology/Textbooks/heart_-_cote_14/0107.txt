Using a variety of probes, ultrasound waves evaluation (color fl ow, pulsed-wave, continuous-wave modali- are used to acquire real time images of cardiovascular struc- ties). Two-dimensional imaging provides structural assessment tures. Various echocardiographic modalities are available, of the heart and adjacent vasculature. Cross-sectional images including transthoracic,270 transesophageal,271-274 fetal,275,276 epi- are obtained from a number of windows that allow for excellent cardial,277 intracardiac imaging,278 and intravascular ultra- anatomic detail in multiple planes (Video Clip 14-11).

M-mode echocar- nature, provision of excellent temporal and spatial resolution, diography allows for a one-dimensional imaging of the heart generation of portable real-time images, cost-eff ectiveness, and with excellent temporal resolution (Fig. 14-27). It is otherwise ease of use. As with any type of ultrasound, these waves are known as an
