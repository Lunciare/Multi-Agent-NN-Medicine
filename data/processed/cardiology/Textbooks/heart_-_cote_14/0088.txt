A premature atrial beat initiates a narrow complex tachycardia (QRS morphology same as in sinus rhythm). The supraventricular tachycardia is associated with hemodynamic changes (note the decrease in the systemic arterial pressure, ART 1, scale 0-100 mm Hg and the increase in the central venous pressure, CVP, scale 0-30 mm Hg; oxygen saturation, SpO2). 316 14 Ventricular Arrhythmias diate morphology between two other distinct QRS morpholo- gies), (3) QRS morphology of VT similar to that of single PVCs, Premature Ventricular Contractions or Beats and (4) tachycardia rate in children usually below 250 beats per Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are characterized by minute.
