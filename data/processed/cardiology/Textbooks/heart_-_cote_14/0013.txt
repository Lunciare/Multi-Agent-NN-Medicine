Patients usually undergo continuous ECG moni- common types in children are hypertrophic, dilated or conges- toring (Holter recording) and exercise testing for risk stratifi ca- tive, and restrictive cardiomyopathies. Other forms include left tion.50 β blockers and calcium-channel blockers are the primary 295 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children I aVR V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-1. ECG in adolescent female with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy demonstrating left ventricular hypertrophy (deep S wave in V 1 and tall R waves over the left precordial leads). There is ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion over the left precordial leads related to repolarization changes associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, also known as a “strain” pattern. Reciprocal ST-segment elevation is noted over the right precordial leads. I aVR V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-2. Tracing in a patient with Pompe disease, a severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy displaying dramatic right and left ventricular voltages, as well as ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. The recording is displayed at full standard (10 mm/mV, meaning that the ECG was not reduced in size to fi t on the
