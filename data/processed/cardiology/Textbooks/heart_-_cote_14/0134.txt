Norwood procedure (stage I Involves aortic reconstruction, an atrial Addresses systemic outfl ow tract obstruction by palliation) septectomy, and placement of a systemic- allowing the right ventricle to eject into a to-pulmonary artery shunt reconstructed aorta. The atrial septectomy provides for unobstructed drainage of the pulmonary venous return into the right atrium. The systemic-to- pulmonary artery shunt supplies the pulmonary blood fl ow. Pulmonary artery banding Constrictive band placed around main Limits excessive pulmonary blood fl ow pulmonary artery Rastelli operation Creation of an intracardiac tunnel that Allows for the left ventricle to eject solely into the allows for left ventricular output into the aorta at the same time as it abolishes the intracardiac aorta while closing a ventricular septal shunting at the ventricular level and provides for defect and placement of a right unobstructed pulmonary blood fl ow. The procedure ventricular conduit to pulmonary artery results in separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations.
