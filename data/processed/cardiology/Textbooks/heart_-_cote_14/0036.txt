thus the natural history and optimal treatment strategies are often determined from limited case series.125-127 Unlike adults, Etiology and Clinical Features in whom atrial myxomas represent more than 90% of cardiac Causes of heart failure diff er with age. In the perinatal period, tumors, in children they tend to be either rhabdomyomas cardiac dysfunction is typically related to birth asphyxia or or fi bromas.128 Less common types include hemangiomas, sepsis or may represent an early presentation of CHD. Th e myxomas (Video Clip 14-9), Purkinje cell tumors, and terato- neonate with heart failure typically presents with clinical signs mas. Whereas in adults, most tumors are found in the left of a low-cardiac output state. Causes include left-sided outfl ow atrium, cardiac tumors in children occur in all four cardiac obstruction (as in aortic stenosis, aortic coarctation, hypoplastic chambers. Malignant primary tumors are extremely rare, and left heart syndrome), severe valve regurgitation (as seen in data on their outcomes are even more limited. Ebstein anomaly), or absent pulmonary valve syndrome. Rhabdomyomas are the most common primary cardiac During the fi rst year of life most cases of heart failure are tumors in children. Th ey often involve the ventricular septum caused
