component of the cardiac cycle as represented on the ECG diagnosis, and indications for the examination. A number of should be examined. Th e P wave represents atrial systole; and requirements are essential for accurate interpretation. Th ese its morphology, with particular interest in leads II and V, can 1 include appropriate skin preparation, electrode placement, and demonstrate either right atrial (P wave amplitude >2.5 mm or an artifact-free recording. A systematic, organized approach to 3.0 mm based on age) or left atrial (P wave duration >100 to the pediatric ECG is suggested. Determination of the rate and 120 msec based on age) enlargement (Fig. 14-13). Th e PR inter- rhythm, with evaluation of the P wave vector and the relation- val represents the time required for passage of an impulse from ship between each P wave and QRS complex, is the fi rst step. It the sinoatrial node until ventricular depolarization and is largely is important to consider the infl uences of age, autonomic composed of the atrioventricular nodal delay. A prolonged PR nervous system, level of physical activity, medications, pain, and interval, which is age specifi c, indicates fi rst-degree atrioven- temperature on the child’s heart rate. Th
