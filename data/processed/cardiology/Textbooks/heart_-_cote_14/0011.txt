An decrease preload or afterload (standing, Valsalva maneuver) or important goal in single-ventricle management involves optimi- increase contractility. Th e murmur decreases in intensity with zation of the balance between the pulmonary and systemic cir- squatting and isometric handgrip. A mitral regurgitant murmur culations early in life. Th is relates to the fact that a low pulmonary may also be present.
