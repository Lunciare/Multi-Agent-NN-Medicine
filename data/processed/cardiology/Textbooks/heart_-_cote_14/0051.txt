A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children

tracheoesophageal fi stula is found in a large number of aff ected infants. Low birth weight (<1500 g) and associated cardiac pathology have been identifi ed to be independent predictors of mortality in infants undergoing surgery for esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fi stula (see Chapter 36). Th e presence of a ductal-dependent cardiac lesion further increases perioperative morbidity and mortality.209 Limb defects occur in most children and include absent or displaced thumbs, polydactyly, syndactyly, and forearm abnormalities. Th ese may impact vascular access and monitor placement. Renal defects are noted in approximately 50% of children. CHARGE Association CHARGE association is characterized by congenital anomalies that include coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarda- tion of growth and development, genitourinary problems, and ear abnormalities. Th e association is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 12,000 live births. Th e etiology is unknown, but it has been suggested that defi ciency in migration of neural crest cells, defi ciency of mesodermal formation, or defective interaction between neural crest cells and mesoderm play a part in these defects of blastogenesis.210,211 Specifi c genetic abnormalities have also been identifi ed in some Figure 14-8.
