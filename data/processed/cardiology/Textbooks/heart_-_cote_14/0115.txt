a complementary technology to other traditional imaging performance, even in the absence of clinical disease. Some of modalities (Video Clips 14-14 and 14-15). Benefi ts have been the newer techniques being used in the assessment of ventricu- reported in the assessment of complex pathology,292,294-298 delin- lar function include (1) myocardial performance index (MPI), eation of systemic and pulmonary vascular anomalies,297,298 also known as the Tei index, which combines systolic and dia- evaluation of global and regional ventricular function,299 assess- stolic intervals to assess global ventricular function284-286; (2) ment of myocardial viability,300 and characterization of pulmo- Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) to evaluate intramural myocardial nary blood supply in children with structural alterations of the velocities287; and (3) strain and strain rate imaging to quantitate pulmonary vascular tree.301 Particularly interesting applications the rate of segmental myocardial deformation.288 Although that may further expand the utility of MRI in cardiovascular values in normal children have been established for all of these medicine include the quantifi cation of left-to-right shunts302-304 imaging modalities and alterations in the presence of pathologic and measurement of blood oxygen saturation.305 Furthermore, conditions have been described,289,290 additional studies docu- MRI has been found to be of benefi t for guiding interventions
