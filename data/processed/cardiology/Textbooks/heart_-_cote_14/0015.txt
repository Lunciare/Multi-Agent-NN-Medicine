those caused by infections (adenovirus, coxsackievirus, human immunodefi - ciency virus55), metabolic derangements (thyroid disorders, mitochondrial disorders, carnitine defi ciency), toxic exposures A (anthracyclines), and degenerative disorders (Becker and Du- chenne muscular dystrophy).56,57 Chronic tachyarrhythmias can also lead to DCM that may or may not improve once the rhythm disturbance is controlled.58-60 Most children with DCM present with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (tachypnea, tachycardia, gallop rhythm, diminished pulses, hepatomegaly). Th e chest radio- graph typically demonstrates cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and, in some cases, atelectasis (Fig. 14-3). An ECG may identify the likely cause of the cardiac dysfunction in those with cardiomyopathy secondary to rhythm disorders or anoma- lous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary root. Th e echocardiogram is essential for diagnosis and characteristi- cally demonstrates a dilated left ventricle and systolic functional impairment (reduced shortening fraction and ejection fraction) (Video Clip 14-6).61 Th erapy in the short term is supportive and aimed at stabilization by controlling congestive heart failure and ventricular dysfunction. Management may include inotropic support (including phosphodiesterase inhibition) and mechani- cal ventilation. Unlike children with HCM, those with DCM have a volume-loaded, poorly contractile ventricle(s); therefore, gentle diuresis is benefi
