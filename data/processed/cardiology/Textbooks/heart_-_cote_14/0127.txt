procedures, are associated with a shunt, although smaller ratios may be associated with signifi cant greater rate of complications. However, as transcatheter inter- symptomatology. ventions become safer and more eff ective, an increasing number of children may obviate the need for surgery, often undergoing Cardiac Output Determinations procedures on an outpatient basis.324 New techniques continue Th e volume of blood ejected by the heart into the systemic cir- to evolve in this fi eld, such as the percutaneous placement of culation, or cardiac output, can be derived in several ways. valves,325 strategies that combine cardiac catheterization and Th ermodilution measurements use saline as an indicator to surgical intervention, so-called hybrid procedures,326-328 and measure pulmonary blood fl ow. In the absence of intracardiac catheter-based interventions during fetal life.329 shunts this is equivalent to the systemic blood fl ow or cardiac output (expressed as liters per minute). In the Fick method, Practical Concepts Regarding the Interpretation of a oxygen is used as an indicator and cardiac output is obtained by Cardiac Catheterization Report the application of the following formula: .
