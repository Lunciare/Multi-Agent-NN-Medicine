the perioperative period may be the bance that can predispose children to arrhythmias that include result of profound hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbances, or met- torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (Fig. 14-24), ven- abolic derangements. Other causes include the use of recre- tricular fi brillation, and bradyarrhythmias resulting in syncope, ational drugs, myocardial injury, poor hemodynamics, and prior cardiac arrest, or sudden death.243 Congenital and acquired cardiac surgical intervention. forms have been described.

It is defi ned as three or more consecutive ventricular beats heart.244 Diagnostic criteria proposed for the long QT syndrome occurring at a rate greater than 120 beats per minute (Fig. include ECG fi ndings, clinical history (deafness, syncope), and 14-22). Th e QRS morphology in VT is diff erent than that in family history.245 A frequent feature is prolongation of the QTc sinus rhythm, and the QRS duration is typically prolonged for on the resting ECG . age. ECG features that support this diagnosis include
