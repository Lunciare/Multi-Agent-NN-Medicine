(A & V) O = None O = None restricted to dual chamber O = None devices O = None *Revised 2000. Most Common Pacing Modes: The pacemaker mode, specifi ed by a code, describes the mode in which the pacemaker is operating. Single-Chamber Pacing: AAI: atrial demand pacing (atrial pacing and sensing, inhibited on sensed beat) AAIR: atrial demand pacing (atrial pacing and sensing, inhibited on sensed beat), rate responsiveness VVI: ventricular demand pacing (ventricular pacing and sensing, inhibited on sensed beat) VVIR: ventricular demand pacing (ventricular pacing and sensing, inhibited on sensed beat), rate responsiveness Asynchronous Pacing (No Sensing): AOO: fi xed rate atrial pacing VOO: fi xed rate ventricular pacing DOO: fi xed rate AV pacing Dual-Chamber Pacing: DDD: paces and senses both chambers DDDR: paces and senses both chambers, sensor-driven rate responsiveness 319 A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children between the electrocautery electrodes.
