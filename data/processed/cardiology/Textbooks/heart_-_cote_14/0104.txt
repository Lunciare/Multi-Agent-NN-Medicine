may obscure the supe- rior portions of the cardiac shadow. Careful inspection of the cardiac silhouette includes an assessment of overall size and evidence of individual chamber/vessel dilation (e.g., rightward cardiac dilation on the posteroanterior fi lm indicating right atrial enlargement or posterior enlargement on the lateral fi lm suggesting left atrial dilation). Prominence of the main pulmo- nary artery segment if present should be noted because it pro- vides further evidence of the degree of pulmonary overcirculation in left-to-right shunt lesions. Th e tracheal indentation can usually be seen and is useful in determining aortic arch sided- ness, although in a young child with a prominent thymus this can be diffi cult to assess. Perhaps more useful than an individual radiograph as a diag- nostic tool, however, are serial chest fi lms used to monitor a child’s cardiovascular status over time. In a young child with a volume overload lesion such as a large septal defect, the child’s physical examination and growth parameters coupled with the degree of cardiomegaly and pulmonary overcirculation are more helpful than other more advanced imaging techniques.
