left ventricular diameter during the cardiac cycle. Th is is calcu- the understanding of pathologic conditions over 2D imaging. It lated using the following equation: allows for an enhanced perspective of the margins and geometry of abnormalities, such as septal defects and valvar anomalies. SF (%) = L VED dimension − LVES dimension/LVED 3D echocardiography may also be particularly useful when dimension 322 14 Values range from 28% to 44%, with a normal mean value of Evaluation of Gradients 36%. Th is index, however, is dependent on ventricular preload Estimation of a peak instantaneous gradient is the most clini- and afterload. cally useful method for quantifying the severity of obstructions Ejection fraction (EF) is the fraction of blood ejected by the across semilunar valves and outfl ow tracts. It is derived by appli- ventricle (stroke volume) relative to its end-diastolic volume. In cation of the simplifi ed Bernoulli equation. Th ese estimates other words, it represents the percentage of blood ejected from when obtained across the pulmonary valve tend to have a higher the left ventricle with each heart beat. Ejection fraction is correlation with catheterization peak-to-peak gradients than derived by volumetric analysis of the left ventricle by means of
