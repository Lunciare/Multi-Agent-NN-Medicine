A Practice of Anesthesia for Infants and Children

artery pressure in a normal child should be equal to the right ventricular systolic pressure, and the mean Considerations in the Perioperative pulmonary artery pressure should not exceed 20 mm Hg. Th e Care of Children with pulmonary artery wedge pressure is obtained by advancing a catheter into a distal vessel until this is occluded, refl ecting the Cardiovascular Disease left atrial pressure. Th e aortic pressure and contour of the tracing varies depending of the site of interrogation. Typically, General Issues there is an increase in the systolic pressure as the catheter navi- Th e anesthetic care of children with heart disease330 is chal- gates toward the peripheral circulation. Th is phenomenon is lenged by the following factors: known as “pulse wave amplifi cation.” ● Th e remarkable spectrum of disease, from structural defects Pressure gradients represent the diff erences between two dis- to acquired pathology tinct sites and can be measured in a number of ways (mean ● Th e wide range of congenital lesions and their underlying gradient and peak gradient).
