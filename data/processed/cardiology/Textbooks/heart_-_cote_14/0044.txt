Subjectively, there is an impression that these children syndrome include webbed neck, low-set ears, multiple pig- have small vessel sizes, vascular hyperreactivity, and fragile mented nevi and micrognathia, lymphedema, short stature, and tissue consistency and may suff er from more complications after ovarian failure.179 Systemic manifestations include cardiac arterial cannulation. defects (notably aortic coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve), Cardiovascular defects occur in 40% to 50% of children, so it hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, renal anomalies, liver has been recommended that all children undergo screening for disease, and infl ammatory bowel disease. Obesity is common in CHD in early infancy.165,166 Th e most common lesions include older children as well as a high incidence of endocrinologic atrioventricular septal defects (Video Clip 14-10), ventricular abnormalities such as hypothyroidism and diabetes.178,180 Renal septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, and patent ductus arteriosus. anomalies occur in up to one third of children. Pathology after repair of atrioventricular septal defects is most often related to mitral regurgitation, left ventricular outfl ow Gene Deletion Syndromes tract obstruction, residual intracardiac shunts, and, rarely, mitral Williams Syndrome stenosis. Bradycardia under anesthesia occurs commonly.167 Williams syndrome is a congenital disorder with an incidence Pulmonary
