Th ese are characterized by a wave at the end of systole) due to the loss of AV synchrony (Fig. periodic failure to conduct atrial impulses to the ventricle (P 14-19). Th e lack of atrial contribution to ventricular fi lling may wave without following QRS complex). In type I second-degree result in decreases in the systemic arterial blood pressure. AV block there is a progressive lengthening of the PR interval with eventual failure of conduction of the next atrial impulse to the ventricle. Th e RR intervals concomitantly shorten. Th e Conduction Disorders degree of AV block is expressed as the ratio of P waves per QRS Bundle Branch Block complexes (i.e., 2 : 1, 3 : 2). Th is can occur during periods of high Incomplete right bundle branch block pattern (RSR′ in right vagal tone or in the postoperative setting. It is generally a benign precordial leads with near normal QRS duration) occurs in chil- phenomenon that requires no therapy.
