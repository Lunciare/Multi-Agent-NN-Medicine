Diagram illustrating the structural abnormalities in a child with complex cardiovascular pathology. Data routinely obtained at cardiac catheterization are depicted, including oxygen saturation determinations, pressure measurements, and hemodynamic calculations. These types of pictorial representations are extremely helpful when caring for children with complex defects. such as might be the case of critically ill neonates with complex ment of blood fl ows and other calculations (i.e., shunts).316 Addi- heart disease, catheter-based interventions such as balloon atrial tional data that may be obtained include pressure gradients, septostomy and other procedures can be lifesaving. cardiac output measurements, and parameters to derive vascu- In most children, access to the central circulation is accom- lar resistances and valve areas. plished percutaneously via the femoral approach.
