duration, the components of the QRS infants with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery arising complex should be examined. Q waves are often present in the from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). Classically, the ECG in lateral and inferior leads, as well as lead aVR, but should be these children demonstrates deep, wide Q waves in leads I and narrow (less than 40 msec) and shallow (age dependent, but aVL with ST-segment and T-wave changes in the anterior dis- generally less than 5 mm deep). Deep or wide Q waves are sug- tribution (V-V) consistent with compromised myocardial 2 4 I aVR V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-14. The tracing demonstrates the typical ECG features of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: short PR interval, delta wave, and prolongation of the QRS interval. 310 14 I aVR V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-15. ECG tracing obtained in infant with poor ventricular function found to have anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the pulmonary root. The presence of Q waves in aVL and the diffuse ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia
