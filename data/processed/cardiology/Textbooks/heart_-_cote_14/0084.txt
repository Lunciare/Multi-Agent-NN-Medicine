V1 V4 V3R II aVL V2 V5 V4R III aVF V3 V6 V7 II Figure 14-18. ECG in a febrile infant displaying the features of sinus tachycardia (heart rate above normal for age and QRS complexes of normal appearance preceded by P waves that are upright in leads I and aVF). 314 14 II V A 100 ART1 50 CVP 0 SpO2 B Figure 14-19. (A) Intraoperative tracing obtained during cardiac surgery at the time of right atrial dissection demonstrating the features of a junctional rhythm. Retrograde P waves are identifi ed following the QRS complexes. (B) The central venous pressure (CVP) tracing demonstrates prominent v waves (arrows) related to the loss of atrioventricular synchrony (scale 0-30 mm Hg).
