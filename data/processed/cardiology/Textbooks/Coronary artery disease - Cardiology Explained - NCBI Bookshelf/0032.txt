Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

following PCI despite adequate restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery troponin levels, which are thought to be a sensitive marker for this type of damage, are elevated following approximately 40% of procedures. (Note that, in unstable angina, the benefit of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors is not limited to those with elevated troponin levels.) Overall, complications from cardiac catheterization are relatively rare (totaling ~5%). They include: 12/19 contrast allergy response (very rare due to modern dyes) local hemorrhage from puncture sites with subsequent thrombosis false aneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) malformation vasovagal reactions coronary dissection aortic dissection or ventricular perforation air or atheroma embolism, which can occur in either the coronary or other arterial circulations with consequent ischemia or stroke ventricular dysrhythmias, which are seen and may even cause death in the setting of left main stem disease The First Human Coronary Angiogram The first human coronary angiogram was, in fact, carried out by mistake by Mason Sones of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in 1958. Carrying out a standard LV angiogram, he paused – leaving the catheter in the aorta – to have a midprocedure smoke with his second operator. He returned, and relying on a pressure reading rather than direct
