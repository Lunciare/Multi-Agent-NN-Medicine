Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

as inotropes (eg, dobutamine) or vasodilators (eg, adenosine or dipyridamole). The isotope is injected at the peak of exercise and the image captured with a gamma camera. Rest images are usually achieved several hours later. The "exercise" and "rest" images are compared to identify perfusion defects that are either "fixed" (eg, the scar of an old MI) or "reversible" (ischemic disease). Thallium-201 has been the isotope of choice for many years, but more recently centers have been using Tc-99m-labeled compounds, such as sestamibi, which achieve a higher resolution from a lower dose of radiation. Single photon emission CT (SPECT) is a technique that employs a gamma camera head that rotates around the patient to provide three-dimensional images. Isotopes are also used in ventriculography. Estimates of LV function arrived at using this imaging technique are more accurate and reproducible than those resulting from echo. Consequently, ventriculography is indicated in: cardiomyopathy assessment pretransplant work-up any situation where accurate risk assessment is critical Two types of protocol are used: equilibrium and first-pass. The former, which is more common, uses a sample of the patient's blood labeled with Tc-99m. Information is gathered from each heartbeat over the time of equilibration (a few minutes) then
