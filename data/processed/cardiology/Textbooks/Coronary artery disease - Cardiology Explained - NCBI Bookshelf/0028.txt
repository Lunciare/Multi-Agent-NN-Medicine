Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

breath-hold and two R–R intervals In fact, the only technique that is still some way from routine clinical application is magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the coronary vessels (larger vessel MRA has been possible for some time). However, as new technology moves the field forward, this is likely to become more attainable, and with it the tempting prospect of cross-sectional imaging and plaque characterization. Stable angina: treatment Cardiac catheterization Since cardiac MRI is still only available in the bigger centers, coronary artery catheterization remains the diagnostic gold standard in CAD. As the conduit for coronary intervention, its position is also safe from advances in imaging technology. Catheterization can also be used in a variety of settings aside from CAD, such as ventricular dysfunction, valve disease, detection and quantification of shunts, and other congenital and acquired structural abnormalities. The basic procedure of PTCA involves cannulation of the femoral artery, with manipulation of a catheter over a guide wire to the site of stenosis. Dye is injected into each coronary artery in turn to assess flow. Flow is graded using a system first put forward by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) investigators (see Table 6). In balloon angioplasty a balloon is
