data on their effect when used in combination. Until further data are available, both should be given together. Short-acting calcium-channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type are contraindicated in acute MI. The longer-acting dihydropyridines may reduce reinfarction in patients with a first non-Q- wave infarction or inferior infarction in the absence of LV dysfunction and pulmonary edema. However, their benefit over aspirin and β-blockade in the context of MI is unclear. 17/19 Although warfarin provides no general benefit, in those patients with mural LV thrombus following a large acute anterior MI, it can reduce the overall rate of cerebrovascular complications (2%–3%) by more than half. Thus, it is recommended for up to 6 months following infarction, or longer if the thrombus is still nonlaminar on echo. Refer with confidence Practices vary enormously from center to center, but it is still common for hospital generalists to manage non-ST elevation, low-risk ACS, and even MI where no facilities for intervention are available. In these situations, the most common scenarios for referral to cardiology would be: recurrent pain following proven MI unstable pain that refuses to settle recurrent episodes of atypical pain with no ECG change or enzyme rise Cardiac rehabilitation Although the general
