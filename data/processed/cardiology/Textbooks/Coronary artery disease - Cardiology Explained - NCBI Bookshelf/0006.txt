Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

unpredictable pain – typically coming on at rest – and is associated with transient ST elevation on an ECG. It is thought to be due to coronary spasm and seems to be independent of atherosclerosis syndrome X – a condition in which the history is typical of coronary disease and there is ST depression on exercise, yet the coronary arteries are angiographically normal. It is thought to reflect small vessel disease and/or abnormal ventricular function dyspnea – angina can present as exertional dyspnea. Pay close attention to the pattern of onset and relief silent ischemia – diabetics, an important subgroup, can suffer from silent ischemia and even silent MI. Thus, even if there are no apparent symptoms of cardiac disease, a diabetic with an ECG abnormality should undergo stress testing and echocardiography to determine whether there is any indication for catheterization. One view is that all diabetics of greater than 5 years standing should be screened for cardiovascular disease The key message is that a patient with an atypical history should always be referred for exercise electrocardiography (see "Investigations" section). In more than 90% of cases, the existence of coronary disease can be predicted accurately from the combined results of
