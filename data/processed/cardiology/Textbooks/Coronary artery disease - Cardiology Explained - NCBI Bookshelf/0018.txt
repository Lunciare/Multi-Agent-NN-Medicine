Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

to the development of atherosclerosis and CAD. VLDLs and LDLs are atherogenic lipoproteins, whereas HDL concentrations are inversely related to the incidence of CAD. Hence, treatments for hyperlipidemia aim to reduce LDL levels and raise HDL levels. Pharmacotherapeutic options in hyperlipidemia include: statins, which inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), the rate- limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. A reduction in cholesterol synthesis causes the liver to increase the number of LDL receptors, reducing circulating concentrations of both cholesterol and triglyceride cholestyramine, which is a lipid-lowering drug that acts by sequestering bile acids in the gut, thus increasing the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol fibrates, which reduce the level of VLDL by increasing the activity of the VLDL- hydrolyzing enzyme LPL 7/19 Guidelines for the use of lipid-lowering therapy have become more aggressive over the past few years following the results of major trials showing mortality benefit for the use of statins. Most guidelines recommend statin treatment for a patient with CAD with a 10-year risk that is greater than 20% (high risk) once a trial of dietary therapy has been unsuccessful. However, treatment can be cost effective with a 10-year risk of 10%. Recent trials have
