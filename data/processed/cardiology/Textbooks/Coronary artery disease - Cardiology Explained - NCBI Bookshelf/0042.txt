Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

absolute contraindications and some notable relative contraindications. Absolute contraindications are: suspected aortic dissection (demands urgent CT, which is the gold standard, MRI, or transesophageal echo) active internal bleeding or uncontrollable external bleeding (excluding menses) recent head trauma (<2 weeks) intracranial neoplasms history of proven hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral infarction within 12 months untreated diabetic hemorrhagic/proliferative retinopathy BP >180/110 mm Hg uncontrolled (reduce with nitrates, β-blockade, angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors) Relative contraindications are: pregnancy traumatic prolonged CPR anticoagulation or INR >1.8 bleeding disorders recent surgery (within 3 weeks) probable intracardiac thrombus (eg, atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis) active peptic ulcer Basic science 16/19 Atherosclerosis is initiated by a combination of circulating factors, such as cholesterol, and hemodynamic forces (common sites for atherosclerosis are areas where arteries branch). LDL and circulating leukocytes penetrate the arterial wall at regions of high shear stress (turbulent flow). In its atherogenic oxidized form, LDL enters macrophages, converting them to foam cells in the process. Oxidized LDL also enhances the growth factor-mediated migration of monocytes and smooth muscle cells to the intima, where the latter differentiate to form the fibrous cap of the mature atherosclerotic plaque. Figure 11 shows the layers of a vessel wall. As a
