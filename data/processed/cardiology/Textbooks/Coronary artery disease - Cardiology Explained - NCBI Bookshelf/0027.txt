for example, lipid-lowering therapy. However, there is some doubt over how much information this measure adds to standard risk factors. Furthermore, vulnerable plaque often does not contain much calcium. The "holy grail" is a test that can locate and quantify "vulnerable" plaque, but this has not yet been found. Magnetic resonance imaging Most cardiologists agree that the future of noninvasive imaging of the heart lies with MRI. This technology can fulfill many of the functions of traditional tests and in most cases improve on them: cardiac anatomy and morphology can be assessed with a high degree of spatial resolution using "black-blood" imaging in cine mode (like two-dimensional echo), resolutions can be achieved that are significantly greater than those obtained with ultrasound and good views can be imaged and processed in under 30 seconds LV function – including under exercise/pharmacological stress – can be achieved with a single breath-hold and the circumferential shortening calculated wall-motion abnormalities can be assessed using tagging techniques perfusion imaging can be carried out with a single breath-hold and two R–R intervals In fact, the only technique that is still some way from routine clinical application is magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the coronary vessels (larger vessel
