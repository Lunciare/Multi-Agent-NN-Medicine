Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

is present in only 50% of enzyme-confirmed MIs (see "Markers of myocardial damage" section). Chest radiograph A chest x-ray (CXR) may be used to help rule out aortic dissection in an acute presentation, although the gold standard is computed tomography (CT). Otherwise, it is rarely helpful. It should not be carried out on a routine basis. Pharmacological management of angina Stable disease is treated with aspirin and agents that offload or reduce the workload of the heart. Thus, standard medication for stable angina includes β-blockers, aspirin, and, if still symptomatic, long-acting nitrates. Aspirin The evidence for aspirin is so strong that it has to be part of the drug regimen of every patient with CAD. If aspirin is not tolerated, clopidogrel may be given instead. In cases in which warfarin (Coumadin) has to be administered (eg, coronary disease and atrial fibrillation), aspirin is usually omitted, since oral anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3–4 has been shown to be safe and effective. Oral long-acting nitrate Nitrates are smooth muscle relaxants with the ability to vasodilate both the arteriolar and venous circulation. This leads to reductions in both preload (venous return) and afterload (blood pressure). However, nitrate-free periods are
