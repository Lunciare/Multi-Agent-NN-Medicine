right internal mammary artery (RIMA) can be connected to the RCA. A clear benefit of LIMA/RIMA CABG is improved graft patency, both perioperatively and in the long term (10 years). Other arteries that can be used include the radial and the gastroepiploic. 13/19 Figure 9 Sites of heart bypass grafting: a saphenous vein graft and a left internal mammary artery graft are shown. Due to the risks of heart–lung bypass – such as postbypass cognitive deficit – some centers now practice beating heart surgery. In this procedure the heart is not arrested: the section of the heart that is to be operated on is stabilized locally by the "suckers" (vacuum-operated suction clamps) of a device known as an octopus. Another technique is minimally invasive bypass, which uses small incisions and LIMA grafts. Evidence base With these rapid advances in both surgical and percutaneous techniques, much of the evidence base is out of date. For example, there are no definitive data indicating that angioplasty saves lives in stable CAD. Previous trials have shown that CABG can benefit outcome in: symptomatic, significant left main stem disease; symptomatic proximal three-vessel disease; and two-vessel disease including the proximal LAD. Patients with moderately impaired LV
