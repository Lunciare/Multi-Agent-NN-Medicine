Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

(1) rule out contraindications to thrombolysis (see "Thrombolysis" section) and (2) arrange for analgesia and thrombolysis to be set up, before (3) completing the history and examination. Primary PTCA Recently – primarily due to improvements in devices, adjunctive therapy (GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), and user experience – in cases of acute MI, the superiority of PTCA over thrombolysis alone has become clear. Most lesions (80%) are suitable for PTCA, particularly if they are discrete, proximal, uncalcified, subtotally occluded, without thrombus, and away from the side branches or divisions of a vessel. As such, primary PTCA is the procedure of choice for patients within 12 hours of the onset of MI symptoms. Current evidence suggests that patients of less than 75 years with cardiogenic shock (occurring within 36 hours of MI) benefit most from primary PTCA (within 18 hours of onset of shock) in an appropriate center with experienced personnel. In cases of poor LV function, intra-aortic balloon pumping (see Chapter 7, Heart failure) is useful in the setting of proximal LAD or mainstem stenting. Thrombolysis Thrombolysis is given as an infusion of (typically) streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) over 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the protocol. Aspirin and (intravenous)
