does not have to comprise formal exercise; it can include informal exercise, provided it is of adequate intensity. In this way, increases in physical activity can be absorbed into everyday life: for example, climbing the stairs instead of taking the elevator and walking to work instead of driving. In fact, walking, partly because it is so inefficient, is excellent exercise. Few people realize that walking a mile and running a mile use similar amounts of energy. Thus, there is no need for patients to join a gym (with all the expense that may be incurred) when daily brisk walking is ample exercise. Keeping a diary of their physical activity may help patients to sustain adequate amounts of daily exercise. Submaximal aerobic exercise in angina Many angina patients refrain from physical activity because they believe that the resulting pain is "dangerous". However, aside from its well-known benefits in risk reduction, exercise can be as effective as β-blockade in the management of stable angina. It has been associated with increased plaque stability and even slight plaque shrinkage. It is recommended that patients exercise for 30–45 minutes per day, 4–5 times a week. Estimating risk Formal risk estimation is aided by a standard
