from Lippincott (more...) Figure 6 The Duke score, which is the most commonly used risk score, can be used for diagnosis as well as prognosis. To use this nomogram: determine (i) the maximum amount of downsloping or planar ST depression, and (ii) the type of angina during exercise. Connect (more...) A diagnostic algorithm for CAD is outlined in Figure 7. Most guidelines suggest the use of an alternative test if the preprobability is low. If the preprobability is high, exercise testing adds little in the way of diagnosis, but is useful for risk stratification. The primary role of exercise testing is where preprobability is intermediate. Figure 7 Diagnostic algorithm for coronary artery disease. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear cardiology Isotopes such as thallium-201 or technetium (Tc)-99m can be used to provide information on cardiac function. Perfusion imaging is used to assess regional blood flow by comparing the relative distribution of isotope at rest and under conditions of stress. Stress is provided either by exercise or by 9/19 pharmacological tools such as inotropes (eg, dobutamine) or vasodilators (eg, adenosine or dipyridamole). The isotope is injected at the peak of exercise and the image captured with a gamma camera. Rest images are
