predominantly on the ST segment, which must fall more than 1 mm from rest and be horizontal or downsloping to be significant. ST depression does not localize ischemia so it cannot reveal anything about a suspected coronary lesion, but it does enable a classification of mild, intermediate, or severe CAD to be made. Figure 5 (a) The Bruce exercise protocol. The patient starts exercising at a speed of 2.7 km/h on a gradient of 10%. The workload is intensified every 3 minutes by increasing the speed and the incline of the treadmill, until the endpoint is achieved. (b) The modified (more...) The exercise test is also useful for recording other variables, ie, work capacity; maximum heart rate and chronotropic incompetence; blood pressure rise and recovery; and heart rate recovery. 8/19 Work capacity (presumably reflecting left ventricular [LV] function) and heart rate recovery are very strong prognostic indicators for CAD. Contraindications to exercise testing and reasons for stopping an exercise test are outlined in Table 4. Table 4 Contraindications to and reasons for stopping an exercise test. HCM: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; LBBB: left bundle branch block. It is important to appreciate where the value of the exercise test lies: exercise ECG on
