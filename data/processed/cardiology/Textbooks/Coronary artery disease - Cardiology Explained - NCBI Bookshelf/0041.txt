(streptokinase treatment has a lower rate of ICH when it is administered without heparin), there is particular concern with respect to the administration of tPA (as it is usually given with heparin) to hypertensive patients above 65 years of age who are less than 70 kg in weight. Partly as a result of these concerns, several centers have explored the use of low-dose thrombolytic treatment in combination with GPIIb/IIIa inhibition. The results of these trials have been encouraging. Recanalization is achieved following thrombolysis in approximately 70% of cases (compared with 15% of cases without thrombolysis). As this leaves a significant minority needing further attention, all patients should be reviewed 2 hours following thrombolysis. Rethrombolysis or coronary intervention should be considered if there is no resolution in the ST segment. There are few absolute contraindications to thrombolysis and risks must be weighed against benefits in each individual case, particularly in the face of a large anterior infarct in a patient where access to primary PTCA is unavailable. However, there are some absolute contraindications and some notable relative contraindications. Absolute contraindications are: suspected aortic dissection (demands urgent CT, which is the gold standard, MRI, or transesophageal echo) active internal bleeding or uncontrollable
