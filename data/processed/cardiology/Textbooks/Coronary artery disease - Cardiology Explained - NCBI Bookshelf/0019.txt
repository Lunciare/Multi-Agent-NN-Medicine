Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

is greater than 20% (high risk) once a trial of dietary therapy has been unsuccessful. However, treatment can be cost effective with a 10-year risk of 10%. Recent trials have identified anti-inflammatory properties of statins and benefit even in patients with normal cholesterol levels. Dosage should be adjusted according to cholesterol levels. As part of secondary prevention, the following levels should be reached: total cholesterol, <200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L); HDL, >40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L); LDL, <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L); triglyceride, <200 mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L). Refer with confidence Early management of stable coronary disease is mostly done in the community. Risk factor and stepwise pharmacological management of stable angina are appropriate. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, a noninvasive test for coronary disease – such as an exercise ECG – should be carried out. Exercise ECG is increasingly carried out by generalists in primary care and hospitals. Pain that is resistant to medical therapy or crescendo symptoms warrants immediate presentation to an emergency room to rule out MI. The patient should then be referred to a cardiologist for further investigation, if needed. When referring patients who have had prior intervention, try to summarize the details of previous revascularization. For
