Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

pharmacological help in the form of bupropion (Zyban) may be indicated. Helping patients to stop smoking is an extremely worthwhile endeavor. The risk tables (see Figures 2 and 3) show just how much there is to be gained by changing smoking status. Figure 2 Coronary heart disease risk tables for men and women.

Basic science Exercise training exerts many beneficial changes at the cellular and molecular level. An exercise-induced increase in blood flow may exert its beneficial effects on vascular reactivity and structure through an increase in the elaboration of several endothelium- derived substances, such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and superoxide dismutase. Although prostacyclin may exert its antiatherogenic effects by inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol esters into macrophages or into smooth muscle cells, nitric oxide contributes strongly to the inhibition
