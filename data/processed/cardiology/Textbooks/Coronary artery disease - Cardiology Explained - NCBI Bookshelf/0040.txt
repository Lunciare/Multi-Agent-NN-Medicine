mainstem stenting. Thrombolysis Thrombolysis is given as an infusion of (typically) streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) over 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the protocol. Aspirin and (intravenous) β-blocker should also be given acutely. Thrombolysis is beneficial up to 12 hours after the onset of pain, but may be given up to 24 hours afterwards in the context of continuing pain or a deteriorating condition. The choice of thrombolytic agent is controversial. tPA and similar recombinant agents are still from 5- to 7-times more expensive than streptokinase and thus only tend to be used in the following situations: where streptokinase has been administered previously 15/19 where recent proven streptococcal throat infections have occurred in cases of hypotension However, even with large anterior MI in younger patients presenting within 4 hours (a situation where tPA is often recommended first-line), the absolute added mortality benefit is only 1% above streptokinase. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) can be an important complication of thrombolysis. Since heparin is associated with an increased risk of ICH (streptokinase treatment has a lower rate of ICH when it is administered without heparin), there is particular concern with respect to the administration of tPA (as it is usually given
