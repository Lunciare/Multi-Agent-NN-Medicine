ischemia, are now available. The transaminases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no longer offer any advantage over the other markers and in fact often cause false-positive results. Timescales of the variation in levels of the most commonly used markers for myocardial damage are outlined in Table 7 and Figure 10. Of the markers in Table 7, troponin I or T are the most specific and sensitive markers to rule acute MI out or in. Table 7 Timescales for the variation in levels of markers for myocardial damage. CK-MB: creatine kinase myocardial a band fraction; LDH1: lactate dehydrogenase 1. Creatine kinase has three isoenzymes, of which CK-MB is the most cardiac specific. However, other (more...)

Acute coronary syndromes: treatment 14/19 Pharmacological agents The first-line treatment of any ACS is oxygen, aspirin, heparin, and β-blockade. Clopidogrel is an alternative to aspirin and diltiazem is an alternative to β-blockade. Low molecular-weight heparins have advantages over heparin, such as: simple administration better bioavailability no requirement for monitoring enhanced antifactor Xa activity lower rates of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
