was the first to suggest that clots, rather than a slow accretion of plaque, are responsible for the complete occlusion that would often result in death. Importantly, he was the first to link symptoms in living patients with coronary artery disease, and to suggest that patients can survive complete blockage. These ideas were radical and new and (not surprisingly) no one believed him. The establishment of these pathophysiological origins of CAD, together with the identification of improved clinical markers for ischemia and necrosis, has led to the proposal of a new (somewhat controversial) definition for acute MI: a rise and fall in troponin or the creatine kinase 1/19 myocardial band fraction (CK-MB) (see "Markers of myocardial damage" section), plus at least one of the following: ischemic symptoms development of pathological Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment elevation or depression on the ECG coronary artery intervention (eg, angioplasty) Angina Pectoris William Heberden defined angina pectoris in 1768 and provided a clear description of the familiar pain. However, it was Edward Jenner and Caleb Parry who linked this "disorder of the breast" with the "hardening" of the arteries that had been described by Giovanni Morgagni 7 years earlier.
