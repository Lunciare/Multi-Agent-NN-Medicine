Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

and dilate the artery. A balloon is directed over a guidewire to the site of stenosis where it is inflated (by contrast medium) to push open the narrowing or deploy the stent. Pioneers In 1929, Werner Forssmann – a German cardiologist – went against the express advice of his boss and, with the help of a nurse, inserted a catheter through an arm vein into his own heart. This was the first time a human heart had ever been catheterized. He saw the successful catheterization images on a fluoroscope screen – only by using a mirror. A pioneer of cardiology, he published his paper in Klinische Wochenschrift in 1929 and, although he catheterized only one patient's heart, he went on to catheterize his own heart another eight times. Other, less common percutaneous techniques include radioactive stents and atherectomy (where the atheroma is physically removed from the artery). Insertion of a metal object into an artery is a prothrombotic event. Hence, stenting is carried out in conjunction with antithrombotic therapy. Infusional antithrombotic agents (eg, abciximab – see below) are used as an adjunct during angioplasty while oral antiplatelet agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, are used for 1 month post stent.
