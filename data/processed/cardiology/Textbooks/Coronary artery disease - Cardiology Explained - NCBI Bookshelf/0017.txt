Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

then enter the cells. The chylomicron remnants, which have lost much of their triglyceride content, are taken up by the liver for disposal. The liver synthesizes triglycerides and cholesterol, and packages them as VLDLs before releasing them into the blood. When VLDLs (which consist mainly of triglyceride) reach muscle and adipose blood vessels, their triglycerides are hydrolyzed by LPL to fatty acids. The fatty acids that are released are taken up by the surrounding muscle and adipose cells. During this process, the VLDLs become progressively more dense and turn into LDLs. While most of the resulting LDLs are taken up by the liver for disposal, some circulate and distribute cholesterol to the rest of the body tissues. HDLs, which are also secreted from the liver and intestine, have the task of preventing lipid accumulation. They remove surplus cholesterol from tissues and transfer it to LDLs that return it to the liver. To regulate cholesterol uptake, cells vary the expression of their LDL receptors. Elevated concentrations of lipid (hyperlipidemia) can lead to the development of atherosclerosis and CAD. VLDLs and LDLs are atherogenic lipoproteins, whereas HDL concentrations are inversely related to the incidence of CAD. Hence, treatments for hyperlipidemia aim to
