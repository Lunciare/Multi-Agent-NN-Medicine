Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

reasons for stopping an exercise test. HCM: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; LBBB: left bundle branch block. It is important to appreciate where the value of the exercise test lies: exercise ECG on its own has low sensitivity (<50%) but high specificity (>90%) – ie, it is very good at ruling disease in, but not good at ruling it out the meaning of the test results is significantly affected by the pretest probability of disease (see Table 5). For example, exercise-induced ST depression in a young woman with no risk factors is likely to be a false positive incorporating clinical and demographic information into the basic test result by calculating diagnostic "scores" can increase the sensitivity and specificity to >90% (see Figure 6) patients without a clear diagnosis from the exercise tolerance test should have another noninvasive test Table 5 Pretest likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) in symptomatic patients according to age and sex – each value represents the percentage of patients found to have significant CAD on catheterization.
