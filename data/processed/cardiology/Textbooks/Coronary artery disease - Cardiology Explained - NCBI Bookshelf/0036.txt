have shown that CABG can benefit outcome in: symptomatic, significant left main stem disease; symptomatic proximal three-vessel disease; and two-vessel disease including the proximal LAD. Patients with moderately impaired LV function benefit more from CABG than those with poor LV function, who have greater operative mortality (overall mortality is around 2.8%, but rises to 3.7%–12% for an emergency procedure). Most cardiologists believe that new trials will demonstrate a mortality benefit for coronary stenting, possibly for three-vessel disease and perhaps even over and above that of bypass. Acute coronary syndromes: assessment Risk assessment is the key to in-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with ST elevation need to be considered immediately for thrombolysis or acute intervention. Other patients should be closely monitored (preferably in a coronary care unit) if they have risk factors, previous infarction, poor ventricular function, and changing ST segments. In this situation, the key investigation is the measurement of cardiac enzymes. Markers of myocardial damage A number of markers for not only infarction, but also noninfarct ischemia, are now available. The transaminases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no longer offer any advantage over the other markers and in fact often cause false-positive results. Timescales
