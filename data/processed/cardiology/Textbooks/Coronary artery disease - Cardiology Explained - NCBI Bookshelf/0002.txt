from stable (lipid-poor, thick fibrous cap) to unstable (lipid-rich, thin fibrous cap) (see Figure 1). When an unstable plaque ruptures – and the more unstable it is, the more likely it is to rupture – the subsequent release of prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive factors increases the likelihood of complete occlusion of the artery. It is the balance between the body's prothrombotic and thrombolytic pathways at the rupture site that determines the clinical outcome. Transient occlusion leads to ischemia and pain; permanent occlusion leads to transmural MI (see Table 1). Figure 1 An atherosclerotic plaque consists of a core of dead foam cells (lipid-engorged macrophages and smooth muscle cells) covered by a fibrous cap (a region of the intimal layer that has become thickened as a result of medial smooth muscle cells depositing (more...) Table 1 Subgroups of coronary artery disease presentations. MI: myocardial infarction. Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction The hypothesis that thrombosis plays a central role in myocardial infarction was first proposed by James Herrick in JAMA in 1912. This paper was the first to suggest that clots, rather than a slow accretion of plaque, are responsible for the complete occlusion that would often result in death. Importantly, he was the
