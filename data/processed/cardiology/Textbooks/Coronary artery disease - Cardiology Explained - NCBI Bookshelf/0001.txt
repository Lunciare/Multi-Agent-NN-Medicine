Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

Chapter 5 Coronary artery disease Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of mortality in the developed world. It results from the collision of ancient genes with modern lifestyles: a hunter–gatherer lifestyle – with high daily energy expenditure and rare kills – favors a tendency to eat large quantities of high-calorie food when it is available. Such predispositions sit uneasily in a modern world with motorized transport and fatty snacks on every corner. Despite this, so-called "hardening of the arteries" was first described only in the 1700s, and it was not until the 1900s that a good description of myocardial infarction (MI) was forthcoming. The term "coronary artery disease" encompasses a range of diseases that result from atheromatous change in coronary vessels. In the past, CAD was thought to be a simple, inexorable process of artery narrowing, eventually resulting in complete vessel blockage (and MI). However, in recent years the explanatory paradigm has changed because it was realized that a whole spectrum of coronary plaques exists – from stable (lipid-poor, thick fibrous cap) to unstable (lipid-rich, thin fibrous cap) (see Figure 1). When an unstable plaque ruptures – and the more unstable it is, the more likely
