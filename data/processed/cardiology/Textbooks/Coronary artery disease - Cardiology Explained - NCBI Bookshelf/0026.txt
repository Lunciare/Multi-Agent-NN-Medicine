Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

(pharmacological stress echo only) Stress echo can also provide information on stunned or hibernating myocardium. The former is myocardium that after a period of acute ischemia and reperfusion remains, for a time, hypokinetic at rest. Hibernating myocardium is a more chronic situation in which the blood flow of a segment is not adequate for function, yet is sufficient for it to remain viable. During periods of stress, these areas of myocardium "recover" and their viability can be detected as improvements (compared with at rest) in segmental contraction on exposure to low-dose pharmacological stress. Stress echo is a useful technique in the hands of an experienced operator in a patient with a good echo window. Views can also be greatly improved by the use of a supine bicycle. Electron beam computed tomography 10/19 This is a new technique that relies on imaging calcium in coronary lesions. It can quantify the "atherosclerotic burden" in the form of a calcium score to give an estimate of risk or to monitor the effect of, for example, lipid-lowering therapy. However, there is some doubt over how much information this measure adds to standard risk factors. Furthermore, vulnerable plaque often does not contain much calcium. The
