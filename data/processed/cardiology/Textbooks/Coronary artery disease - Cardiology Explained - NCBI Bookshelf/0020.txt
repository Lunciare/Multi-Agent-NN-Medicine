patient should then be referred to a cardiologist for further investigation, if needed. When referring patients who have had prior intervention, try to summarize the details of previous revascularization. For example: two-vessel disease (left anterior descending [LAD], circumflex artery) previous left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to LAD, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to right coronary artery (RCA) previous saphenous vein graft (SVG) to circumflex artery Including this type of detail will greatly increase the usefulness of a referral letter. Specialist management Stable angina: assessment Exercise electrocardiography Exercise ECG is the mainstay test for the diagnosis of CAD. It is usually carried out on a treadmill, but bicycle exercise can also be used. The patient exercises according to a set protocol from rest to maximum exertion, which should be reached in 8–12 minutes. The protocol most commonly used was originally described by Robert Bruce and bears his name (see Figure 5). There are, however, good reasons to consider a protocol that is individualized for each patient. Diagnostic exercise tests focus predominantly on the ST segment, which must fall more than 1 mm from rest and be horizontal or downsloping to be significant. ST depression does not localize ischemia so it
