to ensuring that plasma potassium is above 4.5, intravenous amiodarone and therapeutic-dose magnesium are indicated for sustained ventricular tachycardia or in ventricular fibrillation as adjuncts to defibrillation. Amiodarone is usually given via a central line, but can also be administered via a large antecubital cannula, although the latter has a slightly higher risk of local necrosis. Arrhythmias occurring more than 48 hours after an acute MI are associated with a worse prognosis and should be investigated further by coronary angiography to rule out hemodynamically relevant coronary stenoses, and electrophysiological studies to rule out scar- tissue substrate. Other therapy Glycemic control should be optimized in all diabetic patients, preferably with the use of sliding- scale insulin. Oral inotropes should be avoided since almost all randomized trials have shown an increased mortality over placebo. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers are given within the first 24 hours post-MI (in the absence of hypotension or other specific contraindications). However, although there is clear evidence for the benefit of each agent individually, there are few data on their effect when used in combination. Until further data are available, both should be given together. Short-acting calcium-channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type are contraindicated in acute MI.
