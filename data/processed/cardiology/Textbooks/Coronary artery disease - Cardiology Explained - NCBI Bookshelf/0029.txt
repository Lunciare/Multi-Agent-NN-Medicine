Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

turn to assess flow. Flow is graded using a system first put forward by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) investigators (see Table 6). In balloon angioplasty a balloon is inflated (using the image-enhancing contrast dye) to compress the atheroma and dilate the artery (see Figure 8). Until recently, this was the intervention of choice. However, balloon angioplasty has a restenosis rate of 30% over 6 months and a high rate of coronary artery dissection. Consequently, the use of coronary artery stents (see Figure 8), which have lower rates of restenosis and artery dissection, has become common practice. These are deployed using a balloon. Most recent work has focussed on drug-eluting stents (which elute anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative agents), which seem dramatically to reduce the incidence of restenosis. Table 6 11/19 System (devised by the TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] investigators) used to grade the flow of contrast dye that has been injected into coronary arteries during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Figure 8 Balloon angioplasty is used to compress atherosclerotic narrowing and dilate the artery. A balloon is directed over a guidewire to the site of stenosis where it is inflated (by contrast medium) to push open the narrowing or deploy
