Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

for several years subsequently.) Overall mortality rates are quoted at less than one in 1,000 cases, but this increases to one in 100 for higher risk cases. Coronary artery bypass grafting Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the technique of choice for three-vessel disease with depressed LV function and left main stem coronary disease. However, since coronary interventions have become much more sophisticated some studies have shown equal benefit from percutaneous treatment as compared with surgical treatment in patients with three-vessel disease. During surgery, the patient undergoes sternotomy followed by heart–lung bypass and cardiac arrest. A portion of the saphenous vein is dissected from the leg, reversed (to orientate the venous valves in the appropriate direction), and attached proximally to the aortic root and distally to the coronary artery (see Figure 9). The LIMA, which originates from the left subclavian artery, can also be used as a conduit. It is disconnected at its distal end only and the cut end is connected to the LAD. In the same way, the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) can be connected to the RCA. A clear benefit of LIMA/RIMA CABG is improved graft patency, both perioperatively and in the long term (10 years).
