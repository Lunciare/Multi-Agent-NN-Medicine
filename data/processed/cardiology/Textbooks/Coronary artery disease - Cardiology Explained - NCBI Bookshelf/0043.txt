Coronary artery disease - Cardiology Explained

muscle cells to the intima, where the latter differentiate to form the fibrous cap of the mature atherosclerotic plaque. Figure 11 shows the layers of a vessel wall. As a result of our understanding of these processes, there is much experimental interest in factors that contribute to the attraction and adhesion of leukocytes (chemokines and adhesion molecules), the receptors that modulate LDL uptake (scavenger receptors), enzymes that degrade the cap (matrix metalloproteinases), and protective species (such as nitric oxide). With inflammation a central component of our current appreciation of atherosclerosis, there is much interest in circulating markers (such as C-reactive protein) and pharmaceutical interventions that decrease inflammation (aspirin and statins). Figure 11 The walls of normal blood vessels are composed of distinct layers: the intima is the innermost layer. It consists of a single layer of endothelial cells lining the vessel, supported by a layer of connective tissue. The media is composed of smooth muscle (more...) Arrhythmia Reperfusion arrhythmias are common in the first 2 hours following thrombolysis. In addition to ensuring that plasma potassium is above 4.5, intravenous amiodarone and therapeutic-dose magnesium are indicated for sustained ventricular tachycardia or in ventricular fibrillation as adjuncts to defibrillation. Amiodarone is usually
