Chapter 12 Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta Aortic aneurysm Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta (see Figure 1) are not as common as those affecting the abdominal portion, but carry a higher risk of rupture. Both share the same primary cause: atherosclerosis. In the past, ascending aortic aneurysms were typically caused by syphilis, but nowadays hypertension or Marfan's syndrome are more likely to be responsible. Symptoms result from the acute painful tear felt as central chest pain, which radiates to the back, and from the compression of surrounding structures: Figure 1 A typical aneurysm of the thoracic aorta at surgery. dysphagia (esophagus) dyspnea (bronchi; pericardial effusion) upper thorax/neck swelling (superior vena cava) Standard radiology and echocardiography can be useful in monitoring the progression of aneurysms. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard and should be carried out annually in patients with known disease that does not yet require surgery or percutaneous placement of an aortic prosthesis/stents. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used. Management The central feature of management is rigorous control of blood pressure
