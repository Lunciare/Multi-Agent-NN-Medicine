Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta - Cardiology Explained - NCBI Bookshelf

aortic valve; F: false lumen; I: intimal flap; LA: left atrium; T: true lumen. A physical examination can prove useful diagnostically, but should not delay the above emergency investigations. It should include: measurement of the BP in both arms (unequal BP is a sign, though not a reliable sign) documentation of all peripheral pulses (lack of peripheral pulses may be the only sign if the dissection spares the ascending aorta) close attention to heart sounds (aortic regurgitation and tamponade are possible with proximal extension) neurologic examination (hemiplegia or paraplegia can result from occlusion of the carotid arteries and anterior spinal arteries, respectively) Other potentially useful investigations are: assessment of renal function, including urine microscopy and catheterization for accurate measurement of renal output a chest x-ray, which often shows a distended aorta or generalized widening of the mediastinum (see Figures 7 and 8) Figure 7 3/4 (a,b) Chest x-rays. A dissected aorta can be seen in (b) (arrow). Figure 8 Chest x-ray showing extreme dissection of the aorta (arrows).
