Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta - Cardiology Explained - NCBI Bookshelf

a tear in the aortic intima that creates a false lumen through the aortic media for a variable distance (see Figures 2 and 3). Figure 2 The adventitia, media, and intima of the aortic wall. Dissection is classified according to whether it includes the ascending aorta (type A) or not (type B) (see Figure 3). Type A dissection is a surgical emergency because of the high risk of proximal extension, rupture, and sudden death. If a type A dissection is confirmed by CT or MRI, the patient should be operated on immediately. The highly specialized repair operation can involve replacement of the aortic root with a vascular graft, reimplantation of the coronary arteries, and resuspension of the aortic valve. In some cases it may be necesssary to replace the valve. Figure 3 Classification of dissection. In contrast, type B dissection is managed medically by aggressive antihypertensive treatment. In the acute situation, the systolic BP should be lowered to <110 mm Hg using intravenous (IV) β- blockade (eg, labetalol). Beta-blockade, as well as reducing the BP, reduces the BP's rate of rise and for this reason it is preferred to sodium nitroprusside as the first-line IV agent. If β-blockers are contraindicated
