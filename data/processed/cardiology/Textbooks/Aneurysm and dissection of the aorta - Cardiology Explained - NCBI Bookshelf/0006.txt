Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta - Cardiology Explained - NCBI Bookshelf

well as reducing the BP, reduces the BP's rate of rise and for this reason it is preferred to sodium nitroprusside as the first-line IV agent. If β-blockers are contraindicated then rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil, can be used. Dissection typically presents with a severe tearing central chest pain that radiates to the back. A patient with such a history should be referred urgently to a specialist center since the ascending aorta might be involved. Immediate investigations include: CT or MRI scan (see Figures 4 and 5, previous page) transesophageal echo to assess possible aortic regurgitation (see Figure 6, previous page) transthoracic echo for pericardial effusion preoperatively, coronary artery disease must be ruled out by coronary angiography Figure 4 Computed tomography scans showing dissection of the aorta. Figure 5 Magnetic resonance images showing separation of the dissected membrane. AA: ascending aorta; F: false lumen; I: intimal flap; P: pulmonary artery; S: subclavian artery; T: true lumen. Figure 6 Transesophageal echocardiograms showing separation of the dissecting membrane. AV: aortic valve; F: false lumen; I: intimal flap; LA: left atrium; T: true lumen. A physical examination can prove useful diagnostically, but should not delay the above emergency investigations. It
