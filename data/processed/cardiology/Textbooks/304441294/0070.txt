which occurs if the correct position in the upper oesophagus cannot be achieved, the angle differences between the planes of the left ventricle will change. This is the reason why the 2-chamber view in transoesophageal echocardiography often seems to be perpendicular to the long-axis view. The normal 60°-angle difference between the standardized views of the left ventricle can be documented by the triplane approach, which will show exactly the standardized views with 60°-angle difference if the left ventricular apex is centred in the scanning sector ( Fig. 1.36g–h). Fig. 1.35 The mid-oesophageal 5-chamber view during systole (a) and diastole (b) and the corresponding colour-coded views during systole (c) and diastole (d). A slight deeper insertion of the probe at 0° displays the inflow of the coronary sinus. The following views of the right atrium and the right ventricular inflow tract are displayed in grey-scale mode during systole (e) and diastole (f) and in colour-coded mode during systole (g) and diastole (h).
