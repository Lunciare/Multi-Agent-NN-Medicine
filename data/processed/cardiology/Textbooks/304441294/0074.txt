long-axis view of the aortic valve (120–135°) should be documented from the most upper oesophageal approach to display the best possible view of the ascending aorta ( Fig. 1.39b). The perpendicular short-axis view of the ascending aorta (again 60–75°) displays the cross-sected ascending aorta, as well as the bifurcation and origin of the right pulmonary artery ( Fig. 1.39c–d). With a clockwise rotation of the probe shaft, the cross-sected superior caval vein is behind the right upper pulmonary vein ( Fig. 1.39e–f). This view is necessary for the detection of upper sinus venosus atrial defects. Fig. 1.39 Mid-transoesophageal short-axis view of the aortic valve (a). Upper transoesophageal long-axis view of the ascending aorta (b). Upper transoesophageal views of the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery, as well as the superior caval vein. The short-axis view of the aortic root and the pulmonary bifurcation is displayed in grey-scale (c) and colour-coded mode (d). The short-axis view of the superior caval vein and the upper right pulmonary vein is displayed in grey-scale (e) and colour-coded mode (f). Additional comments in the text. By rotating the shaft of the transoesophageal probe clockwise from the aortic long-axis view, the bicaval view can be achieved (
