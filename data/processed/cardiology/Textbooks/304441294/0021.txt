1 brightness of the colour and the ultrasound beam due to the better mm with respect to the penetration and colour, the more the more axial resolution in comparison to the quality of the acoustic window. overlay of the overlay of lateral resolution (e.g. vena contracta of a tissue by the tissue by the mitral regurgitation in the parasternal colour. colour is long-axis view). present. Blood flow Colour Doppler With decreasing colour Doppler scale low Colour Doppler scale has to be adjusted velocities of the Scale—low flow regions will be better elucidated to the flow phenomenon which has to colour-coded blood flow with colour. Thus, flow areas in cardiac be analysed. Thus, if venous flow Doppler signal— velocities will cavities will be depicted larger than using should be visualized, normally lower the lower the be better higher Doppler scales (e.g. especially jet colour Doppler scales will be used than blood flow visualized with flow areas). in the presence of high flow conditions. velocities, the decreasing darker the colour- colour Doppler Artefacts in echocardiography are created by the interactions of ultrasound waves with the tissue and by the image reconstruction algorithms due to beam formation properties. Despite the visualization of artefacts
