Due to the three- dimensional propagation of the ultrasound waves the strong reflectors can be detected only by rotation of the sectional plane. Comet tail Several repetitive strong reflectors can create a Strong reflectors at the origin of Alteration and artefact complex reverberation. Two or more strong the comet tails should be changing of the reflectors which are very close to each other detected to explain the transducer position to induce multiple reflections of the sound wave phenomenon (aortic wall, document the between each other. Thus, transit times posterior epicardium in the changing of the between the reflectors induce multiple images parasternal view, mechanical position of the comet behind the true structure. valves, leads of cardiac devices, tail artefacts. lung comets). Normally these artefacts are easily to identify. However, they impede the view behind the origin of these artefacts. Mirror image The mechanism of mirror images is similar to Mirror artefacts can be Alterations and artefact reverberation artefacts. Again, a strong identified by parallel mirror- changing the reflector—normally in the presence of a good inverted movements of cardiac angulation of the acoustic window—is
