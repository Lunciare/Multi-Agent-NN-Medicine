of the coronary sinus can be visualized ( Fig. 1.35e–h). The standardized 4-chamber view is obtained by a rotation of the plane of about 0°–40° ( Fig. 1.36a–b), straightening the tip of the probe and retracting the probe to the mid-oesophageal window to get the apex into the centre of the scanning sector. The transoesophageal 2- chamber view is shown by rotating the plane a further 60° without any movement of the tip and/or the shaft (60°–100°) ( Fig. 1.36c–d). Then, the left ventricular apex is still in the centreline of the scanning sector. The transoesophageal long-axis view is obtained by further plane rotation of about 60° (120°–160°) ( Fig. 1.36e– f). The angle distance between the views is like in transthoracic echocardiography—60° if the left ventricular apex is in the centre of the scanning sector. If this is not possible and the left ventricular apex is rotating from the right side of the sector in the 4-chamber view to the left side of the sector in the long-axis view, which occurs if the correct position in the upper oesophagus cannot be achieved, the angle differences between the planes of the left ventricle will change. This is the reason why
