the inferior caval vein should be documented for estimation of the preload of the right ventricle ( Fig. 1.31a–b). In the presence of normal right atrial pressure, the central venous pressure is normal, which can be documented by pulsatile wall movement and a complete breath-dependent inspiratory collapse of the inferior caval vein. The right atrial pressure is increased in patients with cardiac stasis on the right side, documented by partial collapse or a complete loss of collapse of the inferior caval vein during deep inspiration.
