the proximal convergence zone becomes smaller. Fig. 1.10 Parasternal short-axis view (a) and a corresponding M-Mode (b) with increased depth to document reverberation artefacts due to strong reflectors. The epicardium represents one strong reflector (thick red arrow) causing a reverberation signal in the far field (thin red arrow) as well as comet tail artefacts (yellow arrows). In addition the mirroring of the posterior wall is shown (green lines). In the M-Mode the parallel movement of the artefact in relation to the reflector is labelled by the red arrows. The biplane parasternal view with the short axis characterized by the white line in the parasternal view documents again the strong reflector (red arrow), comet tail artefacts (yellow arrows) and mirror artefacts (green lines). In addition the reverberations of the mitral valve are seen in the long axis as well as in the short-axis view (blue arrows). It has to be mentioned that the mitral valve as the reflector is not visualized in the short-axis view (c). A reverberation artefact mimicking a dissection membrane in the ascending aorta is shown in (d). Fig. 1.11 Transoesophageal simultaneous 2D- and colour-coded Doppler short-axis views of the descending aorta. The distal aortic wall represents a
