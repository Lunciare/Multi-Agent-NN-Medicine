during diastole (e) and systole (f), as well as the corresponding colour-coded images during diastole (g) and systole (h). Additional comments in the text. Fig. 1.30 The standardized subcostal short-axis view through the pulmonary valve and the pulmonary trunk at diastole (a) and systole (b). The corresponding colour-coded views are displayed in (c) and (d). In (e) the pulsed-wave Doppler spectrum of the right ventricular outflow tract is shown. Additional comments in the text.

Principles of transoesophageal echocardiography—practical aspects A transthoracic echocardiography should be generally performed prior to a transoesophageal p. 25 echocardiography, if it is possible. The main reason for the transthoracic pre-examination in adult patients is the fact that multiple cineloops and Doppler spectra can be achieved and documented in a high and often better image quality in the transthoracic than in the transoesophageal approach. This mainly concerns the short-axis views of the left ventricle and the mitral valve, which often will be visualized by oblique views in the transgastric documentation and the Doppler spectra of the left heart, which will not show optimal Doppler angulations
