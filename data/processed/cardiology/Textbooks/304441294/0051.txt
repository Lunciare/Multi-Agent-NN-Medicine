region the P1-scallop of the mitral valve is depicted, near the inferior region the P3-scallop. In the centre of the mitral valve the A2-scallop is normally seen. The apical 2-chamber view is used for visual assessment of global and regional left ventricular function in the inferior and anterior regions of the left ventricular wall and for the morphological evaluation of the mitral valve. The colour-coded 2-chamber view is suitable for characterization of the defect localization in mitral valve regurgitation ( Fig. p. 21 1.22c–d). Fig. 1.22 Standardized grey-scale apical 2-chamber view during systole (a) and diastole (b), as well as the corresponding colour-coded images during systole (c) and diastole (d).

Fig. 1.23 Standardized grey-scale apical 4-chamber view during systole (a) and diastole (b), as well as the corresponding colour-coded images during systole (c) and diastole (d). Additional comments in the text. After modifying the hand position of the transducer to enable a further approximately 60° clockwise rotation of the transducer, this isolated rotation will be performed from the correctly set apical 2-chamber view to get the standardized apical 4-chamber view ( Fig. 1.23a–b). The correct apical 4-chamber view is characterized by the left ventricular cavity
