performed within 6–12 cardiac cycles using the cursor in the centre line of all parasternal short-axis views by scanning through the left ventricle over the long axis of the left ventricle by tilting the transducer starting from the short-axis view between the papillary muscles up to the cranial short-axis view of the centrally intersected aortic valve and ascending aorta ( Fig. 1.15a). By deriving M-modes and M-mode sweeps in the short axis, it can always be checked whether the left heart is sliced exactly in its centre line or only a secant view of the left ventricle is documented. This fact favours the acquisition of M-modes using short-axis views instead of a long-axis view. The correct transducer position is documented in the M-mode sweep by a horizontal line between the border of the ventral septum and the border of the ventral ascending aorta. The alternative to document the correct transducer position in the long-axis view simultaneously to the short-axis views is only possible by biplane scanning. The problem of isolated short-axis views is the fact that the transducer position is too much lateral or caudal, which causes an oval conformation of the ventricular wall at the level of the left
