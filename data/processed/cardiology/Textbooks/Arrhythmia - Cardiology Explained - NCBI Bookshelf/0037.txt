superiorly in the RA). Ventricular leads are positioned in the RV apex. Most ventricular leads are placed in position and left against the myocardial wall. In certain circumstances, eg, when these leads become easily displaced or do not provide adequate threshold values, an active fixation lead can be used. This lead has a screw "thread" on its end – usually covered by a dissolvable tip, so that it is not exposed until it is in position – that allows the lead to be fixed into the myocardium. After the leads are positioned, a series of tests are carried out to determine if the lead position is satisfactory from an electrical point of view. These would typically assess: threshold the voltage required to cause a contraction. This increases if the lead is not well- positioned and can be a sensitive method of detecting poor placement lead impedance this is a test of the integrity of the lead. It is essentially a measure of electrical resistance and is measured in Ohms abnormal stimulation of the phrenic nerve a high-voltage protocol tests for a diaphragmatic twitch Once all the required tests are completed, the pacemaker pocket (in the fascia overlying the pectoral muscle)
