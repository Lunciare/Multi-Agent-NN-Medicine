Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

by several factors: How long has AF been present? How likely is SR to be maintained? What is the risk of thromboembolism? How severe are the symptoms? Patients with longstanding AF or AF caused by structural abnormalities are least likely to stay in SR. Most cardiologists would agree that every patient should have one attempt at restoration of SR. However, this is not always the best policy. For example, in an elderly patient with asymptomatic, rate-controlled AF, the toxicity of antiarrhythmics may outweigh the benefit of restoration of SR. The following points regarding treatment are helpful when treating a patient with AF. Regardless of the treatment strategy, all patients should have an ECG, chest x-ray, echo, and testing of thyroid function. If the decision is made to accept permanent AF, then control the rate with a combination of digoxin, a β-blocker, or a rate-limiting calcium-channel antagonist, and anticoagulate with warfarin, aiming for an INR of 2–3. The INR should be determined weekly (at least) in the initial stages and monthly thereafter. Patients over the age of 75 years who are considered at high risk for bleeding complications can be targeted to a lower INR of 2. In patients with contraindications
