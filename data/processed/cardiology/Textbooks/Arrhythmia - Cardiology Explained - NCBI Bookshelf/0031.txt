at least 4 weeks. This is because the thromboembolic risk relates to "stunned" atria that do not resume normal mechanical function during this time. 12/18 Famous Scots The first insight into the mechanism of irregular pulse in atrial fibrillation was provided by James Mackenzie, a Scottish GP who used an ink polygraph to record and label jugular venous pulses. He noticed that the jugular "a" wave was lost when patients went from a normal to an irregular rhythm. New directions in the management of atrial fibrillation It has recently been established that triggers in pulmonary veins can initiate AF and that circumferential or segmental disconnection of these veins at the left atrial junction can provide effective therapy. In certain patients, success rates for catheter-based pulmonary vein isolation range from 70% to 90%, but more than one procedure is often necessary. Surgery for AF is now usually reserved for use as an adjunctive treatment in patients having mitral or coronary surgery. Nevertheless, the large experience of the Maze procedure provides an important source of information to guide those performing catheter ablation. The Maze procedure was designed to exclude any place in the atria where the macro re-entrant circuits that underlie AF
