Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

patient is compromised – with pain, dyspnea, hypotension, and light headedness – this is an emergency and the patient needs an intravenous (IV) cannula inserted and a defibrillator brought in immediately. Treatment then depends on the diagnosis (see Table 1). Table 1 Possible diagnoses of an arrhythmic patient. Clinical examination can help, whether an ECG is available or not. The key thing to remember is that there are few components in the electrical "wiring" of the heart (see Figure 1) and the pulse can only be fast or slow, regular or irregular. If an ECG is available, is the QRS complex narrow or broad? Broad (>0.12 seconds) is more likely to be ventricular tachycardia (VT) and will generally be more concerning than narrow, which suggests a high depolarization site and is likely to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

However, this is not a particularly helpful definition as it is well known that elite athletes can have "normal"
