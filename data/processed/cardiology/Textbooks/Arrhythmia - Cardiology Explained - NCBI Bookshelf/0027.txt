AF, and an ECG showing the classic irregular rhythm with a flat or irregular baseline (see Figure 18). The approach to management is guided, as before, by the clinical picture – is the patient compromised? If the answer is yes, you should refer immediately. If not, you then have to decide whether the AF is persistent or paroxysmal (see Figure 19). A large proportion of patients experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24–48 hours of AF onset, but it is rarely clear whether this is their first episode. The best approach is to teach the patient to take his or her own pulse and monitor its regularity. This way, you can gain some idea of how long the patient spends in AF and in SR over the next few days.

If they spontaneously cardiovert, chronic treatment of paroxysmal AF takes three forms: anticoagulation rate control (if necessary) antiarrhythmics (the choice of which is guided by symptoms) 11/18 Most recent studies show that even patients
