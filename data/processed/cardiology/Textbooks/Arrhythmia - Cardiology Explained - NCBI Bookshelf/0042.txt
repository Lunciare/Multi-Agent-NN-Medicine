positions on the body of the patient mobile phones – these should not be placed in a shirt pocket next to the pacemaker car batteries – batteries can produce large magnetic fields. Again, this is only a problem if the person is leaning over and the pacemaker comes close to the battery high-voltage cables Most manufacturers supply each pacemaker recipient with a wallet-sized emergency card for identification as the bearer of an implanted device. This card should include important information about current pacing parameters, names and numbers of the pulse generator (including leads), indication for pacing, and underlying structural heart disease. Patient follow-up Application of a magnet to many pacemaker generators reveals the current battery status by pacing with a fixed pacing rate or "magnet rate". The pacemaker rate decreases in most models 16/18 with declining battery charge. When a decrease indicates exhaustion of one battery capacity, the pulse generator should be replaced. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators The natural evolution of pacemaker technology led, in the late 1960s, to the development of the AICD. Early versions were implanted abdominally under general anesthesia. These boxes, now barely bigger than a VVI pacemaker, are implanted under heavy sedation/light general anesthesia, and have revolutionized
