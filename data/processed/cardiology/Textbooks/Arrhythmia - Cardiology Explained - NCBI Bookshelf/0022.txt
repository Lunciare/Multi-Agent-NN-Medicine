Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

in Boston is named after him. Ventricular tachycardia In the acute situation, broad complex tachycardias present a diagnostic challenge because SVT with aberrant conduction can be difficult to distinguish from VT. As mentioned previously, the key question remains – is the patient compromised? Certain features on the ECG can help to distinguish VT from SVT (see Figure 16): Figure 16 Electrocardiogram of ventricular tachycardia. a very broad QRS complex (>0.14 seconds) AV dissociation (but P waves are often difficult to distinguish in broad complex tachycardias) concordance (all QRS complexes in V1–V6 are either positive or negative) fusion beats capture beats However, the key test is an adenosine challenge, which will interrupt an SVT but have no effect on VT. If VT is clear from the ECG or adenosine challenge has no effect and the patient is compromised, immediate DC cardioversion is needed. If there is time, a short-acting induction agent should be administered (or IV midazolam can be used). If the patient is losing consciousness, even this can be bypassed. Finally, if the patient loses their pulse, the cardiac arrest protocol should be immediately instituted (see Chapter 1, Cardiac arrest). If the patient is only mildly compromised or suffering recurrent
