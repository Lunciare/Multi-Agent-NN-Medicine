seconds (check for bruits first) Valsalva maneuver – the patient should take a deep breath, then attempt to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis for up to 15 seconds diving reflex – this vestigial reflex, which allows marine animals to lower their metabolism when diving underwater, exists in humans and can increase vagal tone. Suddenly immerse the patient's face in very cold water In a number of patients, the tachycardia (ie, AVNRT) terminates spontaneously with these maneuvers. However, if it does not, you should consider an adenosine challenge. This procedure involves rapid IV injections of increasing doses of adenosine (3–16 mg). Adenosine has a very short half-life (10 seconds) and produces temporary AV block, which can interrupt re-entry. This procedure is also very useful diagnostically, as the transient AV block can unmask an underlying atrial rhythm. The use of a short-acting β-blocker (eg, esmolol) or a calcium-channel blocker (eg, verapamil) has also been found to be safe and effective in terminating AVNRT. Verapamil is particularly useful in patients with asthma, in whom adenosine is contraindicated. Symptomatic patients with frequent episodes of AVNRT can be considered for radiofrequency catheter ablation of the "slow" pathway; this can be successfully ablated in more
