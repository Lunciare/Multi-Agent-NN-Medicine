10), while left posterior hemiblock causes right axis deviation (see Figure 11). Figure 10 Left axis deviation. Figure 11 Right axis deviation. Bifascicular block The term "bifascicular block" refers to a block of any two of the three fascicles. Clearly, this should include LBBB (left anterior + left posterior); however, the term is usually reserved for: RBBB + left anterior hemiblock, ie, RBBB + left axis deviation RBBB + left posterior hemiblock, ie, RBBB + right axis deviation (the axis is usually normal in RBBB) Bifascicular block is not in itself an indication for pacing. However, when combined with intermittent second- or third-degree block, a DDD pacemaker should be fitted. Trifascicular block Trifascicular block refers to a block of all three fascicles (but with intact AV conduction). It usually refers to LBBB + a long PR interval. Although trifascicular block is not strictly speaking an indication for permanent pacing, some centers carry this out on the basis that it must reflect extensive conducting tissue damage. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Another term that is sometimes used is "nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect". This usually refers to an abnormal ECG that does not clearly fit any of the patterns described above. 6/18 The
