Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

the device on when the episode begins (or ends, facilitated by the use of a buffer), and thus record over a much greater period of time. An echocardiogram should be used to detect major structural abnormalities potentially associated with syncope (aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ischemia). Carotid sinus massage should be performed if bruits are absent. Before invasive electrophysiological testing, coronary artery disease should be excluded or treated. Electrophysiological testing is indicated whenever an arrhythmia is considered as a probable cause of syncope. Exercise testing may contribute to establishing a basis for syncope by revealing myocardial ischemia (substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias), catecholamine-sensitive tachycardias, exercise-induced AV block, and chronotropic incompetence (SND). Malignant vasovagal syncope In malignant vasovagal syncope, the sympathetic system is activated via a trigger, usually venous pooling, which forces vigorous contraction of a poorly filled ventricle. This stimulates the 3/18 mechanoreceptors in the ventricular wall, which lead (via C fibers and the brainstem) to overactivation of the parasympathetic system, and thus bradycardia and hypotension. This reflex is named Bezold–Jarisch after those who first described it (see Figure 3). Figure 3 The Bezold–Jarisch reflex. Tilt-table testing If malignant vasovagal syncope is suspected, the key investigation is upright tilt-table testing. This test
