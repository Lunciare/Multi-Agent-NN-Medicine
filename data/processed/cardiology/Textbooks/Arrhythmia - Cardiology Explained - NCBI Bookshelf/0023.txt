Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

Finally, if the patient loses their pulse, the cardiac arrest protocol should be immediately instituted (see Chapter 1, Cardiac arrest). If the patient is only mildly compromised or suffering recurrent episodes, other therapeutic options are: 9/18 IV amiodarone IV magnesium IV lidocaine (lignocaine) (no left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) overdrive pacing (this needs a temporary wire. The stimulator rate is turned up above the VT rate [usually ×3] to "capture" ventricular depolarization, and then gradually turned down) The chronic investigation and management of VT will be carried out by a specialist (and probably a cardiologist with a special interest in electrophysiology). Investigation will center on finding a cause of VT. In the acute situation, there is often an obvious precipitating event (eg, MI). However, the most common cause of recurrent VT is ischemic heart disease. Another key aspect of the investigation will be distinguishing between polymorphic and monomorphic VT. The former, in which complexes vary within or between episodes in their pattern, has a stronger association with sudden death. In difficult cases of VT, invasive electrophysiological testing (often with concurrent coronary angiography) is warranted. Control of chronic VT is pharmacological – typical drugs that are used include sotalol, flecainide, amiodarone, propafenone,
