those who first described it (see Figure 3). Figure 3 The Bezold–Jarisch reflex. Tilt-table testing If malignant vasovagal syncope is suspected, the key investigation is upright tilt-table testing. This test is performed on a specially designed table with the patient initially in a supine position. He/she is then tilted upright to a maximum of 60°–80° in such a way as to avoid recruiting the postural muscles. This maximizes venous pooling. The patient is left in this position for up to 40 minutes. The normal tilt-table response is a baroreceptor-mediated decrease in inhibitory drive to the vasomotor center, ie, vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate and ventricular contractility. The test result is considered abnormal when symptomatic hypotension is reproduced (Bezold– Jarisch reflex). Treatment Therapy to prevent recurrent vasovagal syncope has included the use of β-blockers and vagolytics (eg, disopyramide). Atrioventricular block AV block occurs when the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles is delayed or blocked. First-degree AV block This is where there is a prolonged PR interval of >200 milliseconds (5 small squares; see Figure 4). No specific therapy is required and the prognosis is excellent. However, it can be a marker for an underlying problem such
