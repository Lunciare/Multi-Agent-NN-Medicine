chronic treatment of paroxysmal AF takes three forms: anticoagulation rate control (if necessary) antiarrhythmics (the choice of which is guided by symptoms) 11/18 Most recent studies show that even patients with paroxysmal AF or successful cardioversion should remain on anticoagulation (warfarin, international normalized ratio [INR] 2–3) since these individuals have a greater risk of cerebrovascular events than of bleeding complications. The use of rate control and antiarrhythmics is also individualized – some patients will require neither. However, a good choice is a beta-blocker (eg, carvedilol, metoprolol), which can impact both of these factors. Another choice for patients with heart failure or hypertension associated with AF is flecainide (in the absence of coronary artery disease) or amiodarone (if coronary artery disease is present). If, several days following chronic treatment, patients remain in AF, there are two avenues of management: accept progression to permanent AF (and attend to rate control and anticoagulation) or attempt cardioversion. Deciding between the two (the decision will often be in the hands of the cardiologist) is influenced by several factors: How long has AF been present? How likely is SR to be maintained? What is the risk of thromboembolism? How severe are the symptoms? Patients with longstanding
