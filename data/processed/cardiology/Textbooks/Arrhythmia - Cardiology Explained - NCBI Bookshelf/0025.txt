a continuously changing axis (hence, "turning of points"; see Figure 17), which can look like ventricular fibrillation (VF). The prolonged QT interval can be caused by: Figure 17 Electrocardiogram showing torsades de pointes. antiarrhythmic agents hypokalemia hypomagnesemia bradycardia However, in very rare cases it may be congenital (Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome or Romano–Ward syndrome). Atrial fibrillation AF is the single most common cardiac arrhythmia. It is a condition where there is disorganized electrical and mechanical activity of the atria with a mechanism of multiple re-entrant wavelets. 10/18 It may be chronic or occur in a paroxysmal fashion (see Table 6). On the ECG, it is recognized as an irregular rhythm with absent P waves (see Figure 18). Low-amplitude wavelets are frequently seen, but in many cases the baseline is flat. Usually, the ventricular response is controlled by the physiological conduction delay of the AV node and the ventricular response is slower in patients with diseases of the conducting system, in the elderly, or in individuals receiving medications that impair AV nodal conduction (eg, β-blockers, digitalis, or calcium-channel blockers). With intense sympathetic stimulation, it may be as rapid as 160–180 bpm. Table 6 Classification of atrial fibrillation. Figure 18 Electrocardiogram of
