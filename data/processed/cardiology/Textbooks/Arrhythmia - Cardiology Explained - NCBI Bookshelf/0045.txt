Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

during normal SR; (2) during an induced arrhythmia; and (3) following premature extrastimuli. Measurements are usually taken from several intracardiac sites, allowing identification of sinus node function and recovery, sinoatrial conduction, AV nodal conduction, and triggered ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment is with radiofrequency stimulation, which can ablate accessory pathways or interrupt re-entry circuits.
