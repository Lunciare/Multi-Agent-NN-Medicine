Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

term that is sometimes used is "nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect". This usually refers to an abnormal ECG that does not clearly fit any of the patterns described above. 6/18 The QRS complex will generally not be wide, but the waveform will be atypical. It is of unknown significance, but is likely to be benign. Tachyarrhythmia The general principle of patient management outlined at the beginning of this chapter holds true for patients suffering from tachyarrhythmia: is the patient compromised? And, as above, the use of an ECG will be critical when making the diagnosis. However, you will often be called to see a patient in the community where no ECG is available. In this situation, try to make a diagnosis based on the defibrillator monitor. Most patients with tachyarrhythmia will require referral, but making your own diagnosis can only help the situation. The key questions are: do the results show broad (>0.12 seconds) or narrow complexes? are they regular or irregular? More sophisticated interpretation of the ECG is helpful, but the answers to these key questions will be sufficient to guide the immediate management (see Table 5).
