Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

of >200 milliseconds (5 small squares; see Figure 4). No specific therapy is required and the prognosis is excellent. However, it can be a marker for an underlying problem such as myocarditis, MI, degenerative disease, or, most commonly, a drug effect (eg, tricyclic antidepressants). Figure 4 Electrocardiogram of first-degree atrioventricular block. Second-degree AV block This is divided into two types: type I (Mobitz I or Wenckebach AV block) type II (Mobitz II AV block) Type I occurs when there is a repeated pattern of progressive prolongation of the PR interval, which eventually results in the failure of conduction of one atrial beat (see Figure 5). The cause is usually benign, but it can be a marker for the same underlying cardiac problems as first-degree AV block. In most cases, treatment is unnecessary. Routine prophylactic permanent pacing is not recommended unless the patient is symptomatic with presyncope, recurrent syncope, or bradycardia that exacerbates congestive heart failure or angina. 4/18 Figure 5 Electrocardiogram of type I second-degree atrioventricular block (Wenckebach). In type II, most beats are conducted with a constant PR interval, but occasionally atrial depolarization is not followed by ventricular depolarization (see Figure 6). Type II is pathological and indicates disease
