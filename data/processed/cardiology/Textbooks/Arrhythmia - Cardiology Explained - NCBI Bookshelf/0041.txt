arrhythmia with tachycardic pacing. If this happens, it is possible to alter the program (to DDI or set an upper rate limit) or use antiarrhythmic drugs. This problem can be avoided by using a mode-switching pacemaker that detects atrial arrhythmia and switches to VVI. Pacemaker ECGs ECGs are harder to interpret in a patient with a pacemaker as there are more variables; although the pacing spikes are usually straightforward to recognize. It is important to remember that the paced QRS complex will be in an LBBB pattern because the wave of depolarization begins where the lead is placed in the RV. Doctor, I have a pacemaker, what should I avoid? This is a common question that patients ask. In general, patients should live life as normal. They should avoid magnetic resonance imaging studies, and care should be taken with the following: electrocautery during surgery – this can cause sensing problems therapeutic radiation cardioversion/defibrillation – this should be carried out using the lowest effective energy with the paddles in the anterior–posterior positions on the body of the patient mobile phones – these should not be placed in a shirt pocket next to the pacemaker car batteries – batteries can produce large
