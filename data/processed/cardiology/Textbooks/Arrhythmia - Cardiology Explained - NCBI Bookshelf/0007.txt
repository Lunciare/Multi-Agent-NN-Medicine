Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

generalized tonic/clonic movements can be the result of syncope, rather than the cause of it. Evaluation It can be difficult to identify the cause of syncope. Initial clinical evaluation should include supine and erect blood pressures and heart rate measurements. Blood glucose, serum electrolytes, hematocrit, and drug levels (if appropriate) should also be obtained. Assessment of a syncopal event requires information from both the patient and a witness; the pattern can be helpful (see Table 4). A baseline 12-lead ECG may suggest possible causes such as ischemia, Wolff– Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or a prolonged QT interval. In most cases, it will be necessary to refer the patient for additional testing (see Figure 2). Additional testing may include the following. Table 4 Patterns of syncope. Figure 2 Evaluation of syncope. CT: computed tomography; ECG: electrocardiogram; EEG: electroencephalogram; EP: electrophysiology; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Documentation of a symptomatic arrhythmia may be achieved by Holter monitoring. However, if syncope is infrequent, event-recorder monitoring may be more helpful. These devices allow patients to turn the device on when the episode begins (or ends, facilitated by the use of a buffer), and thus record over a much greater period of time. An echocardiogram should be
