Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

(RA) radiofrequency catheter ablation is now considered a curative approach in patients with recurrent atrial flutter. It can be eliminated by creating a linear lesion in the isthmus between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava. Acute success rates of 85%–90% and recurrence rates of 10%–15% have been reported patients with atrial flutter require anticoagulation therapy and, although there is more effective atrial contraction in atrial flutter (which may explain the decreased incidence of thromboembolism), guidelines are similar to those for AF Pacemakers Implantation of a permanent electronic replacement for the heart's natural pacemaker began in the 1950s and is now a well-established treatment that increases patient longevity and improves their quality of life. Since its invention, advances in programmability, telemetry, and the ability to sense and pace two chambers have improved the level of care that can be provided. Miniaturization has made the process of implantation more straightforward and long-term 13/18 complications less common. Advances in pacemaker technology mean that several new indications are likely to be added to the standard ones (see Table 7). Table 7 Standard indications for pacemakers. Pacemaker codes Pacemaker codes are, to many, one of the most confusing aspects of electrocardiology (see Table
