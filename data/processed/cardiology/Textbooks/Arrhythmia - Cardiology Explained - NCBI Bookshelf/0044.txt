burst pacing – a short burst of paced beats delivered at approximately 90% of the rate of the VT ramp pacing – a short burst of paced beats at a rate increasing up to 90% of the rate of the VT (to try to achieve capture) low-energy shock high-energy shock The programming of AICDs is sophisticated and is carried out by telemetry (a magnet detector is placed over the unit). The energy of shock delivered by the AICD is a magnitude less than that delivered across the chest wall by an external defibrillator (internal 5–35 J, external 100–360 J). If an AICD delivers a shock, it is important to refer the patient to the nearest center where the unit can be interrogated. Electrophysiological studies Electrophysiology is a rapidly advancing field in which the potential indications currently outweigh the availability of facilities. The indications for electrophysiology are detailed in Table 9. Table 9 Potential indications for electrophysiology. The essence of the electrophysiological test is a measurement of the intracardiac ECG: (1) during normal SR; (2) during an induced arrhythmia; and (3) following premature extrastimuli. Measurements are usually taken from several intracardiac sites, allowing identification of sinus node function and recovery, sinoatrial
