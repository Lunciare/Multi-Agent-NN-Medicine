Arrhythmia - Cardiology Explained

II, most beats are conducted with a constant PR interval, but occasionally atrial depolarization is not followed by ventricular depolarization (see Figure 6). Type II is pathological and indicates disease of the conduction system distal to the AV node. It can frequently lead to complete AV block, causing Stokes–Adams attacks. Therefore, temporary and then permanent pacing (DDD) is indicated in most patients, even those who initially present without symptoms. Figure 6 Electrocardiogram of type II second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz II). Third-degree AV block (complete heart block) With complete heart block, there is complete dissociation of the P waves and QRS complexes (see Figure 7). The ventricular escape complexes are usually wide and occur at around 30–40 bpm. There is a significant risk of asystole and thus permanent pacing (DDD) is indicated, regardless of symptoms. Acquired AV block is most commonly due to ischemic heart disease or drug toxicity (in particular β-blockers, digitalis, and calcium-channel blockers). Figure 7 Electrocardiogram of third-degree atrioventricular block. Bradyarrhythmia in atrial fibrillation In patients with intermittent or chronic AF, AV node dysfunction is not an uncommon finding. Clearly, this will be aggravated by many of the rate-limiting drugs given to control the ventricular rate. In these
