Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

day for men. People who do not normally drink alcohol should not begin drinking." Regular exercise (walking rather than weight training), stopping smoking, and limiting caffeine intake can all assist in lowering BP and may independently reduce cardiac risk. Pharmacotherapy In most patients, altering lifestyle factors is not enough. For these people, there is the difficult balance of pharmacotherapy. Fewer than half of all hypertensive patients can be controlled on monotherapy, whilst one third require three or more drugs. Knowledge of the mechanisms of action of antihypertensives is important as it allows rational combinations to be chosen based on complementary mechanisms of action. There are four major groups of drug treatments for hypertension and several less frequently used classes. The sites of action of these antihypertensive agents are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Major physiological mechanisms of antihypertensives. See Figure 2 for details of centrally acting hypertensives. ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; AT: angiotensin. Beta-blockers Beta-adrenoreceptor blockers have been used for many decades in the treatment of hypertension and are one of the few classes of agents that have been proven to reduce mortality. They work by reducing cardiac output via negative inotropic and chronotropic actions. In addition, they block sympathetic
