Chapter 6 Hypertension Background Approximately one in four adults in the western world suffers from hypertension. Of these, 32% are not aware that they have it, 15% are not on any therapy, and 26% are on inadequate therapy. Only 27% are receiving adequate therapy. Hypertension is a difficult condition to manage because patients are generally asymptomatic and treatment is preventative rather than palliative. Convincing patients of the need for poorly tolerated medication in the face of well-being is one of the challenges confronting clinicians involved in improving the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality caused by high blood pressure (BP). If untreated, hypertension has serious consequences, including renal disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular accident.
