cardiac death. A history of smoking and physical activity should also be taken. More specific to hypertension, caffeine and alcohol intake should be recorded and some insight into diet and lifestyle stress should be acquired. Examination The physical examination has three specific objectives: documenting an accurate BP excluding possible secondary causes quantifying end-organ damage The BP should be measured in both arms, with the arm and manometer at the patient's heart level. Readings should be taken manually in a standardized way (most clinical trials use Korotkoff I and V – from the first sound heard to the complete disappearance of sounds). The use of a large-diameter cuff is essential in those with large arms. The general appearance of the patient may suggest Cushing's syndrome, a thyroid disorder, polycystic ovarian disease, sleep apnea, or acromegaly. All peripheral pulses should be taken to screen for vascular disease, but special attention should be paid, especially in young people, to radiofemoral delay (diminished and late pulses in the femoral arteries), which suggests aortic coarctation. If positive, the BP should be measured in all four limbs. Auscultation should also be carried out over the aorta and renal arteries for bruits suggestive of stenosis. Abdominal examination
