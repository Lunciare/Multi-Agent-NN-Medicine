Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

The question as to the relative importance of systolic and diastolic BP is common in the management of hypertension. For many years it was felt that as systolic hypertension was more common in the elderly it was an inevitable part of aging and arteriolar stiffening. As a result, the focus was primarily on diastolic BP. In fact, both systolic and diastolic BP predict mortality equally well. However, in the elderly population with predominantly systolic BP, recent evidence suggests it is not the absolute values of systolic or diastolic hypertension, but the difference between the two that predicts mortality best, ie, the pulse pressure. This means that a patient with a BP of 160/80 mm Hg may be at higher risk than a patient with a BP of 160/90 mm Hg. This finding, which actually fits well with current thinking on reflected pressure waves in the stiffer arteries of older people, has little therapeutic relevance as yet because we do not have agents that preferentially improve pulse pressure. Thiazides and calcium-channel blockers reduce systolic hypertension more than diastolic, so these are the rational choices. However, the key for the future may be drugs that can restore vascular elasticity, and in this
