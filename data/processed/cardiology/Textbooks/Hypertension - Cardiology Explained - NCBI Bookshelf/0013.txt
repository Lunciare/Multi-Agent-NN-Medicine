initiation and maintenance of these agents. ACEIs are contraindicated in women of child-bearing potential and may cause a troublesome cough through their inhibition of the enzyme responsible for bradykinin degradation. First-dose hypotension can be a problem in elderly patients on diuretics, although newer, longer-acting formulations have reduced this concern. ACEIs are lipid-neutral, improve insulin resistance, and may be able to induce regression of LVH. Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists Alpha -antagonists (such as doxazosin and prazosin) are becoming more widely used in the 1 treatment of hypertension. They have a good side-effect profile (palpitations and occasional postural hypotension). In addition, they are reported to have beneficial effects on lipid profile and insulin resistance, and lack the negative effects on sexual potency of other antihypertensives, which is a particular advantage for diabetics. They work to reduce total peripheral resistance by blocking the sympathetic activation of α -receptors on resistance vessels. 1 Centrally acting sympathomimetics Clonidine and α-methyldopa, centrally acting α -adrenoceptor agonists, were once popular 2 choices, but are now less widely initiated outside specialist scenarios such as pre-eclampsia. They carry a risk of rebound hypertension on withdrawal. Other vasodilators Other vasodilators, such as hydralazine and the very potent minoxidil, are mostly used in
