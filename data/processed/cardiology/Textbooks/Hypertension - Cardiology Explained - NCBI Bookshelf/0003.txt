awareness of treatable causes is important, especially in younger patients in whom there is a higher probability of the hypertension being secondary to some other cause. Causes of secondary hypertension are outlined in Table 2. Table 2 Causes of secondary hypertension. Assessment History History-taking is straightforward since, in most cases, hypertension is asymptomatic. However, symptoms can include headaches, transient ischemic attacks, mild visual disturbances, epistaxes, exertional dyspnea (if heart failure has developed), angina, claudication, weight gain (in Cushing's syndrome), nocturia, and hematuria (with renal disease). A full drug history is important and must include pharmacologically active preparations such as the combined contraceptive pill and herbal remedies, which are often not regarded by patients as drugs. Other important medications are steroids, sympathomimetics (eg, in cold cures), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and β-blockers. As with any cardiovascular disease, risk factors should be especially well documented. As full a family tree as possible should be drawn to document hypertension, diabetes, or early cardiac death. A history of smoking and physical activity should also be taken. More specific to hypertension, caffeine and alcohol intake should be recorded and some insight into diet and
