Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

blockers reduce systolic hypertension more than diastolic, so these are the rational choices. However, the key for the future may be drugs that can restore vascular elasticity, and in this respect nitrates – which donate nitric oxide – are the most promising. Special populations Elderly patients It is a myth that hypertension is "normal" in the elderly and they have less to lose because of a shorter life expectancy. In fact, the absolute benefit from treatment of the elderly is much greater than that for younger hypertensives because of their larger absolute risk. However, it is true that the prevalence of hypertension is higher amongst the elderly. Optimum BP levels are the same for older people as they are for younger people, and evidence for treatment benefit extends until 6/9 at least 80 years. Taking pulse pressure into account (see "Systolic versus diastolic hypertension", above), the best agents are thiazide diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. Ethnic groups Afro-Caribbean blacks have a particularly high prevalence of hypertension and severe complications. Their presentation is unusual in that the renin–angiotensin system is often suppressed. As a result, β-blockers and ACEIs are unlikely to be successful as monotherapy in these patients.
