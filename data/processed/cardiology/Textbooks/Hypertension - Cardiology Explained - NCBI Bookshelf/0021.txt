Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

secondary hypertension patients with possible accelerated hypertension (see below) Most generalists would expect to try at least three agents and carry out basic investigations before referring the patient to a specialist for the management of resistant hypertension. Certainly, it would be unusual to make use of vasodilators in the community. However, in the special groups mentioned above, it would not be uncommon for the full work-up to be done from the beginning in a special center. Clearly, any suspicion of accelerated hypertension should result in immediate referral. Basic science BP is a normally distributed, polygenic trait. That is, an individual's BP results from the effects of many genes interacting with each other and the environment. Due in part to this, genetics has so far struggled to explain essential hypertension. However, early studies have suggested that up to 50% of variation within the general population could be explained by genetic factors. The experimental approach has involved studying affected sibling pairs and scanning the whole genome for chromosomal regions with higher levels of genetic marker similarity. Selectively bred animal models have also been used to study hypertension. Despite much effort, the only mutations that have been convincingly shown to be associated with
