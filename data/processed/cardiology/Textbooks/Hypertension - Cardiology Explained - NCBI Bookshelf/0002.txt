mm Hg difference between BP measurements taken in the clinic and those taken at home – and in many patients it can be significantly more. Similarly, measurements in the clinic cannot control for a large element of random biological variation, diurnal variation, and variation due to chance stress (eg, stress due to being in a traffic jam on the way to the clinic). Consequently, it is recommended that at least three readings are taken. Table 1 Guidelines for threshold values between normal and high blood pressure. The annual risk of death from cardiovascular disease (including stroke) or coronary artery disease can be calculated from the European Society of Cardiology tables or Framingham risk tables. Some bodies recommend that mild hypertensives should only be treated if their cardiovascular risk exceeds 2% per year. This consideration of individual risk is welcome, since until recently most clinical trials have involved head-to-head comparisons of monotherapy, whereas in practice most patients require combination therapy. Causes No cause is identified in 95% of hypertension patients. However, awareness of treatable causes is important, especially in younger patients in whom there is a higher probability of the hypertension being secondary to some other cause.
