Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

of the few classes of agents that have been proven to reduce mortality. They work by reducing cardiac output via negative inotropic and chronotropic actions. In addition, they block sympathetic nervous system stimulation of renin release by juxtaglomerular cells. As with all medications, their use is limited primarily by adverse effects. Asthma is generally considered to be an absolute contraindication, even with agents selective for the cardiovascular system (β - 1 receptors). Peripheral vascular disease and bradycardia are relative contraindications. In susceptible patients, heart block and heart failure may be initiated. The most commonly reported adverse effect is lethargy, and nightmares can occur with lipid- soluble β-blockers. As with all antihypertensives, erectile dysfunction (ED) is a problem. The best guide as to whether ED is iatrogenic is to determine whether the symptoms appeared suddenly. Nevertheless, β-blockers have significant advantages in patients with coexistent angina and anxiety, and also after MI. Diuretics Thiazide diuretics, such as bendrofluazide, are another class of agent for which randomized controlled trial evidence indicates an improvement in survival, and should be the first-line drug in the elderly and in those with systolic hypertension. They work by inhibiting NaCl reabsorption + in the distal tubule. This initially
