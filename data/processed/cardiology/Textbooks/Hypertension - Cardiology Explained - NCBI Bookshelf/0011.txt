in survival, and should be the first-line drug in the elderly and in those with systolic hypertension. They work by inhibiting NaCl reabsorption + in the distal tubule. This initially leads to an increase in Na loss and a reduction in plasma volume. However, the plasma volume soon recovers, leaving a reduced total peripheral resistance, for which the mechanism is unknown. Thiazide diuretics are widely used and very cheap, with a moderate side-effect profile (most commonly hypokalemia, dyslipidemia, and gout). Potassium levels should be checked regularly. Loop diuretics have a role to play in the place of thiazides when renal function is compromised (creatinine >180 μmol/L or 2 mg/dL) and on a short-term basis, in addition to thiazides, in resistant hypertension, where a significant proportion of patients suffer plasma volume overload. 4/9 Calcium-channel blockers A large number of calcium-channel blockers have been developed and there is good evidence of their ability to reduce BP. There are three subclasses: the dihydropyridines (nifedipine-like), the phenylalkylamine derivatives (verapamil), and the benzothiazepines (diltiazem). All work by blocking the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels, thereby causing vasodilatation. Dihydropyridines cause vasodilatation without the bradycardic and negatively inotropic effects of diltiazem
