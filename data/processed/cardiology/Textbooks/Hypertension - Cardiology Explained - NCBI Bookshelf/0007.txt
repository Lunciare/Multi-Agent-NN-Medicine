variability, with resistant hypertension, or most commonly to diagnose "white coat" hypertension. An ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) is not required for those who are at high risk already, either because of target organ damage or cardiovascular complications. Such patients can be treated on the basis of clinic measurements. Equally, an evidence-based approach suggests that those with mild hypertension, no target organ damage, and low estimated risk may be left untreated (but followed) without ABPM. Management Many randomized controlled trials have shown that BP reduction prevents the complications of hypertension. Early trials showed a significant improvement in the risk of stroke, but little or no reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Later trials, particularly those in the elderly, have also shown a reduction in CHD events, although the benefit is not as great as observational studies predicted. A summary of hypertensive treatments is shown in Table 4. Table 4 Summary of hypertensive treatment. Lifestyle change Lifestyle changes are important in the management of patients with hypertension and can be used alone during an initial period for those with mild hypertension and low risk. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake can improve BP via an effect on potassium; in combination with a
