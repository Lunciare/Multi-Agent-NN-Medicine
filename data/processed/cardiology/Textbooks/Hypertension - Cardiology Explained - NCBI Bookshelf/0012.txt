Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

work by blocking the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels, thereby causing vasodilatation. Dihydropyridines cause vasodilatation without the bradycardic and negatively inotropic effects of diltiazem and verapamil (which limits the use of the latter agents to patients with normal left ventricular function) – so a simpler classification is "rate-limiting" and "non- rate-limiting". Short-acting dihydropyridines have become unpopular following reports of increased risk of MI at high doses. Longer-acting calcium-channel blockers are useful antihypertensives, especially as they are lipid-neutral. Side effects include ankle edema, headache, and flushing. Renin/angiotensin system antagonists Angiotensin is a potent vasoconstrictor, but also increases activity of the sympathetic nervous system by both central and peripheral mechanisms. Fortunately, the renin–angiotensin system provides a series of targets for pharmacological attack by ACEIs, angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone). ACEIs and ARBs tend to be well tolerated and have few contraindications, the most important of which is renal artery stenosis. It is important to monitor renal function and potassium levels during initiation and maintenance of these agents. ACEIs are contraindicated in women of child-bearing potential and may cause a troublesome cough through their inhibition of the enzyme responsible for bradykinin degradation.
