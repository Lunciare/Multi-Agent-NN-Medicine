specialist scenarios such as pre-eclampsia. They carry a risk of rebound hypertension on withdrawal. Other vasodilators Other vasodilators, such as hydralazine and the very potent minoxidil, are mostly used in resistant hypertension when standard agents fail. Use of the latter is generally restricted by unpleasant side effects such as hypertrichosis. Imidazoline type 1 receptor agonists The identification of imidazoline receptors has revealed that the effects of older agents on the central nervous system reflect a relatively nonspecific central site of action mediated primarily through α -adrenoceptor agonism (see Figure 2). It seems that some of the adverse effects of 2 these agents, which are also mediated through this pathway, can be avoided by the use of selective imidazoline type 1 receptor agents. Early results suggest these agents are well tolerated, 5/9 with a dry mouth being the only frequently reported unwanted effect (13% at 3 weeks, 2% at 12 months). Figure 2 Centrally acting antihypertensives. Pharmacotherapy selection In the absence of compelling reasons to choose other medications, the first-line choice should remain a β-blocker or thiazide diuretic. These are the drugs for which clear evidence of mortality reduction exists. In addition, they are generally well tolerated. There are good reasons
