thyroid function should be tested. A low threshold should be adopted for the following: renal ultrasound urine microscopy (for casts and cells – glomerulonephritis) urine samples for testing: catecholamine metabolites (three samples, one every 24 hours, required in acid bottles) urinary free cortisol (one sample in a plain bottle – this can also be used for glomerular filtration rate and 24-hour protein tests) Once hypertension has caused end-organ damage, the risks associated with any given level of BP are higher. Evidence of end-organ damage should therefore be sought in all patients. Dip-stick urinalysis, tests for urea and electrolytes, and a renal ultrasound can reveal renal insufficiency. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be readily detected by electrocardiography or echocardiography (a chest x-ray is rarely necessary). Hypertension with LVH carries a particularly poor prognosis (the 5-year mortality is around 30%–40%) and is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. A useful tool, both for generalists and specialists, is the 24-hour ambulatory BP recording. It is particularly useful when clinic measurements show variability, with resistant hypertension, or most commonly to diagnose "white coat" hypertension. An ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) is not required for those who are at high risk already, either because
