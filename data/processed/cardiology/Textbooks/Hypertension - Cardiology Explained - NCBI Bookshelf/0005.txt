Hypertension - Cardiology Explained

If positive, the BP should be measured in all four limbs. Auscultation should also be carried out over the aorta and renal arteries for bruits suggestive of stenosis. Abdominal examination may reveal palpable kidneys in polycystic disease or a pheochromocytoma. End-organ damage can be detected by palpation of the apex beat, detection of bibasal crackles, and examination of the fundi. Diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is based on a four-stage grading system, as outlined in Table 3. Table 3 Stages of hypertensive retinopathy (Keith–Wagener classification). Investigations Investigations are aimed at diagnosing rare secondary causes and quantifying end-organ damage. Only electrolytes, creatinine, fasting glucose, and lipids should be requested in every patient. A low potassium and raised sodium level suggests hyperaldosteronism – either primary (Conn's syndrome) or secondary to renal artery stenosis. This should prompt measurement of renin and 2/9 aldosterone levels. It should be noted that the potassium level is normal in 50% of cases of primary hyperaldosteronism. Raised calcium levels suggest possible hyperparathyroidism. If the symptoms suggest a thyroid problem, thyroid function should be tested. A low threshold should be adopted for the following: renal ultrasound urine microscopy (for casts and cells – glomerulonephritis) urine samples for testing: catecholamine metabolites
