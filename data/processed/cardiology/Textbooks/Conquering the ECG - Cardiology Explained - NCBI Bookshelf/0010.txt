atrial contractions to one ventricular contraction should be specified. Figure 8 ECG demonstrating atrial flutter – note the characteristic sawtooth waveform. Axis The axis is the net direction of electrical activity during depolarization. It is altered by left ventricular or right ventricular hypertrophy or by bundle branch blocks. It is a very straightforward measurement that, once it has been grasped, can be calculated instantaneously: find the QRS complex in the I and aVF leads (because these look at the heart at 0° and +90°, respectively) determine the net positivity of the QRS wave from each of the two leads by subtracting the S wave height (the number of small squares that it crosses as it dips below the baseline – if it does) from the R wave height (the number of small squares that it crosses as it rises) (see Figure 9a and 9b) plot out the net sizes of these QRS waves against each other on a vector diagram (see Figure 9c). For the I lead, plot net positives to the right and net negatives to the left; for the aVF lead, plot positive downwards and negative upwards the direction of the endpoint from the starting point represents the
