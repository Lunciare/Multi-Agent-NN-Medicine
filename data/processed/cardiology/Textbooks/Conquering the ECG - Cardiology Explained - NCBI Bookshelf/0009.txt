one QRS wave and the next; divide 300 by this number to determine the rate (see Table 2). Table 2 Some common heart rates as determined by analysis of the QRS complex. Rhythm P waves are the key to determining whether a patient is in sinus rhythm or not. If P waves are not clearly visible in the chest leads, look for them in the other leads. The presence of P waves 4/9 immediately before every QRS complex indicates sinus rhythm. If there are no P waves, note whether the QRS complexes are wide or narrow, regular or irregular. No P waves and irregular narrow QRS complexes This is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation (see Figure 7). Sometimes the baseline appears "noisy" and sometimes it appears entirely flat. However, if there are no P waves and the QRS complexes appear at randomly irregular intervals, the diagnosis is atrial fibrillation. Figure 7 ECG demonstrating atrial fibrillation. Sawtooth P waves A sawtooth waveform signifies atrial flutter (see Figure 8). The number of atrial contractions to one ventricular contraction should be specified. Figure 8 ECG demonstrating atrial flutter – note the characteristic sawtooth waveform. Axis The axis is the net direction of electrical
