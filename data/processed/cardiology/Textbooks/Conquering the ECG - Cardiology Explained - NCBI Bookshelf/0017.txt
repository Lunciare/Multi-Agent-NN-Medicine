Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

except aVR. T-wave inversion can represent current ischemia or previous infarction (see Figure 17). In combination with LVH and ST depression, it can represent "strain". This form of LVH carries a poor prognosis. Figure 17 ECG demonstrating T-wave inversion. Long QT interval The QT interval should be less than half of the R–R interval. Calculation of the corrected QT (QTc) is generally not necessary and usually will have been done by the ECG machine (but beware of blindly believing any automated diagnostic system). Conditions associated with a long QT interval are outlined in Table 3 (see Figure 18). Table 3 Causes of a long QT interval. Figure 18 ECG demonstrating a long QT interval. Long QT syndrome may also be drug-induced (see Table 4, p. 32). Once this occurs, the responsible drug needs to be discontinued. Table 4 Drug-induced increase in the QT interval and torsade de pointes. Pattern combinations Digoxin A reverse tick ST depression is characteristic and does not indicate toxicity. Digoxin toxicity can result in dysrhythmia. Pulmonary embolism Sinus tachycardia is seen in many patients with pulmonary embolism. New right bundle branch block (RBBB) or right axis deviation with "strain" can also indicate PE. The classic S
