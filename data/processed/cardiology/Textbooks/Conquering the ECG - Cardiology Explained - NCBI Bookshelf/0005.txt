Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

is delayed briefly at the AVN and atrial contraction is completed. Figure 3 The cardiac depolarization route. AVN: atrioventricular node; SAN: sinoatrial node. Reproduced with permission from WB Saunders (Guyton A, Hall J. Textbook of Medical Physiology. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1996). The wave of depolarization then proceeds rapidly to the bundle of His where it splits into two pathways and travels along the right and left bundle branches. The impulse travels the length of the bundles along the interventricular septum to the base of the heart, where the bundles divide into the Purkinje system. From here, the wave of depolarization is distributed to the ventricular walls and initiates ventricular contraction. The ECG trace The ECG machine processes the signals picked up from the skin by electrodes and produces a graphic representation of the electrical activity of the patient's heart. The basic pattern of the ECG is logical: electrical activity towards a lead causes an upward deflection electrical activity away from a lead causes a downward deflection depolarization and repolarization deflections occur in opposite directions The basic pattern of this electrical activity was first discovered over a hundred years ago. It comprises three waves, which have been named P, QRS (a
