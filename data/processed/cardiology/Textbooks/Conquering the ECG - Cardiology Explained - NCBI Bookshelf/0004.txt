vertical plane (see Figure 2), whereas the chest leads look at the heart in a horizontal plane. In this way, a three-dimensional electrical picture of the heart is built up (see Table 1). Figure 2 The limb leads looking at the heart in a vertical plane. Table 1 ECG leads and their respective views of the heart. Performing Dogs British physiologist Augustus D Waller of St Mary's Medical School, London, published the first human electrocardiogram in the British Medical Journal in 1888. It was recorded from Thomas Goswell, a technician in the laboratory, using a capillary electrometer. After that, Waller used a more available subject for his demonstrations – his dog Jimmy, who would patiently stand with his paws in glass jars of saline. Depolarization of the heart The route that the depolarization wave takes across the heart is outlined in Figure 3. The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the heart's pacemaker. From the SAN, the wave of depolarization 2/9 spreads across the atria to the atrioventricular node (AVN). The impulse is delayed briefly at the AVN and atrial contraction is completed.
