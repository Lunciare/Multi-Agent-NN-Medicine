Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

to the right and net negatives to the left; for the aVF lead, plot positive downwards and negative upwards the direction of the endpoint from the starting point represents the axis or predominant direction of electrical depolarization (determined primarily by the muscle mass of the left ventricle). It is expressed as an angle and can be estimated quite easily (normal is 0°–120°) Figure 9 Vector diagram to determine the QRS axis. Human Resuscitation The first electrical resuscitation of a human took place (almost certainly) in 1872. The resuscitation of a drowned girl with electricity is described by Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne de Boulogne, a pioneering neurophysiologist, in the third edition of his textbook on the medical uses of electricity. Although it is sometimes described as the first artificial pacing, the stimulation was of the phrenic nerve and not the myocardium. 5/9 ECG abnormalities This section discusses the most important and most frequently encountered ECG abnormalities. Normal variations Small Q waves and inverted T waves in lead III often disappear on deep inspiration. Occasional septal Q waves can be seen in other leads. ST elevation following an S wave ("high take off") is common in leads V2–V4 and is quite normal.
