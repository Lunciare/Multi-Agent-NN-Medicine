deep inspiration. Occasional septal Q waves can be seen in other leads. ST elevation following an S wave ("high take off") is common in leads V2–V4 and is quite normal. Differentiating this from pathological ST elevation can be difficult and relies on the patient's history and the availability of a previous ECG. These "repolarization abnormalities" are more common in the young and in athletes. T-wave inversion is common in Afro-Caribbean blacks. U waves – small extra waves following T waves – are seen in hypokalemic patients, but can also represent a normal variant. Ventricular extrasystoles – no P waves, broad and abnormal QRS complexes, and T waves interspersed between normal sinus rhythm – sometimes occur and do not require further investigation unless they are associated with symptoms (such as dizziness, palpitations, exercise intolerance, chest pain, shortness of breath) or occur several times every minute. Pathological variations Long PR interval A distance of more than five small squares from the start of the P wave to the start of the R wave (or Q wave if there is one) constitutes first-degree heart block (see Figure 10). It rarely requires action, but in the presence of other abnormalities might be a sign
