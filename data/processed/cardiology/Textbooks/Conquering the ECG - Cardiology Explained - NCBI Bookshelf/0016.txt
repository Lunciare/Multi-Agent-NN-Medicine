Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

of myocardial infarction (MI). Figure 13 ECG demonstrating left bundle branch block. Figure 14 The shapes of V1 and V6 QRS complexes in left and right bundle branch block. ST segment changes The ST segment extends from the end of the S wave to the start of the T wave. It should be flat or slightly upsloping and level with the baseline. Elevation of more than two small squares in the chest leads or one small square in the limb leads, combined with a characteristic history, indicates the possibility of MI (see Figure 15, previous page). ST depression is diagnostic of ischemia (see Figure 16). It is worth noting that although ST elevation can localize the lesion (eg, anterior MI, inferior MI), ST depression cannot. Concave upwards ST elevation in all 12 leads is diagnostic of pericarditis. Figure 15 7/9 ECG demonstrating anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Note the ST-segment elevation. Figure 16 ECG demonstrating ST-segment depression (I, V3–V6). T waves In a normal ECG, T waves are upright in every lead except aVR. T-wave inversion can represent current ischemia or previous infarction (see Figure 17). In combination with LVH and ST depression, it can represent "strain". This form of LVH carries
