Chapter 3 Conquering the ECG Besides the stethoscope, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is the oldest and most enduring tool of the cardiologist. A basic knowledge of the ECG will enhance the understanding of cardiology (not to mention this book). Electrocardiography At every beat, the heart is depolarized to trigger its contraction. This electrical activity is transmitted throughout the body and can be picked up on the skin. This is the principle behind the ECG. An ECG machine records this activity via electrodes on the skin and displays it graphically. An ECG involves attaching 10 electrical cables to the body: one to each limb and six across the chest. ECG terminology has two meanings for the word "lead": the cable used to connect an electrode to the ECG recorder the electrical view of the heart obtained from any one combination of electrodes Carrying out an ECG 1.
