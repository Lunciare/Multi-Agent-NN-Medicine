Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

patient to undress down to the waist and lie down 2. Remove excess hair where necessary 3. Attach limb leads (anywhere on the limb) 4. Attach the chest leads (see Figure 1) as follows: V1 and V2: either side of the sternum on the fourth rib (count down from the sternal angle, the second rib insertion) V4: on the apex of the heart (feel for it) V3: halfway between V2 and V4 V5 and V6: horizontally laterally from V4 (not up towards the axilla) 5. Ask the patient to relax 6. Press record Figure 1 Standard attachment sites for chest leads. The standard ECG uses 10 cables to obtain 12 electrical views of the heart. The different views reflect the angles at which electrodes "look" at the heart and the direction of the heart's electrical depolarization. Limb leads 1/9 Three bipolar leads and three unipolar leads are obtained from three electrodes attached to the left arm, the right arm, and the left leg, respectively. (An electrode is also attached to the right leg, but this is an earth electrode.) The bipolar limb leads reflect the potential difference between two of the three limb electrodes: lead I: right arm–left arm lead
