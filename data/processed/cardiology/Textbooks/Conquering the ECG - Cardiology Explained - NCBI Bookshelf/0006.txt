Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

occur in opposite directions The basic pattern of this electrical activity was first discovered over a hundred years ago. It comprises three waves, which have been named P, QRS (a wave complex), and T (see Figure 4). Figure 4 The basic pattern of electrical activity across the heart. P wave The P wave is a small deflection wave that represents atrial depolarization. PR interval The PR interval is the time between the first deflection of the P wave and the first deflection of the QRS complex. QRS wave complex The three waves of the QRS complex represent ventricular depolarization. For the inexperienced, one of the most confusing aspects of ECG reading is the labeling of these waves. The rule is: if the wave immediately after the P wave is an upward deflection, it is an R wave; if it is a downward deflection, it is a Q wave: small Q waves correspond to depolarization of the interventricular septum. Q waves can also relate to breathing and are generally small and thin. They can also signal an old myocardial infarction (in which case they are big and wide) the R wave reflects depolarization of the main mass of the ventricles –hence
