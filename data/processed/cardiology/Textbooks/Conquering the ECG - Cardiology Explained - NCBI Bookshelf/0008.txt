Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

leads with respect to the chambers of the heart. (b) In lead V1, depolarization of the interventricular septum occurs towards the lead, thus creating an upward deflection (more...) The ECG trace reflects the net electrical activity at a given moment. Consequently, activity in one direction is masked if there is more activity, eg, by a larger mass, in the other direction. For example, the left ventricle muscle mass is much greater than the right, and therefore its depolarization accounts for the direction of the biggest wave. Interpreting the ECG A normal ECG tracing is provided in Figure 6. The only way to become confident at reading ECGs is to practice. It is important to be methodical – every ECG reading should start with an assessment of the rate, rhythm, and axis. This approach always reveals something about an ECG, regardless of how unusual it is. Figure 6 Example of a normal ECG. Rate Identify the QRS complex (this is generally the biggest wave); count the number of large squares between one QRS wave and the next; divide 300 by this number to determine the rate (see Table 2).
