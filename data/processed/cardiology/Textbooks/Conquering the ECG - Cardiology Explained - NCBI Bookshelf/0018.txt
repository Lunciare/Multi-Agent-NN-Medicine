embolism Sinus tachycardia is seen in many patients with pulmonary embolism. New right bundle branch block (RBBB) or right axis deviation with "strain" can also indicate PE. The classic S Q T is I III III less common. Hyperkalemia The absolute potassium level is less important than its rate of rise. ECG changes reflecting a rapid rise demand immediate action (see Figures 19–21). The level of danger increases as the 8/9 ECG changes progress. The sequence generally follows the order: Figure 19 Hyperkalemia. Note the tall, tented T waves. Figure 21 ECG demonstrating a sinus-wave QRS pattern. tall, tented T waves (see Figure 19) lengthening of the PR interval reduction in the P-wave height widening of the QRS complex (see Figure 20) "sinus" wave QRS pattern (see Figure 21) Figure 20 ECG demonstrating a widening of the QRS complex. A sinus-wave QRS should be treated immediately with calcium chloride, whilst hyperkalemia associated with lesser ECG changes can be treated with insulin/glucose infusion. PQRST? Nobody knows for sure why these letters became standard. Certainly, mathematicians used to start lettering systems from the middle of the alphabet to avoid confusion with the frequently used letters at the beginning. Einthoven used the letters
