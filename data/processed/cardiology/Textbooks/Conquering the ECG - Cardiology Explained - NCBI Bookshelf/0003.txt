the right leg, but this is an earth electrode.) The bipolar limb leads reflect the potential difference between two of the three limb electrodes: lead I: right arm–left arm lead II: right arm–left leg lead III: left leg–left arm The unipolar leads reflect the potential difference between one of the three limb electrodes and an estimate of zero potential – derived from the remaining two limb electrodes. These leads are known as augmented leads. The augmented leads and their respective limb electrodes are: aVR lead: right arm aVL lead: left arm aVF lead: left leg Chest leads Another six electrodes, placed in standard positions on the chest wall, give rise to a further six unipolar leads – the chest leads (also known as precordial leads), V1–V6. The potential difference of a chest lead is recorded between the relevant chest electrode and an estimate of zero potential – derived from the average potential recorded from the three limb leads. Planes of view The limb leads look at the heart in a vertical plane (see Figure 2), whereas the chest leads look at the heart in a horizontal plane. In this way, a three-dimensional electrical picture of the heart is built up
