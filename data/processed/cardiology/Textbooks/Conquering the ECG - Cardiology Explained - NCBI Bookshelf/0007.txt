thin. They can also signal an old myocardial infarction (in which case they are big and wide) the R wave reflects depolarization of the main mass of the ventricles –hence it is the largest wave 3/9 the S wave signifies the final depolarization of the ventricles, at the base of the heart ST segment The ST segment, which is also known as the ST interval, is the time between the end of the QRS complex and the start of the T wave. It reflects the period of zero potential between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. T wave T waves represent ventricular repolarization (atrial repolarization is obscured by the large QRS complex). Wave direction and size Since the direction of a deflection, upward or downward, is dependent on whether the electrical activity is going towards or away from a lead, it differs according to the orientation of the lead with respect to the heart (see Figure 5). Figure 5 (a) A horizontal section through the chest showing the orientation of the chest leads with respect to the chambers of the heart. (b) In lead V1, depolarization of the interventricular septum occurs towards the lead, thus creating an upward deflection (more...) The ECG
