Conquering the ECG - Cardiology Explained

we know them today. In fact, although often credited with inventing the term electrocardiogram (which is why it is sometimes spelt the Dutch way), Einthoven credits Waller with this distinction in his 1895 publication in Pflügers Archives "Über die Form des menschlichen Elektrokardiogramms". Q waves 6/9 A normal ECG has only very small Q waves. A downward deflection immediately following a P wave that is wider than two small squares or greater in height than a third of the subsequent R wave is significant: such Q waves can represent previous infarction (see Figure 11, previous page). Figure 11 ECG demonstrating abnormal Q waves in V1–V4. This is indicative of a previous infarction. Large QRS complexes Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is one of the easiest and most useful diagnoses to make (see Figure 12). The Sokolow–Lyon index is the most commonly calculated index of estimation. Does the sum of the S wave in lead V1 (SV1) and the R wave in V6 (RV6) add up to more than 3.5 mV, ie, 35 small or seven big squares? If so, the patient has LVH by voltage criterion. Right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated by a dominant R wave in V1 (ie, R wave
