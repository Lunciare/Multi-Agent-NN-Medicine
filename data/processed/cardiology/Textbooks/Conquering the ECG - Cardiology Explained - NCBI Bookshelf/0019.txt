became standard. Certainly, mathematicians used to start lettering systems from the middle of the alphabet to avoid confusion with the frequently used letters at the beginning. Einthoven used the letters O to X to mark the timeline on his ECG diagrams and, of course, P is the letter that follows O. If the image of the PQRST diagram was striking enough to be adopted by researchers as a true representation of the underlying form, it would have been logical to continue the same naming convention when the more advanced string galvanometer started creating ECGs a few years later.
