with lower frequency–high penetration throughout the image field though low resolution suggested by the coarse appearance of speckles; (d) is an image obtained with higher frequency–low penetration, about two-thirds of the image field though high resolution suggested by the fine appearance of speckles. Safety is tested with hydrophones, measuring acoustic output. Pressure amplitude, period, and pulse duration are determined. Frequency, PRF, power, and intensity are derived. The transducers and other parts of the machine should be cleaned regularly.
