advances were based on the ability to cut the elements very small, to isolate them, to fit their electric wiring in the case, and to command complex firing algorithms. The first transducers for 2D and then 3D imaging were sparse-arrays, concomitantly using only part of their elements. Full matrix array transducers are currently used. Side lobes of constituent elements add up in grating lobes of the array (illustrated in red in the image). They can be reduced by firing peripheral elements at lower amplitude—apodization—with continuous variation—dynamic apodization. They can also be reduced by cutting subelements within elements. Fig. 1.6 Real-time 3D imaging transducer beam. Currently, full matrix array transducers with more than 2000 elements enable second-generation real-time 3D imaging, concomitantly collecting information in sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes with a pyramidal ultrasound beam. The first 3D images were reconstructed from a series of 2D images acquired with free hand scanning or mechanically driven transducers. Later, sparse-array matrix transducers with 256 elements made possible the first-generation real-time 3D transthoracic imaging with poor spatial resolution.
