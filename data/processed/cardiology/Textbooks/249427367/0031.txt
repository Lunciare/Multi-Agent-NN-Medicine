of the prosthetic ring is made look longer by the combination of true image and side lobe artefact. The image was ʻoptimizedʼ to accentuate artefact for illustration purposes. (b) Comet tail: the example shows a small comet tail produced by a calcified plaque in the aortic root, giving the appearance of a line in the aortic root perpendicular to the anterior wall of the aorta, which could be misdiagnosed as dissection. (c) Reverberations and side lobe artefact: the example shows reverberations produced by prosthetic aortic valve and prolongation of the image of the anterior aspect of the valve ring by side lobe artefact. (d) Enhancement and reverberations artefact: enhancement artefact is the accentuation of the brightness of a reflector behind a structure with low attenuation. It usually creates increased brightness of the distal aspect of structures which have a cavity. In the example, the distal aspect the right atrial wall appears brighter. There are also reverberations like multiple comet tails. Fig. 1.14 Stitching and drop-out artefact. (a) Stitching artefact. If volume 3D is acquired from four cardiac cycles stitched together, stitching artefact may appear, if the cardiac cycles are unequal (atrial fibrillation or ectopic arrhythmia), or because of motion due
