by a strong reflector, giving a series of gradually weaker parallel images of the same structure behind the first. When they consist of a series of short lines near each other, they can take the form of a comet tail. In the example, in 2D, the prosthetic mitral valve creates reverberations which almost take the form of two comet tails. (b) Reverberation artefact: reverberation artefact is generated in 3D imaging as well. They can be bigger and more obscuring of normal structures than in 2D. In the example, the 3D image belongs to the same patient, during the same study as (a). It is possible to observe a multiple parallel disc-like appearance of the reverberation with tornado shape. (c) Reverberation artefact: this is another example of 3D reverberation artefact from mechanical mitral valve prosthesis, giving multiple parallel plate-like appearance when cropped and displayed to be seen from two angles. Fig. 1.12 Reverberation and shadowing artefact. (a) Reverberation and shadowing artefact: behind a highly reflective structure, the normal structures can be obscured not only by reverberations, but also by shadowing—absent image due to weak ultrasound transmission. In this example, in transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), there are reverberations from a prosthetic mitral valve
