particles in the direction of wave propagation. The wavelength determines imaging resolution. In echocardiography, adequate resolution is obtained with wavelengths less than 1 mm. The characteristics of the ultrasound wave are illustrated in Fig. 1.1. Fig. 1.1 Characteristics of an ultrasound wave. Each cycle of complete pressure variation occurs over a certain length of time (period—measured in time units) and also occurs over a certain length of space (wavelength—measured in distance units, usually millimetres). The frequency is the number of complete cycles occurring in the unit of time, measured in hertz (one cycle per second). The maximal pressure variation above or below baseline represents the sound wave amplitude, measured in pressure units—megapascals (MPa) for ultrasound. As the wave travels, the encountered media particles are displaced, resulting in compression of the medium (increased particle density) corresponding to the high-pressure wave travelling past and rarefaction of the medium (decreased particles density) corresponding to low acoustic pressure. A shorter wavelength corresponds to a higher frequency, and vice versa. The wavelength (cycle length) multiplied by frequency (cycles per second) gives the ultrasound wave propagation speed, which is constant in a certain medium_ The average propagation speed in soft tissues is 1540 m/s, higher in
