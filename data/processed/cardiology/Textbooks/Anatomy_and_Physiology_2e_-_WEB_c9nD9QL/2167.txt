pedis arteries in the feet. A variety of commercial electronic devices are also available to measure pulse. FIGURE20.11 Pulse Sites The pulse is most readily measured at the radial artery, but can be measured at any of the pulse points shown. Measurement of Blood Pressure Blood pressure is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting. The technique used today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai 824 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation Korotkoff. Turbulent blood flow through the vessels can be heard as a soft ticking while measuring blood pressure; these sounds are known asKorotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer(a blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as follows: • The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient’s arm at about the level of the heart. • The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and temporarily cutting off blood flow into the patient’s arm. • The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient’s antecubital region
