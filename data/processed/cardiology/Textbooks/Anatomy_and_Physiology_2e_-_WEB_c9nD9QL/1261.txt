Anatomy and Physiology

called the cerebral cortex. Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral function. The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species. The cerebrum of the most primitive vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell. In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the outer gray matter that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning “bark of a tree”) and several deep nuclei that belong to three important functional groups. Thebasal nucleiare responsible for cognitive processing, the most important function being that associated with planning movements. Thebasal forebraincontains nuclei that are important in learning and memory. Thelimbic cortexis the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of thelimbic system, a collection of structures involved in emotion, memory, and behavior. Cerebral Cortex The cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps around either side of the forebrain—the cerebral cortex. This thin, extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher functions of the nervous system. Agyrus(plural = gyri) is the ridge of one of those wrinkles, and asulcus(plural = sulci) is the groove between two gyri. The pattern of these
