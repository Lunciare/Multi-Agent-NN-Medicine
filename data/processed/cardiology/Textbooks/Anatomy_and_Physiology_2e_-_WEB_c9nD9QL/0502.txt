These can become lodged in the capillary beds of the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if not treated quickly, death. Types of Fractures Fractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other features (Figure 6.20).Table 6.4outlines common types of fractures. Some fractures may be described using more than one term because it may have the features of more than one type (e.g., an open transverse fracture).
