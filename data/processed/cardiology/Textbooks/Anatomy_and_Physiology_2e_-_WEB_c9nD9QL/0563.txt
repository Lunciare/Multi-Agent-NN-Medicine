Anatomy and Physiology

between adjacent bones of the skull. The narrow gap between the bones is filled with dense, fibrous connective tissue that unites the bones. The long sutures located between the bones of the brain case are not straight, but instead follow irregular, tightly twisting paths. These twisting lines serve to tightly interlock the adjacent bones, thus adding strength to the skull for brain protection. The two suture lines seen on the top of the skull are the coronal and sagittal sutures. Thecoronal sutureruns from side to side across the skull, within the coronal plane of section (seeFigure 7.5). It joins the frontal bone to the right and left parietal bones. Thesagittal sutureextends posteriorly from the coronal suture, running along the midline at the top of the skull in the sagittal plane of section (seeFigure 7.9). It unites the right and left parietal bones. On the posterior skull, the sagittal suture terminates by joining the lambdoid suture. Thelambdoid sutureextends downward and laterally to either side away from its junction with the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture joins the occipital bone to the right and left parietal and temporal bones. This suture is named for its upside-down "V" shape, which resembles the capital
