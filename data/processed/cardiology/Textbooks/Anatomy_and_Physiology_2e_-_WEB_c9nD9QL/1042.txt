Muscles involved in chewing must be able to exert enough pressure to bite through and then chew food before it is swallowed (Figure 11.10andTable 11.4). The massetermuscle is the main muscle used for chewing because it elevates the mandible (lower jaw) to close the mouth, and it is assisted by thetemporalismuscle, which retracts the mandible. You can feel the temporalis move by putting your fingers to your temple as you chew. FIGURE11.10 Muscles That Move the Lower Jaw The muscles that move the lower jaw are typically located within the cheek and originate from processes in the skull. This provides the jaw muscles with the large amount of leverage needed for chewing. 408 11 • The Muscular System Muscles of the Lower Jaw Prime Movement Target Target motion direction Origin Insertion mover Maxilla arch; Closes mouth; aids zygomatic Mandible Superior (elevates) Masseter Mandible chewing arch (for masseter) Closes mouth; pulls lower
