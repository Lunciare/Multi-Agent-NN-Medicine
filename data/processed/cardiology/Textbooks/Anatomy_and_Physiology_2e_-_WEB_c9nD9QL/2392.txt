from the cortex to the junction between the cortex and medulla. It is here that negative selection takes place. Innegative selection, self- antigens are brought into the thymus from other parts of the body by professional antigen-presenting cells. The T cells that bind to these self-antigens are selected for negatively and are killed by apoptosis. In summary, the only T cells left are those that can bind to MHC molecules of the body with foreign antigens presented on their binding clefts, preventing an attack on one’s own body tissues, at least under normal circumstances. Tolerance can be broken, however, by the development of an autoimmune response, to be discussed later in this chapter. The cells that leave the thymus become single positives, expressing either CD4 or CD8, but not both (seeFigure 21.18). The CD4+T cells will bind to class II MHC and the CD8+cells will bind to class I MHC. The discussion that follows explains the functions of these molecules and how they can be used to differentiate between the different T cell functional types. 918 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses Mature T cells become activated by recognizing processed foreign antigen in
