In the past, anatomy has primarily been Life processes of the human body are maintained at studied via observing injuries, and later by the several levels of structural organization. These include dissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in the chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and the past century, computer-assisted imaging the organism level. Higher levels of organization are techniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the built from lower levels. Therefore, molecules combine living body. Human physiology is the scientific study of to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body. combine to form organs, organs combine to form organ Physiology explains how the structures of the body systems, and organ systems combine to form work together to maintain life. It is difficult to study organisms. structure
