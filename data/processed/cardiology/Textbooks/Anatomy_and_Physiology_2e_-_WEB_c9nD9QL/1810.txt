hormonal role of the gonads—the testes and ovaries—which produce the sex cells (sperm and ova) and secrete the gonadal hormones. The roles of the gonadotropins released from the anterior pituitary (FSH and LH) were discussed earlier. The primary hormone produced by the testes istestosterone, a steroid hormone important in the development of the testicular reproductive system, the maturation of sperm cells, and the development of secondary sex characteristics such as a deepened voice, body hair, and increased muscle mass. Interestingly, testosterone is also produced in the ovaries, but at a much reduced level. In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormoneinhibin, which inhibits the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis. The primary hormones produced by the ovaries areestrogens, which include estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Estrogens play an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the ovarian reproductive system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of secondary sex characteristics such as increased adipose tissue and the development of breast tissue, and the maintenance of pregnancy. Another significant ovarian hormone isprogesterone, which contributes to regulation of the menstrual cycle and is important in preparing the body for pregnancy as well
