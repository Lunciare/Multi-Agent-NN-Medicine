Anatomy and Physiology

levels are lower, more hydrogen is bound, and pH rises. (Seek additional content for more detail about pH.) The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers, increasing cardiac output and constricting peripheral vessels. The cardioinhibitor centers are suppressed. With falling carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (increasing pH), the cardioinhibitor centers are stimulated, and the cardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers are suppressed, decreasing cardiac output and causing peripheral vasodilation. In order to maintain adequate supplies of oxygen to the cells and remove waste products such as carbon dioxide, it is essential that the respiratory system respond to changing metabolic demands. In turn, the cardiovascular system will transport these gases to the lungs for exchange, again in accordance with metabolic demands. This interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be overemphasized. Other neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function. These include the limbic Access for free at openstax.org 20.4 • Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System 837 system that links physiological responses to psychological stimuli, as well as generalized sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation. Endocrine Regulation Endocrine control over the cardiovascular system involves the catecholamines, epinephrine and
