INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for an introduction to the urinary system. 25.1 Physical Characteristics of Urine LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare and contrast blood plasma, glomerular filtrate, and urine characteristics • Describe the characteristics of a normal urine sample, including normal range of pH, osmolarity, and volume The urinary system’s ability to filter the blood resides in about 2 to 3 million tufts of specialized capillaries—the glomeruli—distributed more or less equally between the two kidneys. Because the glomeruli filter the blood based mostly on particle size, large elements like blood cells, platelets, antibodies, and albumen are excluded. The glomerulus is the first part of the nephron, which then continues as a highly specialized tubular structure responsible for creating the final urine composition. All other solutes, such as ions, amino acids, vitamins, and wastes, are filtered to create a filtrate composition very similar to plasma. The glomeruli create about 200 liters (189 quarts) of this filtrate every day, yet you excrete less than two liters of waste you call urine. Characteristics
