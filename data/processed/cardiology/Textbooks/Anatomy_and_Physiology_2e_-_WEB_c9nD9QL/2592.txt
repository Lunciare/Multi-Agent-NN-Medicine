Anatomy and Physiology

Functions region invaginates posteriorly, forming olfactory pits, Normally, the respiratory centers of the brain maintain which ultimately fuse with endodermal tissue of the a consistent, rhythmic breathing cycle. However, in early pharynx. At about this same time, a protrusion of certain cases, the respiratory system must adjust to endodermal tissue extends anteriorly from the foregut, situational changes in order to supply the body with producing a lung bud, which continues to elongate until sufficient oxygen. For example, exercise results in it forms the laryngotracheal bud. The proximal portion increased ventilation, and chronic exposure to a high of this structure will mature into the trachea, whereas altitude results in a greater number of circulating the bulbous end will branch to form two bronchial erythrocytes. Hyperpnea, an increase in the rate and buds. These buds then branch repeatedly, so that at depth of ventilation, appears to be a function of three about week 16, all major airway structures are present. neural mechanisms that include a psychological Development progresses after week 16 as respiratory stimulus, motor neuron activation of skeletal muscles, bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive and the activation of proprioceptors in the muscles, vascularization occurs. Alveolar type I cells also
