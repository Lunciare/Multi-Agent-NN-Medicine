Anatomy and Physiology

which is embedded within the maxilla and mandible. Both parts contain an innerpulp cavity, containing loose connective tissue through which run nerves and blood vessels. The region of the pulp cavity that runs through the root of the tooth is called the root canal. Surrounding the pulp cavity isdentin, a bone-like tissue. In the root of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an even harder bone-like layer calledcementum. In the crown of each tooth, the dentin is covered by an outer layer ofenamel, the hardest substance in the body (Figure 23.11). Although enamel protects the underlying dentin and pulp cavity, it is still nonetheless susceptible to mechanical and chemical erosion, or what is known as tooth decay. The most common form, dental caries (cavities) develops when colonies of bacteria feeding on sugars in the mouth release acids that cause soft tissue inflammation and degradation of the calcium crystals of the enamel. The digestive functions of the mouth are summarized inTable 23.4. 1012 23 • The Digestive System FIGURE23.11 The Structure of the Tooth This longitudinal section through a molar in its alveolar socket shows the relationships between enamel, dentin, and pulp.
