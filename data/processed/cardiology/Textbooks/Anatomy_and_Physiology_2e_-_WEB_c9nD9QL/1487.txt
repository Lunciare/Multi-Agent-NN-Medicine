auditory brain stem that projects to the auditory organ of Corti structure in the cochlea in which hair cortex cells transduce movements from sound waves into medial lemniscus fiber tract of the dorsal column electrochemical signals system that extends from the nuclei gracilis and osmoreceptor receptor cell that senses differences in cuneatus to the thalamus, and decussates the concentrations of bodily fluids on the basis of medial rectus extraocular muscle responsible for osmotic pressure adduction of the eye ossicles three small bones in the middle ear mesencephalic nucleus component of the trigeminal otolith layer of calcium carbonate crystals located on nuclei that is found in the midbrain top of the otolithic membrane middle ear space within the temporal bone between otolithic membrane gelatinous substance in the the ear canal and bony labyrinth where the ossicles utricle and saccule of the inner ear that contains amplify sound waves from the tympanic membrane calcium carbonate crystals and into which the to the oval window stereocilia of hair cells are embedded multimodal integration area region of the cerebral outer segment in the eye, the section of a cortex in which information from more than one photoreceptor that contains opsin molecules that sensory modality
