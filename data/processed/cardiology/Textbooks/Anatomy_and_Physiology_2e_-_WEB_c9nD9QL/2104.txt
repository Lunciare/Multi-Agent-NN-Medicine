Anatomy and Physiology

based on blood flow within the atrioventricular septum; receives the bicuspid valve (also, mitral valve or left impulse from the SA node, pauses, and then atrioventricular valve) valve located between the left transmits it into specialized conducting cells within atrium and ventricle; consists of two flaps of tissue the interventricular septum bulbus cordis portion of the primitive heart tube that atrioventricular bundle (also, bundle of His) group of will eventually develop into the right ventricle specialized myocardial conductile cells that bundle of His (also, atrioventricular bundle) group of transmit the impulse from the AV node through the specialized myocardial conductile cells that interventricular septum; form the left and right transmit the impulse from the AV node through the atrioventricular bundle branches interventricular septum; form the left and right atrioventricular bundle branches (also, left or right atrioventricular bundle branches bundle branches) specialized myocardial conductile cardiac cycle period of time between the onset of cells that arise from the bifurcation of the atrial contraction (atrial systole) and ventricular atrioventricular bundle and pass through the relaxation (ventricular diastole) interventricular septum; lead to the Purkinje fibers cardiac notch depression in the medial surface of the and also to the right papillary muscle via the
