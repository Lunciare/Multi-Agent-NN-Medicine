ability to diversify at each step. Thetotipotent stem cellis the zygote, or fertilized egg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is thepluripotent stem cell, which gives rise to multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes. Beneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that develops only into types of connective tissue, including fibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is thehematopoietic stem cell, orhemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell. Hemopoiesis begins when the hematopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hematopoietic stem cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more Access for free at openstax.org 18.2 • Production of the Formed Elements 717 specialized stem cells (Figure 18.4): • Lymphoid stem cellsgive rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T
