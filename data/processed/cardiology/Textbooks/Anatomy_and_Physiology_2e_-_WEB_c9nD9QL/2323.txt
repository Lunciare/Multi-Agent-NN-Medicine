Anatomy and Physiology

mean arterial pressure is the “average” ADH, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism, pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood ANH, and EPO. Autoregulation is the local control of into the tissues. Pulse, the expansion and recoiling of vasodilation and constriction by chemical signals and an artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables the myogenic response. Exercise greatly improves affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the systemic cardiovascular function and reduces the risk of circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, a volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of leading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Significant the blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation hemorrhage can lead to a form of circulatory shock and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant known as hypovolemic shock. Sepsis, obstruction, and factor in systemic blood pressure: Slight vasodilation widespread inflammation can also cause circulatory greatly decreases resistance and increases flow, shock. whereas slight vasoconstriction greatly increases 20.5Circulatory Pathways resistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into flow decreases. In the venous system, constriction the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary increases blood pressure
