is replaced by trabecular bone. (d) Remodeling occurs. Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the endosteum have created aninternal callus(plural = calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix between the two ends of the broken bone, while the periosteal chondrocytes and osteoblasts create anexternal callusof hyaline cartilage and bone, respectively, around the outside of the break (Figure 6.21b). This stabilizes the fracture. Over the next several weeks, osteoclasts resorb the dead bone; osteogenic cells become active, divide, and differentiate into osteoblasts. The cartilage in the calli is replaced by trabecular bone via endochondral ossification (Figure 6.21c). Eventually, the internal and external calli unite, compact bone replaces spongy bone at the outer margins of the Access for free at openstax.org 6.6 • Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue 215 fracture, and healing is complete. A slight swelling may remain on the outer surface of the bone, but quite often, that region undergoes remodeling (Figure 6.21d), and no external evidence of the fracture remains.
