the intestinal membrane into the bloodstream body to process. and then to body tissues. In the cells, glucose, a six- 24.4Protein Metabolism carbon sugar, is processed through a sequence of reactions into smaller sugars, and the energy stored Digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where HCl inside the molecule is released. The first step of and pepsin begin the process of breaking down carbohydrate catabolism is glycolysis, which produces proteins into their constituent amino acids. As the pyruvate, NADH, and ATP. Under anaerobic conditions, chyme enters the small intestine, it mixes with the pyruvate can be converted into lactate to keep bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. The bicarbonate glycolysis working. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate neutralizes the acidic HCl, and the digestive enzymes enters the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle break down the proteins into smaller peptides and or tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition to ATP, the Krebs amino acids. Digestive hormones secretin and CCK are cycle produces high-energy FADH 2and NADH released from the small intestine to aid in digestive molecules, which provide electrons to the oxidative processes, and digestive proenzymes are released phosphorylation process that generates more high- from the pancreas (trypsinogen and energy ATP molecules.
