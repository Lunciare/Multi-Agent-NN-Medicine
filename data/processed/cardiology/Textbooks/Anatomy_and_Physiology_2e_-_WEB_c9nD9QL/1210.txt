is brain, where conscious perception takes place inactivated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulatory medium within action potential change in voltage of a cell the CNS that is produced by ependymal cells in the membrane in response to a stimulus that results in choroid plexus filtering the blood transmission of an electrical signal; unique to chemical synapse connection between two neurons, neurons and muscle fibers or between a neuron and its target, where a activation gate part of the voltage-gated Na+channel neurotransmitter diffuses across a very short that opens when the membrane voltage reaches distance threshold cholinergic system neurotransmitter system of astrocyte glial cell type of the CNS that provides acetylcholine, which includes its receptors and the support for neurons and maintains the blood-brain enzyme acetylcholinesterase barrier choroid plexus specialized structure containing autonomic nervous system (ANS) functional division ependymal cells that line blood capillaries and filter of the nervous system that is responsible for blood to produce CSF in the four ventricles of the homeostatic reflexes that coordinate control of brain cardiac and smooth muscle, as well as glandular continuous conduction slow propagation of an action tissue potential along an unmyelinated axon owing to axon single process of the neuron that carries
