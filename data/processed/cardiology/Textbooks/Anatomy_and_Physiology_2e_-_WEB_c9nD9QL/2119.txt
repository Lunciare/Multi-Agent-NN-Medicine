Anatomy and Physiology

blood pericardium lined with a serous membrane. Between effectively. Recognizable points on the ECG include the the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial P wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the cavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The QRS complex that corresponds to ventricular walls of the heart are composed of an outer depolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to epicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining ventricular repolarization. layer of endocardium. The human heart consists of a pair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a 19.3Cardiac Cycle pair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels. The cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and The right atrium receives systemic blood relatively low contraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts in oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which approximately 0.8 seconds. Beginning with all pumps it into the pulmonary circuit. Exchange of chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and veins into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves blood high in oxygen returns to the left atrium, which into the ventricles. The atria begin to contract (atrial
