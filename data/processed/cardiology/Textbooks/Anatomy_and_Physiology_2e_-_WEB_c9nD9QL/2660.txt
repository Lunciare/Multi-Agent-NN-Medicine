much of the bacteria you ingest with food and helps to denature proteins, making them more available for enzymatic digestion. Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein necessary for the absorption of vitamin B in the small intestine. 12 Chief cells—Located primarily in the basal regions of gastric glands arechief cells, which secretepepsinogen, the inactive proenzyme form of pepsin. HCl is necessary for the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin. Mucous neck cells—Gastric glands in the upper part of the stomach containmucous neck cellsthat secrete thin, acidic mucus that is much different from the mucus secreted by the goblet cells of the surface epithelium. The role of this mucus is not currently known. Enteroendocrine cells—Finally,enteroendocrine cellsfound in the gastric glands secrete various hormones into the interstitial fluid of the lamina propria. These include gastrin, which is released mainly by enteroendocrineG cells. Table 23.6describes the digestive functions of important hormones secreted by the stomach.
