as in sunlight; and bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which electrical energy, the power of moving electrons. can in turn be broken by hydrolysis. Chemical reactions begin with reactants and end with Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. products. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together, Their structural forms include monosaccharides such a process that requires energy, whereas decomposition as glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and reactions break the bonds within a reactant and polysaccharides, including starches (polymers of thereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds glucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and are both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged. fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is The rate at which chemical reactions occur is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP. influenced by several properties of the reactants: Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body temperature, concentration and pressure, and the fuel and are important components of many biological presence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a compounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid catalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in in the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone the human body. attached to three fatty acid
