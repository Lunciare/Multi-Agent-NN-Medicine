physiology 8. Watch thisvideo( can lead to devastating illnesses. Why are neurons to learn about the release of a neurotransmitter. only found in animals? Why wouldn’t they be The action potential reaches the end of the axon, helpful for plants or microorganisms? called the axon terminal, and a chemical signal is 4. View the University of MichiganWebscope released to tell the target cell to do something, ( see an electron either initiate a new action potential, or to suppress micrograph of a cross-section of a myelinated nerve that activity. In a very short space, the electrical fiber. The axon contains microtubules and signal of the action potential is changed into the neurofilaments, bounded by a plasma membrane chemical signal of a neurotransmitter, and then known as the axolemma. Outside the plasma back to electrical changes in the target cell membrane of the axon is the myelin sheath, which membrane. What is the importance of voltage- is composed of the tightly wrapped plasma gated calcium channels in the release of membrane of a Schwann cell. What aspects of the neurotransmitters? cells in this image react with the stain that makes them the deep, dark, black color, such as the multiple layers
