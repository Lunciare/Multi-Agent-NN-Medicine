Therefore, the pressure is lower in the two-liter container and higher in the one-liter container. At a constant temperature, changing the volume occupied by the gas changes the pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules.Boyle’s lawdescribes the relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If volume increases, pressure decreases. Likewise, if volume decreases, pressure increases. Pressure and volume are inversely related (P= k/V). Therefore, the pressure in the one-liter container (one-half the volume of the two-liter container) would be twice the pressure in the two-liter container. Boyle’s law is expressed by the following formula: In this formula,P represents the initial pressure andV represents the initial volume, whereas the final pressure 1 1 and volume are represented byP andV respectively. If the two- and one-liter containers were connected by a 2 2, tube and the volume of one of the containers were changed, then the gases would move from higher pressure (lower volume) to lower pressure (higher volume). FIGURE22.15 Boyle's Law In a gas, pressure increases as volume decreases. Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar,
