Anatomy and Physiology

complex for it (that is, for us) to completely unravel. But our current level of understanding is probably nowhere close to that limit. One easy way to begin to understand the structure of the nervous system is to start with the large divisions and work through to a more in-depth understanding. In other chapters, the finer details of the nervous system will be explained, but first looking at an overview of the system will allow you to begin to understand how its parts work together. The focus of this chapter is on nervous (neural) tissue, both its structure and its function. But before you learn about that, you will see a big picture of the system—actually, a few big pictures. 452 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue 12.1 Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the anatomical and functional divisions of the nervous system • Relate the functional and structural differences between gray matter and white matter structures of the nervous system to the structure of neurons • List the basic functions of the nervous system The picture you have in your
