probability of expressing the phenotype of the dominant allele would be 4 out of 4, or 100 percent. This seems simple enough, but the inheritance pattern gets interesting when the second-generationAaindividuals are crossed. In this generation, 50 percent of each parent’s gametes areAand the other 50 percent area. By Mendel’s principle of random segregation, the possible combinations of gametes that the offspring can receive are AA,Aa,aA(which is the same asAa), andaa. Because segregation and fertilization are random, each offspring has a 25 percent chance of receiving any of these combinations. Therefore, if anAa×Aacross were performed 1000 times, approximately 250 (25 percent) of the offspring would beAA; 500 (50 percent) would beAa(that is,Aaplus aA); and 250 (25 percent) would beaa. The genotypic ratio for this inheritance pattern is 1:2:1. However, we have already established thatAAandAa(andaA) individuals all express the dominant trait (i.e., share the same phenotype), and can therefore be combined into one group. The result is Mendel’s third-generation phenotype ratio of 3:1.
