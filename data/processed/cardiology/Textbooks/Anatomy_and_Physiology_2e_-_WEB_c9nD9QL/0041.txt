Anatomy and Physiology

The human body’s numerous regions have specific terms to help increase precision (seeFigure 1.12). Notice that the term “brachium” or “arm” is reserved for the “upper arm” and “antebrachium” or “forearm” is used rather than “lower arm.” Similarly, “femur” or “thigh” is correct, and “leg” or “crus” is reserved for the portion of the lower limb between the knee and the ankle. You will be able to describe the body’s regions using the terms from the figure. Directional Terms Certain directional anatomical terms appear throughout this and any other anatomy textbook (Figure 1.13). These terms are essential for describing the relative locations of different body structures. For instance, an anatomist might describe one band of tissue as “inferior to” another or a physician might describe a tumor as “superficial to” a deeper body structure. Commit these terms to memory to avoid confusion when you are studying or describing the locations of particular body parts. • Anterior(orventral) Describes the front or direction toward the front of the body. The toes are anterior to the foot. • Posterior(ordorsal) Describes the back or direction toward the back of the body. The popliteus is posterior to the patella. • Superior(orcranial) describes a position above
