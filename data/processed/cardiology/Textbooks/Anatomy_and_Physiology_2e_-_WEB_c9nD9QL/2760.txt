Anatomy and Physiology

molecular machines that support cell, tissue, and organ function. This includes building new tissue and repairing damaged tissue. ATP can also be stored to fulfill future energy demands. The remaining 60 percent of the energy released from catabolic reactions is given off as heat, which tissues and body fluids absorb. Structurally, ATP molecules consist of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups (Figure 24.2). The chemical bond between the second and third phosphate groups, termed a high-energy bond, represents the greatest source of energy in a cell. It is the first bond that catabolic enzymes break when cells require energy to do work. The products of this reaction are a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a lone phosphate group (P). ATP, ADP, i and P are constantly being cycled through reactions that build ATP and store energy, and reactions that break down i ATP and release energy.

During catabolic reactions, ATP is created and energy is stored until needed during anabolic reactions. The energy from ATP drives all bodily functions, such
