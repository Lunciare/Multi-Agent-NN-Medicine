molecules, and because of this, one hemoglobin molecule is capable of carrying up to four molecules of oxygen. As oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the capillary, it also diffuses into the red blood cell and is bound by hemoglobin. The following reversible chemical reaction describes the production of the final product,oxyhemoglobin(HbO ), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. 2 Oxyhemoglobin is a bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the bright red color of oxygenated blood. In this formula, Hb represents reduced hemoglobin, that is, hemoglobin that does not have oxygen bound to it. There are multiple factors involved in how readily heme binds to and dissociates from oxygen, which will be discussed in the subsequent sections. FIGURE22.25 Erythrocyte and Hemoglobin Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each of which contains one molecule of iron. Function of Hemoglobin Hemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred to as a quaternary structure. Each of the four subunits that make up hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom covalently bound to the heme in the center of each subunit. Binding of the first oxygen molecule causes a conformational change in
