Anatomy and Physiology

the lower neck. The suprahyoid muscles raise the hyoid bone, the floor of the mouth, and the larynx during deglutition. These include thedigastricmuscle, which has anterior and posterior bellies that work to elevate the hyoid bone and larynx when one swallows; it also depresses the mandible. Thestylohyoidmuscle moves the hyoid bone posteriorly, elevating the larynx, and themylohyoidmuscle lifts it and helps press the tongue to the top of the mouth. The geniohyoiddepresses the mandible in addition to raising and pulling the hyoid bone anteriorly.

The omohyoidmuscle, which has superior and inferior bellies, depresses the hyoid bone in conjunction with the sternohyoidandthyrohyoidmuscles. The thyrohyoid muscle also elevates the larynx’s thyroid cartilage, whereas thesternothyroiddepresses it to create different tones of voice. Muscles That Move the Head The head, attached to the top of the vertebral column, is balanced, moved, and rotated by the neck muscles (Table 11.5). When these muscles act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head flexes or extends. The major muscle that laterally flexes
