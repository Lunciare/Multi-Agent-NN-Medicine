urine from recovery of water. The descending loop of the several nephrons and responds to the posterior juxtaglomerular nephrons reaches an osmolarity of up pituitary hormone ADH by inserting aquaporin water to 1200 mOsmol/kg, promoting the recovery of water. channels into the cell membrane to fine tune water The ascending loop is impervious to water but actively recovery. recovers Na+, reducing filtrate osmolarity to 50–100 mOsmol/kg. The descending and ascending loop and 25.5Physiology of Urine Formation vasa recta form a countercurrent multiplier system to The entire volume of the blood is filtered through the increase Na+concentration in the kidney medulla. The kidneys about 300 times per day, and 99 percent of the collecting ducts actively pump urea into the medulla, water filtered is recovered. The GFR is influenced by further contributing to the high osmotic environment. hydrostatic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure. The vasa recta recover the solute and water in the Under normal circumstances, hydrostatic pressure is medulla, returning them to the circulation. Nearly 90 significantly greater and filtration occurs. The percent of water is recovered before the forming urine hydrostatic pressure of the glomerulus depends on reaches the DCT, which will recover another 10 systemic blood pressure, autoregulatory
