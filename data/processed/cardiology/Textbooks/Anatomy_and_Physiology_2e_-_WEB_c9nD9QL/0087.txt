for each element, it identifies the chemical symbol, the atomic number, and the mass number, while organizing elements according to their propensity to react with other elements. The number of protons and electrons in an element are equal. The number of protons and neutrons may be equal for some elements, but are not equal for all.

Clark, W.C.Martin) INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thiswebsite( view the periodic table. In the periodic table of the elements, elements in a single column have the same number of electrons that can participate in a chemical reaction. These electrons are known as “valence electrons.” For example, the elements in the first column all have a single valence electron, an electron that can be “donated” in a chemical reaction with another atom. What is the meaning of a mass number shown in parentheses? Isotopes Although each element has a unique number of protons, it can exist as different isotopes. Anisotopeis one of the different forms of an element, distinguished from one another by different numbers of neutrons. The
