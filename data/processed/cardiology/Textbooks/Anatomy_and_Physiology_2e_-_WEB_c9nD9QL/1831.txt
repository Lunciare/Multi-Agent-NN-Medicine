Kidneys Calcitriol Aids in the absorption of Ca2+ Triggers the formation of red blood cells in Kidneys Erythropoietin the bone marrow Inhibits production of calcitriol and increases Skeleton FGF23 phosphate excretion Skeleton Osteocalcin Increases insulin production Adipose tissue Leptin Promotes satiety signals in the brain Adipose tissue Adiponectin Reduces insulin resistance Skin Cholecalciferol Modified to form vitamin D Thymus (and Among other things, aids in the development Thymosins other organs) of T lymphocytes of the immune system TABLE17.8 700 17 • The Endocrine System Organ Major hormones Effects Liver Insulin-like growth factor-1 Stimulates bodily growth Liver Angiotensinogen Raises blood pressure Liver Thrombopoietin Causes increase in platelets Liver Hepcidin Blocks release of iron into body fluids TABLE17.8 17.11 Development and Aging of the Endocrine System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the embryonic origins of the endocrine system • Discuss the effects of aging on the endocrine system The endocrine system arises from all three embryonic germ layers. The endocrine glands that produce the steroid hormones, such as the gonads and adrenal cortex, arise from the mesoderm. In contrast, endocrine glands that arise from the endoderm and ectoderm produce the amine, peptide,
