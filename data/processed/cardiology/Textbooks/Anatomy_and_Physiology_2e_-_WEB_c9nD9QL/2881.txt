Anatomy and Physiology

of the filtration membrane • Identify the major structures and subdivisions of the renal corpuscles, renal tubules, and renal capillaries • Discuss the function of the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta • Identify the location of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and describe the cells that line it • Describe the histology of the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting ducts The renal structures that conduct the essential work of the kidney cannot be seen by the naked eye. Only a light or electron microscope can reveal these structures. Even then, serial sections and computer reconstruction are necessary to give us a comprehensive view of the functional anatomy of the nephron and its associated blood vessels. Nephrons: The Functional Unit Nephrons take a simple filtrate of the blood and modify it into urine. Many changes take place in the different parts of the nephron before urine is created for disposal. The termforming urinewill be used hereafter to describe the filtrate as it is modified into true urine. The principle task of the nephron population is to balance the plasma to homeostatic set points and excrete potential toxins in the urine. They do this by accomplishing three principle
