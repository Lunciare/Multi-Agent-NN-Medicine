as well. Fetal amount of a specific gas that dissolves in a liquid is a hemoglobin has a different structure than adult function of its partial pressure. The greater the partial hemoglobin, which results in fetal hemoglobin having a pressure of a gas, the more of that gas will dissolve in a greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. liquid, as the gas moves toward equilibrium. Gas molecules move down a pressure gradient; in other Carbon dioxide is transported in blood by three words, gas moves from a region of high pressure to a different mechanisms: as dissolved carbon dioxide, as region of low pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen bicarbonate, or as carbaminohemoglobin. A small is high in the alveoli and low in the blood of the portion of carbon dioxide remains. The largest amount pulmonary capillaries. As a result, oxygen diffuses of transported carbon dioxide is as bicarbonate, across the respiratory membrane from the alveoli into formed in erythrocytes. For this conversion, carbon the blood. In contrast, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is combined with water with the aid of an dioxide is high in the pulmonary capillaries and low in enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This combination
