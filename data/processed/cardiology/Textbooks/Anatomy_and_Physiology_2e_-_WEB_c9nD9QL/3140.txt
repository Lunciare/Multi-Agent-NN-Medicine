a spermatic cord bundle of nerves and blood vessels luteal phase that supplies the testes; contains ductus deferens ovaries female gonads that produce oocytes and sex spermatid immature sperm cells produced by steroid hormones (notably estrogen and meiosis II of secondary spermatocytes progesterone) spermatocyte cell that results from the division of ovulation release of a secondary oocyte and spermatogonium and undergoes meiosis I and associated granulosa cells from an ovary meiosis II to form spermatids ovum haploid female gamete resulting from spermatogenesis formation of new sperm, occurs in completion of meiosis II at fertilization the seminiferous tubules of the testes penis male organ of copulation spermatogonia (singular = spermatogonium) diploid perimetrium outer epithelial layer of uterine wall precursor cells that become sperm polar body smaller cell produced during the process spermiogenesis transformation of spermatids to of meiosis in oogenesis spermatozoa during spermatogenesis prepuce (also, foreskin) flap of skin that forms a suspensory ligaments bands of connective tissue collar around, and thus protects and lubricates, the that suspend the breast onto the chest wall by glans penis; also referred as the foreskin attachment to the overlying dermis primary follicles ovarian follicles with a primary tertiary follicles (also, antral follicles) ovarian oocyte
