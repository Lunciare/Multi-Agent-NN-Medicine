There are three types of muscle tissue: skeletal 10.2Skeletal Muscle muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Most of Skeletal muscles contain connective tissue, blood the body’s skeletal muscle produces movement by vessels, and nerves. There are three layers of acting on the skeleton. Cardiac muscle is found in the connective tissue: epimysium, perimysium, and wall of the heart and pumps blood through the endomysium. Skeletal muscle fibers are organized into circulatory system. groups called fascicles. Blood vessels and nerves enter Smooth muscle is found in the skin, where it is the connective tissue and branch
