core of the medical examination. What does history mean in the context of medical practice? 16.2 The Mental Status Exam LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the relationship of mental status exam results to cerebral functions • Explain the categorization of regions of the cortex based on anatomy and physiology • Differentiate between primary, association, and integration areas of the cerebral cortex • Provide examples of localization of function related to the cerebral cortex In the clinical setting, the set of subtests known as the mental status exam helps us understand the relationship of the brain to the body. Ultimately, this is accomplished by assessing behavior. Tremors related to intentional movements, incoordination, or the neglect of one side of the body can be indicative of failures of the connections of the cerebrum either within the hemispheres, or from the cerebrum to other portions of the nervous system. There is no strict test for what the cerebrum does alone, but rather in what it does through its control of the rest of the CNS, the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the musculature. Sometimes eliciting a behavior is as simple as asking a
