the adaptive immune response. 21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response • List the various characteristics of an antigen • Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors • Outline the steps of T cell development • Describe the major T cell types and their functions Innate immune responses (and early induced responses) are in many cases ineffective at completely controlling pathogen growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either control or eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system also sends signals to the cells of the adaptive immune system, guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response. The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response The specificity of the adaptive immune response—its ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a wide variety of pathogens—is its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens, are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and
