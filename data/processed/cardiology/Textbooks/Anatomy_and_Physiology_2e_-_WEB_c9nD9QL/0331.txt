local bacteria break down; this causes body odor. Both merocrine and apocrine glands continue to produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus and golgi regions remain intact after secretion. In contrast, the process ofholocrine secretioninvolves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell accumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells in the surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin and hair are holocrine glands/cells (Figure 4.11). 140 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization FIGURE4.11 Sebaceous Glands These glands secrete oils that lubricate and protect the skin. They are holocrine glands and they are destroyed after releasing their contents. New glandular cells form to replace the cells that are lost. LM × 400.

Theserous glandproduces watery, blood-plasma-like secretions rich in enzymes such as alpha amylase, whereas themucous glandreleases watery to viscous products rich in the glycoprotein mucin. Both serous and mucous glands are common in the
