formation of a fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis is the process in erythrocytes are red, biconcave disks packed with an which a clot is degraded in a healing vessel. oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin. The Anticoagulants are substances that oppose hemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins coagulation. They are important in limiting the extent bound to a pigment molecule called heme, which and duration of clotting. Inadequate clotting can result contains an ion of iron. In the bloodstream, iron picks from too few platelets, or inadequate production of up oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues; clotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder the amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon hemophilia. Excessive clotting, called thrombosis, can dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. be caused by excessive numbers of platelets. A Erythrocytes live only 120 days on average, and thus thrombus is a collection of fibrin, platelets, and must be continually replaced. Worn-out erythrocytes erythrocytes that has accumulated along the lining of a are phagocytized by macrophages and their blood vessel, whereas an embolus is a thrombus that hemoglobin is broken down. The breakdown products has broken free from the vessel wall and is circulating are
