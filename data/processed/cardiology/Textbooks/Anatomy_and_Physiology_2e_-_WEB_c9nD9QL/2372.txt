previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological characteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor. These soluble factors are secreted during innate or Access for free at openstax.org 21.2 • Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response 909 early induced responses, and later during adaptive immune responses. Cytokines and Chemokines Acytokineis signaling molecule that allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances. Cytokines are secreted into the intercellular space, and the action of the cytokine induces the receiving cell to change its physiology. Achemokineis a soluble chemical mediator similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract cells (chemotaxis) from longer distances. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thiswebsite( learn about phagocyte chemotaxis. Phagocyte chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of interleukins and other chemokines. By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested? Early induced Proteins Early induced proteins are those that are not constitutively present in the body, but are made as they are needed early during the innate immune response.Interferonsare an example of early induced proteins. Cells infected with viruses secrete interferons that travel
