response to elevated blood levels of calcium. The hormone increases the activity of osteoblasts, which remove calcium from the blood and incorporate calcium into the bony matrix. 26.4 Acid-Base Balance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the most powerful buffer system in the body • Explain the way in which the respiratory system affects blood pH Proper physiological functioning depends on a very tight balance between the concentrations of acids and bases in the blood. Acid-balance balance is measured using the pH scale, as shown inFigure 26.15. A variety of buffering systems permits blood and other bodily fluids to maintain a narrow pH range, even in the face of perturbations. A buffer is a chemical system that prevents a radical change in fluid pH by dampening the change in hydrogen ion concentrations in the case of excess acid or base. Most commonly, the substance that absorbs the ions is either a weak acid, which takes up hydroxyl ions, or a weak base, which takes up hydrogen ions. 1172 26 • Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Balance FIGURE26.15 The pH Scale This chart shows where many common substances fall on the pH scale.
