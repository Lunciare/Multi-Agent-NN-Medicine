the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere in the body. The mixed blood drains into typical pulmonary veins, whereas the bronchial artery branches remain separate and drain into bronchial veins described later. Eachpericardial arterysupplies blood to the pericardium, theesophageal arteryprovides blood to the esophagus, and themediastinal arteryprovides blood to the mediastinum. The remaining thoracic aorta branches are collectively referred to asparietal branchesor somatic branches, and include the intercostal and superior phrenic arteries. Eachintercostal arteryprovides blood to the muscles of the thoracic cavity and vertebral column. Thesuperior phrenic arteryprovides blood to the superior surface of the 852 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation diaphragm.Table 20.7lists the arteries of the thoracic region. FIGURE20.28 Arteries of the Thoracic and Abdominal Regions The thoracic aorta gives rise to the arteries of the visceral and parietal branches. Arteries of the Thoracic Region Vessel Description Visceral A group of arterial branches of the thoracic aorta; supplies blood to the viscera (i.e., organs) of the branches thorax Bronchial Systemic branch from the aorta that provides oxygenated blood to the lungs; this blood supply is artery in addition to the pulmonary circuit that brings blood for oxygenation
