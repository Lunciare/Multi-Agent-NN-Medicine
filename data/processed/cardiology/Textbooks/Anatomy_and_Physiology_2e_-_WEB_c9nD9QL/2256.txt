the tibial region. The fibular or peroneal artery branches from the posterior tibial artery. It bifurcates and becomes themedial plantar arteryandlateral plantar artery, providing blood to the plantar surfaces. There is an anastomosis with the dorsalis pedis artery, and the medial and lateral plantar arteries form two arches called thedorsal arch(also called the arcuate arch) and theplantar arch, which provide blood to the remainder of the foot and toes.Figure 20.34shows the distribution of the major systemic arteries in the lower limb.Table 20.10summarizes the major systemic arteries discussed in the text. 860 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.33 Major Arteries Serving the Lower Limb Major arteries serving the lower limb are shown in anterior and posterior views.
