from functioning normally. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thissite( see a virtual neurophysiology lab, and to observe electrophysiological processes in the nervous system, where scientists directly measure the electrical signals produced by neurons. Often, the action potentials occur so rapidly that watching a screen to see them occur is not helpful. A speaker is powered by the signals recorded from a neuron and it “pops” each time the neuron fires an action potential. These action potentials are firing so fast that it sounds like static on the radio. Electrophysiologists can recognize the patterns within that static to understand what is happening. Why is the leech model used for measuring the electrical activity of neurons instead of using humans? 476 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue 12.5 Communication Between Neurons LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the differences between the types of graded potentials • Categorize the major neurotransmitters by chemical type and effect The electrical changes taking place within a neuron, as described in the previous section, are similar to a light switch being turned on. A stimulus starts the depolarization, but the action potential runs on its own once a
