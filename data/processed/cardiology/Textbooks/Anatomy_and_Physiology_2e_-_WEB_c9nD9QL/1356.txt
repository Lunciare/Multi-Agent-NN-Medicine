with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue. contains the cortical area for auditory processing, but Thus, metabolic wastes are collected in cerebrospinal also has regions crucial for memory formation. fluid that circulates through the CNS. This fluid is Nuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the produced by filtering blood at the choroid plexuses in subcortical nuclei, are responsible for augmenting the four ventricles of the brain. It then circulates cortical functions. The basal nuclei receive input from through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid cortical areas and compare it with the general state of space, between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. the individual through the activity of a dopamine- From the arachnoid granulations, CSF is reabsorbed releasing nucleus. The output influences the activity of into the blood, removing the waste from the privileged part of the thalamus that can then increase or decrease central nervous tissue. cortical activity that often results in changes to motor The blood, now with the reabsorbed CSF, drains out of commands. The basal forebrain is responsible for the cranium through the dural sinuses. The dura mater modulating cortical activity in attention and memory. is the tough outer covering of the CNS,
