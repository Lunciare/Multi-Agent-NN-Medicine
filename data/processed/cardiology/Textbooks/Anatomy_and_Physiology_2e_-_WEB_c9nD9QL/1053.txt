one group fails to function, body posture will be compromised. Muscles of the Abdomen There are four pairs of abdominal muscles that cover the anterior and lateral abdominal region and meet at the anterior midline. These muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall can be divided into four groups: the external obliques, the internal obliques, the transversus abdominis, and the rectus abdominis (Figure 11.16andTable 11.6).

On the flanks of the body, medial to the rectus abdominis, the abdominal wall is composed of three layers. The external oblique muscles form the superficial layer, while the internal oblique muscles form the middle layer, and the transversus abdominis forms the deepest layer. (b) The muscles of the lower back move the lumbar spine but also assist in femur movements. 416 11 • The Muscular System Muscles of the Abdomen Target Movement Target motion Prime mover Origin Insertion direction External Supination; Ribs Ribs 7–10; Twisting at waist; also bending to
