Anatomy and Physiology

be sufficiently delivered to muscle. Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very long (approximately 1 minute of muscle activity), but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high- intensity output. This is because glycolysis does not utilize glucose very efficiently, producing a net gain of two ATPs per molecule of glucose, and the end product of lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it accumulates. Aerobic respirationis the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen (O ) to produce carbon 2 dioxide, water, and ATP. Approximately 95 percent of the ATP required for resting or moderately active muscles is provided by aerobic respiration, which takes place in mitochondria. The inputs for aerobic respiration include Access for free at openstax.org 10.3 • Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation 371 glucose circulating in the bloodstream, pyruvic acid, and fatty acids. Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis, producing approximately 36 ATPs per molecule of glucose versus four from glycolysis. However, aerobic respiration cannot be sustained without a steady supply of O to the skeletal muscle and is much 2 slower (Figure 10.12c). To compensate, muscles store small amount of excess oxygen in proteins call
