min under resting conditions. Approximately 20 percent or one liter enters the kidneys to be filtered. On average, this liter results in the production of about 125 mL/min filtrate produced in males (range of 90 to 140 mL/min) and 105 mL/min filtrate produced in females (range of 80 to 125 mL/min). This amount equates to a volume of about 180 L/day in males and 150 L/day in females. Ninety-nine percent of this filtrate is returned to the circulation by reabsorption so that only about 1–2 liters of urine are produced per day (Table 25.4). Calculating Urine Formation per Day Flow per minute Calculation (mL) Cardiac output is about 5000 mL/minute, of which 21 percent flows through the Renal kidney. 1050 blood flow 5000*0.21 = 1050 mL blood/min Renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the hematocrit. If a Renal person has a hematocrit of 45, then the renal plasma flow is 55 percent. plasma 578 flow 1050*0.55 = 578 mL plasma/min The GFR is the amount of plasma entering Bowman’s capsule per minute. It is the Glomerular renal plasma flow times the fraction that enters the renal capsule (19 percent). filtration 110 rate 578*0.19 = 110 mL
