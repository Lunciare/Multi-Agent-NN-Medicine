• Food residue is concentrated and • Absorbs most residual water, electrolytes, temporarily stored prior to defecation Large and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria • Mucus eases passage of feces through intestine • Propels feces toward rectum colon • Eliminates feces TABLE23.3 Access for free at openstax.org 23.2 • Digestive System Processes and Regulation 1003 Digestive Processes The processes of digestion include six activities: ingestion, propulsion, mechanical or physical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and defecation. The first of these processes,ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase. Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced. Food leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example ofpropulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis.Peristalsisconsists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation
