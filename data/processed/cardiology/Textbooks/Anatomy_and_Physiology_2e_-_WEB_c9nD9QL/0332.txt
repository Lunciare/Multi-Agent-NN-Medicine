Anatomy and Physiology

blood-plasma-like secretions rich in enzymes such as alpha amylase, whereas themucous glandreleases watery to viscous products rich in the glycoprotein mucin. Both serous and mucous glands are common in the salivary glands of the mouth. Mixed exocrine glands contain both serous and mucous glands and release both types of secretions. 4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and Protects LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify and distinguish between the types of connective tissue: proper, supportive, and fluid • Explain the functions of connective tissues As may be obvious from its name, one of the major functions of connective tissue is to connect tissues and organs. Unlike epithelial tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no extracellular space in between, connective tissue cells are dispersed in amatrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular material produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the functioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is aground substanceoften crisscrossed by protein fibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones.
