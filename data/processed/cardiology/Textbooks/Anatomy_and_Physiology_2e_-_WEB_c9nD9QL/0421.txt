Sweat glands develop from epidermal projections into the dermis and are classified as merocrine glands; that is, the secretions are excreted by 176 5 • The Integumentary System exocytosis through a duct without affecting the cells of the gland. There are two types of sweat glands, each secreting slightly different products. Aneccrine sweat glandis type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are found all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the forehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin surface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly of water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine glands are a primary component of thermoregulation in
