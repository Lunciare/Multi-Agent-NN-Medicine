membrane are the integral proteins and peripheral protein (Figure 3.4). As its name suggests, anintegral proteinis a protein that is embedded in the membrane. Achannel proteinis an example of an integral protein that selectively allows particular materials, such 84 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization as certain ions, to pass into or out of the cell. FIGURE3.4 Cell Membrane The cell membrane of the cell is a phospholipid bilayer containing many different molecular components, including proteins and cholesterol, some with carbohydrate groups attached. Another important group of integral proteins are cell recognition proteins, which serve to mark a cell’s identity so that it can be recognized by other cells. Areceptoris a type of recognition protein that can selectively bind a specific molecule outside the cell, and this binding induces a chemical reaction within the cell. Aligandis the specific molecule that binds to and activates a receptor. Some integral proteins serve dual roles as both a receptor and an ion channel. One example of a receptor-ligand interaction is the receptors on nerve cells that bind neurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When a dopamine molecule binds to a dopamine receptor protein, a channel within the transmembrane protein opens to allow certain ions
