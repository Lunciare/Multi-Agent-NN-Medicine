The ligamentum flavum unites the lamina of adjacent converted into bone over a period of many years. vertebrae. The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via 7.4The Thoracic Cage endochondral ossification. Mesenchyme accumulates The thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs. It is around the notochord and produces hyaline cartilage composed of 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages models of the vertebrae. The notochord largely and the sternum. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to disappears, but remnants of the notochord contribute the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the to formation of the intervertebral discs. In the thorax manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The region, a portion of the vertebral cartilage model splits manubrium and body are joined at the sternal angle, off to form the ribs. These then become attached which is also the site for attachment of the second ribs. anteriorly to the developing cartilage model of the sternum. Growth of the cartilage models for the Ribs are flattened, curved bones and are numbered vertebrae, ribs, and sternum allow for enlargement of 1–12. Posteriorly, the head of the rib articulates with the thoracic cage during childhood and adolescence. the costal facets located on the bodies
