the full in which embryonic mesenchyme tissue converts length of the anterior vertebral column, uniting the directly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are vertebral bodies. The supraspinous ligament is located separated by fontanelles, wide areas of fibrous posteriorly and interconnects the spinous processes of connective tissue. As the bones grow, the fontanelles the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. In the neck, this are reduced to sutures, which allow for continued ligament expands to become the nuchal ligament. The growth of the skull throughout childhood. In contrast, nuchal ligament is attached to the cervical spinous the cranial base and facial bones are produced by the processes and superiorly to the base of the skull, out to process of endochondral ossification, in which the external occipital protuberance. The posterior mesenchyme tissue initially produces a hyaline longitudinal ligament runs within the vertebral canal cartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage model and unites the posterior sides of the vertebral bodies. allows for growth of the bone and is gradually The ligamentum flavum unites the lamina of adjacent converted into bone over a period of many years. vertebrae. The vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via 7.4The Thoracic Cage endochondral
