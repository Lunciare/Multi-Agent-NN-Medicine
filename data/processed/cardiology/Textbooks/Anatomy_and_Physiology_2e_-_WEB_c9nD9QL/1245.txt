ectoderm, or outer tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the nervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body. But how is it responsible for the nervous system? As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium, forming aneural plate. The cells then begin to change shape, causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward (Figure 13.2). Aneural grooveforms, visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo. The ridge- like edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as theneural fold. As the neural folds come together and converge, the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called theneural tube. Cells from the neural folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as theneural crest, which runs lateral to the neural tube. The neural crest migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous system (CNS) that will form
