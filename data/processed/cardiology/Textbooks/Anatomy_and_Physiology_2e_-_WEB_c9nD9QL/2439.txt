transplantation of organs and the control of the anti-transplant immune response have made huge strides in the past 50 years. Today, these procedures are commonplace.Tissue typingis the determination of MHC molecules in the tissue to be transplanted to better match the donor to the recipient. The immune response to cancer, on the other hand, has been more difficult to understand and control. Although it is clear that the immune system can recognize some cancers and control them, others seem to be resistant to immune mechanisms. The Rh Factor Red blood cells can be typed based on their surface antigens. ABO blood type, in which individuals are type A, B, AB, or O according to their genetics, is one example. A separate antigen system seen on red blood cells is the Rh antigen. When someone is “A positive” for example, the positive refers to the presence of the Rh antigen, whereas someone who is “A negative” would lack this molecule. An interesting consequence of Rh factor expression is seen inerythroblastosis fetalis, a hemolytic disease of the newborn (Figure 21.30). This disease occurs when people negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive children. During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the
