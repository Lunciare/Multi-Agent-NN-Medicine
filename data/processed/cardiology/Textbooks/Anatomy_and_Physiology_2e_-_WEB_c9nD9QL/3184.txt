embryonic process of neurulation establishes the rudiments of the future central nervous system and skeleton. The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a cylindrical shape through the process of embryonic folding(Figure 28.14). The embryo folds laterally and again at either end, forming a C-shape with distinct head and tail ends. The embryo envelops a portion of the yolk sac, which protrudes with the umbilical cord from what will become the abdomen. The folding essentially creates a tube, called the primitive gut, that is lined by the endoderm. The amniotic sac, which was sitting on top of the flat embryo, envelops the embryo as it folds. 1238 28 • Development and Inheritance FIGURE28.14 Embryonic Folding Embryonic folding converts a flat sheet of cells into a hollow, tube-like structure. Within the first 8 weeks of gestation, a developing embryo establishes the rudimentary structures of all of its organs and tissues from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is calledorganogenesis. Like the central nervous system, the heart also begins its development in the embryo as a tube-like structure, connected via capillaries to the chorionic villi. Cells of the primitive tube-shaped heart are capable of electrical conduction
