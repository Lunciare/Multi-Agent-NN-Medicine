arms, chest, radial vein parallels the radius and radial artery; shoulders, back, and central nervous system arises from the palmar venous arches and leads to subclavian vein located deep in the thoracic cavity; the brachial vein becomes the axillary vein as it enters the axillary reabsorption in the cardiovascular system, the region; drains the axillary and smaller local veins movement of material from the interstitial fluid into near the scapular region; leads to the the capillaries brachiocephalic vein renal artery branch of the abdominal aorta; supplies subscapular vein drains blood from the subscapular each kidney region and leads to the axillary vein renal vein largest vein entering the inferior vena cava; superior mesenteric artery branch of the abdominal drains the kidneys and leads to the inferior vena aorta; supplies blood to the small intestine cava (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and resistance any condition or parameter that slows or a majority of the large intestine counteracts the flow of blood superior phrenic artery branch of the thoracic aorta; respiratory pump increase in the volume of the supplies blood to the superior surface of the thorax during inhalation that decreases air pressure, diaphragm enabling venous blood to flow into the
