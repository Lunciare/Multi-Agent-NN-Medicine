side, but not fine touch. The opposite is true on the other side. The pain fibers on the side with motor function cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral column as far as the hemisection. The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the source on the intact side and reach the brain for conscious perception. The trauma would be at the level just before sensory discrimination returns to normal, helping to pinpoint the trauma. Whereas imaging technology, like magnetic resonance Access for free at openstax.org 16.5 • The Coordination and Gait Exams 649 imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning, could localize the injury as well, nothing more complicated than a cotton-tipped applicator can localize the damage. That may be all that is available on the scene when moving the victim requires crucial decisions be made. 16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the relationship between the location of the cerebellum and its function in movement • Chart the major divisions of the cerebellum • List the major connections of the cerebellum • Describe the relationship of the cerebellum
