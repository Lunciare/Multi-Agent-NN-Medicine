to recognize and identify the various formed elements? You will need to do this is a systematic manner, scanning along the image. The standard method is to use a grid, but this is not possible with this resource. Try constructing a simple table with each leukocyte type and then making a mark for each cell type you identify. Attempt to classify at least 50 and perhaps as many as 100 different cells. Based on the percentage of cells that you count, do the numbers represent a normal blood smear or does something appear to be abnormal? 18.5 Hemostasis LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the three mechanisms involved in hemostasis • Explain how the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways lead to the common pathway, and the coagulation factors involved in each • Discuss disorders affecting hemostasis Platelets are key players inhemostasis, the process by which the body seals a ruptured blood vessel and prevents further loss of blood. Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention, hemostasis is quite effective in dealing with small, simple wounds. There are three steps to the process: vascular spasm, the formation of a platelet
