distal end of the femur. The narrowed region below the head is theneck of the femur. This is a common area for fractures of the femur. The greater trochanteris the large, upward, bony projection located above the base of the neck. Multiple muscles that act across the hip joint attach to the greater trochanter, which, because of its projection from the femur, gives additional leverage to these muscles. The greater trochanter can be felt just under the skin on the lateral side of your upper thigh. Thelesser trochanteris a small, bony prominence that lies on the medial aspect of the femur, just below the neck. A single, powerful muscle attaches to the lesser trochanter. Running between the greater and lesser trochanters on the anterior side of the femur is the roughenedintertrochanteric line. The trochanters are also connected on the posterior side of the femur by the largerintertrochanteric crest. The elongatedshaft of the femurhas a slight anterior bowing or curvature. At its proximal end, the posterior shaft has thegluteal tuberosity, a roughened area extending inferiorly from the greater trochanter. More inferiorly, the gluteal tuberosity becomes continuous with thelinea aspera(“rough line”). This is the roughened ridge that passes distally along the posterior
