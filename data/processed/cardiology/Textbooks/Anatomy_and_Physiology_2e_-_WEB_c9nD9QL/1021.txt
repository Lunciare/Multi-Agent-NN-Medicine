bone being pulled is called the muscle’sinsertion, and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed (stabilized) bone is called theorigin. During forearmflexion—bending the elbow—the brachioradialis assists the brachialis. Although a number of muscles may be involved in an action, the principal muscle involved is called theprime mover, oragonist. To lift a cup, a muscle called the biceps brachii is actually the prime mover; however, because it can be assisted by the brachialis, the brachialis is called asynergistin this action (Figure 11.2). A synergist can also be afixatorthat stabilizes the bone that is the attachment for the prime mover’s origin. FIGURE11.2 Prime Movers and Synergists The biceps brachii flex the lower arm. The brachoradialis, in the forearm, and brachialis, located deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion. A muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called anantagonist. Antagonists play two important roles in muscle function: (1) they maintain body or limb position, such as holding the arm out or standing erect; and (2) they control rapid movement, as in shadow boxing without landing a punch or the ability to check the motion of a limb. For example,
