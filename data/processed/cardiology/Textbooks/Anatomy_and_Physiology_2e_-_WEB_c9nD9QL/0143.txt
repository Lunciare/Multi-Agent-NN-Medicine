via dehydration synthesis, and the bond linking them is referred to as a glycosidic bond (glyco- = “sugar”). Three disaccharides (shown inFigure 2.19) are important to humans. These are sucrose, commonly referred to as table sugar; lactose, or milk sugar; and maltose, or malt sugar. As you can tell from their common names, you consume these in your diet; however, your body cannot use them directly. Instead, in the digestive tract, they are split into their component monosaccharides via hydrolysis. 64 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization FIGURE2.19 Three Important Disaccharides All three important disaccharides form by dehydration synthesis. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( observe the formation of a disaccharide. What happens when water encounters a glycosidic bond? Polysaccharides Polysaccharides can contain a few to a thousand or more monosaccharides. Three are important to the body (Figure 2.20): • Starches are polymers of glucose. They occur in long chains called amylose or branched chains called amylopectin, both of which are stored in plant-based foods and are relatively easy to digest.
