severe and, if not detected and treated properly, can lead to diabetic coma, which can be fatal. A common early symptom of ketoacidosis is deep, rapid breathing as the body attempts to drive off CO 2 and compensate for the acidosis. Another common symptom is fruity-smelling breath, due to the exhalation of acetone. Other symptoms include dry skin and mouth, a flushed face, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Treatment for diabetic coma is ingestion or injection of sugar; its prevention is the proper daily administration of insulin. A person who is diabetic and uses insulin can initiate ketoacidosis if a dose of insulin is missed. Among people with type 2 diabetes, those of Hispanic and African-American descent are more likely to go into ketoacidosis than those of other ethnic backgrounds, although the reason for this is unknown. 26.5 Disorders of Acid-Base Balance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the three blood variables considered when making a diagnosis of acidosis or alkalosis • Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a respiratory origin • Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a metabolic/renal origin Normal arterial
