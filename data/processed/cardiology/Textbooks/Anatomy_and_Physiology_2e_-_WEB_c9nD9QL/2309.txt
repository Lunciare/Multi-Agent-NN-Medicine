Anatomy and Physiology

to the left common iliac vein phrenic vein leads to the left renal vein muscular artery (also, distributing artery) artery with plantar arch formed from the anastomosis of the abundant smooth muscle in the tunica media that dorsalis pedis artery and medial and plantar branches to distribute blood to the arteriole network arteries; branches supply the distal portions of the myogenic response constriction or dilation in the foot and digits walls of arterioles in response to pressures related plantar veins drain the foot and lead to the plantar to blood flow; reduces high blood flow or increases venous arch low blood flow to help maintain consistent flow to plantar venous arch formed from the plantar veins; the capillary network leads to the anterior and posterior tibial veins nervi vasorum small nerve fibers found in arteries through anastomoses and veins that trigger contraction of the smooth popliteal artery continuation of the femoral artery muscle in their walls posterior to the knee; branches into the anterior and net filtration pressure (NFP) force driving fluid out of posterior tibial arteries the capillary and into the tissue spaces; equal to the popliteal vein continuation of the femoral vein difference of the capillary hydrostatic pressure
