thick and fan-shaped, covering much of the superior portion of the anterior thorax. The broad, triangularlatissimus dorsiis located on the inferior part of the back, where it inserts into a thick connective tissue sheath called an aponeurosis. 424 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.23 Muscles That Move the Humerus (a, c) The muscles that move the humerus anteriorly are generally located on the anterior side of the body and originate from the sternum (e.g., pectoralis major) or the anterior side of the scapula (e.g., subscapularis). (b) The muscles that move the humerus superiorly generally originate from the superior surfaces of the scapula and/or the clavicle (e.g., deltoids). The muscles that move the humerus inferiorly generally originate from middle or lower back (e.g., latissiumus dorsi). (d) The muscles that move the humerus posteriorly are generally located on the posterior side of the body and insert into the scapula (e.g., infraspinatus).

The anatomical and ligamental structure of the shoulder joint and the arrangements of the muscles covering it, allows the
