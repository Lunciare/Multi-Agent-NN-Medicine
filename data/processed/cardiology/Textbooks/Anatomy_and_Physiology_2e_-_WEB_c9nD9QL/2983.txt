of body mass in infants to about 50–60 percent in adults, to as low as 45 percent in old age. The percent of body water changes with development, because the proportions of the body given over to each organ and to muscles, fat, bone, and other tissues change from infancy to adulthood (Figure 26.2). Your brain and kidneys have the highest proportions of water, which composes 80–85 percent of their masses. In contrast, teeth have the lowest proportion of water, at 8–10 percent.

Fluid Compartments Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specificfluid compartment, a location that is largely separate from another compartment by some form of a physical barrier. Theintracellular fluid (ICF)compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes.Extracellular fluid (ECF)surrounds all cells in the body. Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and
