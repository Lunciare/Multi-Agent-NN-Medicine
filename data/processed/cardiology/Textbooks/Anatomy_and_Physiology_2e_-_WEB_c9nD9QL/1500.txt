the spinal cord, originating from well as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the and red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in dorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. The the medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the major differences between the two are in the type of brain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal information that is relayed to the brain and where the cord in this system. Descending input from the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily secondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum carries information about touch and proprioception and connect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem. crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic All of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord tract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature to synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of sensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at the spinal cord. These lower motor neurons are the the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause similar sensation information from the head to these contractions.
