the temporal bone of the cranium Chapter Review 13.1The Embryologic Perspective PNS structures as well as some non-nervous tissues. The development of the nervous system starts early in The brain develops from this early tube structure and embryonic development. The outer layer of the gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the embryo, the ectoderm, gives rise to the skin and the neural tube grows and differentiates, it enlarges into nervous system. A specialized region of this layer, the three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, neuroectoderm, becomes a groove that folds in and midbrain, and hindbrain regions of the adult brain. becomes the neural tube beneath the dorsal surface of Later in development, two of these three vesicles the embryo. The anterior end of the neural tube differentiate further, resulting in five vesicles. Those develops into the brain, and the posterior region five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions becomes the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the of the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly neural groove, when it closes off, are called the neural from the telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only crest and migrate through the embryo to
