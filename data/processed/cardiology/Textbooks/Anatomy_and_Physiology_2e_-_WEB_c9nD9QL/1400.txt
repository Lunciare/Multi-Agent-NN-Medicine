are activated only by high frequencies, whereas those at the apex of the cochlea are activated only by low frequencies. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn more about how the structures of the ear convert sound waves into a neural signal by moving the “hairs,” or stereocilia, of the cochlear duct. Specific locations along the length of the duct encode specific frequencies, or pitches. The brain interprets the meaning of the sounds we hear as music, speech, noise, etc. Which ear structures are responsible for the amplification and transfer of sound from the external ear to the inner ear? INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisanimation( learn more about the inner ear and to see the cochlea unroll, with the base at the back of the image and the apex at the front. Specific wavelengths of sound cause specific regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate, much like the keys of a piano produce sound at different frequencies. Based on the animation, where do frequencies—from high to low pitches—cause activity in the hair cells within the cochlear duct? 550 14 • The Somatic Nervous System Equilibrium (Balance) Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information aboutequilibrium, the sense of balance.
