the two functions. Sensory fibers are types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information unipolar sensory neurons and are found on the dorsal into the brain and target sensory nuclei. Motor fibers root of all spinal nerves as well as associated with are axons of motor neurons in motor nuclei of the brain many of the cranial nerves. Autonomic ganglia are in stem and target skeletal muscles of the head and neck. the sympathetic chain, the associated paravertebral or Spinal nerves are all mixed nerves with both sensory prevertebral ganglia, or in terminal ganglia near or and motor fibers. Spinal nerves emerge from the spinal within the organs controlled by the autonomic nervous cord and reorganize through plexuses, which then give system. rise to systemic nerves. Thoracic spinal nerves are not part of any plexus, but give rise to the intercostal Nerves are classified as cranial nerves or spinal nerves nerves directly. on the basis of their connection to the brain or spinal cord, respectively.
