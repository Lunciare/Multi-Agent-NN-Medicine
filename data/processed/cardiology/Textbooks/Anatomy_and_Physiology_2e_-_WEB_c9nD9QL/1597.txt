The competing inputs can contribute to the endogenous agents or their receptors. A survey of how resting tone of the organ system. Heart rate is normally different drugs affect autonomic function illustrates the under parasympathetic tone, whereas blood pressure role that the neurotransmitters and hormones play in is normally under sympathetic tone. The heart rate is autonomic function. Drugs can be thought of as slowed by the autonomic system at rest, whereas chemical tools to effect changes in the system with blood vessels retain a slight constriction at rest. some precision, based on where those drugs are effective. In a few systems of the body, the competing input from the two divisions is not the norm. The sympathetic tone Nicotine is not a drug that is used therapeutically, of blood vessels is caused by the lack of except for smoking cessation. When it is introduced parasympathetic input to the systemic circulatory into the body via products, it has broad effects on the system. Only certain regions receive parasympathetic autonomic system. Nicotine carries a risk for input that relaxes the smooth
