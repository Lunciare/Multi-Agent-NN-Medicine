As starvation continues, and more glucose is needed, glycerol from fatty acids can be liberated and used as a source for gluconeogenesis. After several days of starvation, ketone bodies become the major source of fuel for the heart and other organs. As starvation continues, fatty acids and triglyceride stores are used to create ketones for the body. This prevents the continued breakdown of proteins that serve as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis. Once these stores are fully depleted, proteins from muscles are released and broken down for glucose synthesis. Overall survival is dependent on the amount of fat and protein stored in the body. 24.6 Energy and Heat Balance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe how the body regulates temperature • Explain the significance of the metabolic rate The body tightly regulates the body temperature through a process calledthermoregulation, in which the body can maintain its temperature
