Anatomy and Physiology

fifth sign, loss of function, may also accompany inflammation. Upon tissue injury, damaged cells release inflammatory chemical signals that evoke localvasodilation, the widening of the blood vessels. Increased blood flow results in apparent redness and heat. In response to injury, mast cells present in tissue degranulate, releasing the potent vasodilatorhistamine. Increased blood flow and inflammatory mediators recruit white blood cells to the site of inflammation. The endothelium lining the local blood vessel becomes “leaky” under the influence of histamine and other inflammatory mediators allowing neutrophils, macrophages, and fluid to move from the blood into the interstitial tissue spaces. The excess liquid in tissue causes swelling, more properly called edema. The swollen tissues squeezing pain receptors cause the sensation of pain. Prostaglandins released from injured cells also activate pain neurons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce pain because they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. High levels of NSAIDs reduce inflammation. Antihistamines decrease allergies by blocking histamine receptors and as a result the histamine 152 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization response. After containment of an injury, the tissue repair phase starts with removal of toxins and waste products.Clotting (coagulation) reduces blood loss from damaged blood vessels and forms a network of
