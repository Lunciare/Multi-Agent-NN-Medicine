by the hypothalamus. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed in more detail below. Theadrenal medullais neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body. The sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via neurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. One of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress. Stress can be either physical or psychological or both. Physical stresses include exposing the body to injury, walking outside in cold and wet conditions without a coat on, or malnutrition.

The body responds in different ways to short-term stress and long-term stress following a pattern known as the Access for free at openstax.org 17.6 • The Adrenal Glands 689 general adaptation syndrome (GAS). Stage one of GAS is called thealarm reaction. This is short-term stress, the fight-or-flight response, mediated
