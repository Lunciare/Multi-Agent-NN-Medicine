These names are retained and used to define the three regions of the adult hip bone. 286 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton FIGURE8.13 The Hip Bone The adult hip bone consists of three regions. The ilium forms the large, fan-shaped superior portion, the ischium forms the posteroinferior portion, and the pubis forms the anteromedial portion. Theiliumis the fan-like, superior region that forms the largest part of the hip bone. It is firmly united to the sacrum at the largely immobilesacroiliac joint(seeFigure 8.12). Theischiumforms the posteroinferior region of each hip bone. It supports the body when sitting. Thepubisforms the anterior portion of the hip bone. The pubis curves medially, where it joins to the pubis of the opposite hip bone at a specialized joint called thepubic symphysis. Ilium When you place your hands on your waist, you can feel the arching, superior margin of the ilium along your waistline (seeFigure 8.13). This curved, superior margin of the ilium is theiliac crest. The rounded, anterior termination of the iliac crest is theanterior superior iliac spine. This important bony landmark can be felt at your anterolateral hip. Inferior
