the membrane, but exclude anions. Ion channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. Some are opened by certain events, meaning the channels aregated. So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are gated. Although these classes of ion channels are found primarily in the cells of nervous or muscular tissue, they also can be found in the cells of epithelial and connective tissues. Aligand-gated channelopens because a signaling molecule, a ligand, binds to the extracellular region of the channel. This type of channel is also known as anionotropic receptorbecause when the ligand, known as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its charge (Figure 12.18). FIGURE12.18 Ligand-Gated Channels When the ligand, in this case the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, binds to a specific location on the extracellular surface of the channel protein, the pore opens to allow select ions through. The ions, in this case, are cations of sodium, calcium, and potassium. Amechanically gated channelopens because of a physical distortion of the cell membrane. Many channels associated with the sense of touch (somatosensation) are mechanically gated. For example, as pressure is applied
