attached to chordae the pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular tendineae that extend to the papillary muscles, which ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization, the are extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the ventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and valves from being blown back into the atria. The pressure within the ventricles drops. As ventricular pulmonary valve is located at the base of the pressure drops, there is a tendency for blood to flow pulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is back into the atria from the major arteries, producing located at the base of the aorta. The right and left the dicrotic notch in the ECG and closing the two coronary arteries are the first to branch off the aorta semilunar valves. The second heart sound, S or dub, and arise from two of the three sinuses located near 2 occurs when the semilunar valves close. When the the base of the aorta and are generally located in the pressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from sulci. Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries the atria into the ventricles, opening the and generally drain into the coronary sinus. atrioventricular valves and marking one complete
