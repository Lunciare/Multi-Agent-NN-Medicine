that once the electrons have passed 2 through the entire ETC, they must be passed to another, separate molecule. These electrons, O , and H+ions from 2 the matrix combine to form new water molecules. This is the basis for your need to breathe in oxygen. Without oxygen, electron flow through the ETC ceases.

INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn about the electron transport chain. The electrons released from NADH and FADH are passed along the chain by each of the carriers, which are reduced 2 when they receive the electron and oxidized when passing it on to the next carrier. Each of these reactions releases a small amount of energy, which is used to pump H+ions across the inner membrane. The accumulation of these protons in the space between the membranes creates a proton gradient with respect to the mitochondrial matrix. Also embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane is an amazing protein pore complex calledATP synthase. Effectively, it is a turbine
