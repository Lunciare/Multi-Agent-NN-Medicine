support cells, calledgranulosa cells, that surround the oocyte, and they can stay in this resting state for years—some until right before menopause. After puberty, a few primordial follicles will respond to a recruitment signal each day, and will join a pool of immature growing follicles calledprimary follicles. Primary follicles start with a single layer of granulosa cells, but the granulosa cells then become active and transition from a flat or squamous shape to a rounded, cuboidal shape as they increase in size and proliferate. As the granulosa cells divide, the follicles—now calledsecondary follicles (seeFigure 27.12)—increase in diameter, adding a new outer layer of connective tissue, blood vessels, andtheca cells—cells that work with the granulosa cells to produce estrogens. Within the growing secondary follicle, the primary oocyte now secretes a thin acellular membrane called the zona pellucida that will play a critical role in fertilization. A thick fluid, called follicular fluid, that has formed between the granulosa cells also begins to collect into one large pool, orantrum. Follicles in which the antrum has become large and fully formed are consideredtertiary follicles(or antral follicles). Several follicles reach the tertiary stage at the same time, and most of these will undergo atresia. The
