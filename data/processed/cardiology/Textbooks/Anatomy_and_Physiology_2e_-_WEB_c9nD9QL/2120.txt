lungs, and veins into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves blood high in oxygen returns to the left atrium, which into the ventricles. The atria begin to contract (atrial pumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn systole), following depolarization of the atria, and pumps blood into the aorta and the remainder of the pump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to systemic circuit. The septa are the partitions that contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within separate the chambers of the heart. They include the the ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above interatrial septum, the interventricular septum, and the the pressure in the atria, blood flows toward the atria, atrioventricular septum. Two of these openings are producing the first heart sound, S or lub. As pressure guarded by the atrioventricular valves, the right 1 in the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood tricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent pushes open the two semilunar valves and moves into the backflow of blood. Each is attached to chordae the pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular tendineae that extend to the papillary muscles, which ejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization, the are extensions of the myocardium,
