Anatomy and Physiology

Level of Organization and tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit “cliques” whose members are unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology; these are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methyl and phosphate groups (Table 2.1). Functional Groups Important in Human Physiology Functional Structural Importance group formula Hydroxyl groups are polar. They are components of all four types of organic Hydroxyl —O—H compounds discussed in this chapter. They are involved in dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. Carboxyl groups are found within fatty acids, amino acids, and many other Carboxyl acids. Amino —N—H Amino groups are found within amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. 2 Methyl —C—H Methyl groups are found within amino acids. 3 Phosphate —P—O 2– Phosphate groups are found within phospholipids and nucleotides. 4 TABLE2.1 Carbon’s affinity for covalent bonding means that many distinct and relatively stable organic molecules nevertheless readily form larger, more complex molecules. Any large molecule is referred to asmacromolecule(macro- = “large”), and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are made up of several “copies” of single units called monomer (mono- =
