to stimulate sodium reabsorption. Internal Anatomy A frontal section through the kidney reveals an outer region called therenal cortexand an inner region called the medulla(Figure 25.8). Therenal columnsare connective tissue extensions that radiate downward from the cortex through the medulla to separate the most characteristic features of the medulla, therenal pyramidsandrenal papillae. The papillae are bundles of collecting ducts that transport urine made by nephrons to thecalycesof the kidney for excretion. The renal columns also serve to divide the kidney into 6–8 lobes and provide a supportive framework for vessels that enter and exit the cortex. The pyramids and renal columns taken together constitute the kidney lobes.

The medial-facing hila are tucked into the sweeping convex outline of the cortex. Emerging from the hilum is the renal pelvis, which is formed from the major and minor calyxes in the kidney. The smooth muscle in the renal pelvis funnels urine via peristalsis into the ureter. The renal arteries form directly from the descending aorta, whereas the
