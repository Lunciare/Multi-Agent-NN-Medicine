lungs after a forceful inhalation. TLC is about 6000 mL air for males, and about 4200 mL for females.Vital capacity (VC)is the amount of air a person can move into or out of their lungs, and is the sum of all of the volumes except residual volume (TV, ERV, and IRV), which is between 4000 and 5000 milliliters.Inspiratory capacity (IC)is the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled past a normal tidal expiration, is the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. On the other hand, thefunctional residual capacity (FRC)is the amount of air that remains in the lung after a normal tidal expiration; it is the sum of expiratory reserve volume and residual volume (seeFigure 22.18).

Explain how spirometry test results can be used to diagnose respiratory diseases or determine the effectiveness of disease treatment.
