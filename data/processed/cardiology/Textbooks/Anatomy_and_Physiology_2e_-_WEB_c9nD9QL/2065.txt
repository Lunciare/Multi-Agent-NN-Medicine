contraction and is normally described as a “lub,” or first heart sound. The second heart sound, S , is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular diastole 2 and is described as a “dub” (Figure 19.29). In both cases, as the valves close, the openings within the atrioventricular septum guarded by the valves will become reduced, and blood flow through the opening will become more turbulent until the valves are fully closed. There is a third heart sound, S , but it is rarely heard in 3 healthy individuals. It may be the sound of blood flowing into the atria, or blood sloshing back and forth in the ventricle, or even tensing of the chordae tendineae. S may be heard in youth, some athletes, and pregnant people. 3 If the sound is heard later in life, it may indicate congestive heart failure, warranting further tests. Some cardiologists refer to the collective S , S , and S sounds as the “Kentucky gallop,” because they mimic those 1 2 3 produced by a galloping horse. The fourth heart sound, S , results from the contraction of the atria pushing blood 4 into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle,
