continuously, viruses like influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to the next. New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season. Genetic recombination—the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens—is an efficient form of immune evasion. For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different viruses infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. Pathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different types. Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been shown to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV. 930 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System 21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies • Explain the four types of hypersensitivity and how they differ • Give an example of how autoimmune disease breaks tolerance This section is about how
