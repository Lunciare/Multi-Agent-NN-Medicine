of the lateral abdominal wall. 7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the two types of embryonic bone development within the skull • Describe the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage The axial skeleton begins to form during early embryonic development. However, growth, remodeling, and ossification (bone formation) continue for several decades after birth before the adult skeleton is fully formed. Knowledge of the developmental processes that give rise to the skeleton is important for understanding the abnormalities that may arise in skeletal structures. Development of the Skull During the third week of embryonic development, a rod-like structure called thenotochorddevelops dorsally along the length of the embryo. The tissue overlying the notochord enlarges and forms the neural tube, which will give rise to the brain and spinal cord. By the fourth week, mesoderm tissue located on either side of the notochord thickens and separates into a repeating series of block-like tissue structures, each of which is called asomite. As the somites enlarge, each one will split into several parts. The most medial of these parts is called asclerotome. The sclerotomes consist of an
