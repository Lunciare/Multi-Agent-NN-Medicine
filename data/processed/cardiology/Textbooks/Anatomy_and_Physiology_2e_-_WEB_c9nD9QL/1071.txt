digiti minimi, and theextensor carpi ulnaris. The muscles of thedeep posterior compartment of the forearm(deep posterior extensor compartment of the forearm) originate on the radius and ulna. These include theabductor pollicis longus,extensor pollicis brevis, Access for free at openstax.org 11.5 • Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and Upper Limbs 429 extensor pollicis longus, andextensor indicis(seeFigure 11.27). FIGURE11.27 Muscles That Move the Wrist, Hands, and Forearm The tendons of the forearm muscles attach to the wrist and extend into the hand. Fibrous bands calledretinacula sheath the tendons at the wrist. Theflexor retinaculumextends over the palmar surface of the hand while the extensor retinaculumextends over the dorsal surface of the hand. Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand Theintrinsic muscles of the handboth originate and insert within it (Figure 11.28). These muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing. These muscles are divided into three 430 11 • The Muscular System groups. Thethenarmuscles are on the radial aspect of the palm. Thehypothenarmuscles are on the medial aspect of the palm, and theintermediatemuscles are midpalmar. The thenar muscles include theabductor pollicis brevis,opponens pollicis,flexor pollicis brevis, and the adductor pollicis. These muscles form thethenar eminence, the rounded contour
