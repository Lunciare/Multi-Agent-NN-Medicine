the median sacral artery. The aorta divides at approximately the level of vertebra L4 into a left and a rightcommon iliac arterybut continues as a small vessel, themedian sacral artery, into the sacrum. The common iliac arteries provide blood to the pelvic region and ultimately to the lower limbs. They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level of the lumbar-sacral articulation. Eachinternal iliac arterysends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the pelvis, the external genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region. In females, they also provide blood to the 854 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation uterus and vagina.
