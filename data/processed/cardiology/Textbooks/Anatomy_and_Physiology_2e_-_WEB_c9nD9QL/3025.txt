the opposite direction. Excessive deep and rapid breathing (as in hyperventilation) rids the blood of CO and reduces the level of carbonic 2 acid, making the blood too alkaline. This brief alkalosis can be remedied by rebreathing air that has been exhaled into a paper bag. Rebreathing exhaled air will rapidly bring blood pH down toward normal. 1174 26 • Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Balance FIGURE26.16 Respiratory Regulation of Blood pH The respiratory system can reduce blood pH by removing CO2from the blood. The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels 2 through the lung’s pulmonary capillaries. Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by changing how much CO is exhaled. In fact, doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute, 2 removing “extra” CO , would increase the blood pH by 0.2. This situation is common if you are exercising 2 strenuously over a period of time. To keep up the necessary energy production, you would produce excess CO (and 2 lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold). In order to balance the increased acid production, the respiration rate
