relative to the chimpanzee. Read thisarticle( which the author explores the current understanding of why this happened. According to one hypothesis about the expansion of brain size, what tissue might have been sacrificed so energy was available to grow our larger brain? Based on what you know about that tissue and nervous tissue, why would there be a trade-off between them in terms of energy use? 13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the vessels that supply the CNS with blood • Name the components of the ventricular system and the regions of the brain in which each is located • Explain the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its flow through the ventricles • Explain how a disruption in circulation would result in a stroke The CNS is crucial to the operation of the body, and any compromise in the brain and spinal cord can lead to severe difficulties. The CNS has a privileged blood supply, as suggested by the blood-brain barrier. The function of the tissue in the CNS is crucial to the survival of the organism, so the contents of the blood cannot
