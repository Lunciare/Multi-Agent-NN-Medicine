gradually changes the mixture of the gases that keep the patient unconscious, and when the muscles of respiration begin to function, the tube is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat for a few days. Muscles of the Anterior Neck The muscles of the anterior neck assist in deglutition (swallowing) and speech by controlling the positions of the larynx (voice box), and the hyoid bone, a horseshoe-shaped bone that functions as a solid foundation on which the tongue can move. The muscles of the neck are categorized according to their position relative to the hyoid bone (Figure 11.13).Suprahyoid musclesare superior to it, and theinfrahyoid musclesare located inferiorly. FIGURE11.13 Muscles of the Anterior Neck The anterior muscles of the neck facilitate swallowing and speech. The suprahyoid muscles originate from above the hyoid bone in the chin region. The infrahyoid muscles originate below the hyoid bone in the lower neck. The suprahyoid muscles raise the hyoid bone, the floor of the mouth, and the larynx during deglutition. These include thedigastricmuscle, which has anterior and posterior bellies that
