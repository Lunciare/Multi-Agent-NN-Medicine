of endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases. 17.2 Hormones LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure • Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors • Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3 • Identify several factors that influence a target cell’s response • Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of events is initiated that leads to the target cell’s response. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of physiological processes because of the target cell responses they regulate. These responses contribute to human reproduction, growth and development of body tissues, metabolism, fluid, and electrolyte balance, sleep, and many Access for free at openstax.org 17.2 • Hormones 665 other body functions.
