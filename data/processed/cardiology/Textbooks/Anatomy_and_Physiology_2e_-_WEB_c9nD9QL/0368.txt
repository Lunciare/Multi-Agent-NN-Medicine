Recent research shows that contrary to what was previously assumed, tumors are not disorganized masses of cells, but have their own structures. 154 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization FIGURE4.22 Development of Cancer Note the change in cell size, nucleus size, and organization in the tissue. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn more about tumors. What is a tumor? Cancer treatments vary depending on the disease’s type and stage. Traditional approaches, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, aim to remove or kill rapidly dividing cancer cells, but these strategies have their limitations.
