voltage has been reached. The timing of this coincides exactly with when the Na+flow peaks, so voltage-gated K+channels open just as the voltage-gated Na+channels are being inactivated. As the membrane potential repolarizes and the voltage passes -50 mV again, the channel closes—again, with a little delay. Potassium continues to leave the cell for a short while and the membrane potential becomes more negative, resulting in the hyperpolarizing overshoot. Then the channel closes again and the membrane can return to the resting potential because of the ongoing activity of the non-gated channels and the Na+/K+pump. All of this takes place within approximately 2 milliseconds (Figure 12.24). While an action potential is in progress, another one cannot be initiated. That effect is referred to as therefractory period. There are two phases of the refractory period: theabsolute refractory periodand therelative refractory period. During the absolute phase, another action potential will not start. This is because of the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated Na+channel. Once that channel is back to its resting conformation (less than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but only by a stronger stimulus than the one that initiated the current action potential. This is because of the
