Underneath the thin skin of the nose are its skeletal features (seeFigure 22.3, lower illustration). While the root and bridge of the nose consist of bone, the protruding portion of the nose is composed of cartilage. As a result, when looking at a skull, the nose is missing. Thenasal boneis one of a pair of bones that lies under the root and bridge of the nose. The nasal bone articulates superiorly with the frontal bone and laterally with the maxillary bones. Septal cartilage is flexible hyaline cartilage connected to the nasal bone, forming the dorsum nasi. Thealar cartilage consists of the apex of the nose; it surrounds the naris. The nares open into the nasal cavity, which is separated into left and right sections by the nasal septum (Figure 22.4). Thenasal septumis formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage (the flexible portion you can touch with your fingers) and
