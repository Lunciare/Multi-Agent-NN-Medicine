nuclei), but white matter structures play an important role (such as the corpus callosum). Studying the nervous system requires an understanding of the varied physiology of the nervous system. For example, the hypothalamus plays a very different role than the visual cortex. The neurological exam provides a way to elicit behavior that represents those varied functions. 16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • List the major sections of the neurological exam • Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system • Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting • List the causes of neurological deficits • Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system Theneurological examis a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected by damage or disease. It can be performed in a short time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish neurological function. In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to proper treatment and the extent of recovery that is possible. The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major
