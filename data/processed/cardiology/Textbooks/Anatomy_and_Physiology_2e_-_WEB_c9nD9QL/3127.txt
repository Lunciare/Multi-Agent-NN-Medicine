its absence results in female characteristics. Nondisjunction during meiosis can produce other combinations such as XXY, XYY, and XO which are called chromosomal intersex. Without much chemical prompting, all fertilized eggs would develop into females. To become a male, an individual must be exposed to the cascade of factors initiated by a single gene on the male Y chromosome. This is called the SRY (Sex-determiningRegion of theYchromosome). Because females do not have a Y chromosome, they do not have theSRYgene. Without a functionalSRYgene, an individual will be female. In both male and female embryos, the same group of cells has the potential to develop into either the male or female gonads; this tissue is considered bipotential. TheSRYgene actively recruits other genes that begin to develop the testes, and suppresses genes that are important in female development. As part of thisSRY-prompted cascade, germ cells in the bipotential gonads differentiate into spermatogonia. WithoutSRY, different genes are expressed, oogonia form, and primordial follicles develop in the primitive ovary. Soon after the formation of the testis, the Leydig cells begin to secrete testosterone. Testosterone can influence tissues that are bipotential to become male reproductive structures. For example, with exposure to testosterone, cells that could
