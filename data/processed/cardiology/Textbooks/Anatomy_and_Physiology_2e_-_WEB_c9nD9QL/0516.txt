absorption of calcium and phosphate from digestive tract Parathyroid Stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts; promotes reabsorption hormone of calcium by kidney tubules; indirectly increases calcium absorption by small intestine Calcitonin Inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by bones TABLE6.6 6.7 Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the effect of too much or too little calcium on the body • Explain the process of calcium homeostasis Calcium is not only the most abundant mineral in bone, it is also the most abundant mineral in the human body. Calcium ions are needed not only for bone mineralization but for tooth health, regulation of the heart rate and strength of contraction, blood coagulation, contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle cells, and regulation of nerve impulse conduction. The normal level of calcium in the blood is about 10 mg/dL. When the body cannot maintain this level, a person will experience hypo- or hypercalcemia. Hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium, can have an adverse effect on a number of different body systems including circulation, muscles, nerves,
