and give rise to the ascending the atria aorta and pulmonary trunk right atrioventricular valve (also, tricuspid valve) valve in the cardiovascular system, a specialized valve located between the right atrium and structure located within the heart or vessels that ventricle; consists of three flaps of tissue ensures one-way flow of blood semilunar valves valves located at the base of the ventricle one of the primary pumping chambers of pulmonary trunk and at the base of the aorta the heart located in the lower portion of the heart; septum (plural = septa) walls or partitions that divide the left ventricle is the major pumping chamber on the heart into chambers the lower left side of the heart that ejects blood into septum primum flap of tissue in the fetus that covers the systemic circuit via the aorta and receives blood the foramen ovale within a few seconds after birth from the left atrium; the right ventricle is the major sinoatrial (SA) node known as the pacemaker, a pumping chamber on the lower right side of the specialized clump of myocardial conducting cells heart that ejects blood into the pulmonary circuit via located in the superior portion of the right atrium
