Extrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from outside origins, and the intrinsic tongue muscles insert into the tongue from origins within it. The extrinsic muscles move the whole tongue in different directions, whereas the intrinsic muscles allow the tongue to change its shape (such as, curling the tongue in a loop or flattening it). The extrinsic muscles all include the word root glossus (glossus = “tongue”), and the muscle names are derived from where the muscle originates. Thegenioglossus(genio = “chin”) originates on the mandible and allows the tongue to move downward and forward. Thestyloglossusoriginates on the styloid bone, and allows upward and backward motion. Thepalatoglossusoriginates on the soft palate to elevate the back of the tongue, and the hyoglossusoriginates on the hyoid bone to move the tongue downward and flatten it. 410 11 • The Muscular System Everyday Connection Anesthesia and the Tongue Muscles Before surgery, a patient must be made ready for
