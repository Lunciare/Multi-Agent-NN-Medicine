carpi adductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor radialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the magnus adduct the thigh and medially rotate it. The flexor digitorum superficialis. The deep anterior pectineus muscle adducts and flexes the femur at the compartment produces flexion as well. These are the hip. flexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum profundus. The rest of the compartments produce The thigh muscles that move the femur, tibia, and extension. The extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor fibula are divided into medial, anterior, and posterior carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti compartments. The medial compartment includes the minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris are the muscles adductors, pectineus, and the gracilis. The anterior found in the superficial posterior compartment. The compartment comprises the quadriceps femoris, deep posterior compartment includes the abductor quadriceps tendon, patellar ligament, and the longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis sartorius. The quadriceps femoris is made of four longus, and the extensor indicis. muscles: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the vastus medius, and the vastus intermedius, which Finally, the intrinsic muscles of the hands allow our together extend the knee. The posterior compartment fingers to make precise movements, such as typing and of the thigh
