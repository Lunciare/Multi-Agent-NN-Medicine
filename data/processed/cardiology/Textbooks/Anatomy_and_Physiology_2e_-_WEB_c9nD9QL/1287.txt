skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons. The motor neuron that causes contraction of the big toe, for example, is located in the sacral spinal cord. The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that muscle may be a meter in length. The neuronal cell body that maintains that long fiber must be quite large, possibly several hundred micrometers in diameter, making it one of the largest cells in the body. 510 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System FIGURE13.14 Cross-section of Spinal Cord The cross-section of a thoracic spinal cord segment shows the posterior, anterior, and lateral horns of gray matter, as well as the posterior, anterior, and lateral columns of white matter. LM × 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012) White Columns Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending tractsof nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tractscarry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter. Between
