are produced by thelacrimal gland, located just inside the orbit, superior and lateral to the eyeball. Tears produced by this gland flow through thelacrimal ductto the medial corner of the eye, where the tears flow over the conjunctiva, washing away foreign particles.

The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull. Movement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of sixextraocular musclesthat originate from the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14.14). Four of the muscles are arranged at the cardinal points around the eye and are named for those locations. They are thesuperior rectus, medial rectus,inferior rectus, andlateral rectus. When each of these muscles contract, the eye moves toward the contracting muscle. For example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up. Thesuperior obliqueoriginates at the posterior orbit, near the origin of the four rectus muscles. However, the tendon of the oblique muscles threads through a pulley-like piece of cartilage
