to 2 reflect how each glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules. • In the ETC, about three ATP are produced for every oxidized NADH. However, only about two ATP are produced for every oxidized FADH . The electrons from FADH produce less ATP, because they start at a lower point in the 2 2 ETC (Complex II) compared to the electrons from NADH (Complex I) (seeFigure 24.8). Therefore, for every glucose molecule that enters aerobic respiration, a net total of 36 ATPs are produced (Figure 24.9). 1072 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition FIGURE24.9 Carbohydrate Metabolism Carbohydrate metabolism involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Gluconeogenesis Gluconeogenesisis the synthesis of new glucose molecules from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, or the amino acids alanine or glutamine. This process takes place primarily in the liver during periods of low glucose, that is, under conditions of fasting, starvation, and low carbohydrate diets. So, the question can be raised as to why the body would create something it has just spent a fair amount of effort to break down? Certain key organs, including the brain, can use only glucose as an energy source; therefore, it is essential that the body maintain a minimum
