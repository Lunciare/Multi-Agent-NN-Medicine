Anatomy and Physiology

of Organization atoms, the basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there. 2.1 Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the relationships between matter, mass, elements, compounds, atoms, and subatomic particles • Distinguish between atomic number and mass number • Identify the key distinction between isotopes of the same element • Explain how electrons occupy electron shells and their contribution to an atom’s relative stability The substance of the universe—from a grain of sand to a star—is calledmatter. Scientists define matter as anything that occupies space and has mass. An object’s mass and its weight are related concepts, but not quite the same. An object’s mass is the amount of matter contained in the object, and the object’s mass is the same whether that object is on Earth or in the zero-gravity environment of outer space. An object’s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as affected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object’s mass its
