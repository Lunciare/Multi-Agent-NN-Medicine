Anatomy and Physiology

the foot consist of two groups. Thedorsal group includes only one muscle, theextensor digitorum brevis. The second group is theplantar group, which consists of four layers, starting with the most superficial. FIGURE11.34 Intrinsic Muscles of the Foot The muscles along the dorsal side of the foot (a) generally extend the toes while the muscles of the plantar side of the foot (b, c, d) generally flex the toes. The plantar muscles exist in three layers, providing the foot the strength to counterbalance the weight of the body. In this diagram, these three layers are shown from a plantar view beginning with the bottom-most layer just under the plantar skin of the foot (b) and ending with the top-most layer (d) located just inferior to the foot and toe bones. 440 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.35 Intrinsic Muscles in the Foot Access for free at openstax.org 11 • Key Terms 441 Key Terms abduct move away from midline in the sagittal plane located on both sides of the tendon abductor moves the bone away from the midline brachialis muscle deep to the biceps brachii that abductor digiti minimi muscle that abducts the little provides power in flexing the forearm. finger
