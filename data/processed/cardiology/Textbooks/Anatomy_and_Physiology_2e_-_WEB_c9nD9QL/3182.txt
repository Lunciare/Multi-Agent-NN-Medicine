Anatomy and Physiology

fetotoxic substances. Alcohol consumption by pregnant people, for example, can result in a range of abnormalities referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These include organ and facial malformations, as well as cognitive and behavioral disorders. Functions of the Placenta Nutrition and digestion Respiration Endocrine function • Mediates diffusion of maternal glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals • Secretes several hormones, including hCG, • Stores nutrients during • Mediates maternal-to- estrogens, and progesterone, to maintain early pregnancy to fetal oxygen transport the pregnancy and stimulate maternal and accommodate increased and fetal-to-maternal fetal development fetal demand later in carbon dioxide transport • Mediates the transmission of maternal pregnancy hormones into fetal blood and vice versa • Excretes and filters fetal nitrogenous wastes into maternal blood TABLE28.1 FIGURE28.12 Placenta This post-expulsion placenta and umbilical cord (white) are viewed from the fetal side. Organogenesis Following gastrulation, rudiments of the central nervous system develop from the ectoderm in the process of neurulation(Figure 28.13). Specialized neuroectodermal tissues along the length of the embryo thicken into the neural plate. During the fourth week, tissues on either side of the plate fold upward into aneural fold. The two folds converge to form theneural tube.
