the last of the myosin heads and shrinks the H zone, which is normally composed of myosin tails. Eventually, there is nowhere else for the thin filaments to go and the amount of tension is diminished. If the muscle is stretched to the point where thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges can be formed, and no tension is produced in that sarcomere. This amount of stretching does not usually occur, as accessory proteins and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.

The Frequency of Motor Neuron Stimulation A single action potential from a motor neuron will produce a single contraction in the muscle fibers of its motor unit. This isolated contraction is called atwitch. A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds, depending on the muscle type. The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by amyogram, an instrument that measures the amount of tension produced over time (Figure 10.15). Each twitch undergoes three
