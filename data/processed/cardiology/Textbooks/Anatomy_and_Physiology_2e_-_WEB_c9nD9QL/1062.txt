between the pubic symphysis (anteriorly), the coccyx (posteriorly), and the ischial tuberosities (laterally), lying just inferior to the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani and coccygeus). Divided transversely into triangles, the anterior is theurogenital triangle, which includes the external genitals. The posterior is theanal triangle, which contains the anus (Figure 11.20). The perineum is also divided into superficial and deep layers with some of the muscles common to people of any sex (Figure 11.21). Females also have the compressor urethraeand thesphincter urethrovaginalis, which function to close the vagina. In males, there is the deep transverse perinealmuscle that plays a role in ejaculation.
