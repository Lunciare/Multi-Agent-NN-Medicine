separated by very thin bony walls. Each of these spaces is called an ethmoid air cell. These are located on both sides of the ethmoid bone, between the upper nasal cavity and medial Access for free at openstax.org 7.2 • The Skull 247 orbit, just behind the superior nasal conchae. FIGURE7.18 Paranasal Sinuses The paranasal sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces named for the skull bone that each occupies. The most anterior is the frontal sinus, located in the frontal bone above the eyebrows. The largest are the maxillary sinuses, located in the right and left maxillary bones below the orbits. The most posterior is the sphenoid sinus, located in the body of the sphenoid bone, under the sella turcica. The ethmoid air cells are multiple small spaces located in the right and left sides of the ethmoid bone, between the medial wall of the orbit and lateral wall of the upper nasal cavity. Hyoid Bone The hyoid bone is an independent bone that does not contact any other bone and thus is not part of the skull (Figure 7.19). It is a small U-shaped bone located in the upper neck near the level of the inferior mandible, with the tips
