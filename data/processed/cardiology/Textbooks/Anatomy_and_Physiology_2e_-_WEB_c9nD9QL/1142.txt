Anatomy and Physiology

is also referred to as theinitial segment. Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin acts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between myelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called anode of Ranvierand is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is wrapped in myelin, is referred to as anaxon segment. At the end of the axon is theaxon terminal, where there are usually several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an enlargement called asynaptic end bulb. These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the synapse. Types of Neurons There are many neurons in the nervous system—a number in the trillions. And there are many different types of neurons. They can be classified by many different criteria. The first way to classify them is by the number of processes attached to the cell body. Using the standard model of
