acetyl chymotrypsin pancreatic enzyme that digests protein CoA is created during fatty acid oxidation chymotrypsinogen proenzyme that is activated by Krebs cycle also called the citric acid cycle or the trypsin into chymotrypsin tricarboxylic acid cycle, converts pyruvate into CO 2 citric acid cycle also called the Krebs cycle or the and high-energy FADH , NADH, and ATP molecules 2 tricarboxylic acid cycle; converts pyruvate into CO lipogenesis synthesis of lipids that occurs in the liver 2 and high-energy FADH , NADH, and ATP molecules or adipose tissues 2 conduction transfer of heat through physical contact lipolysis breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and convection transfer of heat between the skin and air fatty acids or water metabolic rate amount of energy consumed minus 1102 24 • Chapter Review the amount of energy expended by the body reduction gaining of an electron metabolism sum of all catabolic and anabolic salivary amylase digestive enzyme that is found in reactions that take place in the body the saliva and begins the digestion of carbohydrates minerals inorganic compounds required by the body in the mouth to ensure proper function of the body secretin hormone released in the small intestine to monoglyceride molecules lipid consisting
