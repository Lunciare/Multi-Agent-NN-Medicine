Anatomy and Physiology

cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2phases. After the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G phase. TheG phaseis a second gap phase, during 2 2 which the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G , S, and G phases, 1 2 cells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many days. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these 2 phases, theG phaseis a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting 0 (a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G . 0 The Structure of Chromosomes Billions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase, the amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each cell actually containstwocopies of each chromosome. Each copy of the
