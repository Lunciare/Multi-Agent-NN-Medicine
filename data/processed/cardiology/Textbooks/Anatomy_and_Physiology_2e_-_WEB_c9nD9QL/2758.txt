inherent metabolic rate is a function of the 1058 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition proteins and enzymes derived from their genetic background. Thus, your genes play a big role in your metabolism. Nonetheless, each person’s body engages in the same overall metabolic processes. 24.1 Overview of Metabolic Reactions LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the process by which polymers are broken down into monomers • Describe the process by which monomers are combined into polymers • Discuss the role of ATP in metabolism • Explain oxidation-reduction reactions • Describe the hormones that regulate anabolic and catabolic reactions Metabolic processes are constantly taking place in the body.Metabolismis the sum of all of the chemical reactions that are involved in catabolism and anabolism. The reactions governing the breakdown of food to obtain energy are called catabolic reactions. Conversely, anabolic reactions use the energy produced by catabolic reactions to synthesize larger molecules from smaller ones, such as when the body forms proteins by stringing together amino acids. Both sets of reactions are critical to maintaining life. Because catabolic reactions produce energy and anabolic reactions use energy, ideally, energy usage would balance the energy produced.
