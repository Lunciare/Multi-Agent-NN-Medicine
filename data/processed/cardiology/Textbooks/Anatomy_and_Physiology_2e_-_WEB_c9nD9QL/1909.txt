The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens. Classification of Leukocytes When scientists first began to observe stained blood slides, it quickly became evident that leukocytes could be divided into two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules: • Granular leukocytescontain abundant granules within the cytoplasm. They include neutrophils, eosinophils, 730 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood and basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells inFigure 18.4). • While granules are not totally lacking inagranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious. Agranular leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise from the lymphoid stem cell line. Granular Leukocytes We will consider the granular leukocytes in order from most common to least common. All of these are produced in the red bone marrow and have a short lifespan of hours to days. They typically have a lobed nucleus and are classified according to which type of stain best highlights their granules (Figure 18.11). FIGURE18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to five lobes. An eosinophil’s granules are slightly larger and stain
