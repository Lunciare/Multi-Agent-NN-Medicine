arm at the shoulder joint. Deep to the biceps brachii, thebrachialisprovides additional power in flexing the forearm. Finally, thebrachioradialiscan flex the forearm quickly or help lift a load slowly. These muscles and their associated blood vessels and nerves form theanterior compartment of the arm(anterior flexor compartment of the arm) (Figure 11.25andFigure 11.26).

The muscles originating in the forearm move the wrists, hands, and fingers. 428 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.26 Muscles That Move the Forearm Muscles That Move the Wrist, Hand, and Fingers Wrist, hand, and finger movements are facilitated by two groups of muscles. The forearm is the origin of the extrinsic muscles of the hand. The palm is the origin of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Muscles of the Arm That Move the Wrists, Hands, and Fingers The muscles in theanterior compartment of the forearm(anterior flexor compartment of the forearm) originate on the humerus and insert onto different parts of the hand. These make up the bulk of the forearm.
