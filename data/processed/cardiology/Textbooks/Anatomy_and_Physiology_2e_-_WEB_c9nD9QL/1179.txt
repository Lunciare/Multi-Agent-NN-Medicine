two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V. The change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. In fact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be released under the correct conditions. A battery in your remote has stored a charge that is “released” when you push a button.

INTERACTIVE LINK What happens across the membrane of an electrically active cell is a dynamic process that is hard to visualize with static images or through text descriptions. View thisanimation( learn more about this process. What is the difference between the driving force for Na+and K+? And what is similar about the movement of these two ions? The question is, now, what initiates the action potential? The description above conveniently glosses over that point. But it is vital
