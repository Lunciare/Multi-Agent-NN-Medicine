other tissues, water and small molecules are filtered through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid. In the brain, CSF is produced in special structures to perfuse through the nervous tissue of the CNS and is continuous with the interstitial fluid. Specifically, CSF circulates to remove metabolic wastes from the interstitial fluids of nervous tissues and return them to the blood stream. Theventriclesare the open spaces within the brain where CSF circulates. In some of these spaces, CSF is produced by filtering of the blood that is performed by a specialized membrane known as a choroid plexus. The CSF circulates through all of the ventricles to eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be reabsorbed into the blood. The Ventricles There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube, thecentral canal. The first two are named thelateral ventriclesand are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are connected to thethird ventricleby two openings called theinterventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into thecerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain. The aqueduct opens into thefourth
