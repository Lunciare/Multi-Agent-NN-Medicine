Anatomy and Physiology

is clearly effective in treating patients experiencing a MI, but overall does not increase longevity. Nor does it seem advisable in patients with stable although diminished cardiac capacity since frequently loss of mental acuity occurs following the procedure. Long-term changes to behavior, emphasizing diet and exercise plus a medicine regime tailored to lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol and lipids, and reduce clotting are equally as effective. 19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structure of cardiac muscle • Identify and describe the components of the conducting system that distributes electrical impulses through the heart • Compare the effect of ion movement on membrane potential of cardiac conductive and contractile cells • Relate characteristics of an electrocardiogram to events in the cardiac cycle • Identify blocks that can interrupt the cardiac cycle Recall that cardiac muscle shares a few characteristics with both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, but it has some unique properties of its own. Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical potential at a fixed rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contractile
