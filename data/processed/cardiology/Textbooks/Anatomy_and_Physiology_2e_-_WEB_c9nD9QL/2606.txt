for calcium absorption Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and other lymphatic tissue defend against entry of Lymphatic pathogens; lacteals absorb lipids; and lymphatic vessels transport lipids to bloodstream Muscular Skeletal muscles support and protect abdominal organs Sensory and motor neurons help regulate secretions and muscle contractions in the digestive Nervous tract Respiratory Respiratory organs provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide Skeletal Bones help protect and support digestive organs Kidneys convert vitamin D into its active form, allowing calcium absorption in the small Urinary intestine TABLE23.1 Digestive System Organs The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories. The first group is the organs that make up the alimentary canal. Accessory digestive organs comprise the second group and are critical for orchestrating the breakdown of food and the assimilation of its nutrients into the body. Accessory digestive organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. Alimentary Canal Organs Also called the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or gut, thealimentary canal(aliment- = “to nourish”) is a one-way tube about 7.62 meters (25 feet) in length during life and closer to 10.67 meters (35 feet) in length when measured after death, once smooth muscle
