renal enzyme renin converts wastes. H+and HCO –are secreted or reabsorbed as 3 angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. The lung enzyme, needed to maintain acid–base balance. Movement of ACE, converts angiotensin I into active angiotensin II. water from the glomerulus is primarily due to pressure, Access for free at openstax.org 25 • Review Questions 1151 Angiotensin II is an active vasoconstrictor that water. Diuretics increase urine volume. Mechanisms for increases blood pressure. Angiotensin II also controlling Na+concentration in the blood include the stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and ADH. When cortex, causing the collecting duct to retain Na+, which Na+is retained, K+is excreted; when Na+is lost, K+is promotes water retention and a longer-term rise in retained. When circulating Ca++decreases, PTH blood pressure. ADH promotes water recovery by the stimulates the reabsorption of Ca++and inhibits collecting ducts by stimulating the insertion of reabsorption of . pH is regulated through aquaporin water channels into cell membranes. buffers, expiration of CO , and excretion of acid or base 2 Endothelins are elevated in cases of diabetic kidney by the kidneys. The breakdown of amino acids disease, increasing Na+retention and decreasing GFR. produces ammonia. Most ammonia is converted into Natriuretic hormones, released
