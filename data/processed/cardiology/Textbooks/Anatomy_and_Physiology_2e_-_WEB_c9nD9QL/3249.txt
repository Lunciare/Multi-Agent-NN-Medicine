of the male offspring would be affected (Figure 28.29). With X-linked recessive diseases, males either have the disease or are genotypically normal—they cannot be carriers. Females, however, can be genotypically normal, a carrier who is phenotypically normal, or affected with the disease. A female can inherit the gene for an X-linked recessive illness when the female parent is a carrier or Access for free at openstax.org 28.7 • Patterns of Inheritance 1263 affected, or the male parent is affected. Female offspring will be affected by the disease only if they inherit an X- linked recessive gene from both parents. As you can imagine, X-linked recessive disorders affect many more males than females. For example, color blindness affects at least 1 in 20 males, but only about 1 in 400 females. FIGURE28.29 X-Linked Recessive Inheritance Given two parents in which the male is normal and the female is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder, a male offspring would have a 50 percent probability of being affected with the disorder, whereas female offspring would either be carriers or entirely unaffected.
