(Figure 20.26andFigure 20.27). One of these branches is theanterior cerebral arterythat supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the middle cerebral artery, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of CVAs. Theophthalmic artery, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes. The right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called theanterior communicating artery. The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior portion of the arterial circle. The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a rightposterior communicating arterythat branches from theposterior cerebral artery, which arises from the basilar artery. It provides blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem. Thebasilar arteryis an anastomosis that begins at the junction of the two vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem. It flows into the posterior cerebral arteries.Table 20.6summarizes the aortic arch branches, including the major branches supplying the brain.
