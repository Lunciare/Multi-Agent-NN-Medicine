structures within lung tissue. LM × 178. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012) The alveolar wall consists of three major cell types: type I alveolar cells, type II alveolar cells, and alveolar macrophages. Atype I alveolar cellis a squamous epithelial cell of the alveoli, which constitute up to 97 percent of the alveolar surface area. These cells are about 25 nm thick and are highly permeable to gases. Atype II alveolar cellis interspersed among the type I cells and secretespulmonary surfactant, a substance composed of phospholipids and proteins that reduces the surface tension of the alveoli. Roaming around the alveolar wall is the alveolar macrophage, a phagocytic cell of the immune system that removes debris and pathogens that have reached the alveoli. The simple squamous epithelium formed by type I alveolar cells is attached to a thin, elastic basement membrane. This epithelium is extremely thin and borders the endothelial membrane of capillaries. Taken together, the alveoli and capillary membranes form arespiratory membranethat is approximately 0.5 μm (micrometers) thick. The respiratory membrane allows gases to cross by simple diffusion, allowing oxygen to be picked up by the blood for transport and CO to be
