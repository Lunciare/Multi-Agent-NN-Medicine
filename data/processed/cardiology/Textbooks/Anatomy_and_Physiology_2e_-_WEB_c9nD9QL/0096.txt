its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements form the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon- containing compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its valence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen” 2 reflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”). Thus, hydrogen is the “water maker.” Access for free at openstax.org 2.2 • Chemical Bonds 47 2.2 Chemical Bonds LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the relationship between molecules and compounds • Distinguish between ions, cations, and anions • Identify the key difference between ionic and covalent bonds • Distinguish between nonpolar and polar covalent bonds • Explain how water molecules link via hydrogen bonds Atoms separated by a great distance cannot link; rather, they must come close enough for the electrons in their valence shells to interact. But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged electrons in their valence
