and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity (Figure 1.17). 28 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body FIGURE1.17 Serous Membrane Serous membrane lines the pericardial cavity and reflects back to cover the heart—much the same way that an underinflated balloon would form two layers surrounding a fist. There are three serous cavities and their associated membranes. Thepleurais the serous membrane that encloses the pleural cavity; the pleural cavity surrounds the lungs. Thepericardiumis the serous membrane that encloses the pericardial cavity; the pericardial cavity surrounds the heart. Theperitoneumis the serous membrane that encloses the peritoneal cavity; the peritoneal cavity surrounds several organs in the abdominopelvic cavity. The serous membranes form fluid-filled sacs, or cavities, that are meant to cushion and reduce friction on internal organs when they move, such as when the lungs inflate or the heart beats. Both the parietal and visceral serosa secrete the thin, slippery serous fluid located within the serous cavities. The pleural cavity reduces friction between the lungs and the body wall. Likewise, the pericardial cavity reduces friction between the heart and the wall of the pericardium. The peritoneal cavity reduces friction between the abdominal and pelvic organs and the
