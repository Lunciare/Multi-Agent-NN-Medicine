Neurons from brain-stem nuclei, or from the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord, project to terminal ganglia near or within the various organs of the body. Axons from these ganglionic neurons then project the short distance to those target effectors. Chemical Signaling in the Autonomic Nervous System Where an autonomic neuron connects with a target, there is a synapse. The electrical signal of the action potential Access for free at openstax.org 15.1 • Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System 597 causes the release of a signaling molecule, which will bind to receptor proteins on the target cell. Synapses of the autonomic system are classified as eithercholinergic, meaning thatacetylcholine (ACh)is released, oradrenergic, meaning thatnorepinephrineis released. The terms cholinergic and adrenergic refer not only to the signaling molecule that is released but also to the class of receptors that each binds. The cholinergic system includes two classes of receptor: thenicotinic receptorand themuscarinic receptor. Both receptor types bind to ACh and cause changes in the target cell. The nicotinic receptor is aligand-gated cation channeland the muscarinic receptor is aG protein–coupled receptor. The receptors are named for, and differentiated by, other molecules that bind to them. Whereas nicotine will bind to the nicotinic
