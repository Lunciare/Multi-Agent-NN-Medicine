The process of electromyography and MRI tests indicated converting electrical signals to chemical signals and deficiencies in the spinal cord and cerebellum, both back requires subtle changes that can result in of which are responsible for controlling coordinated transient increases or decreases in membrane movements. To what functional division of the voltage. To cause a lasting change in the target cell, nervous system would these structures belong? multiple signals are usually added together, or 3. The neurons are dynamic cells with the ability to summated. Does spatial summation have to happen make a vast number of connections and to respond all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the incredibly quickly to stimuli and to initiate postsynaptic neuron at slightly different times? movements based on those stimuli. They are the Explain your answer. focus of intense research as failures in physiology 8. Watch thisvideo( can lead to devastating illnesses. Why are neurons to learn about the release of a neurotransmitter. only found in animals? Why wouldn’t they be The action
