Testicular Reproductive System The ovaries produce oocytes, the female gametes, in a Gametes are the reproductive cells that combine to process called oogenesis. As with spermatogenesis, form offspring. Organs called gonads produce the meiosis produces the haploid gamete (in this case, an gametes, along with the hormones that regulate ovum); however, it is completed only in an oocyte that human reproduction. The male gametes are called has been penetrated by a sperm. In the ovary, an sperm. Spermatogenesis, the production of sperm, oocyte surrounded by supporting cells is called a occurs within the seminiferous tubules that make up follicle. In folliculogenesis, primordial follicles develop most of the testis. The scrotum is the muscular sac that into primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles. Early holds the testes outside of the body cavity. tertiary follicles with their fluid-filled antrum will be stimulated by
