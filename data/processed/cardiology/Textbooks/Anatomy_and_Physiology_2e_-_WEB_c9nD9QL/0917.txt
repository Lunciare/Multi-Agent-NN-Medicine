particularly of the limbs. These are skeletal muscles, so-named because most of them move the skeleton. But there are two other types of muscle in the body, with distinctly different jobs. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is concerned with pumping blood through the circulatory system. Smooth muscle is concerned with various involuntary movements, such as having one’s hair stand on end when cold or frightened, or moving food through the digestive system. This chapter will examine the structure and function of these three types of muscles. 10.1 Overview of Muscle Tissues LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the different types of muscle • Explain contractibility and extensibility Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body, and the body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (Figure 10.2). All three muscle tissues have some properties in common; they all exhibit a quality calledexcitabilityas their plasma membranes can change their electrical states 358 10 • Muscle Tissue (from polarized to depolarized) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane.
