Anatomy and Physiology

the average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, this is the time period used to identify the timing of events in the cycle. However, the length of the menstrual cycle varies, and even in the same person from one cycle to the next, typically from 21 to 32 days. Just as the hormones produced by the granulosa and theca cells of the ovary “drive” the follicular and luteal phases of the ovarian cycle, they also control the three distinct phases of the menstrual cycle. These are the menses phase, the proliferative phase, and the secretory phase. Menses Phase Themenses phaseof the menstrual cycle is the phase during which the lining is shed; that is, the days that the person menstruates. Although it averages approximately five days, the menses phase can last from 2 to 7 days, or longer. As shown inFigure 27.15, the menses phase occurs during the early days of the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, when progesterone, FSH, and LH levels are low. Recall that progesterone concentrations decline as a result of the degradation of the corpus luteum, marking the end of the luteal phase. This decline in progesterone triggers the shedding of the stratum
