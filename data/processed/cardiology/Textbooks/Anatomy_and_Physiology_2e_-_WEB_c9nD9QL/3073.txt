organ allows it to penetrate into the vagina and deposit semen into the female reproductive tract. FIGURE27.7 Cross-Sectional Anatomy of the Penis Three columns of erectile tissue make up most of the volume of the penis. The shaft of the penis surrounds the urethra (Figure 27.7). The shaft is composed of three column-like chambers of erectile tissue that span the length of the shaft. Each of the two larger lateral chambers is called acorpus cavernosum(plural = corpora cavernosa). Together, these make up the bulk of the penis. Thecorpus spongiosum, which can be felt as a raised ridge on the erect penis, is a smaller chamber that surrounds the spongy, or penile, urethra. The end of the penis, called theglans penis, has a high concentration of nerve endings, resulting in very sensitive skin that influences the likelihood of ejaculation (seeFigure 27.2). The skin from the shaft extends down 1194 27 • The Reproductive System over the glans and forms a collar called theprepuce(or foreskin). The foreskin also contains a dense concentration of nerve endings, and both lubricate and protect the sensitive skin of the glans penis. A surgical procedure called circumcision, often performed for religious or social reasons, removes the prepuce,
