resolved, PID can leave scar tissue in the tubes, leading to infertility. INTERACTIVE LINK Interactive Link Watch this series ofvideos( look at the movement of the oocyte through the ovary. The cilia in the uterine tube promote movement of the oocyte. What would likely occur if the cilia were paralyzed at the time of ovulation? The Uterus and Cervix Theuterusis the muscular organ that nourishes and supports the growing embryo (seeFigure 27.14). Its average size is approximately 5 cm wide by 7 cm long (approximately 2 in by 3 in) when a female is not pregnant. It has three sections. The portion of the uterus superior to the opening of the uterine tubes is called thefundus. The middle section of the uterus is called thebody of uterus(or corpus).

The cervix produces mucus secretions that become thin and stringy under the influence of high systemic plasma estrogen concentrations, and these secretions can facilitate sperm movement through the reproductive tract. Several ligaments maintain the position of the uterus within the abdominopelvic cavity. The broad ligament is a fold of peritoneum that serves as a primary support for the uterus,
