aging. More severe problems are not necessarily associated with the aging process and may be symptoms of underlying illness.

The incidence of heart diseases, respiratory syndromes, and type 2 diabetes increases with age, though these are not necessarily age- dependent effects. Wound healing is slower in the elderly, accompanied by a higher frequency of infection as the capacity of the immune system to fend off pathogen declines. Aging is also apparent at the cellular level because all cells experience changes with aging. Telomeres, regions of the chromosomes necessary for cell division, shorten each time cells divide. As they do, cells are less able to divide and regenerate. Because of alterations in cell membranes, transport of oxygen and nutrients into the cell and removal of carbon dioxide and waste products from the cell are not as efficient in the elderly. Cells may begin to function abnormally, which may lead to diseases associated with aging, including arthritis, memory issues, and some cancers. The progressive impact of aging on the body varies considerably among individuals,
