System Disorders of the... Endocrine System: Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and Hyperthyroidism As discussed above, dietary iodine is required for the synthesis of T and T . But for much of the world’s 3 4 population, foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used. Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high levels because they concentrate iodine from seawater, but many people in landlocked regions lack access to seafood. Thus, the primary source of dietary iodine in many countries is iodized salt. Fortification of salt with iodine began in the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the world’s poorest nations continue today. Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T and T , leading to a variety of severe 3 4 disorders. When T and T cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this 3 4 hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid
