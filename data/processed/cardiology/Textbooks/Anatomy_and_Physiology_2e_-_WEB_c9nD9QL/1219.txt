voltage-gated K+channels signal passes from neuron to the next, initiating a are not closed new electrical signal in the target cell repolarization return of the membrane potential to synaptic cleft small gap between cells in a chemical its normally negative voltage at the end of the action synapse where neurotransmitter diffuses from the potential presynaptic element to the postsynaptic element resistance property of an axon that relates to the synaptic end bulb swelling at the end of an axon ability of particles to diffuse through the cytoplasm; where neurotransmitter molecules are released this is inversely proportional to the fiber diameter onto a target cell across a synapse response nervous system function that causes a temporal summation combination of graded target tissue (muscle or gland) to produce an event potentials at the same location on a neuron as a consequence to stimuli resulting in a strong signal from one input resting membrane potential the difference in voltage thalamus region of the central nervous system that measured across a cell membrane under steady- acts as a relay for sensory pathways state conditions, typically -70 mV thermoreceptor type of sensory receptor capable of saltatory conduction quick propagation of the action transducing temperature stimuli
