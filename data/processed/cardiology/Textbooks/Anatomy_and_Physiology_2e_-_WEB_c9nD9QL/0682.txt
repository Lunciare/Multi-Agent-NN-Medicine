forearm deviates laterally by 5–15 degrees from the line of the arm. This deviation is called the carrying angle. It allows the forearm and hand to swing freely or to carry an object without hitting the hip. The carrying angle is larger in females to accommodate their wider pelvis. Radius The radius runs parallel to the ulna, on the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm (seeFigure 8.6). Thehead of the radiusis a disc-shaped structure that forms the proximal end. The small depression on the surface of the head articulates with the capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, whereas the smooth, outer margin of the head articulates with the radial notch of the ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. Theneck of the radiusis the narrowed region immediately below the expanded head. Inferior to this point on the medial side is theradial tuberosity, an oval-shaped, bony protuberance that serves as a muscle attachment point. Theshaft of the radiusis slightly curved and has a small ridge along its medial side. This ridge forms theinterosseous border of the radius, which, like the similar border of the ulna, is the line of attachment for the interosseous membrane that unites the two
