possess a mixture of each fiber type. The predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the muscle. 10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe hypertrophy and atrophy • Explain how resistance exercise builds muscle • Explain how performance-enhancing substances affect muscle Physical training alters the appearance of skeletal muscles and can produce changes in muscle performance. Conversely, a lack of use can result in decreased performance and muscle appearance. Although muscle cells can change in size, new cells are not formed when muscles grow. Instead, structural proteins are added to muscle fibers in a process calledhypertrophy, so cell diameter increases. The reverse, when structural proteins are lost and muscle mass decreases, is calledatrophy. Age-related muscle atrophy is calledsarcopenia. Cellular components of muscles can also undergo changes in response to changes in muscle use. Endurance Exercise Slow fibers are predominantly used in endurance exercises that require little force but involve numerous repetitions. The aerobic metabolism used by slow-twitch fibers allows them to maintain contractions over long periods. Endurance training modifies these slow fibers to make them even more efficient by producing more
