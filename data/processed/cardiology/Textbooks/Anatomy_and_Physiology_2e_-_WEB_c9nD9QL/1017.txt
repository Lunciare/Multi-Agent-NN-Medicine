of voltage-gated contractions being the same duration as skeletal sodium channels and voltage-gated potassium muscle contractions? channels? 45. How are cardiac muscle cells similar to and 35. How would muscle contractions be affected if different from skeletal muscle cells? skeletal muscle fibers did not have T-tubules? 46. Why can smooth muscles contract over a wider 36. What causes the striated appearance of skeletal range of resting lengths than skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue? muscle? 37. How would muscle contractions be affected if ATP 47. Describe the differences between single-unit was completely depleted in a muscle fiber? smooth muscle and multiunit smooth muscle. 38. Why does a motor unit of the eye have few muscle 48. Why is muscle that has sustained significant fibers compared to a motor unit of the leg? damage unable to produce the same amount of 39. What factors contribute to the amount of tension power as it could before being damaged? produced in an individual muscle fiber? 49. Which muscle type(s) (skeletal, smooth, or 40. Why do muscle cells use creatine phosphate cardiac) can regenerate new muscle cells/fibers? instead of glycolysis to supply ATP for the first few Explain your answer. seconds of muscle contraction?
