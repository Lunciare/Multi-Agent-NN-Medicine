response to a T cell-dependent antigen, the B and T cells must come close together. To become fully activated, the B cell must receive two signals from the native antigen and the T cell’s cytokines. 21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the development of immunological competence • Describe the mucosal immune response • Discuss immune responses against bacterial, viral, fungal, and animal pathogens • Describe different ways pathogens evade immune responses Now that you understand the development of mature, naïve B cells and T cells, and some of their major functions, how do all of these various cells, proteins, and cytokines come together to actually resolve an infection? Ideally, the immune response will rid the body of a pathogen entirely. The adaptive immune response, with its rapid clonal expansion, is well suited to this purpose. Think of a primary infection as a race between the pathogen and the immune system. The pathogen bypasses barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host’s body. During the first 4 to 5 days, the innate immune response will partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth. As the adaptive immune
