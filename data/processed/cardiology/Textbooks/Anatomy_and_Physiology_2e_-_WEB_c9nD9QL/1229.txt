Anatomy and Physiology

a synapse is called gated channels will result in further depolarization an inhibitory PSP. followed by repolarization of the membrane. A slight Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which overshoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the can either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical action potential. While an action potential is in synapses are far more common. At a chemical synapse, progress, another cannot be generated under the same neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic conditions. While the voltage-gated Na+channel is element and diffuses across the synaptic cleft. The inactivated, absolutely no action potentials can be neurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and generated. Once that channel has returned to its causes a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the resting state, a new action potential is possible, but it PSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is overcome the K+leaving the cell. limited in time. The action potential travels down the axon as voltage- The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based gated ion channels are opened by the spreading on the neurotransmitter system produced by that depolarization.
