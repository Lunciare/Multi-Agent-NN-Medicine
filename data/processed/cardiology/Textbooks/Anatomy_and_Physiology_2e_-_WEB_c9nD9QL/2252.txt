artery exits the thorax into the axillary region, it is renamed theaxillary artery. Although it does branch and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31). Thebrachial arterysupplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply blood to the region of the elbow. As the brachial artery approaches the coronoid fossa, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium. Theradial arteryandulnar arteryparallel their namesake bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region. At this level, they fuse to form the superficial and deeppalmar archesthat supply blood to the hand, as well as thedigital arteriesthat supply blood to the digits.Figure 20.32shows the distribution of systemic arteries from the heart into the upper limb.Table 20.9summarizes the arteries serving the upper limbs.
