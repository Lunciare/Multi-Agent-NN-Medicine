FIGURE10.24 Muscle Contraction The dense bodies and intermediate filaments are networked through the sarcoplasm, which cause the muscle fiber to contract. Although smooth muscle contraction relies on the presence of Ca++ions, smooth muscle fibers have a much smaller diameter than skeletal muscle cells. T-tubules are not required to reach the interior of the cell and therefore not necessary to transmit an action potential deep into the fiber. Smooth muscle fibers have a limited calcium-storing SR but have calcium channels in the sarcolemma (similar to cardiac muscle fibers) that open during the action potential along the sarcolemma. The influx of extracellular Ca++ions, which diffuse into the sarcoplasm to reach the calmodulin, accounts for most of the Ca++that triggers contraction of a smooth muscle cell. Muscle contraction continues until ATP-dependent calcium pumps actively transport Ca++ions back into the SR and out of the cell. However, a low concentration of calcium remains in the sarcoplasm to maintain muscle tone. This remaining calcium keeps the muscle slightly contracted, which is important in certain tracts and around blood vessels. Because most smooth muscles must function for long periods without rest, their power output
