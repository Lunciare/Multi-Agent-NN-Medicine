Anatomy and Physiology

Pyruvate crosses back across the mitochondrial membrane to wait for the next cycle of lipogenesis. The acetyl CoA is converted into malonyl CoA that is used to synthesize fatty acids.Figure 24.16 summarizes the pathways of lipid metabolism.

Glycerol and fatty acids follow different pathways. 24.4 Protein Metabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe how the body digests proteins • Explain how the urea cycle prevents toxic concentrations of nitrogen • Differentiate between glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids • Explain how protein can be used for energy Much of the body is made of protein, and these proteins take on a myriad of forms. They represent cell signaling receptors, signaling molecules, structural members, enzymes, intracellular trafficking components, extracellular matrix scaffolds, ion pumps, ion channels, oxygen and CO transporters (hemoglobin). That is not even the complete 2 list! There is protein in bones (collagen), muscles, and tendons; the hemoglobin that transports oxygen; and enzymes that catalyze all biochemical reactions. Protein is also used for growth and repair. Amid all these necessary
