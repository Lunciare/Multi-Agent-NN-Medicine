mature milk from approximately postpartum day 10 (seeTable 28.3). As you can see in the accompanying table, cow’s milk is not a substitute for breast milk. It contains less lactose, less fat, and more protein and minerals. Moreover, the proteins in cow’s milk are difficult for an infant’s immature digestive system to metabolize and absorb. The first few weeks of breastfeeding may involve leakage, soreness, and periods of milk engorgement as the relationship between milk supply and infant demand becomes established. Once this period is complete, the lactating person will produce approximately 1.5 liters of milk per day for a single infant, and more if the person has twins or triplets. As the infant goes through growth spurts, the milk supply constantly adjusts to accommodate changes in demand. A person can continue to lactate for years, but once breastfeeding is stopped for approximately 1 week, any remaining milk will be reabsorbed; in most cases, no more will be produced, even if suckling or pumping is resumed. Mature milk changes from the beginning to the end of a feeding. The early milk, calledforemilk, is watery, translucent, and rich in lactose and protein. Its purpose is to quench the infant’s thirst.Hindmilkis delivered
