Anatomy and Physiology

hypothalamus–pituitary complex is located in the consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal diencephalon of the brain. The hypothalamus and the medulla. The adrenal cortex—the outer layer of the pituitary gland are connected by a structure called the gland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve and androgens. The adrenal medulla at the core of the axons. The pituitary gland is divided into two distinct gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine. structures with different embryonic origins. The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of The adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress hypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the response and a long-term stress response. A perceived bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin threat results in the secretion of epinephrine and and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The anterior lobe is norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature in the mediate the fight-or-flight response. The long-term infundibulum and produces and secretes six stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH hormones. Their secretion is regulated, however, by from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in releasing and inhibiting hormones from the turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from hypothalamus. The six anterior pituitary hormones are:
