A muscle twitch has a latent period, a Cardiac muscle is striated muscle that is present only contraction phase, and a relaxation phase. A graded in the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers have a single muscle response allows variation in muscle tension. nucleus, are branched, and joined to one another by Summation occurs as successive stimuli are added intercalated discs that contain gap junctions for Access for free at openstax.org 10 • Interactive Link Questions 391 depolarization between cells and desmosomes to hold autonomic nervous system, by hormones, the fibers together when the heart contracts. spontaneously, or by stretching. The fibers in some Contraction in each cardiac muscle fiber is triggered by smooth muscle have latch-bridges, cross-bridges that Ca++ions in a similar manner as skeletal muscle, but cycle slowly without the need for ATP; these muscles here the Ca++ions come from SR and through voltage- can maintain low-level contractions for long periods. gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma. Pacemaker Single-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap cells stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac junctions to synchronize membrane depolarization
