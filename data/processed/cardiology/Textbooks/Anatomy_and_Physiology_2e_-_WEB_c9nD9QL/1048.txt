Anatomy and Physiology

rotated by the neck muscles (Table 11.5). When these muscles act unilaterally, the head rotates. When they contract bilaterally, the head flexes or extends. The major muscle that laterally flexes and rotates the head is thesternocleidomastoid. In addition, both muscles working together are the flexors of the head. Place your fingers on both sides of the neck and turn your head to the left and to the right. You will feel the movement originate there. This muscle divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles when viewed from the side (Figure 11.14). FIGURE11.14 Posterior and Lateral Views of the Neck The superficial and deep muscles of the neck are responsible for moving the head, cervical vertebrae, and scapulas.
