whereas the deep lymphatic vessels of the viscera generally follow the paths of arteries. The Organization of Immune Function The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each other in extraordinarily complex ways. The modern model of immune function is organized into three phases based on the timing of their effects. The three temporal phases consist of the following: • Barrier defensessuch as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic invasion into the body tissues • The rapid but nonspecificinnate immune response, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and soluble factors • The slower but more specific and effectiveadaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and soluble factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known aslymphocytes, which help control immune responses The cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune response, arise in the bone marrow via various differentiation pathways from hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 21.5). In contrast with embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost to age or function. These cells
