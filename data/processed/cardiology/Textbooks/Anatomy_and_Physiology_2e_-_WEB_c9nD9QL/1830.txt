wide variety of functions, so the thymosins cannot be strictly categorized as thymic hormones. Liver The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor (somatomedin), angiotensinogen, thrombopoietin, and hepcidin. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is the immediate stimulus for growth in the body, especially of the bones. Angiotensinogen is the precursor to angiotensin, mentioned earlier, which increases blood pressure. Thrombopoietin stimulates the production of the blood’s platelets. Hepcidins block the release of iron from cells in the body, helping to regulate iron homeostasis in our body fluids. The major hormones of these other organs are summarized inTable 17.8. Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions and Their Major Hormones Organ Major hormones Effects Reduces blood volume, blood pressure, and Heart Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) Na+concentration Gastrointestinal Aid digestion of food and buffering of Gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin tract stomach acids Gastrointestinal Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide Stimulate beta cells of the pancreas to tract (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) release insulin Kidneys Renin Stimulates release of aldosterone Kidneys Calcitriol Aids in the absorption of Ca2+ Triggers the formation of red blood cells in Kidneys Erythropoietin the bone marrow Inhibits production of calcitriol and increases Skeleton FGF23 phosphate
