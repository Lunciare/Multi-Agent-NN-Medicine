insulated by a lipid-rich within each division. A localized collection of neuron substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells cell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the CNS and as provide this insulation. a ganglion in the PNS. A bundle of axons is referred to as a tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS. Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous Whereas nuclei and ganglia are specifically in the system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical central or peripheral divisions, axons can cross the division in which they are found. In the CNS, boundary between the two. A single axon can be part astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and of a nerve and a tract. The name for that specific ependymal cells are found. Astrocytes are important structure depends on its location. for maintaining the chemical environment around the neuron and are crucial for regulating the blood-brain Nervous tissue can also be described as gray matter barrier. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the and white matter on the basis of its appearance in CNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in unstained tissue. These descriptions are more
