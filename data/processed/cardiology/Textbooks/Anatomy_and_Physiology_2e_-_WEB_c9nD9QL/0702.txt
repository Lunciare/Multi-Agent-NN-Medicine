to the ischial tuberosity. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments contribute to the formation of the greater and lesser sciatic foramina. 288 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( a 3-D view of the pelvis and its associated ligaments. What is the large opening in the bony pelvis, located between the ischium and pubic regions, and what two parts of the pubis contribute to the formation of this opening? The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments also help to define two openings on the posterolateral sides of the pelvis through which muscles, nerves, and blood vessels for the lower limb exit. The superior opening is thegreater sciatic foramen. This large opening is formed by the greater sciatic notch of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the sacrospinous ligament. The smaller, more inferiorlesser sciatic foramenis formed by the lesser sciatic notch of the hip bone, together with the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments. The space enclosed by the bony pelvis is divided into two regions (Figure 8.15). The broad, superior region, defined laterally by the large, fan-like portion of the upper hip bone, is called thegreater pelvis(greater pelvic cavity; false pelvis). This broad area is occupied by portions of the small and large
