Anatomy and Physiology

specialized epithelial cells, called endocrinocytes, located in the mucosal epithelium of the stomach and small intestine. These hormones then enter the bloodstream, through which they can reach their target organs. 23.3 The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structures of the mouth, including its three accessory digestive organs • Group the 32 adult teeth according to name, location, and function • Describe the process of swallowing, including the roles of the tongue, upper esophageal sphincter, and epiglottis • Trace the pathway food follows from ingestion into the mouth through release into the stomach In this section, you will examine the anatomy and functions of the three main organs of the upper alimentary canal—the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus—as well as three associated accessory organs—the tongue, salivary glands, and teeth. The Mouth The cheeks, tongue, and palate frame the mouth, which is also called theoral cavity(or buccal cavity). The structures of the mouth are illustrated inFigure 23.7. At the entrance to the mouth are the lips, orlabia(singular = labium). Their outer covering is skin, which transitions to a mucous membrane in the mouth proper. Lips are very vascular
