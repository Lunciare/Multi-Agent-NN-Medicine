interosseous membrane that spans the fibula and tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms thelateral malleolus, which forms the easily palpated bony bump on the lateral side of the ankle. The deep (medial) side of the lateral malleolus articulates with the talus bone of the foot as part of the ankle joint. The distal fibula also articulates with the fibular notch of the tibia. Tarsal Bones The posterior half of the foot is formed by seven tarsal bones (Figure 8.19). The most superior bone is thetalus. This has a relatively square-shaped, upper surface that articulates with the tibia and fibula to form theankle joint. Three areas of articulation form the ankle joint: The superomedial surface of the talus bone articulates with the medial malleolus of the tibia, the top of the talus articulates with the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral side of the talus articulates with the lateral malleolus of the fibula. Inferiorly, the talus articulates with thecalcaneus(heel bone), the largest bone of the foot, which forms the heel. Body weight is transferred from the tibia to the talus to the calcaneus, which rests on the ground. The medial calcaneus has a prominent bony extension called
