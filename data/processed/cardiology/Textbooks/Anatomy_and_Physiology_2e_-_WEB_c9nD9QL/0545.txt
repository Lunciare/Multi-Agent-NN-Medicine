bones of the appendicular skeleton are covered in a separate chapter. 7.2 The Skull LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • List and identify the bones of the brain case and face • Locate the major suture lines of the skull and name the bones associated with each • Locate and define the boundaries of the anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae, the temporal fossa, and infratemporal fossa • Define the paranasal sinuses and identify the location of each • Name the bones that make up the walls of the orbit and identify the openings associated with the orbit • Identify the bones and structures that form the nasal septum and nasal conchae, and locate the hyoid bone • Identify the bony openings of the skull Thecranium(skull) is the skeletal structure of the head that supports the face and protects the brain. It is subdivided into thefacial bonesand thebrain case, or cranial vault (Figure 7.3). The facial bones underlie the facial 230 7 • Axial Skeleton structures, form the nasal cavity, enclose the eyeballs, and support the teeth of the upper and lower jaws. The rounded brain case surrounds and protects the brain
