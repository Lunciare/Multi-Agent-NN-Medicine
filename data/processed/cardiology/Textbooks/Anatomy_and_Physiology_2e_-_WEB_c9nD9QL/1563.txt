on the basis of emotional state. For example, when you are anxious or scared, the amygdala will send signals to the hypothalamus along the medial forebrain bundle that will stimulate the sympathetic fight-or- flight response. The hypothalamus will also stimulate the release of stress hormones through its control of the endocrine system in response to amygdala input. FIGURE15.12 The Limbic Lobe Structures arranged around the edge of the cerebrum constitute the limbic lobe, which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus, and connects to the hypothalamus. The Medulla The medulla contains nuclei referred to as thecardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts, such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region. Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as thecardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels compose thevasomotor nerves. Several brain stem nuclei
