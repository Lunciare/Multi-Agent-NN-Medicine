myelinating glia in the and white matter on the basis of its appearance in CNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in unstained tissue. These descriptions are more often immune surveillance. Ependymal cells are responsible used in the CNS. Gray matter is where nuclei are found for filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter is where tracts are found. In the PNS, which is a circulatory fluid that performs some of the ganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white functions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because matter. of the BBB. In the PNS, satellite cells are supporting The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of cells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate how it controls the body. The somatic nervous system peripheral axons. (SNS) is responsible for functions that result in moving 12.3The Function of Nervous Tissue skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions that result in the movement of skeletal muscle would Sensation starts with the activation of a sensory be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system ending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing (ANS) is responsible for functions that affect cardiac or
