inherited from one parent. Each chromosome in the homologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape. Mitosis and Cytokinesis Themitotic phaseof the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major processes. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and distributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells. Mitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by cytokinesis. FIGURE3.32 Cell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis The stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic material into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. 110 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization Prophaseis the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible chromosomes. During prophase, each chromosome becomes visible with its identical partner attached, forming the familiar X-shape of sister chromatids. The nucleolus disappears early during this phase,
