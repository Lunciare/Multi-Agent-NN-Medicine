Anatomy and Physiology

the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe different types of sensory receptors • Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision • Distinguish how different tastes are transduced • Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance • List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball • Describe the processes of phototransduction A major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our internal environment. Stimuli from varying sources, and of different types, are received and changed into the electrochemical signals of the nervous system. This occurs when a stimulus changes the cell membrane potential of a sensory neuron. The stimulus causes the sensory cell to produce an action potential that is relayed into the central nervous system (CNS), where it is integrated with other sensory information—or sometimes higher cognitive functions—to become a conscious perception of that stimulus. The central integration may then lead to a motor response. Describing sensory function with the term sensation or perception is a deliberate distinction. Sensation is the activation of sensory receptor cells at
