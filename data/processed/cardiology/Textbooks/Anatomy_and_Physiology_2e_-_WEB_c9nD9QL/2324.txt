Anatomy and Physiology

increases, blood pressure increases and The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into flow decreases. In the venous system, constriction the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary increases blood pressure as it does in arteries; the arteries, which carry it to the right and left lungs for gas increasing pressure helps to return blood to the heart. exchange. Oxygen-rich blood is transported by In addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to pulmonary veins to the left atrium. The left ventricle become more rounded, decreasing resistance and pumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of increasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with descending aorta, which is further divided into the the skeletal muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and thoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries their valves to promote venous return to the heart. branch from the ascending aorta. After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to 20.3Capillary Exchange the right atrium from the venous system via the Small molecules can cross into and out of capillaries superior vena cava, which drains most of the veins via simple or facilitated diffusion.
