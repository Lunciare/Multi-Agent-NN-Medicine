for initial acidosis. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( see a demonstration of the effect altitude has on blood pH. What effect does high altitude have on blood pH, and why? Compensation Mechanisms Various compensatory mechanisms exist to maintain blood pH within a narrow range, including buffers, respiration, and renal mechanisms. Although compensatory mechanisms usually work very well, when one of these mechanisms is not working properly (like kidney failure or respiratory disease), they have their limits. If the pH and bicarbonate to carbonic acid ratio are changed too drastically, the body may not be able to compensate. Moreover, extreme changes in pH can denature proteins. Extensive damage to proteins in this way can result in disruption of normal metabolic processes, serious tissue damage, and ultimately death. Respiratory Compensation Respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis increases the respiratory rate to drive off CO and readjust the 2 bicarbonate to carbonic acid ratio to the 20:1 level. This adjustment can occur within minutes. Respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis is not as adept as its compensation for acidosis. The normal response of the respiratory system to elevated pH is to increase the amount of CO in the blood by decreasing the respiratory rate to 2
