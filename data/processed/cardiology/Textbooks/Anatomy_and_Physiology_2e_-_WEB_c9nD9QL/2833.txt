into bile salts salts that are released from the liver in smaller chain fatty acids and acetyl CoA response to lipid ingestion and surround the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) coenzyme used to insoluble triglycerides to aid in their conversion to produce FADH 2 monoglycerides and free fatty acids glucokinase cellular enzyme, found in the liver, which biosynthesis reactions reactions that create new converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate upon molecules, also called anabolic reactions uptake into the cell body mass index (BMI) relative amount of body gluconeogenesis process of glucose synthesis from weight compared to the overall height; a BMI pyruvate or other molecules ranging from 18–24.9 is considered normal weight, glucose-6-phosphate phosphorylated glucose 25–29.9 is considered overweight, and greater than produced in the first step of glycolysis 30 is considered obese glycogen form that glucose assumes when it is stored calorie amount of heat it takes to raise 1 kg (1000 g) glycolysis series of metabolic reactions that breaks of water by 1 °C down glucose into pyruvate and produces ATP catabolic hormones hormones that stimulate the hexokinase cellular enzyme, found in most tissues, breakdown of larger molecules that converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate catabolic reactions reactions that break down larger upon
