divisions on 12.2Nervous Tissue the basis of anatomy and physiology. The anatomical Nervous tissue contains two major cell types, neurons divisions are the central and peripheral nervous and glial cells. Neurons are the cells responsible for systems. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The PNS communication through electrical signals. Glial cells is everything else. Functionally, the nervous system can are supporting cells, maintaining the environment be divided into those regions that are responsible for around the neurons. sensation, those that are responsible for integration, and those that are responsible for generating Neurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of responses. All of these functional areas are found in electrical signals along their membrane. Signals are both the central and peripheral anatomy. received at the dendrites, are passed along the cell body, and propagate along the axon towards the target, Considering the anatomical regions of the nervous which may be another neuron, muscle tissue, or a system, there are specific names for the structures gland. Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich within each division. A localized collection of neuron substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells cell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the
