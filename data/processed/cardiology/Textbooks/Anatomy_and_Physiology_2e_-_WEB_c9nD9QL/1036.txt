as therectus(straight) abdominis, or theoblique(at an angle) muscles of the abdomen. Some muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of four muscles located on the anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to how many origins a particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii. The prefixbiindicates that the muscle has two origins andtriindicates three origins. The location of a muscle’s attachment can also appear in its name. When the name of a muscle is based on the attachments, the origin is always named first. For instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck has a dual origin on the sternum (sterno) and clavicle (cleido), and it inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The last feature by which to name a muscle is its action. When muscles are named for the movement they produce, one can find action words in their name. Some examples areflexor(decreases the angle at the joint),extensor (increases the angle at the joint),abductor(moves the bone away from the midline), oradductor(moves the bone toward the midline). 11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of
