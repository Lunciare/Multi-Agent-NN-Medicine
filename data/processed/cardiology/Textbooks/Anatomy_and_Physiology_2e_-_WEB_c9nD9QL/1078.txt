externus,superior gemellus,inferior gemellus, andquadratus femorislaterally rotate the femur at the hip. Theadductor longus,adductor brevis, andadductor magnuscan both medially and laterally rotate the thigh depending on the placement of the foot. The adductor longus flexes the thigh, whereas the adductor magnus extends it. Thepectineusadducts and flexes the femur at the hip as well. The pectineus is located in thefemoral triangle, which is formed at the junction between the hip and the leg and also includes the femoral nerve, the femoral artery, the femoral vein, and the deep inguinal lymph nodes. Thigh Muscles That Move the Femur, Tibia, and Fibula Deep fascia in the thigh separates it into medial, anterior, and posterior compartments (seeFigure 11.29andFigure 11.31). The muscles in themedial compartment of the thighare responsible for adducting the femur at the hip. Along with the adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, and pectineus, the strap-likegracilisadducts the thigh in addition to flexing the leg at the knee. 436 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.31 Thigh Muscles That Move the Femur, Tibia, and Fibula The muscles of theanterior compartment of the thighflex the thigh and extend the leg. This compartment contains thequadriceps femoris group, which actually comprises four muscles that extend and stabilize the
