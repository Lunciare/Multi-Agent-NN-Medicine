Although the 7.6-cm (3-in) long appendix contains lymphoid tissue, suggesting an immunologic function, this organ is generally considered vestigial. However, at least one recent report postulates a survival advantage conferred by the appendix: In diarrheal illness, the appendix may serve as a bacterial reservoir to repopulate the enteric bacteria for those surviving the initial phases of the illness. Moreover, its twisted anatomy provides a haven for the accumulation and multiplication of enteric bacteria. Themesoappendix, the mesentery of the appendix, tethers it to the mesentery of the ileum. 1028 23 • The Digestive System Colon The cecum blends seamlessly with thecolon. Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colonon the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure(hepatic flexure) and becomes thetransverse colon. The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the
