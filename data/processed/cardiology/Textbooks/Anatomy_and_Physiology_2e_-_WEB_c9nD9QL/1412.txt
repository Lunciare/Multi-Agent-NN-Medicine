much of the “white of the eye” visible (Figure 14.15). The transparent cornea covers the anterior tip of the eye and allows light to enter the eye. The middle layer of the eye is thevascular tunic, which is mostly composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. Thechoroidis a layer of highly vascularized connective tissue that provides a blood supply to the eyeball. The choroid is posterior to theciliary body, a muscular structure that is attached to thelensby suspensory ligaments, orzonule fibers. These two structures bend the lens, allowing it to focus light on the back of the eye. Overlaying the ciliary body, and visible in the anterior eye, is theiris—the colored part of the eye. The iris is a smooth muscle that opens or closes thepupil, which is the hole at the center of the eye that allows light to enter. The iris constricts the pupil in response to bright light and dilates the pupil in response to dim light. The innermost layer of the eye is the neural tunic, orretina, which contains the nervous tissue responsible for photoreception. The eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity. The anterior cavity is the
