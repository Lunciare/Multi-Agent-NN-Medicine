The enlarged medial portion of the pubis is thepubic body. Located superiorly on the pubic body is a small bump called thepubic tubercle. Thesuperior pubic ramusis the segment of bone that passes laterally from the pubic body to join the ilium. The narrow ridge running along the superior margin of the superior pubic ramus is thepectineal lineof the pubis. The pubic body is joined to the pubic body of the opposite hip bone by the pubic symphysis. Extending downward and laterally from the body is theinferior pubic ramus. Thepubic archis the bony structure formed by the pubic symphysis, and the bodies and inferior pubic rami of the adjacent pubic bones. The inferior pubic ramus extends downward to join the ischial ramus. Together, these form the singleischiopubic ramus, which extends from the pubic body to the ischial tuberosity. The inverted V-shape formed as the ischiopubic rami from both sides come together at the pubic symphysis is called thesubpubic angle. Pelvis The pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum,
