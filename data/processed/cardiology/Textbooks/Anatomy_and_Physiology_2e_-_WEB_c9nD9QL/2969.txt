occurs. The percent of water is recovered before the forming urine hydrostatic pressure of the glomerulus depends on reaches the DCT, which will recover another 10 systemic blood pressure, autoregulatory mechanisms, percent. Calciumrecovery in the DCT is influenced by sympathetic nervous activity, and paracrine hormones. PTH and active vitamin D. In the collecting ducts, ADH The kidney can function normally under a wide range of stimulates aquaporin channel insertion to increase blood pressures due to the autoregulatory nature of water recovery and thereby regulate osmolarity of the smooth muscle. blood. Aldosterone stimulates Na+recovery by the collecting duct. 25.6Tubular Reabsorption 25.7Regulation of Renal Blood Flow The kidney regulates water recovery and blood pressure by producing the enzyme renin. It is renin that The kidneys are innervated by sympathetic nerves of starts a series of reactions, leading to the production of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nervous the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and the salt- activity decreases blood flow to the kidney, making retaining steroid aldosterone. Water recovery is also more blood available to other areas of the body during powerfully and directly influenced by the hormone times of stress. The arteriolar myogenic mechanism ADH. Even so, it only influences the last 10
