low-level contractions for long periods. gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma. Pacemaker Single-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap cells stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac junctions to synchronize membrane depolarization and muscle as a functional unit, called a syncytium. contractions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. Single-unit smooth muscle in the walls of the 10.8Smooth Muscle viscera, called visceral muscle, has a stress-relaxation Smooth muscle is found throughout the body around response that permits muscle to stretch, contract, and various organs and tracts. Smooth muscle cells have a relax as the organ expands. Multiunit smooth muscle single nucleus, and are spindle-shaped. Smooth cells do not possess gap junctions, and contraction muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia, mitotically does not spread from one cell to the next. dividing to produce new cells. The smooth cells are 10.9Development and Regeneration of nonstriated, but their sarcoplasm is filled with actin Muscle Tissue and myosin, along with dense bodies in the sarcolemma to anchor the thin filaments and a network Muscle tissue arises from embryonic mesoderm. of intermediate filaments involved in pulling the Somites give rise to myoblasts and fuse to form a sarcolemma toward the fiber’s middle, shortening it in myotube.
