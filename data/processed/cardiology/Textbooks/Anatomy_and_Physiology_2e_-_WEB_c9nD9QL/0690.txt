The thumb (pollex) is digit number 1 and has two phalanges, a proximal phalanx, and a distal phalanx bone (seeFigure 8.7). Digits 2 (index finger) through 5 (little finger) have three phalanges each, called the proximal, middle, and distal phalanx bones. Aninterphalangeal joint is one of the articulations between adjacent phalanges of the digits (seeFigure 8.8). INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thissite( explore the bones and joints of the hand.

Appendicular System: Fractures of Upper Limb Bones Due to our constant use of the hands and the rest of our upper limbs, an injury to any of these areas will cause a significant loss of functional ability. Many fractures result from a hard fall onto an outstretched hand. The resulting transmission of force up the limb may result in a fracture of the humerus, radius, or scaphoid bones. These injuries are especially common in elderly people whose bones are weakened due to osteoporosis. Falls onto the hand or elbow, or direct blows to the arm, can result in fractures of the humerus (Figure 8.11). Following a fall, fractures at the surgical neck, the region at which
