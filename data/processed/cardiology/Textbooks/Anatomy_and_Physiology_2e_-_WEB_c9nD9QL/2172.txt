Anatomy and Physiology

down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer, even if you are weak in math. Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (λ), and viscosity (η). Poiseuille’s equation: • π is the Greek letter pi, used to represent the mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. It may commonly be represented as 3.14, although the actual number extends to infinity. • ΔP represents the difference in pressure. • r4is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power. • η is the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the blood. • λ is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a blood vessel. One of several things this equation allows us to do is calculate the resistance in the vascular system. Normally this value is extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship: If we rearrange this slightly, Then by substituting Pouseille’s equation for blood flow: By examining this equation, you can see that there are only three variables: viscosity, vessel length, and radius, since 8 and π are both constants. The important
