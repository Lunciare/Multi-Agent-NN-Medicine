Originally, it consists of a pair of strands called Venous return is determined by activity of the skeletal cardiogenic cords that quickly form a hollow lumen and muscles, blood volume, and changes in peripheral are referred to as endocardial tubes. These then fuse circulation. Venous return determines preload and the into a single heart tube and differentiate into the atrial reflex.
