roughened area extending inferiorly from the greater trochanter. More inferiorly, the gluteal tuberosity becomes continuous with thelinea aspera(“rough line”). This is the roughened ridge that passes distally along the posterior side of the mid-femur. Multiple muscles of the hip and thigh regions make long, thin attachments to the femur along the linea aspera. The distal end of the femur has medial and lateral bony expansions. On the lateral side, the smooth portion that covers the distal and posterior aspects of the lateral expansion is thelateral condyle of the femur. The roughened 292 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton area on the outer, lateral side of the condyle is thelateral epicondyle of the femur. Similarly, the smooth region of the distal and posterior medial femur is themedial condyle of the femur, and the irregular outer, medial side of this is themedial epicondyle of the femur. The lateral and medial condyles articulate with the tibia to form the knee joint. The epicondyles provide attachment for muscles and supporting ligaments of the knee. Theadductor tubercle is a small bump located at the superior margin of the medial epicondyle. Posteriorly, the medial and lateral condyles are separated by a deep depression called theintercondylar fossa. Anteriorly,
