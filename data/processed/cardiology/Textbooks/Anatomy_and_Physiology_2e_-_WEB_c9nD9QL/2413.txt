an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen. The downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the antibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade. 926 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System INTERACTIVE LINK Immunity can be acquired in an active or passive way, and it can be natural or artificial. Watch thisvideo ( see an animated discussion of passive and active immunity. What is an example of natural immunity acquired passively? T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to complex antigens such as those made by proteins. On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent. AT cell-independent antigenusually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria. Each antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell. The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell cytokines. AT cell-dependent antigen, on the
