Anatomy and Physiology

the activation of a sensory be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system ending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing (ANS) is responsible for functions that affect cardiac or the temperature of the water. The sensory endings in smooth muscle tissue, or that cause glands to produce the skin initiate an electrical signal that travels along their secretions. Autonomic functions are distributed the sensory axon within a nerve into the spinal cord, between central and peripheral regions of the nervous where it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of system. The sensations that lead to autonomic the spinal cord. The temperature information functions can be the same sensations that are part of represented in that electrical signal is passed to the initiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic next neuron by a chemical signal that diffuses across integrative functions may overlap as well. the small gap of the synapse and initiates a new electrical signal in the target cell. That signal travels A special division of the nervous system is the enteric through the sensory pathway to the brain, passing nervous system, which is responsible for controlling through the thalamus, where conscious perception of the digestive organs.
