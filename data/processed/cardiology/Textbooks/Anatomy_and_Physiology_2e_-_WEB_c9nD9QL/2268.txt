thecavernous sinus, which flows into thepetrosal sinusand then into the internal jugular vein. Theoccipital sinus, sagittal sinus, and straight sinuses all flow into the left and right transverse sinuses near the lambdoid suture. Thetransverse sinusesin turn flow into thesigmoid sinusesthat pass through the jugular foramen and into the internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein flows parallel to the common carotid artery and is more or less its counterpart. It empties into the brachiocephalic vein. The veins draining the cervical vertebrae and the posterior surface of the skull, including some blood from the occipital sinus, flow into the vertebral veins. These parallel the vertebral arteries and travel through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral veins also flow into the brachiocephalic veins.Table 20.13summarizes the major veins of the brain. 868 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.37 Veins of the Head and Neck This left lateral view shows the veins of the head and neck, including the intercranial sinuses. Major Veins of the Brain Vessel Description Superior Enlarged vein located midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal layers of the dura mater sagittal within the falx cerebri; receives most of the blood drained from the superior
