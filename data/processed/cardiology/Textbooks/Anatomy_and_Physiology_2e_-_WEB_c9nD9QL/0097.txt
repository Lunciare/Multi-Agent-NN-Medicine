Anatomy and Physiology

for the electrons in their valence shells to interact. But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body—or anywhere in the natural world—is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense. Instead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. Abondis a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in the same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms were when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds is called amolecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H , which is called 2 molecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is called a chemicalcompound. Thus, a unit of water, or H O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas 2 methane,
