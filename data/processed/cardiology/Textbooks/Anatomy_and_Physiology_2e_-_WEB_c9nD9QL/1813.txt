Anatomy and Physiology

steroid use can increase cholesterol levels, raise blood pressure, and damage the liver. Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have been implicated in causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Paradoxically, steroids can have effects, including shriveled testicles and enlarged breast tissue. In females, their use can cause effects such as an enlarged clitoris and growth of facial hair. In all people, their use can promote increased aggression (commonly known as “roid- rage”), depression, sleep disturbances, severe acne, and infertility. 17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the location and structure of the pancreas, and the morphology and function of the pancreatic islets • Compare and contrast the functions of insulin and glucagon Thepancreasis a long, slender organ, most of which is located posterior to the bottom half of the stomach (Figure 17.18). Although it is primarily an exocrine gland, secreting a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function. Itspancreatic islets—clusters of cells formerly known as the islets of Langerhans—secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide
