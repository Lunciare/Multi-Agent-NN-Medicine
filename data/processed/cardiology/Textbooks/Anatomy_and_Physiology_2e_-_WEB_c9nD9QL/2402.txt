specificity as their B cell precursors. There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody functions critical to many adaptive immune responses. B cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells. B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen and do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells. B Cell Differentiation and Activation B cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B cells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells. B cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells.Central toleranceis the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is critical and well established. In the process ofclonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens expressed on tissues are signaled to induce their own destruction by apoptosis, removing them from the population.
