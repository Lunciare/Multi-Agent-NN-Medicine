can also help. 24.3 Lipid Metabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how energy can be derived from fat • Explain the purpose and process of ketogenesis • Describe the process of ketone body oxidation • Explain the purpose and the process of lipogenesis Fats (or triglycerides) within the body are ingested as food or synthesized by adipocytes or hepatocytes from carbohydrate precursors (Figure 24.11). Lipid metabolism entails the oxidation of fatty acids to either generate energy or synthesize new lipids from smaller constituent molecules. Lipid metabolism is associated with carbohydrate metabolism, as products of glucose (such as acetyl CoA) can be converted into lipids. 1076 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition FIGURE24.11 Triglyceride Broken Down into a Monoglyceride A triglyceride molecule (a) breaks down into a monoglyceride (b). Lipid metabolism begins in the intestine where ingestedtriglyceridesare broken down into smaller chain fatty acids and subsequently intomonoglyceride molecules(seeFigure 24.11b) bypancreatic lipases, enzymes that break down fats after they are emulsified bybile salts. When food reaches the small intestine in the form of chyme, a digestive hormone calledcholecystokinin (CCK)is released by intestinal cells in the intestinal mucosa. CCK stimulates the release of pancreatic
