tail of the epididymis (the final section) until ejaculation occurs. Duct System During ejaculation, sperm exit the tail of the epididymis and are pushed by smooth muscle contraction to theductus deferens(also called the vas deferens). The ductus deferens is a thick, muscular tube that is bundled together inside the scrotum with connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves into a structure called thespermatic cord(see Figure 27.2andFigure 27.3). Because the ductus deferens is physically accessible within the scrotum, surgical sterilization to interrupt sperm delivery can be performed by cutting and sealing a small section of the ductus (vas) deferens. This procedure is called a vasectomy, and it is an effective form of birth control. Although it may be possible to reverse a vasectomy, clinicians consider the procedure permanent, and advise people to undergo it only if they are certain they no longer wish to have children. 1192 27 • The Reproductive System INTERACTIVE LINK Interactive Link Feature Watch thisvideo( learn about a vasectomy. As described in this video, a vasectomy is a procedure in which a small section of the ductus (vas) deferens is removed from the scrotum. This interrupts the path taken by sperm through the ductus deferens. If sperm do
