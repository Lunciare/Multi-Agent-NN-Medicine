Anatomy and Physiology

abdominal cavity that covers abdominal organs and forms double sheets of mesenteries that suspend many of the digestive organs. The skin is an epithelial membrane also called thecutaneous membrane. It is a stratified squamous epithelial membrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external environment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens. 4.2 Epithelial Tissue LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the structure and function of epithelial tissue • Distinguish between tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions • Distinguish between simple epithelia and stratified epithelia, as well as between squamous, cuboidal, and columnar epithelia • Describe the structure and function of endocrine and exocrine glands and their respective secretions Most epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the outside world and lining the outside of organs. Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin is not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well as the
