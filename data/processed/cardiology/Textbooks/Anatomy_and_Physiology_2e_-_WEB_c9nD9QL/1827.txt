which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the 3 kidneys produce the hormoneerythropoietin (EPO)in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form). Skeleton Although bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that the skeleton itself produces at least two hormones. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells in response to increased blood levels of vitamin D or phosphate. It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of 3 calcitriol from vitamin D and to increase phosphorus excretion. Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates 3 the pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin production. It also acts on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity to insulin and their utilization of glucose. Adipose Tissue Adipose tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage. One important example isleptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels of body fat. Leptin is released in response to food consumption
