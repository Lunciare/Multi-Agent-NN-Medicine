Humerus The rest of the shoulder muscles originate on the scapula. The anatomical and ligamental structure of the shoulder joint and the arrangements of the muscles covering it, allows the arm to carry out different types of movements. The deltoid, the thick muscle that creates the rounded lines of the shoulder is the major abductor of the arm, but it also facilitates flexing and medial rotation, as well as extension and lateral rotation. Thesubscapularisoriginates on the anterior scapula and medially rotates the arm. Named for their locations, thesupraspinatus(superior to the spine of the scapula) and theinfraspinatus(inferior to the spine of the scapula) abduct the arm, and laterally rotate the arm, respectively. The thick and flatteres majoris inferior to the teres minor and extends the arm, and assists in adduction and medial rotation of it. The longteres minorlaterally rotates and extends the arm. Finally, the coracobrachialisflexes and adducts the arm. The tendons of the deep subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor connect the scapula to the humerus, forming therotator cuff(musculotendinous cuff), the circle of tendons around the shoulder joint. When baseball pitchers undergo shoulder surgery it is usually on the rotator cuff, which becomes pinched and inflamed, and may tear away
