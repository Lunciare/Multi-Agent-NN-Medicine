urine However, these functions are usually not significant in maintaining calcium homeostasis, so the importance of calcitonin is not entirely understood. Pharmaceutical preparations of calcitonin are sometimes prescribed to reduce osteoclast activity in people with osteoporosis and to reduce the degradation of cartilage in people with osteoarthritis. The hormones secreted by thyroid are summarized inTable 17.4. Thyroid Hormones Associated hormones Chemical class Effect Thyroxine (T ), triiodothyronine (T ) Amine Stimulate basal metabolic rate 4 3 Calcitonin Peptide Reduces blood Ca2+levels TABLE17.4 Of course, calcium is critical for many other biological processes. It is a second messenger in many signaling pathways, and is essential for muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and blood clotting. Given these roles, it is not surprising that blood calcium levels are tightly regulated by the endocrine system. The organs involved in the regulation are the parathyroid glands. 17.5 The Parathyroid Glands LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the location and structure of the parathyroid glands • Describe the hormonal control of blood calcium levels • Discuss the physiological response of parathyroid dysfunction Theparathyroid glandsare tiny, round structures usually found embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid
