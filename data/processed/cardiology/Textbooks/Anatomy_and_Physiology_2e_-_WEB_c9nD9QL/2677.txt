those cells. Although their small size makes it difficult to see each microvillus, their combined microscopic appearance suggests a mass of bristles, which is termed thebrush border. Fixed to the surface of the microvilli membranes are enzymes that finish digesting carbohydrates and proteins. There are an estimated 200 million microvilli per square millimeter of small intestine, greatly expanding the surface area of the plasma membrane and thus greatly enhancing absorption. Intestinal Glands In addition to the three specialized absorptive features just discussed, the mucosa between the villi is dotted with deep crevices that each lead into a tubularintestinal gland(crypt of Lieberkühn), which is formed by cells that line Access for free at openstax.org 23.5 • The Small and Large Intestines 1025 the crevices (seeFigure 23.19). These produceintestinal juice, a slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 to 7.8) mixture of water and mucus. Each day, about 0.95 to 1.9 liters (1 to 2 quarts) are secreted in response to the distention of the small intestine or the irritating effects of chyme on the intestinal mucosa. The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex mucus-secretingduodenal glands(Brunner’s glands), which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers the acidic chyme as it
