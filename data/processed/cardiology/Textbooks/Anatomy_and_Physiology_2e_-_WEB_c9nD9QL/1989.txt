of the heart are visible, including the four chambers. There is a superficial leaf-like extension of the atria near the superior surface of the heart, one on each side, called an auricle—a name that means “ear like”—because its shape resembles the external ear of a human (Figure 19.6). Auricles are relatively thin-walled structures that can fill with blood and empty into the atria or upper chambers of the heart. You may also hear them referred to as atrial appendages. Also prominent is a series of fat-filled grooves, each of which is known as asulcus(plural = sulci), along the superior surfaces of the heart. Major coronary blood vessels are located in these sulci. The deepcoronary sulcusis located between the atria and ventricles. Located between the left and right ventricles are two additional sulci that are not as deep as the coronary sulcus. The anterior interventricular sulcusis visible on the anterior surface of the heart, whereas theposterior interventricular sulcusis visible on the posterior surface of the heart.Figure 19.6illustrates anterior and posterior views of the surface of the heart. 758 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart FIGURE19.6 External Anatomy of the Heart Inside the pericardium, the surface features of the heart are
