delicate organs and, of course, the skeletal system. Specialized cells in connective tissue defend the body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of fluid, nutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured by specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph. Adipose cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body. Embryonic Connective Tissue All connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (seeFigure 4.3).

Clusters of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement and repair after a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord, calledmucous connective tissueor Wharton’s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only scattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body. Classification of Connective Tissues The three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground substance and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1).Connective
