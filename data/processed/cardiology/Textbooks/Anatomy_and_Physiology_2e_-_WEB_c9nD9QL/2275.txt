spermatic cord. Eachovarian veindrains an ovary in females. Each of these veins is generically called agonadal vein. The right gonadal vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava, and the left gonadal vein empties into the left renal vein. Each side of the diaphragm drains into aphrenic vein; the right phrenic vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava, whereas the left phrenic vein empties into the left renal vein. Blood supply from the liver drains into each hepatic veinand directly into the inferior vena cava. Since the inferior vena cava lies primarily to the right of the vertebral column and aorta, the left renal vein is longer, as are the left phrenic, adrenal, and gonadal veins. The longer length of the left renal vein makes the left kidney the primary target of surgeons removing this organ for donation.Figure 20.40provides a flow chart of the veins flowing into the inferior vena cava.Table 20.15summarizes the major veins of the abdominal region.
