sternoclavicular joint. The sternal end is also region located between the shoulder and elbow joints. anchored to the first rib by the costoclavicular This area contains the humerus. The proximal humerus ligament. The acromial end of the clavicle articulates consists of the head, which articulates with the scapula with the acromion of the scapula at the at the glenohumeral joint, the greater and lesser acromioclavicular joint. This end is also anchored to tubercles separated by the intertubercular (bicipital) the coracoid process of the scapula by the groove, and the anatomical and surgical necks. The coracoclavicular ligament, which provides indirect humeral shaft has the roughened area of the deltoid support for the acromioclavicular joint. The clavicle tuberosity on its lateral side. The distal humerus is supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces flattened, forming a lateral supracondylar ridge that from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the terminates at the small lateral epicondyle. The medial underlying nerves and blood vessels. side of the distal humerus has the large, medial The scapula lies on the posterior aspect of the pectoral epicondyle. The articulating surfaces of the distal girdle. It mediates the attachment of the upper limb to humerus
