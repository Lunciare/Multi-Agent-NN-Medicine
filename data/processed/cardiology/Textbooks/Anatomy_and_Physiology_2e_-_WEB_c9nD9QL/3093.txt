female descendants died childless or with only male children, and thus, their maternal line—and its mtDNA—ended. Folliculogenesis Again, ovarian follicles are oocytes and their supporting cells. They grow and develop in a process called folliculogenesis, which typically leads to ovulation of one follicle approximately every 28 days, along with death to multiple other follicles. The death of ovarian follicles is called atresia, and can occur at any point during follicular development. Recall that, a female infant at birth will have one to two million oocytes within the ovarian follicles, and that this number declines throughout life until menopause, when no follicles remain. As you’ll see next, follicles progress from primordial, to primary, to secondary and tertiary stages prior to ovulation—with the oocyte inside the follicle remaining as a primary oocyte until right before ovulation. Folliculogenesis begins with follicles in a resting state. These smallprimordial folliclesare present in newborn females and are the prevailing follicle type in the adult ovary (Figure 27.12). Primordial follicles have only a single flat layer of support cells, calledgranulosa cells, that surround the oocyte, and they can stay in this resting state for years—some until right before menopause. After puberty, a few primordial follicles will respond
