transverse sinuses, and also the vertebral veins Transverse Pair of enlarged veins near the lambdoid suture that drains the occipital, sagittal, and straight sinuses sinuses, and leads to the sigmoid sinuses Sigmoid Enlarged vein that receives blood from the transverse sinuses and leads through the jugular sinuses foramen to the internal jugular vein TABLE20.13 Veins Draining the Upper Limbs Thedigital veinsin the fingers come together in the hand to form thepalmar venous arches(Figure 20.38). From here, the veins come together to form the radial vein, the ulnar vein, and the median antebrachial vein. Theradial veinand theulnar veinparallel the bones of the forearm and join together at the antebrachium to form thebrachial vein, a deep vein that flows into the axillary vein in the brachium. Themedian antebrachial veinparallels the ulnar vein, is more medial in location, and joins thebasilic veinin the forearm. As the basilic vein reaches the antecubital region, it gives off a branch called themedian cubital veinthat crosses at an angle to join the cephalic vein. The median cubital vein is the most common site for drawing venous blood in humans. The basilic vein continues through the arm medially and superficially to the axillary vein. Thecephalic veinbegins in the
