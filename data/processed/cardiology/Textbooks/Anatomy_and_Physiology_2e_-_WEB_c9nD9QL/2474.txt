is released as a waste product. You may be surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The circulatory system transports gases from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic obstruction pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties. 948 22 • The Respiratory System 22.1 Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • List the structures that make up the respiratory system • Describe how the respiratory system processes oxygen and CO 2 • Compare and contrast the functions of upper respiratory tract with the lower respiratory tract The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to
