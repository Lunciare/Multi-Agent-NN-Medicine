compensation for acidosis. The normal response of the respiratory system to elevated pH is to increase the amount of CO in the blood by decreasing the respiratory rate to 2 conserve CO . There is a limit to the decrease in respiration, however, that the body can tolerate. Hence, the 2 respiratory route is less efficient at compensating for metabolic alkalosis than for acidosis.

In cases of respiratory acidosis, the kidney increases the conservation of bicarbonate and secretion of H+through the exchange mechanism discussed earlier. These processes increase the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, reestablishing the proper relative concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonic acid. In cases of respiratory alkalosis, the kidneys decrease the production of bicarbonate and reabsorb H+ from the tubular fluid. These processes can be limited by the exchange of potassium by the renal cells, which use a K+-H+exchange mechanism (antiporter). Diagnosing Acidosis and Alkalosis Lab tests for pH, CO partial pressure (PCO ),and HCO –can identify acidosis and alkalosis, indicating whether the 2 2
