Anatomy and Physiology

Inflammation is the classic response of the body to is tough because of extra collagen fibers and forms, injury and follows a common sequence of events. The among other things, the intervertebral discs. Elastic area is red, feels warm to the touch, swells, and is cartilage can stretch and recoil to its original shape painful. Injured cells, mast cells, and resident because of its high content of elastic fibers. The matrix macrophages release chemical signals that cause contains very few blood vessels. Bones are made of a vasodilation and fluid leakage in the surrounding rigid, mineralized matrix containing calcium salts, tissue. The repair phase includes blood clotting, crystals, and osteocytes lodged in lacunae. Bone tissue followed by regeneration of tissue as fibroblasts is highly vascularized. Cancellous bone is spongy and deposit collagen. Some tissues regenerate more less solid than compact bone. Fluid tissue, for example readily than others. Epithelial and connective tissues blood and lymph, is characterized by a liquid matrix replace damaged or dead cells from a supply of adult and no supporting fibers. stem cells.
