Anatomy and Physiology

components are conducted through the surface of the chorionic villi, but maternal and fetal bloodstreams never mix directly. The placenta develops throughout the embryonic period and during the first several weeks of the fetal period; placentationis complete by weeks 14–16. As a fully developed organ, the placenta provides nutrition and excretion, respiration, and endocrine function (Table 28.1andFigure 28.12). It receives blood from the fetus through the umbilical arteries. Capillaries in the chorionic villi filter fetal wastes out of the blood and return clean, oxygenated blood to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Nutrients and oxygen are transferred from maternal blood surrounding the villi through the capillaries and into the fetal bloodstream. Some substances move across the placenta by simple diffusion. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and any other lipid-soluble substances take this route. Other substances move across by facilitated diffusion. This includes water-soluble glucose. The fetus has a high demand for amino acids and iron, and those substances are moved across the placenta by active transport. Maternal and fetal blood does not commingle because blood cells cannot move across the placenta. This separation prevents the pregnant person's cytotoxic T cells from reaching and subsequently destroying the fetus, which bears “non-self” antigens. Further,
