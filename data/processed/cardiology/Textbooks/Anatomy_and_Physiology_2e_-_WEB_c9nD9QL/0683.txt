side. This ridge forms theinterosseous border of the radius, which, like the similar border of the ulna, is the line of attachment for the interosseous membrane that unites the two forearm bones. The distal end of the radius has a smooth surface for articulation with two carpal bones to form theradiocarpal jointor wrist joint (Figure 8.7andFigure 8.8). On the medial side of the distal radius is theulnar notch of the radius. This shallow depression articulates with the head of the ulna, which together form thedistal radioulnar joint. The lateral end of the radius has a pointed projection called thestyloid process of the radius. This provides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint. Compared to the styloid process of the ulna, the styloid process of the radius projects more distally, thereby limiting the range of movement for lateral deviations of the hand at the wrist joint. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( see how fractures of the distal radius bone can affect the wrist joint. Explain the problems that may occur if a fracture of the distal radius involves the joint surface of the radiocarpal joint of the wrist. Carpal Bones The wrist and base of the hand
