tissues. In on the lateral side, serve to resist hyperextension or the skull, the bones develop either directly from rotation of the extended knee joint. Two intracapsular mesenchyme through the process of intramembranous ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior ossification, or indirectly through endochondral cruciate ligament, span between the tibia and the inner ossification, which initially forms a hyaline cartilage aspects of the femoral condyles. The anterior cruciate model of the future bone, which is later converted into ligament resists hyperextension of the knee, while the bone. In both cases, the mesenchyme between the posterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior sliding of developing bones differentiates into fibrous connective the femur, thus supporting the knee when it is flexed tissue that will unite the skull bones at suture joints. In and weight bearing. The medial and lateral menisci, the limbs, mesenchyme accumulations within the located between the femoral and tibial condyles, are growing limb bud will become a hyaline cartilage model articular discs that provide padding and improve the fit for each of the limb bones. A joint interzone will between the bones. develop between these areas of cartilage. The talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the Mesenchyme cells
