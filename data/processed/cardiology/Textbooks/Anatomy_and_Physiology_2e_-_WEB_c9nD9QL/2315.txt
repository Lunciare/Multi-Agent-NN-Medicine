pump increase in the volume of the supplies blood to the superior surface of the thorax during inhalation that decreases air pressure, diaphragm enabling venous blood to flow into the thoracic superior sagittal sinus enlarged vein located region, then exhalation increases pressure, moving midsagittally between the meningeal and periosteal blood into the atria layers of the dura mater within the falx cerebri; right gastric artery branch of the common hepatic receives most of the blood drained from the artery; supplies blood to the stomach superior surface of the cerebrum and leads to the sepsis (also, septicemia) organismal-level inferior jugular vein and the vertebral vein inflammatory response to a massive infection superior vena cava large systemic vein; drains blood septic shock (also, blood poisoning) type of shock from most areas superior to the diaphragm; empties that follows a massive infection resulting in into the right atrium organism-wide inflammation systolic pressure larger number recorded when sigmoid sinuses enlarged veins that receive blood measuring arterial blood pressure; represents the from the transverse sinuses; flow through the maximum value following ventricular contraction jugular foramen and into the internal jugular vein temporal vein drains blood from the temporal region sinusoid capillary rarest type of capillary,
