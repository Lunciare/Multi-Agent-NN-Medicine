Veins of the Lower Limbs Vessel Description Plantar Drain the foot and flow into the plantar venous arch veins Dorsal venous Drains blood from digital veins and vessels on the superior surface of the foot arch Plantar Formed from the plantar veins; flows into the anterior and posterior tibial veins through venous anastomoses arch Anterior Formed from the dorsal venous arch; drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and flows tibial vein into the popliteal vein TABLE20.16 Access for free at openstax.org 20.5 • Circulatory Pathways 877 Vessel Description Posterior Formed from the dorsal venous arch; drains the area near the posterior surface of the tibia and tibial vein flows into the popliteal vein
