enzymes and can persist in macrophage organelles or escape into the cytosol. In such situations, infected macrophages receiving cytokine signals from Th1 cells turn on special metabolic pathways.Macrophage oxidative metabolismis hostile to intracellular bacteria, often relying on the production of nitric oxide to kill the bacteria inside the macrophage. Fungal infections, such as those fromAspergillus,Candida, andPneumocystis, are largely opportunistic infections that take advantage of suppressed immune responses. Most of the same immune mechanisms effective against bacteria have similar effects on fungi, both of which have characteristic cell wall structures that protect their cells. Defenses against Parasites Worm parasites such as helminths are seen as the primary reason why the mucosal immune response, IgE- mediated allergy and asthma, and eosinophils evolved. These parasites were at one time very common in human Access for free at openstax.org 21.5 • The Immune Response against Pathogens 929 society. When infecting a human, often via contaminated food, some worms take up residence in the gastrointestinal tract. Eosinophils are attracted to the site by T cell cytokines, which release their granule contents upon their arrival. Mast cell degranulation also occurs, and the fluid leakage caused by the increase in local vascular permeability is thought to have
