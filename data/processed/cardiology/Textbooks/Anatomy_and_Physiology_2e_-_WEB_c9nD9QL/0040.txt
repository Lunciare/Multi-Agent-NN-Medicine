Anatomy and Physiology

upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward as illustrated inFigure 1.12. Using this standard position reduces confusion. It does not matter how the body being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical position. For example, a scar in the “anterior (front) carpal (wrist) region” would be present on the palm side of the wrist. The term “anterior” would be used even if the hand were palm down on a table. 24 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body FIGURE1.12 Regions of the Human Body The human body is shown in anatomical position in an (a) anterior view and a (b) posterior view. The regions of the body are labeled in boldface. A body that is lying down is described as either prone or supine.Pronedescribes a face-down orientation, and supinedescribes a face up orientation. These terms are sometimes used in describing the position of the body during specific physical examinations or surgical procedures. Regional Terms The human body’s numerous regions have specific terms to help increase precision (seeFigure 1.12). Notice that the term “brachium” or “arm” is reserved for the “upper arm” and “antebrachium” or
