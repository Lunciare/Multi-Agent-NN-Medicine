via the Cori cycle. Similarly, when a person exercises, muscles use ATP faster than oxygen can be delivered to them. They depend on glycolysis and lactic acid production for rapid ATP production. Aerobic Respiration In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate can enter the Krebs cycle where additional energy is extracted as electrons are transferred from the pyruvate to the receptors NAD+, GDP, and FAD, with carbon dioxide being a “waste product” (Figure 24.6). The NADH and FADH pass electrons on to the electron transport chain, which uses the transferred 2 energy to produce ATP. As the terminal step in the electron transport chain, oxygen is theterminal electron acceptorand creates water inside the mitochondria. 1068 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition FIGURE24.6 Aerobic versus Anaerobic Respiration The process of anaerobic respiration converts glucose into two lactate molecules in the absence of oxygen or within erythrocytes that lack mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, glucose is oxidized into two pyruvate molecules. Krebs Cycle/Citric Acid Cycle/Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle The pyruvate molecules generated during glycolysis are transported across the mitochondrial membrane into the Access for free at openstax.org 24.2 • Carbohydrate Metabolism 1069 inner mitochondrial matrix, where they are metabolized by enzymes in a pathway called theKrebs
