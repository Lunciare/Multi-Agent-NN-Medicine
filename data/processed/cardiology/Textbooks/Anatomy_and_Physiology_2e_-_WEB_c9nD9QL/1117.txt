of polarity • List the types of glial cells and assign each to the proper division of the nervous system, along with their function(s) • Distinguish the major functions of the nervous system: sensation, integration, and response • Describe the components of the membrane that establish the resting membrane potential • Describe the changes that occur to the membrane that result in the action potential • Explain the differences between types of graded potentials • Categorize the major neurotransmitters by chemical type and effect INTRODUCTION The nervous system is a very complex organ system. In Peter D. Kramer’s bookListening to Prozac, a pharmaceutical researcher is quoted as saying, “If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand, we would be too simple to understand it” (1994). That quote is from the early 1990s; in the two decades since, progress has continued at an amazing rate within the scientific disciplines of neuroscience. It is an interesting conundrum to consider that the complexity of the nervous system may be too complex for it (that is, for us) to completely unravel. But our current level of understanding is probably nowhere close to that limit. One easy way to begin to understand
