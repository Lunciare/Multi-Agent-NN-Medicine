Whereas some researchers believe that certain aspects of andropause are difficult to tease apart from aging in general, testosterone replacement is sometimes prescribed to alleviate some symptoms. Recent studies have shown a benefit from androgen replacement therapy on the new onset of depression in elderly males; however, other studies caution against testosterone replacement for long-term treatment of andropause symptoms, showing that high doses can sharply increase the risk of both heart disease and prostate cancer. 27.2 Anatomy and Physiology of the Ovarian Reproductive System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structure and function of the organs of the ovarian reproductive system • List the steps of oogenesis • Describe the hormonal changes that occur during the ovarian and menstrual cycles • Trace the path of an oocyte from ovary to fertilization The female, or ovarian, reproductive system functions to produce gametes and reproductive hormones, just like the male reproductive system; however, it also has the additional task of supporting the developing fetus and delivering it to the outside world. Unlike its male counterpart, the female reproductive system is
