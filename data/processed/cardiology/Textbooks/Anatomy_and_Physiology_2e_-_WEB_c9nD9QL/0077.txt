In humans the DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes. CHAPTER OBJECTIVES After studying this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe the fundamental composition of matter • Identify the three subatomic particles • Identify the four most abundant elements in the body • Explain the relationship between an atom’s number of electrons and its relative stability • Distinguish between ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds • Explain how energy is invested, stored, and released via chemical reactions, particularly those reactions that are critical to life • Explain the importance of the inorganic compounds that contribute to life, such as water, salts, acids, and bases • Compare and contrast the four important classes of organic (carbon-based) compounds—proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids—according to their composition and functional importance to human life INTRODUCTION The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements. In fact, chemicals called nucleotide bases are the foundation of
