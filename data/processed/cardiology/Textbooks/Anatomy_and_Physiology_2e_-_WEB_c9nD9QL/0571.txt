will also be seen. Because of the communication between the oral and nasal cavities, a cleft palate makes it very difficult for an infant to generate the suckling needed for nursing, thus leaving the infant at risk for malnutrition. Surgical repair is required to correct cleft palate defects. 242 7 • Axial Skeleton Zygomatic Bone Thezygomatic boneis also known as the cheekbone. Each of the paired zygomatic bones forms much of the lateral wall of the orbit and the lateral-inferior margins of the anterior orbital opening (seeFigure 7.4). The short temporal process of the zygomatic bone projects posteriorly, where it forms the anterior portion of the zygomatic arch (see Figure 7.5). Nasal Bone Thenasal boneis one of two small bones that articulate (join) with each other to form the bony base (bridge) of the nose. They also support the cartilages that form the lateral walls of the nose (seeFigure 7.11). These are the bones that are damaged when the nose is broken. Lacrimal Bone Eachlacrimal boneis a small, rectangular bone that forms the anterior, medial wall of the orbit (seeFigure 7.4and Figure 7.5). The anterior portion of the lacrimal bone forms a shallow depression called thelacrimal fossa, and extending inferiorly
