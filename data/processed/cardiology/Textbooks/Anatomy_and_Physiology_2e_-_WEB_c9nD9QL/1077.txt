Anatomy and Physiology

originate on the pelvic girdle and insert into the femur. The muscles that move the lower leg typically originate on the femur and insert into the bones of the knee joint. The anterior muscles of the femur extend the lower leg but also aid in flexing the thigh. The posterior muscles of the femur flex the lower leg but also aid in extending the thigh. A combination of gluteal and thigh muscles also adduct, abduct, and rotate the thigh and lower leg. 434 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.30 Gluteal Region Muscles That Move the Femur Thetensor fascia lataeis a thick, squarish muscle in the superior aspect of the lateral thigh. It acts as a synergist of the gluteus medius and iliopsoas in flexing and abducting the thigh. It also helps stabilize the lateral aspect of the Access for free at openstax.org 11.6 • Appendicular Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limbs 435 knee by pulling on theiliotibial tract(band), making it taut.

Theadductor longus,adductor brevis, andadductor magnuscan both medially and laterally rotate the thigh depending on the placement of the foot.
