A similar process occurs involving MALT in the mucosa and submucosa of the appendix. A blockage of the lumen triggers these cells to elicit an inflammatory response that can lead to appendicitis. FIGURE21.11 Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Nodule LM × 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School © 2012) Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)consists of lymphoid follicular structures with an overlying epithelial layer found along the bifurcations of the bronchi, and between bronchi and arteries. They also have the typically less-organized structure of other lymphoid nodules. These tissues, in addition to the tonsils, are effective against inhaled pathogens. 21.2 Barrier Defenses and the Innate Immune Response LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the barrier defenses of the body • Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps
