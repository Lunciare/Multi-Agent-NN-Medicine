the joints. Epithelial membranes are formed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of Connective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many connective tissue. There are three types of epithelial cell shapes and tissue architecture. Structurally, all membranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous, connective tissues contain cells that are embedded in which secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the an extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The skin. chemical nature and physical layout of the extracellular matrix and proteins vary enormously among tissues, 4.2Epithelial Tissue reflecting the variety of functions that connective In epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little tissue fulfills in the body. Connective tissues separate or no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina and cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or that separates the epithelium from underlying tissue. traumatic injury. Connect tissues provide support and The main functions of epithelia are protection from the assist movement, store and transport energy environment, coverage, secretion and excretion, molecules, protect against infections, and contribute to absorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by temperature homeostasis. tight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They Many different cells contribute to the formation of can also be connected by gap junctions,
