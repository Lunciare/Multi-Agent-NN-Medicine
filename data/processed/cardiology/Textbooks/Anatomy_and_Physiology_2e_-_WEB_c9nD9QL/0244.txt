region with the sequence AGTGCCT, then the sequence of the complementary strand would be TCACGGA. FIGURE3.23 Molecular Structure of DNA The DNA double helix is composed of two complementary strands. The strands are bonded together via their nitrogenous base pairs using hydrogen bonds. DNA replicationis the copying of DNA that occurs before cell division can take place. After a great deal of debate and experimentation, the general method of DNA replication was deduced in 1958 by two scientists in California, Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl. This method is illustrated inFigure 3.24and described below. 102 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization FIGURE3.24 DNA Replication DNA replication faithfully duplicates the entire genome of the cell. During DNA replication, a number of different enzymes work together to pull apart the two strands so each strand can be used as a template to synthesize new complementary strands. The two new daughter DNA molecules each contain one pre-existing strand and one newly synthesized strand. Thus, DNA replication is said to be “semiconservative.” Stage 1: Initiation.The two complementary strands are separated, much like unzipping a zipper. Special enzymes, includinghelicase, untwist and separate the two strands of DNA. Stage 2: Elongation.Each strand becomes a template along
