contains various form chromosomes. dissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell There is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your contains an array of cellular organelles, each one body. The result is billions of new cells being created performing a unique function and helping to maintain each day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must the health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and replicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will organelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm. receive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A Most organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane variety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication. similar to the cell membrane of the cell. The These enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and the two strands, and assist with the building of lysosomes share a functional connectivity and are complementary strands along each parent strand. The collectively referred to as the endomembrane system. original DNA strands serve as templates from which There are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are the smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid determined and synthesized. When replication
