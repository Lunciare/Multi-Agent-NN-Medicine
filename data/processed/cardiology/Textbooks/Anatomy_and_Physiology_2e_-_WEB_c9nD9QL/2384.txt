are two chains in the T cell receptor, and each chain consists of two domains. Thevariable region domainis furthest away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between receptors. In contrast, theconstant region domainhas less variation. The differences in the amino acid sequences of the variable domains are the molecular basis of the diversity of antigens the receptor can recognize. Thus, the antigen-binding site of the receptor consists of the terminal ends of both receptor chains, and the amino acid sequences of those two areas combine to determine its antigenic specificity. Each T cell produces only one type of receptor and thus is specific for a single particular antigen. Antigens Antigens on pathogens are usually large and complex, and consist of many antigenic determinants. Anantigenic determinant(epitope) is one of the small regions within an antigen to which a receptor can bind, and antigenic determinants are limited by the size of the receptor itself. They usually consist of six or fewer amino acid residues in a protein, or one or two sugar moieties in a carbohydrate antigen. Antigenic determinants on a carbohydrate antigen are usually less diverse than on a protein antigen. Carbohydrate
