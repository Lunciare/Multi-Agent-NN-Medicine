Anatomy and Physiology

volumes, the respiratory system also containsanatomical dead space, which is air that is present in the airway that never reaches the alveoli and therefore never participates in gas exchange.Alveolar dead spaceinvolves air found within alveoli that are unable to function, such as those affected by disease or abnormal blood flow.Total dead spaceis the anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space together, and represents all of the air in the respiratory system that is not being used in the gas exchange process. Respiratory Rate and Control of Ventilation Breathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can consciously control it, such as when you swim under water, sing a song, or blow bubbles. Therespiratory rateis the total number of breaths, or respiratory cycles, that occur each minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease, as the rate may increase or decrease during an illness or in a disease condition. The respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center located within the medulla oblongata in the brain, which responds primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the blood. The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year
