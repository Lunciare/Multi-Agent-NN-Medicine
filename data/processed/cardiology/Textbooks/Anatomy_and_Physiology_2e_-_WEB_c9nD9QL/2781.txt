converts the three-carbon pyruvate into a 1070 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule, releasing carbon dioxide and transferring two electrons that combine with NAD+to form NADH. Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle by combining with a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form the six-carbon molecule citrate, or citric acid, at the same time releasing the coenzyme A molecule. The six-carbon citrate molecule is systematically converted to a five-carbon molecule and then a four-carbon molecule, ending with oxaloacetate, the beginning of the cycle. Along the way, each citrate molecule will produce one ATP, one FADH , and three NADH. The FADH and NADH will enter the oxidative phosphorylation system 2 2 located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the Krebs cycle supplies the starting materials to process and break down proteins and fats. To start the Krebs cycle, citrate synthase combines acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon citrate molecule; CoA is subsequently released and can combine with another pyruvate molecule to begin the cycle again. The aconitase enzyme converts citrate into isocitrate. In two successive steps of oxidative decarboxylation, two molecules of CO and two NADH molecules are produced when isocitrate dehydrogenase converts isocitrate into 2
