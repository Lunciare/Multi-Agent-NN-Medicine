Neurons from particular nuclei a readiness to confront the threat or to run away: the in the brain stem or from the lateral horn of the sacral fight-or-flight response. The parasympathetic division spinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to terminal plays the opposite role. When the external environment (intramural) ganglia located close to or within the wall does not present any immediate danger, a restful mode of target effectors.

The postganglionic fibers then contact the target tissues within the organ to release The sympathetic output of the nervous system ACh, which binds to muscarinic receptors to induce originates out of the lateral horn of the thoracolumbar rest-and-digest responses. spinal cord.
