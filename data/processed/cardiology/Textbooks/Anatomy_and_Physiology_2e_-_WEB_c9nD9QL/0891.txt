A vertebrae, which provides the side-to-side rotation of symphysis is where the bones are joined by the head, or at the proximal radioulnar joint between fibrocartilage and the gap between the bones may be the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna, narrow or wide. A narrow symphysis is found at the which allows for rotation of the radius during forearm manubriosternal joint and at the pubic symphysis. A movements. Hinge joints, such as at the elbow, knee, wide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in ankle, or interphalangeal joints between phalanx bones which the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by of the fingers and toes, allow only for bending and an intervertebral disc. straightening of the joint. Pivot and hinge joints are functionally classified as uniaxial joints. 9.4Synovial Joints Condyloid joints are found where the shallow Synovial joints are the most common type of joints in depression of one bone receives a rounded bony area the body. They are characterized by the presence of a formed by one or two bones. Condyloid joints are found joint cavity, inside of which the bones
