What structures forms during prophase? 3.6 Cellular Differentiation LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss how the generalized cells of a developing embryo or the stem cells of an adult organism become differentiated into specialized cells • Distinguish between the categories of stem cells How does a complex organism such as a human develop from a single cell—a fertilized egg—into the vast array of cell types such as nerve cells, muscle cells, and epithelial cells that characterize the adult? Throughout development and adulthood, the process of cellular differentiation leads cells to assume their final morphology and physiology. Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct functions. Stem Cells Astem cellis an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to their potential to differentiate.
