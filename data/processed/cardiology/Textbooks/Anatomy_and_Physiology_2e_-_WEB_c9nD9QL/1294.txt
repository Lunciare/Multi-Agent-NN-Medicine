Anatomy and Physiology

A second set of vessels that supply the CNS are thevertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae. The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through theforamen magnumof the occipital bone. Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into theanterior spinal arterysupplying the anterior aspect of the spinal cord, found along the anterior median fissure. The two vertebral arteries then merge into thebasilar artery, which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum. The left and right internal carotid arteries and branches of the basilar artery all become thecircle of Willis, a confluence of arteries that can maintain perfusion of the brain even if narrowing or a blockage limits flow through one part (Figure 13.15). FIGURE13.15 Circle of Willis The blood supply to the brain enters through the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries, eventually giving rise to the circle of Willis.
