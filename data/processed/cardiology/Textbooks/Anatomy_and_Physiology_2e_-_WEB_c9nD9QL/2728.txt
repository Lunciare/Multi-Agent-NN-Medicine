Anatomy and Physiology

as many iron transport proteins in their intestinal epithelial cells as do males. Calcium—Blood levels of ionic calcium determine the absorption of dietary calcium. When blood levels of ionic calcium drop, parathyroid hormone (PTH) secreted by the parathyroid glands stimulates the release of calcium ions from bone matrices and increases the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. PTH also upregulates the activation of vitamin D in the kidney, which then facilitates intestinal calcium ion absorption. Vitamin Absorption The small intestine absorbs the vitamins that occur naturally in food and supplements. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, Access for free at openstax.org 23.7 • Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look 1047 and K) are absorbed along with dietary lipids in micelles via simple diffusion. This is why you are advised to eat some fatty foods when you take fat-soluble vitamin supplements. Most water-soluble vitamins (including most B vitamins and vitamin C) also are absorbed by simple diffusion. An exception is vitamin B , which is a very large 12 molecule. Intrinsic factor secreted in the stomach binds to vitamin B , preventing its digestion and creating a 12 complex that binds to mucosal receptors in the terminal ileum, where it is
