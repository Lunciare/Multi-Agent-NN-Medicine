acids. Nucleic Acid Digestion The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are found in most of the foods you eat. Two types ofpancreatic nucleaseare responsible for their digestion:deoxyribonuclease, which digests DNA, andribonuclease, which digests RNA. The nucleotides produced by this digestion are further broken down by two intestinal brush border enzymes (nucleosidaseandphosphatase) into pentoses, phosphates, and nitrogenous bases, which can be absorbed through the alimentary canal wall. The large food molecules that must be broken down into subunits are summarizedTable 23.9 Absorbable Food Substances Source Substance Carbohydrates Monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, and fructose Proteins Single amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides TABLE23.9 Access for free at openstax.org 23.7 • Chemical Digestion and Absorption: A Closer Look 1043 Source Substance Triglycerides Monoacylglycerides, glycerol, and free fatty acids Nucleic acids Pentose sugars, phosphates, and nitrogenous bases TABLE23.9 Absorption The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi. The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the alimentary canal processes up to 10 liters of food, liquids, and GI secretions, yet less than one liter enters the large intestine. Almost all ingested food, 80 percent
