Anatomy and Physiology

ischiopubic rami from both sides come together at the pubic symphysis is called thesubpubic angle. Pelvis The pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx (seeFigure 8.12). The pelvis has several important functions. Its primary role is to support the weight of the upper body when sitting and to transfer this weight to the lower limbs when standing. It serves as an attachment point for trunk and lower limb muscles, and also protects the internal pelvic organs. When standing in the anatomical position, the pelvis is tilted anteriorly. In this position, the anterior superior iliac spines and the pubic tubercles lie in the same vertical plane, and the anterior (internal) surface of the sacrum faces forward and downward. The three areas of each hip bone, the ilium, pubis, and ischium, converge centrally to form a deep, cup-shaped cavity called theacetabulum. This is located on the lateral side of the hip bone and is part of the hip joint. The large opening in the anteroinferior hip bone between the ischium and pubis is theobturator foramen. This space is largely filled in by a layer of connective tissue and serves for the attachment of
