This is a composite of MRI images (posterior) root and sends information out through taken of the brains of people from 5 years of age the fibers of the ventral (anterior) root. As through 20 years of age, demonstrating how the discussed in this video, these connections cerebrum changes. As the color changes to blue, represent the interactions of the CNS with the ratio of gray matter to white matter changes. peripheral structures for both sensory and motor The caption for the video describes it as “less gray functions. The cervical and lumbar spinal cords matter,” which is another way of saying “more white have enlargements as a result of larger populations matter.” If the brain does not finish developing until of neurons. What are these enlargements approximately 20 years of age, can teenagers be responsible for? held responsible
