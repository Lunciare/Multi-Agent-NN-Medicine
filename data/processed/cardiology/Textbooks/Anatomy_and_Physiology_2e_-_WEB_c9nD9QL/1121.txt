Anatomy and Physiology

which can be seen as distinct structures. The equivalent structures in the CNS are not obvious from this overall perspective and are best examined in prepared tissue under the microscope. Nervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells. Aglial cellis one of a variety of cells that provide a framework of tissue that supports the neurons and their activities.

To describe the functional divisions of the nervous system, it is important to understand the structure of a neuron. Neurons are cells and therefore have asoma, or cell body, but they also have extensions of the cell; each extension is generally referred to as aprocess. There is one important process that every neuron has called anaxon, which is the fiber that connects a neuron with its target. Another type of process that branches off from the soma is the dendrite. Dendrites are responsible for receiving most of the input from other neurons. Looking at nervous
