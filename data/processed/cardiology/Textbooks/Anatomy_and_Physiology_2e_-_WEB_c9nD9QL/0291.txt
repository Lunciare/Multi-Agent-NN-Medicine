by a transcription process of producing an mRNA cell (determined by the cell’s specific gene molecule that is complementary to a particular gene expression) of DNA reactive oxygen species (ROS) a group of extremely transcription factor one of the proteins that regulate reactive peroxides and oxygen-containing radicals the transcription of genes that may contribute to cellular damage transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules of RNA that serve to receptor protein molecule that contains a binding site bring amino acids to a growing polypeptide strand for another specific molecule (called a ligand) and properly place them into the sequence receptor-mediated endocytosis endocytosis of translation process of producing a protein from the ligands attached to membrane-bound receptors nucleotide sequence code of an mRNA transcript ribosomal RNA (rRNA) RNA that makes up the triplet consecutive sequence of three nucleotides on subunits of a ribosome a DNA molecule that, when transcribed into an ribosome cellular organelle that functions in protein mRNA codon, corresponds to a particular amino synthesis acid RNA polymerase enzyme that unwinds DNA and then unipotent describes the condition of being adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA for committed to a single specialized cell type the transcription phase of protein synthesis
