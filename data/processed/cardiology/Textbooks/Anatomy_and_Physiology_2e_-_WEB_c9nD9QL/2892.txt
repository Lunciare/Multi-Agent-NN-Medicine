is the time to focus on the physiology. You will discover that different parts of the nephron utilize specific processes to produce urine: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. You will learn how each of these processes works and where they occur along the nephron and collecting ducts. The physiologic goal is to modify the composition of the plasma and, in doing so, produce the waste product urine. Failure of the renal anatomy and/or physiology can lead suddenly or gradually to renal failure. In this event, a number of symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings point to the diagnosis (Table 25.3). Symptoms of Kidney Failure Weakness Lethargy Shortness of breath Widespread edema Anemia Metabolic acidosis Metabolic alkalosis Heart arrhythmias Uremia (high urea level in the blood) Loss of appetite TABLE25.3 1126 25 • The Urinary System Fatigue Excessive urination Oliguria (too little urine output) TABLE25.3 Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) The volume of filtrate formed by both kidneys per minute is termed theglomerular filtration rate (GFR). The heart pumps about 5 L blood per min under resting conditions. Approximately 20 percent or one liter enters the kidneys to be filtered. On average, this liter results in the production of about 125 mL/min filtrate produced
