Anatomy and Physiology

whether the fiber is classified as oxidative or glycolytic. If a fiber primarily produces ATP through aerobic pathways it is oxidative. More ATP can be produced during each 378 10 • Muscle Tissue metabolic cycle, making the fiber more resistant to fatigue. Glycolytic fibers primarily create ATP through anaerobic glycolysis, which produces less ATP per cycle. As a result, glycolytic fibers fatigue at a quicker rate. The oxidative fibers contain many more mitochondria than the glycolytic fibers, because aerobic metabolism, which uses oxygen (O ) in the metabolic pathway, occurs in the mitochondria. The SO fibers possess a large number of 2 mitochondria and are capable of contracting for longer periods because of the large amount of ATP they can produce, but they have a relatively small diameter and do not produce a large amount of tension. SO fibers are extensively supplied with blood capillaries to supply O from the red blood cells in the bloodstream. The SO fibers 2 also possess myoglobin, an O -carrying molecule similar to O -carrying hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The 2 2 myoglobin stores some of the needed O within the fibers themselves (and gives SO fibers their red color). All of
