It mediates the attachment of the upper limb to humerus consist of the trochlea medially and the the clavicle, and contributes to the formation of the capitulum laterally. Depressions on the humerus that glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. This triangular bone has accommodate the forearm bones during bending three sides called the medial, lateral, and superior (flexing) and straightening (extending) of the elbow borders. The suprascapular notch is located on the include the coronoid fossa, the radial fossa, and the superior border. The scapula also has three corners, olecranon fossa. two of which are the superior and inferior angles.

The elbow joint is formed acromion. The subscapular fossa is located on the by the articulation between the trochlea of the anterior surface of the scapula. The
