Anatomy and Physiology

short extensions called dendrites, matrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue which receive chemical signals from other neurons, although adipose tissue does not have much and a long tail called an axon, which relays signals extracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is away from the cell to other neurons, muscles, or richer in fibers and may be regular, with fibers oriented glands. Many axons are wrapped by a myelin sheath, a in parallel as in ligaments and tendons, or irregular, lipid derivative that acts as an insulator and speeds up with fibers oriented in several directions. Organ the transmission of the action potential. Other cells in capsules (collagenous type) and walls of arteries the nervous tissue, the neuroglia, include the (elastic type) contain dense irregular connective tissue. astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann Cartilage and bone are supportive tissue. Cartilage cells. contains chondrocytes and is somewhat flexible. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and clear, covers joints, and 4.6Tissue Injury and Aging is found in the growing portion of bones. Fibrocartilage Inflammation is the classic response of the body to is tough because of extra collagen fibers and forms, injury and follows a common sequence of events. The among other things,
