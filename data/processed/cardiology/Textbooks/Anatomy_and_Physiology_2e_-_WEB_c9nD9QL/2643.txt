Anatomy of a Tooth The teeth are secured in the alveolar processes (sockets) of the maxilla and the mandible.Gingivae(commonly called the gums) are soft tissues that line the alveolar processes and surround the necks of the teeth. Teeth are also held in their sockets by a connective tissue called the periodontal ligament. The two main parts of a tooth are thecrown, which is the portion projecting above the gum line, and theroot, which is embedded within the maxilla and mandible. Both parts contain an innerpulp cavity, containing loose connective tissue through which run nerves and blood vessels. The region of the pulp
