Anatomy and Physiology

section, you will be able to: • Relate heart rate to cardiac output • Describe the effect of exercise on heart rate • Identify cardiovascular centers and cardiac reflexes that regulate heart function • Describe factors affecting heart rate • Distinguish between positive and negative factors that affect heart contractility • Summarize factors affecting stroke volume and cardiac output • Describe the cardiac response to variations in blood flow and pressure The autorhythmicity inherent in cardiac cells keeps the heart beating at a regular pace; however, the heart is regulated by and responds to outside influences as well. Neural and endocrine controls are vital to the regulation of cardiac function. In addition, the heart is sensitive to several environmental factors, including electrolytes. Resting Cardiac Output Cardiac output (CO)is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. To calculate this value, multiplystroke volume (SV), the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle, byheart rate (HR), in contractions per minute (or beats per minute, bpm). It can be represented mathematically by the following equation: CO = HR × SV SV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV
