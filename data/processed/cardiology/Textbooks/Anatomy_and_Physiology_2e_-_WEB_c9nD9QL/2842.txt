Anatomy and Physiology

are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The starvation, or low carbohydrate diets, glucose can be nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is synthesized from lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, or converted to urea in the urea acid cycle and eliminated glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is in the urine. In times of starvation, amino acids can be almost the reverse of glycolysis and serves to create used as an energy source and processed through the glucose molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such Krebs cycle. as the brain, when glucose levels fall below normal. 24.5Metabolic States of the Body 24.3Lipid Metabolism There are three main metabolic states of the body: Lipids are available to the body from three sources. absorptive (fed), postabsorptive (fasting), and They can be ingested in the diet, stored in the adipose starvation. During any given day, your metabolism tissue of the body, or synthesized in the liver. Fats switches between absorptive and postabsorptive ingested in the diet are digested in the small intestine. states. Starvation states happen very rarely in generally The triglycerides are broken down into monoglycerides well-nourished individuals. When the body is fed, and free fatty acids, then imported across the intestinal glucose,
