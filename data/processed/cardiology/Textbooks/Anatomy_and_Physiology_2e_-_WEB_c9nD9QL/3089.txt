Anatomy and Physiology

menopause (the cessation of a female's reproductive functions). The number of primary oocytes present in the ovaries declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause. The initiation ofovulation—the release of an oocyte from the ovary—marks the transition from puberty into reproductive maturity. From then on, throughout a the reproductive years, ovulation occurs approximately once every 28 days. Just prior to ovulation, a surge of luteinizing hormone triggers the resumption of meiosis in a primary oocyte. This initiates the transition from primary to secondary oocyte. However, as you can see inFigure 27.11, this cell division does not result in two identical cells. Instead, the cytoplasm is divided unequally, and one daughter cell is much larger than the other. This larger cell, the secondary oocyte, eventually leaves the ovary during ovulation. The smaller cell, called the firstpolar body, may or may not complete meiosis and produce second polar bodies; in either case, it eventually disintegrates. Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives. 1200 27 • The Reproductive System FIGURE27.11 Oogenesis The unequal cell division of oogenesis produces one to three polar bodies that later
