designed to replace damaged cells of different body tissues. In contrast, adult stem cells isolated from a patient are not seen as foreign by the body, but they have a limited range of differentiation. Some individuals bank the cord blood or deciduous teeth of their child, storing away those sources of stem cells for future use, should their child need it. Induced pluripotent stem cells are considered a promising advance in the field because using them avoids the legal, ethical, and immunological pitfalls of embryonic stem cells. 116 3 • Key Terms Key Terms active transport form of transport across the cell perform their functions membrane that requires input of cellular energy cytokinesis final stage in cell division, where the amphipathic describes a molecule that exhibits a cytoplasm divides to form two separate daughter difference in polarity between its two ends, cells resulting in a difference in water solubility cytoplasm internal material between the cell anaphase third stage of mitosis (and meiosis), during membrane and nucleus of a cell, mainly consisting which sister chromatids separate into two new of a water-based fluid called cytosol, within which nuclear regions of a dividing cell are all the other organelles and cellular solute
