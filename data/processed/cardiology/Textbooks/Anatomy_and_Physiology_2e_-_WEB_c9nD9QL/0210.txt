ions—across the membrane, usually against their concentration gradients (from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration). Thesodium-potassium pump, which is also called Na+/K+ATPase, transports sodium out of a cell while moving potassium into the cell. The Na+/K+pump is an important ion pump found in the membranes of many types of cells. These pumps are particularly abundant in nerve cells, which are constantly pumping out sodium ions and pulling in potassium ions to maintain an electrical gradient across their cell membranes. Anelectrical gradientis a difference in electrical charge across a space. In the case of nerve cells, for example, the electrical gradient exists between the inside and outside of the cell, with the inside being negatively-charged (at around -70 mV) relative to the outside. The negative electrical gradient is maintained because each Na+/K+pump moves three Na+ions out of the cell and two K+ions into the cell for each ATP molecule that is used (Figure 3.9). This process is so important for nerve cells that it accounts for the majority of their ATP usage. FIGURE3.9 Sodium-Potassium Pump The sodium-potassium pump is found in many cell (plasma) membranes. Powered by ATP, the pump moves sodium and potassium ions in
