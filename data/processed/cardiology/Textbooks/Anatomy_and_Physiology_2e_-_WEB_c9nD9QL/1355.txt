unique circle of Willis that provides responsible for motor functions, from planning constant perfusion of the brain even if one of the blood movements through executing commands to be sent to vessels is blocked or narrowed. That blood is the spinal cord and periphery. The most anterior eventually filtered to make a separate medium, the portion of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex, CSF, that circulates within the spaces of the brain and which is associated with aspects of personality through then into the surrounding space defined by the its influence on motor responses in decision-making. meninges, the protective covering of the brain and The other lobes are responsible for sensory functions. spinal cord. The parietal lobe is where somatosensation is The blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is processed. The occipital lobe is where visual behind the glial-cell–enforced blood-brain barrier, processing begins, although the other parts of the brain which limits the exchange of material from blood can contribute to visual function. The temporal lobe vessels with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue. contains the cortical area for auditory processing, but Thus, metabolic wastes are collected in cerebrospinal also has regions crucial for memory formation.
