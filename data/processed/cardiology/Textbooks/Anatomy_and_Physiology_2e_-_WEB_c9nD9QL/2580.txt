The conducting zone consists of all of the structures that provide passageways for air to The respiratory system is responsible for obtaining travel into and out of the lungs: the nasal cavity, oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide, and aiding in pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and most bronchioles. The speech production and in sensing odors. From a nasal passages contain the conchae and meatuses that functional perspective,
