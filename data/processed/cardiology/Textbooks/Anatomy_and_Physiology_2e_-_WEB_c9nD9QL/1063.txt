• Identify the muscles of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs • Identify the movement and function of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb can be divided into four groups: muscles that stabilize and position the pectoral girdle, muscles that move the arm, muscles that move the forearm, and muscles that move the wrists, hands, and fingers. Thepectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, consists of the lateral ends of the clavicle and scapula, along with the proximal end of the humerus, and the muscles covering these three bones to stabilize the shoulder joint. The girdle creates a base from which the head of the humerus, in its ball-and-socket joint with the glenoid fossa of the scapula, can move the arm in multiple directions. Muscles That Position the Pectoral Girdle Muscles that position the pectoral girdle are located either on the anterior thorax or on the posterior thorax (Figure 11.22andTable 11.8). The anterior muscles include thesubclavius,pectoralis minor, andserratus anterior. The posterior muscles include thetrapezius,rhomboid major, andrhomboid minor. When the rhomboids are contracted, your scapula moves medially, which can pull the shoulder and upper limb posteriorly. 422 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.22 Muscles That Position
