• Central Control 607 The second underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension is autonomic failure. There are several disorders that result in compromised sympathetic functions. The disorders range from diabetes to multiple system atrophy (a loss of control over many systems in the body), and addressing the underlying condition can improve the hypotension. For example, with diabetes, peripheral nerve damage can occur, which would affect the postganglionic sympathetic fibers. Getting blood glucose levels under control can improve neurological deficits associated with diabetes. 15.3 Central Control LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the role of higher centers of the brain in autonomic regulation • Explain the connection of the hypothalamus to homeostasis • Describe the regions of the CNS that link the autonomic system with emotion • Describe the pathways important to descending control of the autonomic system The pupillary light reflex (Figure 15.10) begins when light hits the retina and causes a signal to travel along the optic nerve. This is visual sensation, because the afferent branch of this reflex is simply sharing the special sense pathway. Bright light hitting the retina leads to the parasympathetic response, through the oculomotor nerve, followed
