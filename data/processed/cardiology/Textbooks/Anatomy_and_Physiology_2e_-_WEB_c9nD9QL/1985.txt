Anatomy and Physiology

blood through the pulmonary and systemic circuits is critical to all health professions (Figure 19.4). FIGURE19.4 Dual System of the Human Blood Circulation Blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, where it is 756 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart pumped into the pulmonary circuit. The blood in the pulmonary artery branches is low in oxygen but relatively high in carbon dioxide. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary capillaries (oxygen into the blood, carbon dioxide out), and blood high in oxygen and low in carbon dioxide is returned to the left atrium. From here, blood enters the left ventricle, which pumps it into the systemic circuit. Following exchange in the systemic capillaries (oxygen and nutrients out of the capillaries and carbon dioxide and wastes in), blood returns to the right atrium and the cycle is repeated. Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers Our exploration of more in-depth heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the heart, the prominent surface features of the heart, and the layers that form the wall of the heart. Each of these components plays its own unique role in terms of function. Membranes The membrane that directly surrounds the heart and
