reactants in a synthesis reaction that yields ammonia as the product. The general equation for a synthesis reaction is Access for free at openstax.org 2.3 • Chemical Reactions 53 FIGURE2.12 The Three Fundamental Chemical Reactions The atoms and molecules involved in the three fundamental chemical reactions can be imagined as words. In the second example, ammonia is catabolized into its smaller components, and the potential energy that had been stored in its bonds is released. Such reactions are referred to as decomposition reactions. Adecomposition reactionis a chemical reaction that breaks down or “de-composes” something larger into its constituent parts (see Figure 2.12b). The general equation for a decomposition reaction is: . Anexchange reactionis a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are both formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (seeFigure 2.12c). The simplest form of an exchange reaction might be: . Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to break apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex exchange reaction might be: . Another example might be: . In theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either
