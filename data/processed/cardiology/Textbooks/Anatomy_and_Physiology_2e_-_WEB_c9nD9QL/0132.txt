their hydrogenionsremain bonded within a compound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a proton.

Nearly every molecule of a strong acid dissociates, producing a high concentration of H+. (b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and cations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–. Bases Abaseis a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+already present in solution (seeFigure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine with H+present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases release most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food mixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract after the stomach, if it were not for
