Anatomy and Physiology

vein, as the name suggests, drains blood from the deeper portions of the thigh. Thefemoral circumflex veinforms a loop around the femur just inferior to the trochanters and drains blood from the areas in proximity to the head and neck of the femur. As thefemoral veinpenetrates the body wall from the femoral portion of the upper limb, it becomes theexternal iliac vein, a large vein that drains blood from the leg to the common iliac vein. The pelvic organs and integument drain into theinternal iliac vein, which forms from several smaller veins in the region, including the umbilical veins that run on either side of the bladder. The external and internal iliac veins combine near the inferior portion of the sacroiliac joint to form the common iliac vein. In addition to blood supply from the external and internal iliac veins, themiddle sacral veindrains the sacral region into thecommon iliac vein. Similar to the common iliac arteries, the common iliac veins come together at the level of L5 to form the inferior vena cava.
