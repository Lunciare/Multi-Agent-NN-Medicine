• Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity 779 FIGURE19.22 Standard Placement of ECG Leads In a 12-lead ECG, six electrodes are placed on the chest, and four electrodes are placed on the limbs. A normal ECG tracing is presented inFigure 19.23. Each component, segment, and interval is labeled and corresponds to important electrical events, demonstrating the relationship between these events and contraction in the heart. There are five prominent points on the ECG: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. The smallP wave represents the depolarization of the atria. The atria begin contracting approximately 25 ms after the start of the P wave. The largeQRS complexrepresents the depolarization of the ventricles, which requires a much stronger electrical signal because of the larger size of the ventricular cardiac muscle. The ventricles begin to contract as the QRS reaches the peak of the R wave. Lastly, theT waverepresents the repolarization of the ventricles. The repolarization of the atria occurs during the QRS complex, which masks it on an ECG. The major segments and intervals of an ECG tracing are indicated inFigure 19.23. Segments are defined as the regions between two waves. Intervals include one segment plus one or more waves.
