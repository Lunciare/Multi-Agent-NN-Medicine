dorsal column is separated into two component tracts, thefasciculus gracilisthat contains axons from the legs and lower body, and thefasciculus cuneatusthat contains axons from the upper body and arms. The axons in the dorsal column terminate in the nuclei of the medulla, where each synapses with the second neuron in their respective pathway. Thenucleus gracilisis the target of fibers in the fasciculus gracilis, whereas the nucleus cuneatusis the target of fibers in the fasciculus cuneatus. The second neuron in the system projects from one of the two nuclei and thendecussates, or crosses the midline of the medulla. These axons then continue to 560 14 • The Somatic Nervous System ascend the brain stem as a bundle called themedial lemniscus. These axons terminate in the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in their respective pathway. The third neuron in the system projects its axons to the postcentral gyrus of the cerebral cortex, where somatosensory stimuli are initially processed and the conscious perception of the stimulus occurs. The spinothalamic tract also begins with neurons in a dorsal root ganglion. These neurons extend their axons to the dorsal horn, where they synapse with the second neuron in their respective pathway.
