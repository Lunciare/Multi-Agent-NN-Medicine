Anatomy and Physiology

allow easy entry of fluid. In the small intestine, lymphatic capillaries called lacteals are critical for the transport of dietary lipids and lipid- soluble vitamins to the bloodstream. In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides combine with other lipids and proteins, and enter the lacteals to form a milky fluid calledchyle. The chyle then travels through the lymphatic system, eventually entering the bloodstream. Larger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts The lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic structure and the presence of valves. These one-way valves are located fairly close to one another, and each one causes a bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the vessels a beaded appearance (seeFigure 21.3). The superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger lymphatic vessels known aslymphatic trunks. On the right side of the body, the right sides of the head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right subclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct (Figure 21.4).
