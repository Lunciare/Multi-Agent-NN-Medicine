genes located on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair (Figure 28.28). Recall that a male has one X and one Y chromosome. When a male transmits a Y chromosome, the child is male, and when a male parent transmits an X chromosome, the child is female. A female can transmit only an X chromosome, as both her sex chromosomes are X chromosomes. When an abnormal allele for a gene that occurs on the X chromosome is dominant over the normal allele, the pattern is described asX-linked dominant. This is the case with vitamin D–resistant rickets: an affected male would pass the disease gene to all of the female offspring, but none of the male offspring, because the male transmits only the Y chromosome to male offspring (seeFigure 28.28a). If it is the female parent who is affected, all of the offspring—male or female—would have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder because the female parent can only pass an X chromosome on to children (seeFigure 28.28b). For an affected female, the inheritance pattern would be identical to that of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in which one parent is heterozygous and the other is homozygous for the normal
