Condyloid joints are found joint cavity, inside of which the bones of the joint at the base of the fingers (metacarpophalangeal joints) articulate with each other. The articulating surfaces of and at the wrist (radiocarpal joint). At a saddle joint, the bones at a synovial joint are not directly connected the articulating bones fit together like a rider and a to each other by connective tissue or cartilage, which saddle. An example is the first carpometacarpal joint allows the bones to move freely against each other. The located at the base of the thumb. Both condyloid and walls of the joint cavity are formed by the articular saddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial joints. capsule. Friction between the bones is reduced by a thin layer of articular cartilage covering the surfaces of Plane joints are formed between the small, flattened the bones, and by a lubricating synovial fluid, which is surfaces of adjacent bones. These joints allow the secreted by the synovial membrane. bones to slide or rotate against each other, but the range of motion is usually slight and
