Anatomy and Physiology

vein is the most common site for drawing venous blood in humans. The basilic vein continues through the arm medially and superficially to the axillary vein. Thecephalic veinbegins in the antebrachium and drains blood from the superficial surface of the arm into the axillary vein. It is extremely superficial and easily seen along the surface of the biceps brachii muscle in individuals with good muscle tone and in those without excessive subcutaneous adipose tissue in the arms. Thesubscapular veindrains blood from the subscapular region and joins the cephalic vein to form theaxillary vein. As it passes through the body wall and enters the thorax, the axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein. Many of the larger veins of the thoracic and abdominal region and upper limb are further represented in the flow chart inFigure 20.39.Table 20.14summarizes the veins of the upper limbs. 870 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.38 Veins of the Upper Limb This anterior view shows the veins that drain the upper limb.
