The valves prevent backflow of blood. Failure of the valves to operate properly produces turbulent The heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine blood flow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur control, yet it is capable of initiating its own action can often be heard with a stethoscope. potential followed by muscular contraction.
