body that experience the maximum mechanical stress (Figure 5.13). In addition, the nail body forms a back-support for picking up small objects with the fingers. The nail body is composed of densely packed dead keratinocytes. The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form. The nail body forms at thenail root, which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables the nail to grow continuously. The lateralnail foldoverlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The nail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms thenail cuticle, also called theeponychium. The nail bed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail matrix forms a crescent-shaped region called thelunula(the “little moon”). The area beneath the free edge of the nail, furthest from the cuticle, is called thehyponychium. It consists of a thickened layer of stratum corneum.
