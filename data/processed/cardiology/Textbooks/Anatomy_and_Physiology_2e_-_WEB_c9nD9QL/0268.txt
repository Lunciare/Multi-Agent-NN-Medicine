Control As the cell proceeds through its cycle, each phase involves certain processes that must be completed before the cell should advance to the next phase. Acheckpointis a point in the cell cycle at which the cycle can be signaled to move forward or stopped. At each of these checkpoints, different varieties of molecules provide the stop or go Access for free at openstax.org 3.5 • Cell Growth and Division 111 signals, depending on certain conditions within the cell. Acyclinis one of the primary classes of cell cycle control molecules (Figure 3.33). Acyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)is one of a group of molecules that work together with cyclins to determine progression past cell checkpoints. By interacting with many additional molecules, these triggers push the cell cycle forward unless prevented from doing so by “stop” signals, if for some reason the cell is not ready. At the G checkpoint, the cell must be ready for DNA synthesis to occur. At the G checkpoint the cell 1 2 must be fully prepared for mitosis. Even during mitosis, a crucial stop and go checkpoint in metaphase ensures that the cell is fully prepared to complete cell division. The metaphase checkpoint ensures that all sister chromatids
