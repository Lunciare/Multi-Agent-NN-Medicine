Anatomy and Physiology

24 liters per day are filtered, whereas 20.4 liters are reabsorbed. This excess fluid is picked up by capillaries of the lymphatic system. These extremely thin-walled vessels have copious numbers of valves that ensure unidirectional flow through ever-larger lymphatic vessels that eventually drain into the subclavian veins in the neck. An important function of the lymphatic system is to return the fluid (lymph) to the blood. Lymph may be thought of as recycledblood plasma. (Seek additional content for more detail on the lymphatic system.) INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( explore capillaries and how they function in the body. Capillaries are never more than 100 micrometers away. What is the main component of interstitial fluid? 20.4 Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of vascular homeostasis • Describe the contribution of a variety of hormones to the renal regulation of blood pressure • Identify the effects of exercise on vascular homeostasis • Discuss how hypertension, hemorrhage, and circulatory shock affect vascular health In order to maintain homeostasis in the cardiovascular system and provide adequate blood to the tissues, blood Access for
