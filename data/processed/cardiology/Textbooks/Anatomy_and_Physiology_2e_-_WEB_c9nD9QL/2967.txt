Anatomy and Physiology

The role in regulating the rate at which the blood is filtered. PCT is the most metabolically active part of the Specialized cells in the JGA produce paracrine signals nephron and uses a wide array of protein to regulate blood flow and filtration rates of the micromachines to maintain homeostasis—symporters, glomerulus. Other JGA cells produce the enzyme renin, antiporters, and ATPase active transporters—in which plays a central role in blood pressure regulation. conjunction with diffusion, both simple and facilitated. The filtrate enters the PCT where absorption and Almost 100 percent of glucose, amino acids, and secretion of several substances occur. The descending vitamins are recovered in the PCT. Bicarbonate (HCO –) 3 and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle consist of is recovered using the same enzyme, carbonic thick and thin segments. Absorption and secretion anhydrase (CA), found in erythrocytes. The recovery of continue in the DCT but to a lesser extent than in the solutes creates an osmotic gradient to promote the PCT. Each collecting duct collects forming urine from recovery of water. The descending loop of the several nephrons and responds to the posterior juxtaglomerular nephrons reaches an osmolarity of up pituitary hormone ADH by inserting aquaporin
