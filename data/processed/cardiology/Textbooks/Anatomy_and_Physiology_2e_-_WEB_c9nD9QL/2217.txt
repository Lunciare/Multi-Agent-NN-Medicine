disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of the body), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure. INTERACTIVE LINK Listen to this CDCpodcast( learn about hypertension, often described as a “silent killer.” What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke? Hemorrhage Minor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by hemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing blood pressure and maintaining blood flow. Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either through physiological processes or through medical intervention. In response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic responses to increase cardiac output and vasoconstriction. This typically prompts the heart rate to Access for free at openstax.org 20.4 • Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System 841 increase to about 180–200 contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular resistance, whereas constriction of the veins increases venous return to the heart. Both of these steps will help increase blood pressure. Sympathetic stimulation also triggers the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which enhance
