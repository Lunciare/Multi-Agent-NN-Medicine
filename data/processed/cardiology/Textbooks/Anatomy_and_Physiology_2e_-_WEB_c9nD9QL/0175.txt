breaking chemical bonds. Ions are of its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and charged atoms that form when an atom donates or neutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the accepts one or more negatively charged electrons. number of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass Cations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to number. Heavier and lighter versions of the same anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is element can occur in nature because these versions called an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the have different numbers of neutrons. Different versions participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but of an element are called isotopes. rather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent The tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear Access for free at openstax.org 2 • Chapter Review 77 three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar The pH of any solution is its relative concentration of covalent bonds have “poles”—regions of weakly H+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH positive and negative charge—and have a triangular below 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are three-dimensional
