times to meet the needs of the body.Anabolic hormonesare required for the synthesis of molecules and include growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, insulin, testosterone, and estrogen.Table 24.1summarizes the function of each of the catabolic hormones and Table 24.2summarizes the functions of the anabolic hormones. Catabolic Hormones Hormone Function Released from the adrenal gland in response to stress; its main role is to increase blood glucose Cortisol levels by gluconeogenesis (breaking down fats and proteins) Released from alpha cells in the pancreas either when starving or when the body needs to generate additional energy; it stimulates the breakdown of glycogen in the liver to increase blood Glucagon glucose levels; its effect is the opposite of insulin; glucagon and insulin are a part of a negative- feedback system that stabilizes blood glucose levels Released in response to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system; increases heart rate Adrenaline/ and heart contractility, constricts blood vessels, is a bronchodilator that opens (dilates) the epinephrine bronchi of the lungs to increase air volume in the lungs, and stimulates gluconeogenesis TABLE24.1 Anabolic Hormones Hormone Function Growth Synthesized and released from the pituitary gland; stimulates the growth of cells, tissues, and hormone bones (GH) Insulin-like growth Stimulates
