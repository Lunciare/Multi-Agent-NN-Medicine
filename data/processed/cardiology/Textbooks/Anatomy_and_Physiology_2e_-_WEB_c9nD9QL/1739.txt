and control is critical for homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the endocrine system. 17.1 An Overview of the Endocrine System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Distinguish the types of intercellular communication, their importance, mechanisms, and effects • Identify the major organs and tissues of the endocrine system and their location in the body Communication is a process in which a sender transmits signals to one or more receivers to control and coordinate actions. In the human body, two major organ systems participate in relatively “long distance” communication: the nervous system and the endocrine system. Together, these two systems are primarily responsible for maintaining 662 17 • The Endocrine System homeostasis in the body. Neural and Endocrine Signaling The nervous system uses two types of intercellular communication—electrical and chemical signaling—either by the direct action of an electrical potential, or in the latter case, through the action of chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Neurotransmitters act locally and rapidly. When an electrical signal in the form of an action potential arrives at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending neuron and a
