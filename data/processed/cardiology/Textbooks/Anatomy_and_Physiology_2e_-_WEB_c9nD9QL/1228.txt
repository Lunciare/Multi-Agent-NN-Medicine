Anatomy and Physiology

of the electrical signal is unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron the controlled distribution of ions across the ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a membrane. Transmembrane ion channels regulate generator potential because it can directly generate when ions can move in or out of the cell, so that a the action potential in the initial segment of the axon. If precise signal is generated. This signal is the action the sensory stimulus is received by a specialized potential which has a very characteristic shape based sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a on voltage changes across the membrane in a given receptor potential. Graded potentials produced by time period. interactions between neurons at synapses are called The membrane is normally at rest with established Na+ postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded and K+concentrations on either side. A stimulus will potential at a synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a start the depolarization of the membrane, and voltage- hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called gated channels will result in further depolarization an inhibitory PSP. followed by repolarization of the membrane. A slight Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which overshoot
