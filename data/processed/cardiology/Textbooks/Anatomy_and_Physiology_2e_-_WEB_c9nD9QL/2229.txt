Anatomy and Physiology

Left and right vessels that form from the pulmonary trunk and lead to smaller arterioles and arteries eventually to the pulmonary capillaries Pulmonary Two sets of paired vessels—one pair on each side—that are formed from the small venules, leading veins away from the pulmonary capillaries to flow into the left atrium TABLE20.4 Overview of Systemic Arteries Blood relatively high in oxygen concentration is returned from the pulmonary circuit to the left atrium via the four pulmonary veins. From the left atrium, blood moves into the left ventricle, which pumps blood into the aorta. The aorta and its branches—the systemic arteries—send blood to virtually every organ of the body (Figure 20.24). 846 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.24 Systemic Arteries The major systemic arteries shown here deliver oxygenated blood throughout the body. The Aorta Theaortais the largest artery in the body (Figure 20.25). It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries. The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm and a landmark that divides
