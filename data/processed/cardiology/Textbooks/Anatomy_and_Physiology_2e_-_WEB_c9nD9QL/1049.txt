The back muscles stabilize and move the vertebral column, and are grouped according to the lengths and direction of the fascicles. Thespleniusmuscles originate at the midline and run laterally and superiorly to their insertions. From the sides and the back of the neck, thesplenius capitisinserts onto the head region, and thesplenius cervicisextends onto the cervical region. These muscles can extend the head, laterally
