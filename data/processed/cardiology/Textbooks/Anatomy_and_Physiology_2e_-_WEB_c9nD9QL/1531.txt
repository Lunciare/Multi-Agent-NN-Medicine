of the human body, so a researcher can use them without any confoundingendogenous results (results caused by the molecules produced in the body). The adrenergic system also has two types of receptors, named thealpha (α)-adrenergic receptorandbeta (β)- adrenergic receptor. Unlike cholinergic receptors, these receptor types are not classified by which drugs can bind to them. All of them are G protein–coupled receptors. There are two types of α-adrenergic receptors, termed α , and 1 α , and there are three types of β-adrenergic receptors, termed β , β and β . An additional aspect of the adrenergic 2 1 2 3 system is that there is a second signaling molecule calledepinephrine. The chemical difference between norepinephrine and epinephrine is the addition of a methyl group (CH ) in epinephrine. The prefix “nor-” actually 3 refers to this chemical difference, in which a methyl group is missing. The term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response described at the beginning of the chapter. Adrenaline and epinephrine are two names for the same molecule. The adrenal gland (in Latin, ad- = “on top of”; renal = “kidney”) secretes adrenaline. The ending “-ine” refers to
