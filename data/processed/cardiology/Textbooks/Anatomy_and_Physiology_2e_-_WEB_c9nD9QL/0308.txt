degree of organization among different types of cells in the tissue of the cervix. You can also see how that organization breaks down when cancer takes over the regular mitotic functioning of a cell. The variety in shape reflects the many different roles that cells fulfill in your body. The human body starts as a single cell at fertilization. As this fertilized egg divides, it gives rise to trillions of cells, each built from the same blueprint, but organizing into tissues and becoming irreversibly committed to a developmental pathway. 126 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization 4.1 Types of Tissues LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the four main tissue types • Discuss the functions of each tissue type • Relate the structure of each tissue type to their function • Discuss the embryonic origin of tissue • Identify the three major germ layers • Identify the main types of tissue membranes The termtissueis used to describe a group of cells found together in the body. The cells within a tissue share a common embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features and are
