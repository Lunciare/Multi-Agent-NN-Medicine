Commons) The wall of the hair follicle is made of three concentric layers of cells. The cells of theinternal root sheathsurround the root of the growing hair and extend just up to the hair shaft. They are derived from the basal cells of the hair matrix. Theexternal root sheath, which is an extension of the epidermis, encloses the hair root. It is made of basal cells at the base of the hair root and tends to be more keratinous in the upper regions. Theglassy membraneis a thick, clear connective tissue sheath covering the hair root, connecting it to the tissue of the dermis. INTERACTIVE LINK The hair follicle is made of multiple layers of cells that form from basal cells in the hair matrix and the hair root. Cells of the hair matrix divide and differentiate to form the layers of the hair. Watch thisvideo( follicle)to learn more about hair follicles. Hair serves a variety of functions, including protection, sensory input, thermoregulation, and communication. For example, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. The hair in the nose and ears, and around the eyes (eyelashes) defends the body by trapping and excluding dust particles that may contain
