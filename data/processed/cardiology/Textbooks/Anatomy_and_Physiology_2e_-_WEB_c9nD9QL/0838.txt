bone. Thumb opposition is produced by a combination of flexion and abduction of the thumb at this joint. Returning the thumb to its anatomical position next to the index finger is calledreposition (seeFigure 9.13l). Movements of the Joints Type of Movement Example Joint Atlantoaxial joint (C1–C2 vertebrae Pivot Uniaxial joint; allows rotational movement articulation); proximal radioulnar joint Uniaxial joint; allows flexion/extension Knee; elbow; ankle; interphalangeal joints of Hinge movements fingers and toes Metacarpophalangeal (knuckle) joints of Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/ Condyloid fingers; radiocarpal joint of wrist; adduction, and circumduction movements metatarsophalangeal joints for toes Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/ First carpometacarpal joint of the thumb; Saddle adduction, and circumduction movements sternoclavicular joint Multiaxial joint; allows inversion and eversion of Intertarsal joints of foot; superior-inferior Plane foot, or flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of articular process articulations between the vertebral column vertebrae Multiaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, Ball-and- abduction/adduction, circumduction, and medial/ Shoulder and hip joints socket lateral rotation movements TABLE9.1 9.6 Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the bones that articulate together to form selected synovial joints • Discuss the movements available at each joint •
