is also used for some modern garments. From the most interior layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (seeFigure 20.3).Table 20.1compares and contrasts the tunics of the arteries and veins. Comparison of Tunics in Arteries and Veins Arteries Veins General Thick walls with small lumens Thin walls with large lumens appearance Generally appear rounded Generally appear flattened Endothelium usually appears wavy due to constriction of Endothelium appears smooth Tunica smooth muscle Internal elastic membrane intima Internal elastic membrane present in larger vessels absent Normally thinner than the tunica externa Smooth muscle cells and Normally the thickest layer in arteries collagenous fibers predominate Tunica Smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers predominate (the media proportions of these vary with distance from the heart) Nervi vasorum and vasa External elastic membrane present in larger vessels vasorum present External elastic membrane absent Normally the thickest layer in veins Normally thinner than the tunica media in all but the largest Collagenous and smooth fibers Tunica arteries predominate externa Collagenous and elastic fibers Some smooth muscle fibers Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present Nervi vasorum and vasa vasorum present TABLE20.1 Tunica Intima Thetunica intima(also called the
