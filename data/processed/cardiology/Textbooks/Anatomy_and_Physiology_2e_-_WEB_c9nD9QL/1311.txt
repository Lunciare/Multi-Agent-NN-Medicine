Sometimes, treatment with blood-thinning drugs can alleviate the problem, and recovery is possible. If the tissue is damaged, the amazing thing about the nervous system is that it is adaptable. With physical, occupational, and speech therapy, victims of strokes can recover, or more accurately relearn, functions. 13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structures found in the PNS • Distinguish between somatic and autonomic structures, including the special peripheral structures of the enteric nervous system • Name the twelve cranial nerves and explain the functions associated with each • Describe the sensory and motor components of spinal nerves and the plexuses that they pass through The PNS is not as contained as the CNS because it is defined as everything that is not the CNS. Some peripheral structures are incorporated into the other organs of the body.
