available if you are interested in how the nervous system works. Especially for neurophysiology, a medical degree might be more suitable so you can learn about the clinical applications of neurophysiology and possibly work with human subjects. An academic career is not a necessity. Biotechnology firms are eager to find motivated scientists ready to tackle the tough questions about how the nervous system works so that therapeutic chemicals can be tested on some of the most challenging disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, or spinal cord injury. 468 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue Others with a medical degree and a specialization in neuroscience go on to work directly with patients, diagnosing and treating mental disorders. You can do this as a psychiatrist, a neuropsychologist, a neuroscience nurse, or a neurodiagnostic technician, among other possible career paths. 12.4 The Action Potential LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the components of the membrane that establish the resting membrane potential • Describe the changes that occur to the membrane that result in the action potential The functions of the nervous system—sensation, integration, and response—depend on the functions of the
