the upper limb is held next to the body with the palm facing forward. This is thesupinated positionof the forearm. In this position, the radius and ulna are parallel to each other. When the palm of the hand faces backward, the forearm is in thepronated position, Access for free at openstax.org 9.5 • Types of Body Movements 331 and the radius and ulna form an X-shape. Supination and pronation are the movements of the forearm that go between these two positions.Pronationis the motion that moves the forearm from the supinated (anatomical) position to the pronated (palm backward) position. This motion is produced by rotation of the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint, accompanied by movement of the radius at the distal radioulnar joint. The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows for rotation of the head of the radius. Because of the slight curvature of the shaft of the radius, this rotation causes the distal end of the radius to cross over the distal ulna at the distal radioulnar joint. This crossing over brings the radius and ulna into an X- shape position.Supinationis the opposite motion, in which rotation of the radius returns the bones to their parallel
