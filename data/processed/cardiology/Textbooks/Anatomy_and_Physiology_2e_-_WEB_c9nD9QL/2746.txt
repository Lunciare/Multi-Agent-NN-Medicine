The breakdown of fat also requires bile. The main regions of the large intestine are the cecum, Most nutrients are absorbed by transport mechanisms the colon, and the rectum. The large intestine absorbs at the apical surface of enterocytes. Exceptions include water and forms feces, and is responsible for lipids, fat-soluble vitamins, and most water-soluble defecation. Bacterial flora break down additional vitamins.
