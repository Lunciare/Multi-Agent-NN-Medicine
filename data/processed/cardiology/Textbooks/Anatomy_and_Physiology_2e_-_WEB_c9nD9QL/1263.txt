sulci. Using these landmarks, the cortex can be separated into four major regions, or lobes (Figure 13.7). Thelateral sulcusthat separates thetemporal lobefrom the other regions is one such landmark. Superior to the lateral sulcus are theparietal lobeandfrontal lobe, which are separated from each other by the central sulcus. The posterior region of the cortex is theoccipital lobe, which has no obvious anatomical border between it and the parietal or temporal lobes on the lateral surface of the brain. From the medial surface, an Access for free at openstax.org 13.2 • The Central Nervous System 501 obvious landmark separating the parietal and occipital lobes is called theparieto-occipital sulcus. The fact that there is no obvious anatomical border between these lobes is consistent with the functions of these regions being interrelated. FIGURE13.7 Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex The cerebral cortex is divided into four lobes. Extensive folding increases the surface area available for cerebral functions. Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization of function. In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the microscopic anatomy—the cytoarchitecture—of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52
