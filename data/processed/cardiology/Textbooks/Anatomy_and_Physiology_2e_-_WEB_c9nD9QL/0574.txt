Anatomy and Physiology

each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony projections. The more anterior projection is the flattenedcoronoid process of the mandible, which provides attachment for one of the biting muscles. The posterior projection is thecondylar process of the mandible, which is topped by the oval-shapedcondyle. The condyle of the mandible articulates (joins) with the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone. Together these articulations form the temporomandibular joint, which allows for opening and closing of the mouth (seeFigure 7.5). The broad U-shaped curve located between the coronoid and condylar processes is themandibular notch. Important landmarks for the mandible include the following: • Alveolar process of the mandible—This is the upper border of the mandibular body and serves to anchor the lower teeth. • Mental protuberance—The forward projection from the inferior margin of the anterior mandible that forms the chin (mental = “chin”). • Mental foramen—The opening located on each side of the anterior-lateral mandible, which is the exit site for a sensory nerve that supplies the chin. • Mylohyoid line—This bony ridge extends along the inner aspect of the mandibular body (seeFigure 7.11). The muscle that forms the floor of the oral cavity attaches to the mylohyoid lines
