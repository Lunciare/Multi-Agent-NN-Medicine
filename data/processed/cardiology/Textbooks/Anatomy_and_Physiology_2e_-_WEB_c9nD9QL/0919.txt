Anatomy and Physiology

actin-binding sites. Ca++also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle, although its role is different: here Ca++activates enzymes, which in turn activate myosin heads. All muscles require adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to continue the process of contracting, and they all relax when the Ca++is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded. A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue calledelasticity. It can recoil back to its original length due to elastic fibers. Muscle tissue also has the quality ofextensibility; it can stretch or extend.Contractilityallows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force. Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins—actin and myosin. The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells (referred to as fibers) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, which creates a pattern, or stripes, called striations. The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification (seeFigure 10.2).Skeletal Access for free at openstax.org 10.2 • Skeletal Muscle 359 musclefibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle.Cardiac musclefibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically
