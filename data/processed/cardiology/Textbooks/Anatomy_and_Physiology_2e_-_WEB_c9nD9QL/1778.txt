mediates growth and protein synthesis by triggering the liver and other tissues to produce a group of proteins calledinsulin-like growth factors (IGFs). These proteins enhance cellular proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, or programmed cell death. IGFs stimulate cells to increase their uptake of amino acids from the blood for protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs. Dysfunction of the endocrine system’s control of growth can result in several disorders. For example,gigantismis a disorder in children that is caused by the secretion of abnormally large amounts of GH, resulting in excessive growth. A similar condition in adults isacromegaly, a disorder that results in the growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet in response to excessive levels of GH in individuals who have stopped growing. Abnormally low levels of GH in children can cause growth impairment—a disorder calledpituitary dwarfism(also known as growth hormone deficiency). Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated bythyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotropin. TSH is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.
