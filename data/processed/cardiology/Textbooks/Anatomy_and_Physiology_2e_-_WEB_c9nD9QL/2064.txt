from there into the ventricles. Both chambers are in diastole, the atrioventricular valves are open, and the semilunar valves remain closed (seeFigure 19.27). The cardiac cycle is complete. Figure 19.28illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG. FIGURE19.28 Relationship between the Cardiac Cycle and ECG Initially, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). The P wave represents depolarization of the atria and is followed by atrial contraction (systole). Atrial systole extends until the QRS complex, at which point, the atria relax. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction. The T wave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation. Heart Sounds One of the simplest, yet effective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patient’s heart is auscultation using a stethoscope. In a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audibleheart sounds: S and S . S is the sound created by the 1 2 1 closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as a “lub,” or first heart sound. The second heart sound, S , is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular
