zone perform other functions as well. The epithelium of the nasal passages, for example, is essential to sensing odors, and the bronchial epithelium that lines the lungs can metabolize some airborne carcinogens. The Nose and its Adjacent Structures The major entrance and exit for the respiratory system is through the nose. When discussing the nose, it is helpful to divide it into two major sections: the external nose, and the nasal cavity or internal nose. Theexternal noseconsists of the surface and skeletal structures that result in the outward appearance of the nose and contribute to its numerous functions (Figure 22.3). Therootis the region of the nose located between the eyebrows. Thebridgeis the part of the nose that connects the root to the rest of the nose. Thedorsum nasiis the length of the nose. Theapexis the tip of the nose. On either side of the apex, the nostrils are formed by the alae (singular = ala). Analais a cartilaginous structure that forms the lateral side of eachnaris(plural = nares), or nostril opening. Thephiltrumis the concave surface that connects the apex of the nose to the upper lip.
