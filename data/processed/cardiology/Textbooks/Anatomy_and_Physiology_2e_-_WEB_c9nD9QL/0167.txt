are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P). This hydrolysis reaction can be written: i Removal of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these reactions also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too, as when ADP undergoes phosphorylation.Phosphorylationis the addition of a phosphate group to an organic compound, in this case, resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during hydrolysis must be reinvested to power dehydration synthesis. Cells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first enters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C H O —P) and ADP. Once 6 12 6 glucose is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.
