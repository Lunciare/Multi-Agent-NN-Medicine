the pelvis. The body’s center of gravity is in the area of the pelvis. If the center of gravity were not to remain fixed, standing up would be difficult as well. Therefore, what the leg muscles lack in range of motion and versatility, they make up for in size and power, facilitating the body’s stabilization, posture, and movement. Gluteal Region Muscles That Move the Femur Most muscles that insert on the femur (the thigh bone) and move it, originate on the pelvic girdle. Thepsoas major andiliacusmake up theiliopsoas group. Some of the largest and most powerful muscles in the body are the gluteal muscles orgluteal group. Thegluteus maximusis the largest; deep to the gluteus maximus is thegluteus medius, and deep to the gluteus medius is thegluteus minimus, the smallest of the trio (Figure 11.29andFigure 11.30).

The muscles that move the lower leg typically originate on the femur and insert into the bones of the knee
