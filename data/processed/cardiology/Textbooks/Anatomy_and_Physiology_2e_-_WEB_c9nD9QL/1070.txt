Anatomy and Physiology

theanterior compartment of the forearm(anterior flexor compartment of the forearm) originate on the humerus and insert onto different parts of the hand. These make up the bulk of the forearm. From lateral to medial, thesuperficial anterior compartment of the forearmincludes theflexor carpi radialis,palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, andflexor digitorum superficialis. The flexor digitorum superficialis flexes the hand as well as the digits at the knuckles, which allows for rapid finger movements, as in typing or playing a musical instrument (see Figure 11.27andTable 11.9). However, poor ergonomics can irritate the tendons of these muscles as they slide back and forth with the carpal tunnel of the anterior wrist and pinch the median nerve, which also travels through the tunnel, causing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Thedeep anterior compartmentproduces flexion and bends fingers to make a fist. These are theflexor pollicis longusand theflexor digitorum profundus. The muscles in thesuperficial posterior compartment of the forearm(superficial posterior extensor compartment of the forearm) originate on the humerus. These are theextensor radialis longus,extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum,extensor digiti minimi, and theextensor carpi ulnaris. The muscles of thedeep posterior compartment of the forearm(deep posterior extensor compartment of the forearm) originate on the radius and ulna. These include theabductor
