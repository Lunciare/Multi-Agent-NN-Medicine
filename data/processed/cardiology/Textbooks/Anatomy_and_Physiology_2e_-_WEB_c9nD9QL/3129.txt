Where are the testes located for most of gestational time? Further Sexual Development Occurs at Puberty Pubertyis the stage of development at which individuals become sexually mature. Though the outcomes of puberty for different sexes are very different, the hormonal control of the process is very similar. In addition, though the timing of these events varies between individuals, the sequence of changes that occur is predictable for male and female adolescents. As shown inFigure 27.18, a concerted release of hormones from the hypothalamus (GnRH), the anterior pituitary (LH and FSH), and the gonads (either testosterone or estrogen) is responsible for the maturation of the reproductive systems and the development ofsecondary sex characteristics, which are physical changes that serve auxiliary roles in reproduction. The first changes begin around the age of eight or nine when the production of LH becomes detectable.
