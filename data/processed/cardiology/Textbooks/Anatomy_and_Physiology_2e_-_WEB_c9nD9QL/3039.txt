which use a K+-H+exchange mechanism (antiporter). Diagnosing Acidosis and Alkalosis Lab tests for pH, CO partial pressure (PCO ),and HCO –can identify acidosis and alkalosis, indicating whether the 2 2 3 imbalance is respiratory or metabolic, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms are working. The blood pH value, as shown inTable 26.3, indicates whether the blood is in acidosis, the normal range, or alkalosis. The PCO and total HCO –values aid in determining whether the condition is metabolic or respiratory, and whether the 2 3 patient has been able to compensate for the problem.Table 26.3lists the conditions and laboratory results that can be used to classify these conditions. Metabolic acid-base imbalances typically result from kidney disease, and the respiratory system usually responds to compensate.
