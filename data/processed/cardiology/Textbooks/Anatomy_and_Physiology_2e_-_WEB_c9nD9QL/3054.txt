facilitate the transfer of male gametes—the sperm—to the female gamete, an oocyte (egg). Finally, combination of the gametes (fertilization) had to occur, followed by implantation and development. In this chapter, you will explore the reproductive systems, whose functioning can culminate in the powerful sound of a newborn’s first cry. 1186 27 • The Reproductive System 27.1 Anatomy and Physiology of the Testicular Reproductive System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structure and function of the organs of the testicular reproductive system • Describe the structure and function of the sperm cell • Explain the events during spermatogenesis that produce haploid sperm from diploid cells • Identify the importance of testosterone in reproductive function People often use the words "female" and "male" to describe two different concepts: our sense of gender identity, and our biological sex as determined by our X/Y chromosomes, hormones, sex organs, and other physical characteristics. For some people, gender identity is different from biological sex or their sex assigned at birth. In this chapter and the next chapter, "female" and "male" refer to sex only, and the typical reproductive anatomy of XX and XY individuals is discussed.
