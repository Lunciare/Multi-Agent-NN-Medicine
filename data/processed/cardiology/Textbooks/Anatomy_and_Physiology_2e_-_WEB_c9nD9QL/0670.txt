of the clavicle, has a triangular shape and articulates with the manubrium portion of the sternum. This forms thesternoclavicular joint, which is the only bony articulation between the pectoral girdle of the upper limb and the axial skeleton. This joint allows considerable mobility, enabling the clavicle and scapula to move in upward/ downward and anterior/posterior directions during shoulder movements. The sternoclavicular joint is indirectly supported by thecostoclavicular ligament(costo- = “rib”), which spans the sternal end of the clavicle and the underlying first rib. The lateral oracromial end of the claviclearticulates with the acromion of the scapula, the portion of the scapula that forms the bony tip of the shoulder. There are some sex differences in the morphology of the clavicle. In females, the clavicle tends to be shorter, thinner, and less curved. In males, the clavicle is heavier and longer, and has a greater curvature and rougher surfaces where muscles attach, features that are more pronounced in manual workers. The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. Such breaks often occur because of the force exerted on the clavicle when a person falls onto their outstretched arms, or when the lateral shoulder receives a strong blow. Because
