Anatomy and Physiology

Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The largeranterior interventricular artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising from the left coronary artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the way it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular artery, forming anastomoses. Ananastomosisis an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally allow blood to circulate to a region even if there may be partial blockage in another branch.

Therefore, this ability is somewhat restricted in the heart so a coronary artery blockage often results in death of the cells (myocardial infarction) supplied by the particular vessel. The right coronary artery proceeds along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium, portions of both ventricles, and the heart conduction system. Normally, one or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery inferior to the right atrium. Themarginal arteriessupply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle.
