Anatomy and Physiology

the pancreas releasessodium bicarbonateto neutralize the HCl. This helps to protect the lining of the intestine. The small intestine also releases digestive hormones, includingsecretinand CCK, which stimulate digestive processes to break down the proteins further. Secretin also stimulates the pancreas to release sodium bicarbonate. The pancreas releases most of the digestive enzymes, including the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, andelastase, which aid protein digestion. Together, all of these enzymes break complex proteins into smaller individual amino acids (Figure 24.17), which are then transported across the intestinal mucosa to be used to create new proteins, or to be converted into fats or acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs cycle. FIGURE24.17 Digestive Enzymes and Hormones Enzymes in the stomach and small intestine break down proteins into amino acids. HCl in the stomach aids in proteolysis, and hormones secreted by intestinal cells direct the digestive processes. In order to avoid breaking down the proteins that make up the pancreas and small intestine, pancreatic enzymes are released asinactive proenzymesthat are only activated in the small intestine. In the pancreas, vesicles store trypsinandchymotrypsinastrypsinogenandchymotrypsinogen. Once released into the small intestine, an enzyme found in the wall of the small intestine, calledenterokinase, binds to trypsinogen and converts it
