liver will be converted into triglycerides and fatty acids for long-term storage. Figure 24.22summarizes the metabolic processes occurring in the body during the postabsorptive state. 1090 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition FIGURE24.22 Postabsorptive State During the postabsorptive state, the body must rely on stored glycogen for energy. Starvation When the body is deprived of nourishment for an extended period of time, it goes into “survival mode.” The first priority for survival is to provide enough glucose or fuel for the brain. The second priority is the conservation of amino acids for proteins. Therefore, the body uses ketones to satisfy the energy needs of the brain and other glucose-dependent organs, and to maintain proteins in the cells (seeFigure 24.2). Because glucose levels are very low during starvation, glycolysis will shut off in cells that can use alternative fuels. For example, muscles will switch from using glucose to fatty acids as fuel. As previously explained, fatty acids can be converted into acetyl CoA and processed through the Krebs cycle to make ATP. Pyruvate, lactate, and alanine from muscle cells are not converted Access for free at openstax.org 24.6 • Energy and Heat Balance 1091 into acetyl CoA and used in the Krebs
