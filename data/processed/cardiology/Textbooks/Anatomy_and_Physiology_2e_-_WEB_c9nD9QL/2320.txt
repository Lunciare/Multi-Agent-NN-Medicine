The venous system is a lower- pressure system, containing veins that have larger Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of lumens and thinner walls. They often appear flattened. vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed venules, and veins before returning to the heart. of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica Arteries transport blood away from the heart and media, and tunica externa.
