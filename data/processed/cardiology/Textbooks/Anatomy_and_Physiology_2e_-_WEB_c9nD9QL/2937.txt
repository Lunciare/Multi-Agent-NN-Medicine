Anatomy and Physiology

its targets is the PCT, where it stimulates the hydroxylation of calcidiol to calcitriol (1,25-hydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D). It also blocks reabsorption of phosphate (PO –), causing its loss in the urine. The retention of phosphate would result in the formation of calcium phosphate 3 in the plasma, reducing circulating Ca++levels. By ridding the blood of phosphate, higher circulating Ca++levels are permitted.

Circumstances that lead to fluid depletion in the body include blood loss and dehydration. Homeostasis requires that volume and osmolarity be preserved. Blood volume is important in maintaining sufficient blood pressure, and there are nonrenal mechanisms involved in its preservation, including vasoconstriction, which can act within seconds of a drop in pressure.
