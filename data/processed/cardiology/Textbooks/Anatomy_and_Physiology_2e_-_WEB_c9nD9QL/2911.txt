appear briefly in the urine, the appearance of glycosuriausually points to type I or II diabetes mellitus. The transport of glucose from the lumen of the PCT to the interstitial space is similar to the way it is absorbed by the small intestine. Both glucose and Na+bind simultaneously to the same symport proteins on the apical surface of the cell to be transported in the same direction, toward the interstitial space. Sodium moves down its electrochemical and concentration gradient into the cell and takes glucose with it. Na+is then actively pumped out of the cell at the basal surface of the cell into the interstitial space. Glucose leaves the cell to enter the interstitial space by facilitated diffusion. The energy to move glucose comes from the Na+/K+ATPase that pumps Na+out of the cell on the basal surface. Fifty percent of Cl–and variable quantities of Ca++, Mg++, and are also recovered in the PCT. Recovery of bicarbonate (HCO –) is vital to the maintenance of acid–base balance, since it is a very powerful and 3 fast-acting buffer. An important enzyme is used to catalyze this mechanism: carbonic anhydrase (CA). This same enzyme and reaction is used in red blood cells in
