down clots. It is released naturally by endothelial cells but is also used in clinical medicine. New research is progressing using compounds isolated from the venom of some species of snakes, particularly vipers and cobras, which may eventually have therapeutic value as thrombolytic agents. 18.6 Blood Typing LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the two basic physiological consequences of transfusion of incompatible blood • Compare and contrast ABO and Rh blood groups • Identify which blood groups may be safely transfused into patients with different ABO types • Discuss the pathophysiology of hemolytic disease of the newborn Blood transfusions in humans were risky procedures until the discovery of the major human blood groups by Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist and physician, in 1900. Until that point, physicians did not understand that death sometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into the patient was incompatible with the patient’s own blood. Blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of specific marker molecules on the plasma membranes of erythrocytes. With their discovery, it became possible for the first time to match patient-donor blood types and prevent transfusion reactions
