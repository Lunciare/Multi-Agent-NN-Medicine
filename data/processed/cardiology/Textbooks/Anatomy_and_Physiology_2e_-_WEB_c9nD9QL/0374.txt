spleen, and the liver connective tissue cells are derived Schwann cell neuroglial cell that produces myelin in mesenchyme embryonic tissue from which the peripheral nervous system connective tissue cells derive secondary union wound healing facilitated by wound mesoderm middle embryonic germ layer from which contraction connective tissue, muscle tissue, and some serous gland group of cells within the serous epithelial tissue derive membrane that secrete a lubricating substance onto mesothelium simple squamous epithelial tissue the surface which covers the major body cavities and is the serous membrane type of tissue membrane that epithelial portion of serous membranes lines body cavities and lubricates them with serous mucous connective tissue specialized loose fluid connective tissue present in the umbilical cord simple columnar epithelium tissue that consists of a mucous gland group of cells that secrete mucous, a single layer of column-like cells; promotes secretion thick, slippery substance that keeps tissues moist and absorption in tissues and organs and acts as a lubricant simple cuboidal epithelium tissue that consists of a mucous membrane tissue membrane that is covered single layer of cube-shaped cells; promotes by protective mucous and lines tissue exposed to secretion and absorption in ducts and tubules the outside environment simple
