Anatomy and Physiology

The muscles of theanterior compartment of the thighflex the thigh and extend the leg. This compartment contains thequadriceps femoris group, which actually comprises four muscles that extend and stabilize the knee. Therectus femorisis on the anterior aspect of the thigh, thevastus lateralisis on the lateral aspect of the thigh, thevastus medialisis on the medial aspect of the thigh, and thevastus intermediusis between the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis and deep to the rectus femoris. The tendon common to all four is thequadriceps tendon (patellar tendon), which inserts into the patella and continues below it as thepatellar ligament. The patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. In addition to the quadriceps femoris, thesartoriusis a band-like muscle that extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial side of the proximal tibia. This versatile muscle flexes the leg at the knee and flexes, abducts, and laterally rotates the leg at the hip.
