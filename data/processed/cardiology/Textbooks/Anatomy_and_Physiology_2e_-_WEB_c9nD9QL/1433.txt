ear than in the right ear because some of the sound waves reaching the opposite ear are blocked by the head. This is an example of an interaural intensity difference. 562 14 • The Somatic Nervous System FIGURE14.20 Auditory Brain Stem Mechanisms of Sound Localization Localizing sound in the horizontal plane is achieved by processing in the medullary nuclei of the auditory system. Connections between neurons on either side are able to compare very slight differences in sound stimuli that arrive at either ear and represent interaural time and intensity differences. Auditory processing continues on to a nucleus in the midbrain called theinferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior colliculus project to two locations, the thalamus and thesuperior colliculus. Themedial geniculate nucleusof the thalamus receives the auditory information and then projects that information to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. The superior colliculus receives input from the visual and somatosensory systems, as well as the ears, to initiate stimulation of the muscles that turn the head and neck toward the auditory stimulus. Balance is coordinated through the vestibular system, the nerves of which are composed of axons from the vestibular ganglion that carries information from the
