Single cell layers form simple epithelia, that can all be classified into four types of tissues: whereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial few capillaries penetrate these tissues. tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the surface. Connective tissue Glands are secretory tissues and organs that are integrates the various parts of the body and provides derived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release support and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows their products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete the body to move.
