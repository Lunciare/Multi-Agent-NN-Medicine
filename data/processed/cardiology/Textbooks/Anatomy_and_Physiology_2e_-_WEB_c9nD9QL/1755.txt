Anatomy and Physiology

Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors Hydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones, which are lipid-soluble, all amino acid–derived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the extracellular surface of the cell membrane. Therefore, they do not directly affect the transcription of target genes, but instead initiate a signaling cascade that is carried out by a molecule called asecond messenger. In this case, the hormone is called afirst messenger. The second messenger used by most hormones iscyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second messenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 inFigure 17.5). This receptor is associated with an intracellular component called aG protein, and binding of the hormone activates the G-protein component (Step 2). The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme calledadenylyl cyclase, also known as adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second messenger, cAMP activates a type of enzyme called aprotein kinasethat is present
