Anatomy and Physiology

The scapula is located on the posterior side of the shoulder. It is surrounded by muscles on both its anterior (deep) and posterior (superficial) sides, and thus does not articulate with the ribs of the thoracic cage. The scapula has several important landmarks (Figure 8.4). The three margins or borders of the scapula, named for their positions within the body, are thesuperior border of the scapula, themedial border of the scapula, and the lateral border of the scapula. Thesuprascapular notchis located lateral to the midpoint of the superior border. The corners of the triangular scapula, at either end of the medial border, are thesuperior angle of the scapula, located between the medial and superior borders, and theinferior angle of the scapula, located between the medial and lateral borders. The inferior angle is the most inferior portion of the scapula, and is particularly important because it serves as the attachment point for several powerful muscles involved in shoulder and upper limb movements. The remaining corner of the scapula, between the superior and lateral borders, is the location of the glenoid cavity(glenoid fossa). This shallow depression articulates with the humerus bone of the arm to form the glenohumeral joint(shoulder joint). The small
