The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis. 17.2Hormones The body coordinates its functions through two major Hormones are derived from amino acids or lipids. types of communication: neural and endocrine. Neural Amine hormones originate from the amino acids communication includes both electrical and chemical tryptophan or tyrosine. Larger amino acid hormones signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine include peptides and protein hormones. Steroid communication involves chemical signaling via the hormones are derived from cholesterol. release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and may Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a soluble. All other amino acid–derived hormones are response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless water soluble. Hydrophobic hormones are able to glands that secrete hormones. Many organs
