states happen very rarely in generally The triglycerides are broken down into monoglycerides well-nourished individuals. When the body is fed, and free fatty acids, then imported across the intestinal glucose, fats, and proteins are absorbed across the mucosa. Once across, the triglycerides are intestinal membrane and enter the bloodstream and resynthesized and transported to the liver or adipose lymphatic system to be used immediately for fuel. Any tissue. Fatty acids are oxidized through fatty acid or β- excess is stored for later fasting stages. As blood oxidation into two-carbon acetyl CoA molecules, which glucose levels rise, the pancreas releases insulin to can then enter the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. If stimulate the uptake of glucose by hepatocytes in the excess acetyl CoA is created and overloads the liver, muscle cells/fibers, and adipocytes (fat cells), and capacity of the Krebs cycle, the acetyl CoA can be used to promote its conversion to glycogen. As the to synthesize ketone bodies. When glucose is limited, postabsorptive state begins, glucose levels drop, and ketone bodies can be oxidized and used for fuel. there is a corresponding drop in insulin levels. Falling Excess acetyl CoA generated from excess glucose or glucose levels trigger the
