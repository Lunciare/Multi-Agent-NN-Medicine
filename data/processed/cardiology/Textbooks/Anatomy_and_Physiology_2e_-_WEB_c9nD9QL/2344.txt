The thoracic duct itself begins just beneath the diaphragm in thecisterna chyli, a sac-like chamber that receives lymph from the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower limbs by way of the left and right lumbar trunks and the intestinal trunk. FIGURE21.4 Major Trunks and Ducts of the Lymphatic System The thoracic duct drains a much larger portion of the body than does the right lymphatic duct. The overall drainage system of the body is asymmetrical (seeFigure 21.4). Theright lymphatic ductreceives lymph from only the upper right side of the body. The lymph from the rest of the body enters the bloodstream through the thoracic ductvia all the remaining lymphatic trunks. In general, lymphatic vessels of the subcutaneous tissues of the skin, that is, the superficial lymphatics, follow the same routes as veins, whereas the deep lymphatic vessels of the viscera generally follow the paths of arteries. The Organization of Immune Function The immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble
