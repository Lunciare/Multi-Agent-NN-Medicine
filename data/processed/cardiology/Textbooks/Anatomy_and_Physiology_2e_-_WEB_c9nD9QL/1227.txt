The lower neuron to generate an action potential, it needs to motor neuron is that cell in the gray matter of the receive input from another source, either another spinal cord and its axon extends into the periphery neuron or a sensory stimulus. That input will result in where it synapses with a skeletal muscle in a opening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a neuromuscular junction. graded potential based on the strength of the stimulus. Graded potentials can be depolarizing or 12.4The Action Potential hyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the The nervous system is characterized by electrical probability of the neuron reaching threshold. signals that are sent from one area to another.

The basis of the electrical signal is unipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron the controlled distribution of ions across the ending in the skin, the graded potential is called a
