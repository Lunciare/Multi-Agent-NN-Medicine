Anatomy and Physiology

as thecommon hepatic duct. This duct then joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder, forming thecommon bile ductthrough which bile flows into the small intestine. Ahepatic sinusoidis an open, porous blood space formed by fenestrated capillaries from nutrient-rich hepatic portal veins and oxygen-rich hepatic arteries. Hepatocytes are tightly packed around the fenestrated endothelium of these spaces, giving them easy access to the blood. From their central position, hepatocytes process the nutrients, toxins, and waste materials carried by the blood. Materials such as bilirubin are processed and excreted into the bile canaliculi. Other materials including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are processed and secreted into the sinusoids or just stored in the cells until called upon. The hepatic sinusoids combine and send blood to acentral vein. Blood then flows through ahepatic veininto the inferior vena cava. This means that blood and bile flow in opposite directions. The hepatic sinusoids also contain star-shapedreticuloendothelial cells(Kupffer cells), phagocytes that remove dead red and white blood cells, bacteria, and other foreign material that enter the sinusoids. Theportal triadis a distinctive arrangement around the perimeter of hepatic lobules, consisting of three basic structures: a bile duct, a hepatic artery branch, and a hepatic portal vein branch.
