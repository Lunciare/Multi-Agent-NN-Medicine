then unipotent describes the condition of being adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA for committed to a single specialized cell type the transcription phase of protein synthesis vesicle membrane-bound structure that contains S phase stage of the cell cycle during which DNA materials within or outside of the cell replication occurs Chapter Review 3.1The Cell Membrane peripherally. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only a limited number of materials The cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell, to diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that separating its internal components from the cross the membrane do so using passive (non energy- extracellular environment. It is composed of a requiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport phospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid processes. During passive transport, materials move by “tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.” simple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the Various membrane proteins are scattered throughout membrane, down their concentration gradient. Water the bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it Access for free at openstax.org 3 • Chapter Review 119 passes through the membrane in a diffusion process by-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein- called osmosis. During active transport, energy is
