in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside the living body. 8 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body 1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and methods of study • Discuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology Humananatomyis the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however,
