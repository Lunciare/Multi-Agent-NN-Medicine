the sensory neurons. Sensory Receptors Stimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system. Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of receptor cells. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: cell type, position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. They can also be classified functionally on the basis of the transductionof stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential. Structural Receptor Types The cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has afree nerve ending, Access for free at openstax.org 14.1 • Sensory Perception 541 with dendrites embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has anencapsulated endingin which the sensory nerve endings are encapsulated in connective tissue that enhances their sensitivity; or (3) a specializedreceptor cell, which has distinct structural components that interpret a specific type of stimulus (Figure 14.2). The pain and temperature receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings. Also located in
