The cerebrum is formed directly neural groove, when it closes off, are called the neural from the telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only crest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to region that keeps its embryonic name.

The cerebellum also develops medulla. It controls the head and neck region of the from the metencephalon and is a separate region of the body through the cranial nerves. There are control adult brain. centers in the brain stem that regulate the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The spinal cord develops out of the rest of the neural tube and retains the tube structure, with the nervous The cerebellum is connected to the brain stem, tissue thickening and the hollow center becoming a primarily at the pons, where it receives a copy of the very small central canal through the cord.
