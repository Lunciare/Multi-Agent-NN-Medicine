The Chemical Level of Organization concentration of proteins in the blood, the cells, and the spaces between cells helps ensure a balance of fluids in these various “compartments.” Moreover, proteins in the cell membrane help to transport electrolytes in and out of the cell, keeping these ions in a healthy balance. Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby produce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body. The body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and adipose tissue become depleted. However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using protein for energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting. Nucleotides The fourth type of organic compound important to human structure and function are the nucleotides (Figure 2.28). A nucleotideis one of a class of organic compounds composed of three subunits: • one or more phosphate groups • a pentose sugar: either deoxyribose or ribose • a nitrogen-containing base: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil Nucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate.
