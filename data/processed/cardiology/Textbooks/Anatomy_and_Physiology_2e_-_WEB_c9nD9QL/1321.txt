involved in facial expressions, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. Thevestibulocochlear nerveis responsible for the senses of hearing and balance. The glossopharyngeal nerveis responsible for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva. Thevagus nerveis responsible for contributing to homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. Thespinal accessory nerveis responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical spinal nerves. Thehypoglossal nerveis responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.

Three of the cranial nerves also contain autonomic fibers, and a fourth is almost purely a component of the autonomic system. The oculomotor, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact autonomic ganglia. The oculomotor fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both initiate salivation. The vagus nerve primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. INTERACTIVE
