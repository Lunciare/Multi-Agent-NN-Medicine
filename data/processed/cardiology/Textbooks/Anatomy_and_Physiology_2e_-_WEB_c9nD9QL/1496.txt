aspects of the cells. The structural classifications are general senses, which are those sensory structures either based on the anatomy of the cell that is that are distributed throughout the body and in the interacting with the stimulus (free nerve endings, walls of various organs. The special senses are all encapsulated endings, or specialized receptor cell), or primarily part of the somatic nervous system in that where the cell is located relative to the stimulus they are consciously perceived through cerebral (interoceptor, exteroceptor, proprioceptor). Thirdly, the processes, though some special senses contribute to functional classification is based on how the cell autonomic function. The general senses can be divided transduces the stimulus into a neural signal. into somatosensation, which is commonly considered Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli and are touch, but includes tactile, pressure, vibration, the basis for olfaction and gustation.

The Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli and vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences are the basis for most aspects of somatosensation, as activity
