Anatomy and Physiology

of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both initially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further mature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this section. The human body contains approximately 1012lymphocytes. B Cells B cellsare immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies. Anantibodyis any of the group of proteins that binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens. Anantigenis a chemical structure on the surface of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated B cells are known as plasma cells. T Cells TheT cell, on the other hand, does not secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive immune
