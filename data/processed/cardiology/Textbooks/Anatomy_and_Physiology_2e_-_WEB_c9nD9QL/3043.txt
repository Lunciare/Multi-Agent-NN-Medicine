Body fluids are aqueous Homeostasis requires that water intake and output be solutions with differing concentrations of materials, balanced. Most water intake comes through the called solutes. An appropriate balance of water and digestive tract via liquids and food, but roughly 10 solute concentrations must be maintained to ensure percent of water available to the body is generated at cellular functions. If the cytosol becomes too the end of aerobic respiration during cellular concentrated due to water loss, cell functions metabolism. Urine produced by the kidneys accounts deteriorate. If the cytosol becomes too dilute due to for the largest amount of water leaving the body. The water intake by cells, cell membranes can be damaged, kidneys can adjust the concentration of the urine to and the cell can burst. Hydrostatic pressure is the force reflect the body’s water needs, conserving water if the exerted by a fluid against a wall
