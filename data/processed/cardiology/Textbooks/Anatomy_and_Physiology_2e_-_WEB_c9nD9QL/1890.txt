Anatomy and Physiology

It also enables them to fold up as they move through narrow blood vessels. Hemoglobin Hemoglobinis a large molecule made up of proteins and iron. It consists of four folded chains of a protein called 722 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood globin, designated alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 (Figure 18.7a). Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment molecule calledheme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe2+) (Figure 18.7b). FIGURE18.7 Hemoglobin (a) A molecule of hemoglobin contains four globin proteins, each of which is bound to one molecule of the iron-containing pigment heme. (b) A single erythrocyte can contain 300 million hemoglobin molecules, and thus more than 1 billion oxygen molecules. Each iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule; therefore, each hemoglobin molecule can transport four oxygen molecules. An individual erythrocyte may contain about 300 million hemoglobin molecules, and therefore can bind to and transport up to 1.2 billion oxygen molecules (seeFigure 18.7b). In the lungs, hemoglobin picks up oxygen, which binds to the iron ions, formingoxyhemoglobin. The bright red, oxygenated hemoglobin travels to the body tissues, where it releases some of the oxygen molecules, becoming darker reddeoxyhemoglobin,
