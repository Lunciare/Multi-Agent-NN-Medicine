The dartos muscle makes up the subcutaneous muscle layer of the scrotum (Figure 27.3). It continues internally to make up the scrotal septum, a wall that divides the scrotum into two compartments, each housing one testis. Descending from the internal oblique muscle of the abdominal wall are the two cremaster muscles, which cover each testis like a muscular net. By contracting simultaneously, the dartos and cremaster muscles can elevate the testes in cold weather (or water), moving the testes closer to the body and decreasing the surface area of the scrotum to retain heat. Alternatively, as the environmental temperature increases, the scrotum relaxes, moving the testes farther from the body core and increasing scrotal surface area, which promotes heat loss. Externally, the 1188 27 • The Reproductive System scrotum has a raised medial thickening on the surface called the raphae. FIGURE27.3 The Scrotum and Testes This anterior view shows the structures of the scrotum and testes. Testes Thetestes(singular = testis) are the malegonads—that is, the male reproductive organs. They produce both sperm and androgens, such as testosterone, and are active throughout the reproductive lifespan. Paired ovals, adult testes are each approximately 4 to 5 cm in length and are housed
