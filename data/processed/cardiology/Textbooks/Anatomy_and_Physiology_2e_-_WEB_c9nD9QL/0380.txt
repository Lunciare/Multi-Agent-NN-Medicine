Cells are bound together by temperature homeostasis. tight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They Many different cells contribute to the formation of can also be connected by gap junctions, which allow connective tissues. They originate in the mesodermal free exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and germ layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and anchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow. Fibroblasts matrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are 158 4 • Chapter Review are the most abundant and secrete many protein Cells are attached to one another at intercalated disks. fibers, adipocytes specialize in fat storage, The cells are interconnected physically and hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow give rise to electrochemically to act as a syncytium. Cardiac all the blood cells, chondrocytes form cartilage, and muscle cells contract autonomously and involuntarily. osteocytes form bone. The extracellular matrix Smooth muscle is involuntary. Each cell is a spindle- contains fluid, proteins, polysaccharide derivatives, shaped fiber and contains a single nucleus. No and, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers striations are evident because the actin and myosin fall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are filaments do
