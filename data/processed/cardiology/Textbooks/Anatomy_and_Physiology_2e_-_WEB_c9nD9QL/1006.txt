the breakdown of structural proteins. Endurance myofibrils, and muscle fibers shorten to produce exercise causes an increase in cellular mitochondria, movement. myoglobin, and capillary networks in SO fibers. Endurance athletes have a high level of SO fibers 10.4Nervous System Control of Muscle relative to the other fiber types. Resistance exercise Tension causes hypertrophy. Power-producing muscles have a The number of cross-bridges formed between actin higher number of FG fibers than of slow fibers. and myosin determines the amount of tension Strenuous exercise causes muscle cell damage that produced by a muscle. The length of a sarcomere is requires time to heal. Some athletes use performance- optimal when the zone of overlap between thin and enhancing substances to enhance muscle thick filaments is greatest. Muscles that are stretched performance. Muscle atrophy due to age is called or compressed too greatly do not produce maximal sarcopenia and occurs as muscle fibers die and are amounts of power. A motor unit is formed by a motor replaced by connective and adipose tissue. neuron and all of the muscle fibers that are innervated 10.7Cardiac Muscle Tissue by that same motor neuron. A single contraction is called a twitch. A muscle twitch has a latent
