a unique number of protons, it can exist as different isotopes. Anisotopeis one of the different forms of an element, distinguished from one another by different numbers of neutrons. The standard isotope of carbon is12C, commonly called carbon twelve.12C has six protons and six neutrons, for a mass number of twelve. All of the isotopes of carbon have the same number of protons; therefore,13C has seven neutrons, and14C has eight neutrons. The different isotopes of an element can also be indicated with the mass number hyphenated (for example, C-12 instead of12C). Hydrogen has three common isotopes, shown inFigure 2.5. 44 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization FIGURE2.5 Isotopes of Hydrogen Protium, designated1H, has one proton and no neutrons. It is by far the most abundant isotope of hydrogen in nature. Deuterium, designated2H, has one proton and one neutron. Tritium, designated3H, has two neutrons. An isotope that contains more than the usual number of neutrons is referred to as a heavy isotope. An example is 14C. Heavy isotopes tend to be unstable, and unstable isotopes are radioactive. Aradioactive isotopeis an isotope whose nucleus readily decays, giving off subatomic particles and electromagnetic energy. Different radioactive isotopes (also called radioisotopes) differ in
