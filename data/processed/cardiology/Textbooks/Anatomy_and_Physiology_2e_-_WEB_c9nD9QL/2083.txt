a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and men are six times as likely to die as would otherwise be expected. The same study indicated that longer relationships also had a greater incidence of a person dying soon after the death of their spouse. Other Factors Influencing Heart Rate Using a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over HR. However, there are a number of other factors that have an impact on HR as well, including epinephrine, NE, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance (Table 19.1andTable 19.2). After reading this section, the importance of maintaining homeostasis should become even more apparent. 794 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart Major Factors Increasing Heart Rate and Force of Contraction Factor Effect Cardioaccelerator Release of norepinephrine by cardioaccelerator nerves nerves Proprioreceptors Increased firing rates of proprioreceptors (e.g. during exercise) Chemoreceptors sensing decreased levels of O or increased levels of H+, CO and Chemoreceptors 2 2 lactic acid Baroreceptors Decreased firing rates of baroreceptors (indicating falling blood volume/pressure) Limbic system Anticipation of physical exercise or strong emotions
