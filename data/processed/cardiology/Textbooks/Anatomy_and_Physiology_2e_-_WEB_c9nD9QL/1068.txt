the circle of tendons around the shoulder joint. When baseball pitchers undergo shoulder surgery it is usually on the rotator cuff, which becomes pinched and inflamed, and may tear away from the bone due to the repetitive motion of bring the arm overhead to throw a fast pitch. Muscles That Move the Forearm The forearm, made of the radius and ulna bones, has four main types of action at the hinge of the elbow joint: 426 11 • The Muscular System flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. The forearm flexors include the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis. The extensors are thetriceps brachiiandanconeus. The pronators are thepronator teresand the pronator quadratus, and thesupinatoris the only one that turns the forearm anteriorly. When the forearm faces anteriorly, it is supinated. When the forearm faces posteriorly, it is pronated. The biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis flex the forearm. The two-headedbiceps brachiicrosses the shoulder and elbow joints to flex the forearm, also taking part in supinating the forearm at the radioulnar joints and flexing the arm at the shoulder joint. Deep to the biceps brachii, thebrachialisprovides additional power in flexing the forearm. Finally, thebrachioradialiscan flex the forearm quickly or help lift a load slowly. These
