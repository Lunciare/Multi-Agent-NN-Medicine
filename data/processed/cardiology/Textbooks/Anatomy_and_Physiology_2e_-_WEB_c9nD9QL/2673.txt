can therefore be subdivided into four segments: the superior, descending, horizontal, and ascending duodenum. Of particular interest is thehepatopancreatic ampulla(ampulla of Vater). Located in the duodenal wall, the ampulla marks the transition from the anterior portion of the alimentary canal to the mid-region, and is where the bile duct (through which bile passes from the liver) and themain pancreatic duct(through which pancreatic juice passes from the pancreas) join. This ampulla opens into the duodenum at a tiny volcano-shaped structure called themajor duodenal papilla. Thehepatopancreatic sphincter(sphincter of Oddi) regulates the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice from the ampulla into the duodenum. FIGURE23.18 Small Intestine The three regions of the small intestine are the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Thejejunumis about 0.9 meters (3 feet) long (in life) and runs from the duodenum to the ileum. Jejunum means “empty” in Latin and supposedly was so named by the ancient Greeks who noticed it was always empty at death. No clear demarcation exists between the jejunum and the final segment of the small intestine, the ileum. Theileumis the longest part of the small intestine, measuring about 1.8 meters (6 feet) in length. It is thicker, more vascular, and has more developed mucosal
