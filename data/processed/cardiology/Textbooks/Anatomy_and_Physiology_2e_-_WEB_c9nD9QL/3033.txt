Anatomy and Physiology

concentration of carbonic acid in the blood is dependent on the level of CO 2 in the body and the amount of CO gas exhaled through the lungs. Thus, the respiratory contribution to acid-base 2 balance is usually discussed in terms of CO (rather than of carbonic acid). Remember that a molecule of carbonic 2 acid is lost for every molecule of CO exhaled, and a molecule of carbonic acid is formed for every molecule of CO 2 2 retained.

Both acidosis and alkalosis can be diagnosed using a blood test. Metabolic Acidosis: Primary Bicarbonate Deficiency Metabolic acidosisoccurs when the blood is too acidic (pH below 7.35) due to too little bicarbonate, a condition called primary bicarbonate deficiency. At the normal pH of 7.40, the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid buffer is 20:1. If a person’s blood pH drops below 7.35, then the person is in metabolic acidosis. The most common cause of metabolic acidosis is the presence of organic acids or excessive ketone bodies in the blood.Table 26.2lists some other causes of metabolic
