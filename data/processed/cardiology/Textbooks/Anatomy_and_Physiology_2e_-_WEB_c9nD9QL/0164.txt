Anatomy and Physiology

adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil Nucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate. FIGURE2.28 Nucleotides (a) The building blocks of all nucleotides are one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen- containing base. (b) The nitrogen-containing bases of nucleotides. (c) The two pentose sugars of DNA and RNA. Nucleic Acids The nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar.Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)is nucleotide that stores genetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus one phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.Ribonucleic acid (RNA)is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic code as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of base for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. The nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. Apurineis a nitrogen-containing molecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine (found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. Apyramidineis a nitrogen-containing base with Access for free at openstax.org 2.5
