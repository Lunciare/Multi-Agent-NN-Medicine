Anatomy and Physiology

the The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine Endocrine System functions. The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha The endocrine system originates from all three germ cells, which produce glucagon; beta cells, which layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, produce insulin; delta cells, which produce ectoderm, and mesoderm. In general, different somatostatin; and PP cells, which produce pancreatic hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging polypeptide. Insulin and glucagon are involved in the affects the endocrine glands, potentially affecting regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin is produced hormone production and secretion, and can cause by the beta cells in response to high blood glucose disease. The production of hormones, such as human levels. It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, target cells, as well as the storage of excess glucose for and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age. later use.
