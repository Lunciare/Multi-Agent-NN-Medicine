Anatomy and Physiology

pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli that are the sites of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Once gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary venules that eventually lead to a series of largerpulmonary veins. Four pulmonary veins, two on the left and two on the right, return blood to the left atrium. At this point, the pulmonary circuit is complete.Table 20.4defines the major arteries and veins of the pulmonary circuit discussed in the text. FIGURE20.23 Pulmonary Circuit Blood exiting from the right ventricle flows into the pulmonary trunk, which bifurcates into the two Access for free at openstax.org 20.5 • Circulatory Pathways 845 pulmonary arteries. These vessels branch to supply blood to the pulmonary capillaries, where gas exchange occurs within the lung alveoli. Blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Pulmonary Arteries and Veins Vessel Description Pulmonary Single large vessel exiting the right ventricle that divides to form the right and left pulmonary trunk arteries Pulmonary Left and right vessels that form from the pulmonary trunk and lead to smaller arterioles and arteries eventually to the pulmonary capillaries Pulmonary Two sets of paired vessels—one pair on
