Anatomy and Physiology

human cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic cells. Somatic cells containtwocopies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A homologouspair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human is adiploidorganism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of having pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy. Cells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what triggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? Thecell cycleis the sequence of events in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then divides itself, generating two new cells. 108 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization The Cell Cycle One “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.
