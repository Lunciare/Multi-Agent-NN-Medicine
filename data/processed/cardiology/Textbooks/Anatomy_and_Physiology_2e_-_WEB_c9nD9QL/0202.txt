gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or the tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster than at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6°F thus also aids in diffusion of particles within the body. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thislink( see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of molecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why? Whenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so. Consider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen (O ) and CO . O generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO typically 2 2 2 2 diffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy on the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane. Before moving on, you need to review the
