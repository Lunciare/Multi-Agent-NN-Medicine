to get into the CNS, with specializations to protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted perfusion. 512 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System Arterial Supply The major artery carrying recently oxygenated blood away from the heart is the aorta. The very first branches off the aorta supply the heart with nutrients and oxygen. The next branches give rise to thecommon carotid arteries, which further branch into theinternal carotid arteries. The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on the surface of the cranium. The bases of the common carotids contain stretch receptors that immediately respond to the drop in blood pressure upon standing. Theorthostatic reflexis a reaction to this change in body position, so that blood pressure is maintained against the increasing effect of gravity (orthostatic means “standing up”). Heart rate increases—a reflex of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system—and this raises blood pressure. The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through thecarotid canalin the temporal bone. A second set of vessels that supply the CNS are thevertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae.
