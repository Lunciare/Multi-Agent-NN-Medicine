Anatomy and Physiology

In the collecting ducts, the apical surfaces of intercalated cells have proton pumps that actively secrete H+into the luminal, forming urine to remove it from the body. As hydrogen ions are pumped into the forming urine, it is buffered by bicarbonate (HCO –), H PO –(dihydrogen 3 2 4 phosphate ion), or ammonia (forming NH +, ammonium ion). Urine pH typically varies in a normal range from 4.5 to 4 Access for free at openstax.org 25.10 • The Urinary System and Homeostasis 1143 8.0. Regulation of Nitrogen Wastes Nitrogen wastes are produced by the breakdown of proteins during normal metabolism. Proteins are broken down into amino acids, which in turn are deaminated by having their nitrogen groups removed. Deamination converts the amino (NH ) groups into ammonia (NH ), ammonium ion (NH +), urea, or uric acid (Figure 25.22). Ammonia is 2 3 4 extremely toxic, so most of it is very rapidly converted into urea in the liver. Human urinary wastes typically contain primarily urea with small amounts of ammonium and very little uric acid.
