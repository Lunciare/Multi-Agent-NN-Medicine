The cerebrum is the largest portion The CNS has a privileged blood supply established by and contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei. the blood-brain barrier. Establishing this barrier are It is divided into two halves by the longitudinal fissure. anatomical structures that help to protect and isolate the CNS. The arterial blood to the brain comes from the The cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal, internal carotid and vertebral arteries, which both temporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is contribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides responsible for motor functions, from planning constant perfusion of the brain even if one of the blood movements through executing commands to be sent
