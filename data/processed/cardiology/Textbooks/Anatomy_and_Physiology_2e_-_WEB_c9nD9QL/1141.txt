target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites, which receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact calledsynapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction.Figure 12.8shows the relationship of these parts to one another. FIGURE12.8 Parts of a Neuron The major parts of the neuron are labeled on a multipolar neuron from the CNS. Where the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as theaxon hillock. This is a tapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of limited components calledaxoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also referred to as theinitial segment. Many axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin acts as insulation much like
