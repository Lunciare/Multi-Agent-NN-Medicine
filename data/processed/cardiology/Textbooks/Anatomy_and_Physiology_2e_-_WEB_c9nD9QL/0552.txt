unpaired frontal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. Parietal Bone Theparietal boneforms most of the upper lateral side of the skull (seeFigure 7.5). These are paired bones, with the right and left parietal bones joining together at the top of the skull. Each parietal bone is also bounded anteriorly by the frontal bone, inferiorly by the temporal bone, and posteriorly by the occipital bone. Temporal Bone Thetemporal boneforms the lower lateral side of the skull (seeFigure 7.5). Common wisdom has it that the temporal bone (temporal = “time”) is so named because this area of the head (the temple) is where hair typically first turns gray, indicating the passage of time. The temporal bone is subdivided into several regions (Figure 7.7). The flattened, upper portion is the squamous portion of the temporal bone. Below this area and projecting anteriorly is the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, which forms the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly is the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. Projecting inferiorly from this region is a large prominence, themastoid process, which serves as a muscle attachment site. The mastoid process can easily be felt on the side of the head just behind your earlobe. On
