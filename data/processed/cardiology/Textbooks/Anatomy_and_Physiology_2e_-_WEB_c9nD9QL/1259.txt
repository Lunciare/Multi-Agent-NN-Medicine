The caption for the video describes it as “less gray matter,” which is another way of saying “more white matter.” If the brain does not finish developing until approximately 20 years of age, can teenagers be held responsible for behaving badly? 13.2 The Central Nervous System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Name the major regions of the adult brain • Describe the connections between the cerebrum and brain stem through the diencephalon, and from those regions into the spinal cord • Recognize the complex connections within the subcortical structures of the basal nuclei • Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they represent the main organs of the nervous system. The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. A person’s conscious experiences are based on neural activity in the brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain. The coordination of reflexes
