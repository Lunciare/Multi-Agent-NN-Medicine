: male: 35–48 mm Hg, female: 32–45 mm Hg; total 2 venous bicarbonate: 22–29 mM. N denotes normal; ↑ denotes a rising or increased value; and ↓ denotes a falling or decreased value. Metabolic acidosis is problematic, as lower-than-normal amounts of bicarbonate are present in the blood. The PCO 2 would be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would decrease as the body reestablishes the proper ratio of bicarbonate and carbonic acid/CO . 2 Respiratory acidosis is problematic, as excess CO is present in the blood. Bicarbonate levels would be normal at 2 first, but if compensation has occurred, they would increase in an attempt to reestablish the proper ratio of bicarbonate and carbonic acid/CO . 2 Alkalosis is characterized by a higher-than-normal pH. Metabolic alkalosis is problematic, as elevated pH and excess bicarbonate are present. The PCO would again be normal at first, but if compensation has occurred, it would 2 increase as the body attempts to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid/CO . 2 Respiratory alkalosis is problematic, as CO deficiency is present in the bloodstream. The bicarbonate concentration 2 would be normal at first. When renal compensation occurs, however, the bicarbonate
