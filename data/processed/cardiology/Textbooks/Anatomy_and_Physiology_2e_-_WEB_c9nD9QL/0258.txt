the same protein in the same minute. Apolyribosomeis a string of ribosomes translating a single mRNA strand. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn about ribosomes. The ribosome binds to the mRNA molecule to start translation of its code into a protein. What happens to the small and large ribosomal subunits at the end of translation? 3.5 Cell Growth and Division LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the stages of the cell cycle • Discuss how the cell cycle is regulated • Describe the implications of losing control over the cell cycle • Describe the stages of mitosis and cytokinesis, in order So far in this chapter, you have read numerous times of the importance and prevalence of cell division. While there are a few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and some muscle cells), most somatic cells divide regularly. Asomatic cellis a general term for a body cell, and all human cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic cells. Somatic cells containtwocopies of each of their chromosomes (one
