have difficulty in bending directly forward, and the right and left sides of the back will not be level with each other in the bent position. FIGURE7.21 Abnormal Curvatures of the Vertebral Column (a) Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral bending of the vertebral column. (b) An excessive curvature of the upper thoracic vertebral column is called kyphosis. (c) Lordosis is an excessive curvature in the Access for free at openstax.org 7.3 • The Vertebral Column 251 lumbar region of the vertebral column. FIGURE7.22 Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder that causes the gradual loss of bone density and strength. When the thoracic vertebrae are affected, there can be a gradual collapse of the vertebrae. This results in kyphosis, an excessive curvature of the thoracic region. INTERACTIVE LINK Osteoporosis is a common age-related bone disease in which bone density and strength is decreased. Watch this video( get a better understanding of how thoracic vertebrae may become weakened and may fracture due to this disease. How may vertebral osteoporosis contribute to kyphosis? General Structure of a Vertebra Within the different regions of the vertebral column, vertebrae vary in size and shape, but they all follow a similar structural pattern. A typical vertebra
