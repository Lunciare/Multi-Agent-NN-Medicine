Also, those changes are the same for every action potential, which means that once the threshold is reached, the exact same thing happens. A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past threshold, will not make a “bigger” action potential. Action potentials are “all or none.” Either the membrane reaches the threshold and everything occurs as described above, or the membrane does not reach the threshold and nothing else happens. All action potentials peak at the same voltage (+30 mV), so one action potential is not bigger than another. Stronger stimuli will initiate multiple action potentials more quickly, but the individual signals are not bigger. Thus, for example, you will not feel a greater sensation of pain, or have a stronger muscle contraction, because of the size of the action potential because they are not different sizes. As we have seen, the depolarization and repolarization of an action potential are dependent on two types of channels (the voltage-gated Na+channel and the voltage-gated K+channel). The voltage-gated Na+channel actually 474 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue has two gates. One is theactivation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV. The other gate is theinactivation gate, which
