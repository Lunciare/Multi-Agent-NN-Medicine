Anatomy and Physiology

of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does 404 11 • The Muscular System not move). The insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective tissue and the dermis of the skin. Because the muscles insert in the skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create facial expression (Figure 11.7). FIGURE11.7 Muscles of Facial Expression Many of the muscles of facial expression insert into the skin surrounding the eyelids, nose and mouth, producing facial expressions by moving the skin rather than bones. Theorbicularis orisis a circular muscle that moves the lips, and theorbicularis oculiis a circular muscle that closes the eye. Theoccipitofrontalismuscle moves up the scalp and eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and an occipital (near the occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other words, there is a muscle on the forehead (frontalis) and one on the back of the head (occipitalis), but there is no muscle across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies are connected by a broad tendon called theepicranial aponeurosis, or galea aponeurosis (galea = “helmet”). The physicians originally
