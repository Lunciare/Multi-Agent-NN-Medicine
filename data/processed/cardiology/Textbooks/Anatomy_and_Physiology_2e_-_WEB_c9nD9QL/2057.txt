Anatomy and Physiology

circulating oxygen and oxygen attached to myoglobin, can supply sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance. Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the mitochondria to release energy in the form of ATP. Both fatty acid droplets and glycogen are stored within the sarcoplasm and provide additional nutrient supply.

The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is calledsystole. The period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is calleddiastole. Both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole, and it is essential that these components be carefully regulated and coordinated to
