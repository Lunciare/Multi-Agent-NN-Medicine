Anatomy and Physiology

dislocation injury of the acromioclavicular joint is known as a “shoulder separation” and is common in contact sports such as hockey, football, or martial arts. 8.2 Bones of the Upper Limb LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the divisions of the upper limb and describe the bones in each region • List the bones and bony landmarks that articulate at each joint of the upper limb 278 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton The upper limb is divided into three regions. These consist of thearm, located between the shoulder and elbow joints; theforearm, which is between the elbow and wrist joints; and thehand, which is located distal to the wrist. There are 30 bones in each upper limb (seeFigure 8.2). Thehumerusis the single bone of the upper arm, and the ulna(medially) and theradius(laterally) are the paired bones of the forearm. The base of the hand contains eight bones, each called acarpal bone, and the palm of the hand is formed by five bones, each called ametacarpal bone. The fingers and thumb contain a total of 14 bones, each of which is aphalanx bone of the hand. Humerus The humerus is the single
