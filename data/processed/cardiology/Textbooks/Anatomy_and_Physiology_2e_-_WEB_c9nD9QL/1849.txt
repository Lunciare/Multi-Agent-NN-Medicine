Anatomy and Physiology

however, by from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in releasing and inhibiting hormones from the turn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from hypothalamus. The six anterior pituitary hormones are: the adrenal cortex. The mineralocorticoids, chiefly growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone aldosterone, cause sodium and fluid retention, which (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle- increases blood volume and blood pressure. stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), 17.7The Pineal Gland and prolactin (PRL). The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the 17.4The Thyroid Gland diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in posterior to the thalamus. It is made up of the neck anterior to the trachea. Its hormones regulate pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the basal metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, hormone melatonin in response to low light levels. the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They High blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet also contribute to protein synthesis and the normal lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, growth and development of body tissues, including occurs because melatonin synthesis takes several days maturation of the nervous system, and they increase to readjust to the light-dark patterns
