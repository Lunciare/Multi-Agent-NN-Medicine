Throughout this chapter, we will express embryonic and fetal ages in terms of weeks from fertilization, commonly called conception. The period of time required for full development of a fetus in utero is referred to asgestation (gestare = “to carry” or “to bear”). It can be subdivided into distinct gestational periods. The first 2 weeks of prenatal development are referred to as the pre-embryonic stage. A developing human is referred to as anembryo during weeks 3–8, and afetusfrom the ninth week of gestation until birth. In this section, we’ll cover the pre- embryonic and embryonic stages of development, which are characterized by cell division, migration, and differentiation. By the end of the embryonic period, all of the organ systems are structured in rudimentary form, although the organs themselves are either nonfunctional or only semi-functional. Pre-implantation Embryonic Development Following fertilization, the zygote and its associated membranes, together referred to as theconceptus, continue to be projected toward the uterus by peristalsis and beating cilia of the epithelial cells of the Fallopian tube. During its journey to the uterus, the zygote undergoes five or six rapid mitotic cell divisions. Although eachcleavageresults in more cells, it does not increase the total volume of the
