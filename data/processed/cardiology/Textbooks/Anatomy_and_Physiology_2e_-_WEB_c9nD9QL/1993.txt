Anatomy and Physiology

in regulating the contraction of the muscle within the myocardium. The endothelium may also regulate the growth patterns of the cardiac muscle cells throughout life, and the endothelins 760 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart it secretes create an environment in the surrounding tissue fluids that regulates ionic concentrations and states of contractility. Endothelins are potent vasoconstrictors and, in a normal individual, establish a homeostatic balance with other vasoconstrictors and vasodilators. Internal Structure of the Heart Recall that the heart’s contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulation—the pulmonary and systemic circuits—because of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more precise understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail. Septa of the Heart The word septum is derived from the Latin for “something that encloses;” in this case, aseptum(plural = septa) refers to a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers. The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with endocardium. Located between the two atria is theinteratrial septum. Normally in an adult heart, the interatrial septum bears an oval-shaped depression known as thefossa ovalis, a remnant of
