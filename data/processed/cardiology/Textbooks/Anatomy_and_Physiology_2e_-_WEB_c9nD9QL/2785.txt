Anatomy and Physiology

creates a proton gradient with respect to the mitochondrial matrix. Also embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane is an amazing protein pore complex calledATP synthase. Effectively, it is a turbine that is powered by the flow of H+ions across the inner membrane down a gradient and into the mitochondrial matrix. As the H+ions traverse the complex, the shaft of the complex rotates. This rotation enables other portions of ATP synthase to encourage ADP and P to create ATP. In accounting for the total number of i ATP produced per glucose molecule through aerobic respiration, it is important to remember the following points: • A net of two ATP are produced through glycolysis (four produced and two consumed during the energy- consuming stage). However, these two ATP are used for transporting the NADH produced during glycolysis from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Therefore, the net production of ATP during glycolysis is zero. • In all phases after glycolysis, the number of ATP, NADH, and FADH produced must be multiplied by two to 2 reflect how each glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules. • In the ETC, about three ATP are produced for every oxidized NADH. However, only about two ATP are
