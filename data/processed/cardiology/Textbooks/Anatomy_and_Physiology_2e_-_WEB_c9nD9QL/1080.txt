Anatomy and Physiology

and Lower Limbs 437 cross-legged. Theposterior compartment of the thighincludes muscles that flex the leg and extend the thigh. The three long muscles on the back of the knee are thehamstring group, which flexes the knee. These are thebiceps femoris, semitendinosus, andsemimembranosus. The tendons of these muscles form thepopliteal fossa, the diamond- shaped space at the back of the knee. Muscles That Move the Feet and Toes Similar to the thigh muscles, the muscles of the leg are divided by deep fascia into compartments, although the leg has three: anterior, lateral, and posterior (Figure 11.32andFigure 11.33). FIGURE11.32 Muscles of the Lower Leg The muscles of the anterior compartment of the lower leg are generally responsible for dorsiflexion, and the muscles of the posterior compartment of the lower leg are generally responsible for plantar flexion. The lateral and medial muscles in both compartments invert, evert, and rotate the foot. 438 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.33 Muscles That Move the Feet and Toes The muscles in theanterior compartment of the leg: thetibialis anterior, a long and thick muscle on the lateral surface of the tibia, theextensor hallucis longus, deep under it, and theextensor digitorum longus, lateral to it, all contribute to
