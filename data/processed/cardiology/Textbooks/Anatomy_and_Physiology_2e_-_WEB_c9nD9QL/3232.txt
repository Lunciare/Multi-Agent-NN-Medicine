Anatomy and Physiology

in a systematic arrangement called akaryotype. Among these is one pair of chromosomes, called thesex chromosomes, that determines the sex of the individual (XX in females, XY in males). The remaining 22 chromosome pairs are calledautosomal chromosomes. Each of these chromosomes carries hundreds or even thousands of genes, each of which codes for the assembly of a particular protein—that is, genes are “expressed” as proteins. An individual’s complete genetic makeup is referred to as theirgenotype. The characteristics that the genes express, whether they are physical, behavioral, or biochemical, are a person’sphenotype. In genetics and reproduction, "parent" is often used to describe the individual organisms that contribute genetic material to offspring, usually in the form of gamete cells and their chromosomes. The concept of a genetic parent is distinct from social and legal concepts of parenthood, and may differ from those whom people consider their parents. You inherit one chromosome in each pair—a full complement of 23—from each parent. This occurs when the sperm and oocyte combine at the moment of your conception. Homologous chromosomes—those that make up a complementary pair—have genes for the same characteristics in the same location on the chromosome. Because one copy of a gene, anallele, is
