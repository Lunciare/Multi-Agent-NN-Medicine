be able to: • Explain how different foods can affect metabolism • Describe a healthy diet, as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) • List reasons why vitamins and minerals are critical to a healthy diet The carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the foods you eat are used for energy to power molecular, cellular, and organ system activities.
