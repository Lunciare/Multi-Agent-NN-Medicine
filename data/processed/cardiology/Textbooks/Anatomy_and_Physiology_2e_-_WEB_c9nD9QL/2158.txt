the blood volume at any given time (Figure 20.9). Their ability to hold this much blood is due to their highcapacitance, that is, their capacity to distend (expand) readily to store a high volume of blood, even at a low pressure. The large lumens and relatively thin walls of veins make them far more distensible than arteries; thus, they are said to becapacitance vessels. 820 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.9 Distribution of Blood Flow When blood flow needs to be redistributed to other portions of the body, the vasomotor center located in the medulla oblongata sends sympathetic stimulation to the smooth muscles in the walls of the veins, causing constriction—or in this case, venoconstriction. Less dramatic than the vasoconstriction seen in smaller arteries and arterioles, venoconstriction may be likened to a “stiffening” of the vessel wall. This increases pressure on the blood within the veins, speeding its return to the heart. As you will note inFigure 20.9, approximately 21 percent of the venous blood is located in venous networks within the liver, bone marrow, and integument. This volume of blood is referred to asvenous reserve. Through venoconstriction, this “reserve” volume of blood can get back
