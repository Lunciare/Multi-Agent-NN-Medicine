Phospholipids are 2.4Inorganic Compounds Essential to compounds composed of a diglyceride with a Human Functioning phosphate group attached at the molecule’s head. The result is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions. Inorganic compounds essential to human functioning Steroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings. include water, salts, acids, and bases. These The most important is cholesterol.
