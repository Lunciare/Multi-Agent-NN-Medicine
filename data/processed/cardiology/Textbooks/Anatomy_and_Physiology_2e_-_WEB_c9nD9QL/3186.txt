and includes nostrils, outer ears, and lenses (Figure 28.15). By the eighth week, the head is nearly as large as the rest of the embryo’s body, and all major brain structures are in place.

(This embryo was derived from an ectopic pregnancy.) (credit: Ed Uthman) INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( view the process of embryogenesis from fertilization through pregnancy to birth. Can you identify when neurulation occurs in the embryo? 28.3 Fetal Development LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Differentiate between the embryonic period and the fetal period • Briefly describe the process of sexual differentiation
