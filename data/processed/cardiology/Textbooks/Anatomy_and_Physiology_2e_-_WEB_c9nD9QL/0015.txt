of reactions that accomplish this:anabolismandcatabolism. • Anabolismis the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex substances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining small molecules derived from the foods you eat • Catabolismis the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler molecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down so the body can use their parts to assemble the structures and substances needed for life. Taken together, these two processes are called metabolism.Metabolismis the sum of all anabolic and catabolic reactions that take place in the body (Figure 1.6). Both anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously and continuously to keep you alive.

Catabolic reactions break materials down and release energy. Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions. Every cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound,adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store and release energy. The cell stores energy in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location where energy is
