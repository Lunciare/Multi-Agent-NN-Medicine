face along the midline. If both eyes see an object moving in the same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement? Everyday Connection Depth Perception, 3-D Movies, and Optical Illusions The visual field is projected onto the retinal surface, where photoreceptors transduce light energy into neural signals for the brain to interpret. The retina is a two-dimensional surface, so it does not encode three- dimensional information. However, we can perceive depth. How is that accomplished? Two ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on monocular cues and binocular cues, respectively. Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of information within the two-dimensional visual field. One object that overlaps another object has to be in front. Relative size differences are also a cue. For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the basket must be further away. On the basis of experience, we can estimate how far away the basket is. Binocular depth cues compare information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly the same. The centers of the two eyes are separated by a small
