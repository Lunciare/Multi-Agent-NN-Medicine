What are these enlargements approximately 20 years of age, can teenagers be responsible for? held responsible for behaving badly? 3. Watch thisvideo( basalnuclei1)to learn about the basal nuclei (also known as the basal ganglia), which have two pathways that process information within the cerebrum. As shown in this video, the direct pathway is the shorter pathway through the system that results in increased activity in the cerebral cortex and increased motor activity. The direct pathway is described as resulting in “disinhibition” of the thalamus. What does disinhibition mean? What are the two neurons doing individually to cause this?

Watch thisanimation( the chimpanzee, the human has a brain that is CSFflow)that shows the flow of CSF through the huge. At a point in the past, a common ancestor brain and spinal cord, and how it originates from gave rise to the two species of humans and the ventricles and then spreads into the space chimpanzees. That evolutionary history is long and within the meninges, where the fluids then move
