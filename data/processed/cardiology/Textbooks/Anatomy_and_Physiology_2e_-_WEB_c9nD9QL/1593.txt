An axon from one of these central neurons projects by way of the ventral spinal nerve root and Signaling molecules utilized by the autonomic nervous spinal nerve to a sympathetic ganglion, either in the system are released from axons and can be considered sympathetic chain ganglia or one of the collateral as either neurotransmitters (when they directly interact locations, where it synapses on a ganglionic neuron. with the effector) or as hormones (when they are These preganglionic fibers release ACh, which excites released into the bloodstream). The same molecule, the ganglionic neuron through the nicotinic receptor. such as norepinephrine, could be considered either a The axon from the ganglionic neuron—the neurotransmitter or a hormone on the basis of whether postganglionic fiber—then projects to a target effector it is released from a postganglionic sympathetic axon where it will release norepinephrine to bind to an or from the adrenal gland. The synapses in the adrenergic receptor, causing a change in the physiology autonomic system are not always the typical type of of that organ in keeping with the broad, divergent connection first described in the neuromuscular sympathetic response.
