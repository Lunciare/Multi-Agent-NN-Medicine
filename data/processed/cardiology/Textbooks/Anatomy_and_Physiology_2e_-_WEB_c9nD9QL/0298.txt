Anatomy and Physiology

it is ready to replicate itself and and functions, since all cells essentially originate from produce daughter cells. This interphase includes two a single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process gap phases (G and G ), as well as an S phase, during of cells becoming specialized as they body develops. A 1 2 which its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide division. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by without limit as needed and can, under specific chemical messengers both inside and outside the cell conditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem that provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement cells are divided into several categories according to from one phase to the next. Failures of these signals their potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells can result in cells that continue to divide contain the exact same genome, different cell types uncontrollably, which can lead to cancer. only express some of those genes at any given time. These differences in gene expression ultimately dictate Once a cell has completed interphase and is ready for a cell’s unique morphological and physiological cell division, it proceeds through four separate
