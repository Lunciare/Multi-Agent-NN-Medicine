curves develop after birth and thus are occipital bone. Openings here include the large secondary curves. The cervical curve develops as the foramen magnum, plus the internal acoustic meatus, infant begins to hold up the head, and the lumbar curve jugular foramina, and hypoglossal canals. Additional appears with standing and walking. openings located on the external base of the skull A typical vertebra consists of an enlarged anterior include the stylomastoid foramen and the entrance to portion called the body, which provides weight-bearing the carotid canal. support. Attached posteriorly to the body is a vertebral The anterior skull has the orbits that house the arch, which surrounds and defines the vertebral eyeballs and associated muscles. The walls of the orbit foramen for passage of the spinal cord. The vertebral are formed by contributions from seven bones: the arch consists of the pedicles, which attach to the frontal, zygomatic, maxillary, palatine, ethmoid, vertebral body, and the laminae, which come together lacrimal, and sphenoid. Located at the superior margin to form the roof of the arch. Arising from the vertebral of the orbit is the supraorbital foramen, and below the arch are the laterally projecting transverse processes orbit is the infraorbital foramen.
