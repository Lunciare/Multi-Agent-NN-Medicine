Anatomy and Physiology

are mediated by the hormones of the adrenal cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HPA axis. Adrenal hormones also have several non–stress-related functions, including the increase of blood sodium and glucose levels, which will be described in detail below. Adrenal Cortex The adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells that occur in three structurally distinct regions. Each of these regions produces different hormones. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thislink( view an animation describing the location and function of the adrenal glands. Which hormone produced by the adrenal glands is responsible for the mobilization of energy stores? Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa The most superficial region of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa, which produces a group of hormones collectively referred to asmineralocorticoidsbecause of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium. These hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance. Aldosteroneis the major mineralocorticoid. It is important in the regulation of the concentration of sodium and potassium ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K+, low blood Na+, low blood pressure, or low blood volume. In response, aldosterone increases the excretion of K+and the
