Anatomy and Physiology

through the aortic hiatus of the posterior diaphragm. The Intercostal Muscles There are three sets of muscles, calledintercostal muscles, which span each of the intercostal spaces. The principal role of the intercostal muscles is to assist in breathing by changing the dimensions of the rib cage (Figure 11.18).

The internal intercostals are located medially near the sternum. The innermost intercostals are located deep to both the internal and external intercostals. The 11 pairs of superficialexternal intercostalmuscles aid in inspiration of air during breathing because when they contract, they raise the rib cage, which expands it. The 11 pairs ofinternal intercostalmuscles, just under the externals, are used for expiration because they draw the ribs together to constrict the rib cage. Theinnermost intercostalmuscles are the deepest, and they act as synergists for the action of the internal intercostals. Muscles of the Pelvic Floor and Perineum The pelvic floor is a muscular sheet that defines the inferior portion of the pelvic cavity. Thepelvic diaphragm, spanning anteriorly to posteriorly from the pubis to
