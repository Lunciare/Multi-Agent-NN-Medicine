blood through the cardiac circuits • Describe the size, shape, and location of the heart • Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle • Explain the cardiac conduction system • Describe the process and purpose of an electrocardiogram • Explain the cardiac cycle • Calculate cardiac output • Describe the effects of exercise on cardiac output and heart rate • Name the centers of the brain that control heart rate and describe their function • Identify other factors affecting heart rate • Describe fetal heart development INTRODUCTION In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no single better word to describe the function of the heart other than “pump,” since its contraction develops the pressure that ejects blood into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk. From these vessels, the blood is distributed to the remainder of the body. Although the connotation of the term “pump” suggests a mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical structure is a living, sophisticated muscle. As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and muscle. Although the term “heart” is an English word, cardiac
