Anatomy and Physiology

Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions. Anorgan systemis a group of organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body. This book covers eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (Figure 1.4andFigure 1.5). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that “belong” to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, most organs contribute to more than one system. In this book and throughout your studies of biological sciences, you will often read descriptions related to similarities and differences among biological structures, processes, and health related to a person's biological sex. People often use the words "female" and "male" to describe two different concepts: our sense of gender identity, and our biological sex as determined by our chromosomes, hormones, organs, and other physical characteristics. For some people, gender identity is different from biological sex or their sex assigned at birth. Throughout this book, "female" and "male" refer to sex only, and the typical anatomy and physiology of XX and XY individuals is discussed. 12 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body FIGURE1.4 Organ Systems of the Human Body Organs that work together
