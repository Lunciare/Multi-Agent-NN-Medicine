of the rib(seeFigure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal facet located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowedneck of the rib. A small bump on the posterior rib surface is thetubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the transverse process of the same numbered vertebra. The remainder of the rib is thebody of the rib(shaft). Just lateral to the tubercle is theangle of the rib, the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The angles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align with the medial border of the scapula. A shallowcostal groovefor the passage of blood vessels and a nerve is found along the inferior margin of each rib. Rib Classifications The bony ribs do not extend anteriorly completely around to the sternum. Instead, each rib ends in acostal cartilage. These cartilages are made of hyaline cartilage and can extend for several inches. Most ribs are then attached, either directly or
