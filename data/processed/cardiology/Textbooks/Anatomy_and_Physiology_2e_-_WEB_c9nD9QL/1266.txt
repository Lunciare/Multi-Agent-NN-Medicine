cortex. Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned movements. Thepremotor areais responsible for thinking of a movement to be made. Thefrontal eye fieldsare important in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli.Broca’s areais responsible for the production of language, or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located only on the left side. Anterior to these regions is theprefrontal lobe, which serves cognitive functions that can be 502 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System the basis of personality, short-term memory, and consciousness. The prefrontal lobotomy is an outdated mode of treatment for personality disorders (psychiatric conditions) that profoundly affected the personality of the patient. FIGURE13.8 Brodmann's Areas of the Cerebral Cortex Brodmann mapping of functionally distinct regions of the cortex was based on its cytoarchitecture at a microscopic level. Subcortical structures Beneath the cerebral cortex are sets of nuclei known assubcortical nucleithat augment cortical processes. The nuclei of the basal forebrain serve as the primary location for acetylcholine production, which modulates
