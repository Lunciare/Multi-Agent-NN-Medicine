up the larynx. The thyroid cartilage consists of thelaryngeal prominence, or “Adam’s apple,” which tends to be more prominent in males. The thickcricoid cartilageforms a ring, with a wide posterior region and a thinner anterior region. Three smaller, paired cartilages—the arytenoids, corniculates, and cuneiforms—attach to the epiglottis and the vocal cords and muscle that help move the vocal cords to produce speech.

Theepiglottis, attached to the thyroid cartilage, is a very flexible piece of elastic cartilage that covers the opening of the trachea (seeFigure 22.4). When in the “closed” position, the unattached end of the epiglottis rests on the glottis. Theglottisis composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between these folds (Figure 22.8). Avestibular fold, or false vocal cord, is one of a pair of folded sections of mucous membrane. Atrue vocal cordis one of the white, membranous folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages of the larynx on their outer edges. The inner edges of the true vocal cords are free,
