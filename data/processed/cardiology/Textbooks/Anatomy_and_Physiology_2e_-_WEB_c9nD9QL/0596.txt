Anatomy and Physiology

General Structure of a Vertebra Within the different regions of the vertebral column, vertebrae vary in size and shape, but they all follow a similar structural pattern. A typical vertebra will consist of a body, a vertebral arch, and seven processes (Figure 7.23). The body is the anterior portion of each vertebra and is the part that supports the body weight. Because of this, the vertebral bodies progressively increase in size and thickness going down the vertebral column. The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated and strongly united by an intervertebral disc. Thevertebral archforms the posterior portion of each vertebra. It consists of four parts, the right and left pedicles and the right and left laminae. Eachpedicleforms one of the lateral sides of the vertebral arch. The pedicles are anchored to the posterior side of the vertebral body. Eachlaminaforms part of the posterior roof of the vertebral arch. The large opening between the vertebral arch and body is thevertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. In the intact vertebral column, the vertebral foramina of all of the vertebrae align to form thevertebral (spinal) canal, which serves as the bony protection and passageway for the spinal cord down the back.
