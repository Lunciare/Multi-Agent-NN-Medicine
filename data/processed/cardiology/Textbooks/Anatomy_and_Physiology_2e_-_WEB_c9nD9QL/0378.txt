Endocrine glands secrete the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate hormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood information. stream. Glands are classified both according to the type of secretion and by their structure.

All cells and tissues in the Apocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the body derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the apical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. store their secretions until they rupture and release Different types of tissues form membranes that their contents.
