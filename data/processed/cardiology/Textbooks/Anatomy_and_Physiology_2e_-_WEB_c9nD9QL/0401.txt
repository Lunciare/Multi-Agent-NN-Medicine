Anatomy and Physiology

two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in the stratum granulosum and give the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as the cells die, leaving behind the keratin, keratohyalin, and cell membranes that will form the stratum lucidum, the stratum corneum, and the accessory structures of hair and nails. Stratum Lucidum Thestratum lucidumis a smooth, seemingly translucent layer of the epidermis located just above the stratum granulosum and below the stratum corneum. This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms, soles, and digits. The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (seeFigure 5.5). These cells are densely packed witheleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their transparent (i.e., lucid) appearance. Stratum Corneum Thestratum corneumis the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside environment (seeFigure 5.5). The increased keratinization (also called cornification) of the cells in this layer gives it its name. There are usually 15 to 30 layers of cells in the stratum corneum. This dry, dead layer helps prevent the penetration of microbes and the dehydration of underlying tissues, and
