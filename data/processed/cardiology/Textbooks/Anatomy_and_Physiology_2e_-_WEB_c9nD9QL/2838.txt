Anabolic reactions build bone, muscle mass, Metabolism is the sum of all catabolic (break down) and new proteins, fats, and nucleic acids. Oxidation- and anabolic (synthesis) reactions in the body. The reduction reactions transfer electrons across metabolic rate measures the amount of energy used to molecules by oxidizing one molecule and reducing maintain life. An organism must ingest a sufficient another, and collecting the released energy to convert amount of food to maintain its metabolic rate if the P and ADP into ATP. Errors in metabolism alter the i organism is to stay alive for very long. processing of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and Catabolic reactions break down larger molecules, such nucleic acids, and can result in a number of disease as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins from ingested states. food, into their constituent smaller parts.
