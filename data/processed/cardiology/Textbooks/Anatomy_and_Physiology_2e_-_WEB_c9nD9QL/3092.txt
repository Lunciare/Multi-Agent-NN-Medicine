Anatomy and Physiology of the Ovarian Reproductive System 1201 Mutations (changes) in mtDNA occur spontaneously in a somewhat organized pattern at regular intervals in human history. By analyzing these mutational relationships, researchers have been able to determine that we can all trace our ancestry back to one female who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. More precisely, that human is our most recent common ancestor through matrilineal descent. This doesn’t mean that everyone’s mtDNA today looks exactly like that of our common ancestor. Because of the spontaneous mutations in mtDNA that have occurred over the centuries, researchers can map different “branches” off of the “main trunk” of our mtDNA family tree. Your mtDNA might have a pattern of mutations that aligns more closely with one branch, and your neighbor’s may align with another branch. Still, all branches eventually lead back to the common ancestor. But what happened to the mtDNA of all of the otherHomo sapiensfemales who were living 200,000 years ago? Researchers explain that, over the centuries, their female descendants died childless or with only male children, and thus, their maternal line—and its mtDNA—ended.
