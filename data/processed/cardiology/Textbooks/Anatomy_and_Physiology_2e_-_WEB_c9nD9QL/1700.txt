primarily concerned with planning motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the thalamic projections back to the premotor and motor cortices. Processing in the midline regions targets movements of the axial musculature, whereas the lateral regions target movements of the appendicular musculature. The vermis is referred to as thespinocerebellumbecause it primarily receives input from the dorsal columns and spinocerebellar pathways. The flocculonodular lobe is referred to as thevestibulocerebellumbecause of the vestibular projection into that region. Finally, the lateral cerebellum is referred to as thecerebrocerebellum, reflecting the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway. FIGURE16.15 Major Regions of the Cerebellum The cerebellum can be divided into two basic regions: the midline and the hemispheres. The midline is composed of the vermis and the flocculonodular lobe, and the hemispheres are the lateral regions. Coordination and Alternating Movement Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature, controlling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar function will depend on the normal functioning of other systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control from the cerebrum, as well as sensory input from
