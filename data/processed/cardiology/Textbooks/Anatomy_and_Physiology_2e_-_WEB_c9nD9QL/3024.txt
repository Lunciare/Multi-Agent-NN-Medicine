blood. However, the bicarbonate buffer is the primary buffering system of the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the body. Respiratory Regulation of Acid-Base Balance The respiratory system contributes to the balance of acids and bases in the body by regulating the blood levels of carbonic acid (Figure 26.16). CO in the blood readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid, and the levels of CO 2 2 and carbonic acid in the blood are in equilibrium. When the CO level in the blood rises (as it does when you hold 2 your breath), the excess CO reacts with water to form additional carbonic acid, lowering blood pH. Increasing the 2 rate and/or depth of respiration (which you might feel the “urge” to do after holding your breath) allows you to exhale more CO . The loss of CO from the body reduces blood levels of carbonic acid and thereby adjusts the pH 2 2 upward, toward normal levels. As you might have surmised, this process also works in the opposite direction. Excessive deep and rapid breathing (as in hyperventilation) rids the blood of CO and reduces the level of carbonic 2 acid, making the blood too alkaline. This
