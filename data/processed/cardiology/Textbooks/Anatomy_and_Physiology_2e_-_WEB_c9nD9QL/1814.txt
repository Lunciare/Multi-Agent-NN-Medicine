a variety of digestive enzymes, the pancreas has an endocrine function. Itspancreatic islets—clusters of cells formerly known as the islets of Langerhans—secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). FIGURE17.18 Pancreas The pancreatic exocrine function involves the acinar cells secreting digestive enzymes that are transported into the small intestine by the pancreatic duct. Its endocrine function involves the secretion of insulin (produced by beta cells) and glucagon (produced by alpha cells) within the pancreatic islets. These two hormones regulate the rate of glucose metabolism in the body. The micrograph reveals pancreatic islets. LM × 760.

Glucagon plays an important role in blood glucose regulation; low blood glucose levels stimulate its release. • Thebeta cellproduces the hormone insulin and makes up approximately 75 percent of each islet. Elevated blood glucose levels stimulate the release of
