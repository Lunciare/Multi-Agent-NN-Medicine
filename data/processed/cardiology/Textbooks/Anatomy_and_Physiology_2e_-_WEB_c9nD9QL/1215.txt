with few or no myelinated input and response output to and from the central axons; actually may be more pink or tan in color, but nervous system called gray in contrast to white matter neuron neural tissue cell that is primarily responsible inactivation gate part of a voltage-gated Na+channel for generating and propagating electrical signals that closes when the membrane potential reaches into, within, and out of the nervous system +30 mV neuropeptide neurotransmitter type that includes inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) graded protein molecules and shorter chains of amino acids potential in the postsynaptic membrane that is the neurotransmitter chemical signal that is released result of hyperpolarization and makes an action from the synaptic end bulb of a neuron to cause a potential less likely to occur change in the target cell initial segment first part of the axon as it emerges nicotinic receptor type of acetylcholine receptor from the axon hillock, where the electrical signals protein that is characterized by also binding to known as action potentials are generated nicotine and is an ionotropic receptor integration nervous system function that combines node of Ranvier gap between two myelinated regions sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions of an axon, allowing
