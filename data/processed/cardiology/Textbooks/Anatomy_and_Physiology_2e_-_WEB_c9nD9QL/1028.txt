The rectus abdominis (rector = “straight”) is the straight muscle in the anterior wall of the abdomen, while the rectus femoris is the straight muscle in the anterior compartment of the thigh. When a muscle has a widespread expansion over a sizable area, but then the fascicles come to a single, common attachment point, the muscle is calledconvergent. The attachment point for a convergent muscle could be a tendon, an aponeurosis (a flat, broad tendon), or a raphe (a very slender tendon). The large muscle on the chest, the pectoralis major,
