Anatomy and Physiology

with embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells are present throughout adulthood and allow for the continuous differentiation of blood cells to replace those lost to age or function. These cells can be divided into three classes based on function: • Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them • Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity • Cells containing cytoplasmic granules, which help mediate immune responses against parasites and 898 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System intracellular pathogens such as viruses FIGURE21.5 Hematopoietic System of the Bone Marrow All the cells of the immune response as well as of the blood arise by differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells. Platelets are cell fragments involved in the clotting of blood. Lymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells As stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses (Table 21.1). The two basic types of lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin layer of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the molecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and
