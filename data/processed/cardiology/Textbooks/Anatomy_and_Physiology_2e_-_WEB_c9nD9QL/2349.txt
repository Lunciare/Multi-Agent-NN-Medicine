killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response. Anatural killer cell (NK)is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares this mechanism with the cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune response. NK cells are among the body’s first lines of defense against viruses and certain types of cancer. Lymphocytes Type of lymphocyte Primary function B lymphocyte Generates diverse antibodies T lymphocyte Secretes chemical messengers Plasma cell Secretes antibodies NK cell Destroys virally infected cells TABLE21.1 INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thiswebsite( learn about the many different cell types in the immune system and their very specialized jobs. What is the role of the dendritic cell in an HIV infection? Primary Lymphoid Organs and Lymphocyte Development Understanding the differentiation and development of B and T cells is critical to the understanding of the adaptive immune response. It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the body’s own cells relatively intact. Theprimary lymphoid organsare the bone marrow and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells of the body. Bone Marrow In
