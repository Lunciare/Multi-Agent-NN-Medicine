intestinal mucosa. The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex mucus-secretingduodenal glands(Brunner’s glands), which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers the acidic chyme as it enters from the stomach. The roles of the cells in the small intestinal mucosa are detailed inTable 23.7. Cells of the Small Intestinal Mucosa Location in the Cell type Function mucosa Epithelium/intestinal Absorptive Digestion and absorption of nutrients in chyme glands Epithelium/intestinal Goblet Secretion of mucus glands Paneth Intestinal glands Secretion of the bactericidal enzyme lysozyme; phagocytosis Intestinal glands of G cells Secretion of the hormone intestinal gastrin duodenum Intestinal glands of Secretion of the hormone cholecystokinin, which stimulates release of I cells duodenum pancreatic juices and bile Secretion of the hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, K cells Intestinal glands which stimulates the release of insulin Intestinal glands of Secretion of the hormone motilin, which accelerates gastric emptying, M cells duodenum and stimulates intestinal peristalsis, and stimulates the production of pepsin jejunum S cells Intestinal glands Secretion of the hormone secretin TABLE23.7 Intestinal MALT The lamina propria of the small intestine mucosa is studded with quite a bit of MALT. In addition to solitary lymphatic nodules, aggregations of intestinal MALT, which
