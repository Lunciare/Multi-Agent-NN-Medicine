the axon as voltage- The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based gated ion channels are opened by the spreading on the neurotransmitter system produced by that depolarization. In unmyelinated axons, this happens in neuron. The cholinergic system is found at the a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated neuromuscular junction and in certain places within channels throughout the membrane. In myelinated the nervous system. Amino acids, such as glutamate, axons, propagation is described as saltatory because glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are voltage-gated channels are only found at the nodes of used as neurotransmitters. Other neurotransmitters Ranvier and the electrical events seem to “jump” from are the result of amino acids being enzymatically one node to the next. Saltatory conduction is faster changed, as in the biogenic amines, or being covalently than continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated bonded together, as in the neuropeptides. axons propagate their signals faster.
