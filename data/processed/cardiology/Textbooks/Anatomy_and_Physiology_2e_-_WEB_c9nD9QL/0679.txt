of the Upper Limb 279 muscles of the anterior forearm arise from the medial epicondyle, which is thus larger and more robust than the lateral epicondyle that gives rise to the weaker posterior forearm muscles. The distal end of the humerus has two articulation areas, which join the ulna and radius bones of the forearm to form theelbow joint. The more medial of these areas is thetrochlea, a spindle- or pulley-shaped region (trochlea = “pulley”), which articulates with the ulna bone. Immediately lateral to the trochlea is thecapitulum(“small head”), a knob-like structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus. The capitulum articulates with the radius bone of the forearm. Just above these bony areas are two small depressions. These spaces accommodate the forearm bones when the elbow is fully bent (flexed). Superior to the trochlea is thecoronoid fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna, and above the capitulum is theradial fossa, which receives the head of the radius when the elbow is flexed. Similarly, the posterior humerus has theolecranon fossa, a larger depression that receives the olecranon process of the ulna when the forearm is fully extended. Ulna The ulna is the medial bone of the
