by a pituitary or thyroid tumor. In Graves’ disease, the hyperthyroid state results from an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies overstimulate the follicle cells of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can lead to an increased metabolic rate, excessive body heat and sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, tremors, and increased heart rate. The person’s eyes may bulge (called exophthalmos) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues of the orbits. The person may also develop a goiter. Calcitonin The thyroid gland also secretes a hormone calledcalcitoninthat is produced by the parafollicular cells (also called C cells) that stud the tissue between distinct follicles. Calcitonin is released in response to a rise in blood calcium Access for free at openstax.org 17.5 • The Parathyroid Glands 685 levels. It appears to have a function in decreasing blood calcium concentrations by: • Inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, bone cells that release calcium into the circulation by degrading bone matrix • Increasing osteoblastic activity • Decreasing calcium absorption in the intestines • Increasing calcium loss in the urine However, these functions are usually not significant in maintaining calcium homeostasis, so the importance of calcitonin is not entirely understood. Pharmaceutical preparations of calcitonin are sometimes prescribed to reduce
