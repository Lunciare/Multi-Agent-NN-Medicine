Anatomy and Physiology

low bicarbonate blood levels can result from elevated levels of ketones (common in unmanaged diabetes mellitus), which bind bicarbonate in the filtrate and prevent its conservation. Bicarbonate ions, HCO -, found in the filtrate, are essential to the bicarbonate buffer system, yet the cells of the 3 tubule are not permeable to bicarbonate ions. The steps involved in supplying bicarbonate ions to the system are seen inFigure 26.17and are summarized below: • Step 1: Sodium ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate in exchange for H+by an antiport mechanism in the apical membranes of cells lining the renal tubule. • Step 2: The cells produce bicarbonate ions that can be shunted to peritubular capillaries. • Step 3: When CO is available, the reaction is driven to the formation of carbonic acid, which dissociates to form 2 a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion. • Step 4: The bicarbonate ion passes into the peritubular capillaries and returns to the blood. The hydrogen ion is secreted into the filtrate, where it can become part of new water molecules and be reabsorbed as such, or removed in the urine.
