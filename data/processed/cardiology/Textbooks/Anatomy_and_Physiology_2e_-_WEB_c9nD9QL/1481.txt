Anatomy and Physiology

encapsulated ending configuration of a sensory gustation sense of taste receptor neuron with dendrites surrounded by gustatory receptor cells sensory cells in the taste specialized structures to aid in transduction of a bud that transduce the chemical stimuli of gustation particular type of sensation, such as the lamellated hair cells mechanoreceptor cells found in the inner corpuscles in the deep dermis and subcutaneous ear that transduce stimuli for the senses of hearing tissue and balance equilibrium sense of balance that includes incus (also, anvil) ossicle of the middle ear that sensations of position and movement of the head connects the malleus to the stapes executive functions cognitive processes of the inferior colliculus last structure in the auditory prefrontal cortex that lead to directing goal-directed brainstem pathway that projects to the thalamus behavior, which is a precursor to executing motor and superior colliculus commands inferior oblique extraocular muscle responsible for external ear structures on the lateral surface of the lateral rotation of the eye head, including the auricle and the ear canal back to inferior rectus extraocular muscle responsible for the tympanic membrane looking down exteroceptor sensory receptor that is positioned to inner ear structure within the temporal bone that interpret
