to secrete T and T . The levels of TRH, TSH, T , and T are regulated by a negative feedback system in which 3 4 3 4 increasing levels of T and T decrease the production and secretion of TSH. 3 4 Access for free at openstax.org 17.4 • The Thyroid Gland 683 FIGURE17.13 Classic Negative Feedback Loop A classic negative feedback loop controls the regulation of thyroid hormone levels. Functions of Thyroid Hormones The thyroid hormones, T and T , are often referred to as metabolic hormones because their levels influence the 3 4 body’s basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy used by the body at rest. When T and T bind to intracellular 3 4 receptors located on the mitochondria, they cause an increase in nutrient breakdown and the use of oxygen to produce ATP. In addition, T and T initiate the transcription of genes involved in glucose oxidation. Although these 3 4 mechanisms prompt cells to produce more ATP, the process is inefficient, and an abnormally increased level of heat is released as a byproduct of these reactions. This so-called calorigenic effect (calor- = “heat”) raises body temperature. Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are also
