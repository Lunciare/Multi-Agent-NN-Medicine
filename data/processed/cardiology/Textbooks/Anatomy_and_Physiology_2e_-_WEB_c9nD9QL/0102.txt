formation of large groupings called crystals. Water is an essential component of life because it is able to break the ionic bonds in salts to free the ions. In fact, in Access for free at openstax.org 2.2 • Chemical Bonds 49 biological fluids, most individual atoms exist as ions. These dissolved ions produce electrical charges within the body. The behavior of these ions produces the tracings of heart and brain function observed as waves on an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG). The electrical activity that derives from the interactions of the charged ions is why they are also called electrolytes. Covalent Bonds Unlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive charge and an anion’s negative charge, molecules formed by acovalent bondshare electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship. Like next-door neighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons permanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of pairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds. Nonpolar Covalent Bonds Figure 2.9shows several common types of
