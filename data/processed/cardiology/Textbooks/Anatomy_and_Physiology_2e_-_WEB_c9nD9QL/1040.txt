The movement of the eyeball is under the control of theextrinsic eye muscles, which originate outside the eye and insert onto the outer surface of the white of the eye.

If you have ever been to a doctor who held up a finger and asked you to follow it up, down, and to both sides, the doctor is checking to make sure your eye muscles are acting in a coordinated pattern. 406 11 • The Muscular System FIGURE11.9 Muscles of the Eyes (a) The extrinsic eye muscles originate outside of the eye on the skull.
