bond formed within a solution polypeptide between sulfide groups of sulfur- activation energy amount of energy greater than the containing amino acids, for example, cysteine energy contained in the reactants, which must be electron subatomic particle having a negative charge overcome for a reaction to proceed and nearly no mass; found orbiting the atom’s adenosine triphosphate (ATP) nucleotide containing nucleus ribose and an adenine base that is essential in electron shell area of space a given distance from an energy transfer atom’s nucleus in which electrons are grouped amino acid building block of proteins; characterized element substance that cannot be created or broken by an amino and carboxyl functional groups and a down by ordinary chemical means variable side-chain enzyme protein or RNA that catalyzes chemical anion atom with a negative charge reactions atom smallest unit of an element that retains the exchange reaction type of chemical reaction in which unique properties of that element bonds are both formed and broken, resulting in the atomic number number of protons in the nucleus of transfer of components an atom functional group group of atoms linked by strong base compound that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) in covalent bonds that tends to behave
