(HDN)or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly after birth. FIGURE18.15 Erythroblastosis Fetalis The first exposure of an Rh−person to Rh+erythrocytes during pregnancy induces 742 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood sensitization. Anti-Rh antibodies begin to circulate in the pregnant person's bloodstream. A second exposure occurs with a subsequent pregnancy with an Rh+fetus in the uterus. During that subsequent pregnancy, the pregnant person's anti-Rh antibodies may cross the placenta and enter the fetal bloodstream, causing agglutination and hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes. A drug known as RhoGAM, short for Rh immune globulin, can temporarily prevent the development of Rh antibodies in the Rh−parent, thereby averting this potentially serious disease for the fetus. RhoGAM antibodies destroy any fetal Rh+erythrocytes that may cross the placental barrier. RhoGAM is normally administered to Rh−pregnant people during weeks 26−28 of pregnancy and within 72 hours following birth. It has proven remarkably effective in decreasing the incidence of HDN. Earlier we noted that the incidence of HDN in an Rh+subsequent pregnancy to an Rh−person is about 13–14 percent without preventive treatment. Since the introduction of
