range—between pH 7.35 and 7.45. A 7.35) and too alkaline (pH above 7.45). Each of these buffer is a substance that prevents a radical change in conditions can be caused either by metabolic problems fluid pH by absorbing excess hydrogen or hydroxyl related to bicarbonate levels or by respiratory ions. Most commonly, the substance that absorbs the problems related to carbonic acid and CO levels. 2 ion is either a weak acid, which takes up a hydroxyl ion Several compensatory mechanisms allow the body to (OH-), or a weak base, which takes up a hydrogen ion maintain a normal pH.
