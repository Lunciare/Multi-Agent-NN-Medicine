An example is enzymes, which thereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic). catalyze chemical reactions. 78 2 • Interactive Link Questions Nucleotides are compounds with three building blocks: body’s fundamental molecule of energy transfer. one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a Removal or addition of phosphates releases or invests nitrogen-containing base.
