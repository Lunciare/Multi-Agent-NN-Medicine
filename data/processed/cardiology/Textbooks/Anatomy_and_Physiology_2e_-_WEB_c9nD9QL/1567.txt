several effects of the autonomic system in response to fear. On the basis of what you have already studied about autonomic function, which effect would you expect to be associated with parasympathetic, rather than sympathetic, activity? 15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • List the classes of pharmaceuticals that interact with the autonomic nervous system • Differentiate between cholinergic and adrenergic compounds • Differentiate between sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs • Relate the consequences of nicotine abuse with respect to autonomic control of the cardiovascular system An important way to understand the effects of native neurochemicals in the autonomic system is in considering the effects of pharmaceutical drugs. This can be considered in terms of how drugs change autonomic function. These effects will primarily be based on how drugs act at the receptors of the autonomic system neurochemistry. The signaling molecules of the nervous system interact with proteins in the cell membranes of various target cells. In fact, no effect can be attributed to just the signaling molecules themselves without considering the receptors. A chemical that the body produces to interact with those receptors is called anendogenous
