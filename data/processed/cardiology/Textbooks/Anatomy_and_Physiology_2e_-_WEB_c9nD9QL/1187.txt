Anatomy and Physiology

polarity of the neuron is maintained, as mentioned above. Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon segment, but there are no voltage-gated Na+channels until the first node of Ranvier. Because there is not constant opening of these channels along the axon segment, the depolarization spreads at an optimal speed. The distance between nodes is the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next node. As Na+spreads along the inside of the membrane of the axon segment, the charge starts to dissipate. If the node were any farther down the axon, that depolarization would have fallen off too much for voltage-gated Na+ channels to be activated at the next node of Ranvier. If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation would be slower. Propagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to ascontinuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated axon, it issaltatory conduction. Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated Na+ channels opening, and more and more Na+is rushing into the cell.
