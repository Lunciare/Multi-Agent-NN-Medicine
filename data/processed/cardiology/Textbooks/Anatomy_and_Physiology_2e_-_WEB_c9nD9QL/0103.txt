Anatomy and Physiology

the close sharing of pairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds. Nonpolar Covalent Bonds Figure 2.9shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically share just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is that in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of both atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is shared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. There even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms. FIGURE2.9 Covalent Bonding You can see that the covalent bonds shown inFigure 2.9are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is relatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why covalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region of the molecule is either more positive
