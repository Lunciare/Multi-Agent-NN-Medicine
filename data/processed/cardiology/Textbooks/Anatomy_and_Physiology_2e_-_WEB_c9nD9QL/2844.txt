ketone bodies can be oxidized and used for fuel. there is a corresponding drop in insulin levels. Falling Excess acetyl CoA generated from excess glucose or glucose levels trigger the pancreas to release glucagon carbohydrate ingestion can be used for fatty acid to turn off glycogen synthesis in the liver and stimulate 1104 24 • Review Questions its breakdown into glucose. The glucose is released mechanisms to return the temperature to its normal into the bloodstream to serve as a fuel source for cells range. The body can also gain or lose heat through throughout the body. If glycogen stores are depleted mechanisms of heat exchange. Conduction transfers during fasting, alternative sources, including fatty acids heat from one object to another through physical and proteins, can be metabolized and used as fuel. contact. Convection transfers heat to air or water. When the body once again enters the absorptive state Radiation transfers heat via infrared radiation. after fasting, fats and proteins are digested and used to Evaporation transfers heat as water changes state from replenish fat and protein stores, whereas glucose is a liquid to a gas. processed and used first to replenish the glycogen 24.7Nutrition and Diet stores in the
