Anatomy and Physiology

For example, when certain immune defense cells (white blood cells) phagocytize bacteria, the bacterial cell is transported into a lysosome and digested by the enzymes inside. As one might imagine, such phagocytic defense cells contain large numbers of lysosomes. Under certain circumstances, lysosomes perform a more grand and dire function. In the case of damaged or unhealthy cells, lysosomes can be triggered to open up and release their digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm of the cell, killing the cell. This “self-destruct” mechanism is calledautolysis, and makes the process of cell death controlled (a mechanism called “apoptosis”). INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn about the endomembrane system, which includes the rough and smooth ER and the Golgi body as well as lysosomes and vesicles.

Just as you must consume nutrients to provide yourself with energy, so must each of your cells take in nutrients, some of which convert to chemical energy that can be used to power
