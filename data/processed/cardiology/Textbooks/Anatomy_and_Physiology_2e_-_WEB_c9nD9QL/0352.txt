Anatomy and Physiology

able to: • Identify the three types of muscle tissue • Compare and contrast the functions of each muscle tissue type • Explain how muscle tissue can enable motion Muscle tissue is characterized by properties that allow movement. Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a stimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two movable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle movement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book and read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control, such as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure and function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2). 148 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization Comparison of Structure and Properties of Muscle Tissue Types Tissue Histology Function Location Long cylindrical fiber, Attached to bones and striated, many Voluntary movement, produces heat, protects around entrance points Skeletal peripherally located organs to body (e.g., mouth, nuclei anus) Short, branched, Cardiac striated, single central Contracts to
