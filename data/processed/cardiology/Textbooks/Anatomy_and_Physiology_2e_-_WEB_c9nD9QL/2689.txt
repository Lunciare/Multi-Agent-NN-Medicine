Anatomy and Physiology

lateral bends that create a trio of internal transverse folds called therectal valves. These valves help separate the feces from gas to prevent the simultaneous passage of feces and gas. Anal Canal Finally, food residue reaches the last part of the large intestine, theanal canal, which is located in the perineum, completely outside of the abdominopelvic cavity. This 3.8–5 cm (1.5–2 in) long structure opens to the exterior of the Access for free at openstax.org 23.5 • The Small and Large Intestines 1029 body at the anus. The anal canal includes two sphincters. Theinternal anal sphincteris made of smooth muscle, and its contractions are involuntary. Theexternal anal sphincteris made of skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control. Except when defecating, both usually remain closed. Histology There are several notable differences between the walls of the large and small intestines (Figure 23.22). For example, few enzyme-secreting cells are found in the wall of the large intestine, and there are no circular folds or villi. Other than in the anal canal, the mucosa of the colon is simple columnar epithelium made mostly of enterocytes (absorptive cells) and goblet cells. In addition, the wall of the large intestine has far more intestinal glands,
