Pharynx esophagus • Propels food to the stomach • Lubricates food and passageways Esophagus • Mixes and churns food with gastric juices to form chyme • Begins chemical breakdown of proteins • Stimulates protein-digesting enzymes • Releases food into the duodenum as chyme • Secretes intrinsic factor required for Stomach • Absorbs some fat-soluble substances (for vitamin B absorption in small intestine 12 example, alcohol, aspirin) • Possesses antimicrobial functions • Mixes chyme with digestive juices • Propels food at a rate slow enough for digestion and absorption • Absorbs breakdown products of • Provides optimal medium for enzymatic Small carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic activity intestine acids, along with vitamins, minerals, and water • Performs physical digestion via segmentation • Liver: produces bile salts, which emulsify lipids, aiding their digestion and absorption • Bicarbonate-rich pancreatic juices help • Gallbladder: stores, concentrates, and Accessory neutralize acidic chyme and provide releases bile organs optimal environment for enzymatic activity • Pancreas: produces digestive enzymes and bicarbonate • Further breaks down food residues • Food residue is concentrated and • Absorbs most residual water, electrolytes, temporarily stored prior to defecation Large and vitamins produced by enteric bacteria • Mucus eases passage of feces
