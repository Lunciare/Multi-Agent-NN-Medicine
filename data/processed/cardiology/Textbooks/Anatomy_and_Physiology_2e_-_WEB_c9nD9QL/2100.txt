tube quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these include the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. This is a very different pattern from that of an adult. FIGURE19.36 Development of the Human Heart This diagram outlines the embryological development of the human heart during the first eight weeks and the subsequent formation of the four heart chambers. The five regions of the primitive heart tube develop into recognizable structures in a fully developed heart. The truncus arteriosuswill eventually divide and give rise to the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. Thebulbus cordisdevelops into the right ventricle. Theprimitive ventricleforms the left ventricle. Theprimitive atrium becomes the anterior portions of both the right and left atria, and the two auricles. Thesinus venosusdevelops into the posterior portion of the right atrium, the SA node, and the coronary sinus. As the primitive heart tube elongates, it begins to fold within the pericardium, eventually forming an S shape, which places the chambers and major vessels into an alignment similar to
