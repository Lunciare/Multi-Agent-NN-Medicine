inside of the medial malleolus and the smooth area at the distal end of the tibia articulate with the talus bone of the foot as part of the ankle joint. On the lateral side of the distal tibia is a wide groove called thefibular notch. This area Access for free at openstax.org 8.4 • Bones of the Lower Limb 295 articulates with the distal end of the fibula, forming thedistal tibiofibular joint. Fibula The fibula is the slender bone located on the lateral side of the leg (seeFigure 8.18). The fibula does not bear weight. It serves primarily for muscle attachments and thus is largely surrounded by muscles. Only the proximal and distal ends of the fibula can be palpated. Thehead of the fibulais the small, knob-like, proximal end of the fibula. It articulates with the inferior aspect of the lateral tibial condyle, forming theproximal tibiofibular joint. The thinshaft of the fibulahas theinterosseous border of the fibula, a narrow ridge running down its medial side for the attachment of the interosseous membrane that spans the fibula and tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms thelateral malleolus, which forms the easily palpated bony bump on the lateral side of the
