The outer surface of bone, except in regions covered with The major functions of the bones are body support, articular cartilage, is covered with a fibrous membrane facilitation of movement, protection of internal organs, called the periosteum. Flat bones consist of two layers storage of minerals and fat, and hematopoiesis. of compact bone surrounding a layer of spongy bone. Together, the muscular system and skeletal system are Bone markings depend on the function and location of known as the musculoskeletal system. bones. Articulations are places where two bones meet. 6.2Bone Classification Projections stick out from the surface of the bone and provide attachment points for tendons and ligaments. Bones can be classified according to their shapes. Long Holes are openings or depressions in the bones. bones, such as the femur, are longer than they are wide. Short bones, such as the carpals, are Bone matrix
