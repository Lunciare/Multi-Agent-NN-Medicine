Anatomy and Physiology

The endocrine glands secrete a variety of hormones that control the development and regulation of the reproductive system (these glands include the anterior pituitary, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads—the testes and the ovaries). Much of the development of the reproductive system occurs during puberty and is marked by the development of sex-specific characteristics in adolescents. Puberty is initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a hormone produced and secreted by the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins—hormones that regulate the function of the gonads. The levels of GnRH are regulated through a negative feedback loop; high levels of reproductive hormones inhibit the release of GnRH. Throughout life, gonadotropins regulate reproductive function and, in the case of females, the onset and cessation of reproductive capacity. The gonadotropins include two glycoprotein hormones:follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)stimulates the production and maturation of sex cells, or gametes, including ova and sperm. FSH also promotes follicular growth; these follicles then release estrogens in ovaries.Luteinizing hormone (LH)triggers ovulation, as well as the production of estrogens and progesterone by the ovaries. LH stimulates production of testosterone by the testes. Prolactin As its name implies,prolactin (PRL)promotes lactation (milk production). During pregnancy, it contributes to development of the mammary
