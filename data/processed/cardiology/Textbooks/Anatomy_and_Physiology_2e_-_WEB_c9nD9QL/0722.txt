forms the heel. Body weight is transferred from the tibia to the talus to the calcaneus, which rests on the ground. The medial calcaneus has a prominent bony extension called the sustentaculum tali(“support for the talus”) that supports the medial side of the talus bone. FIGURE8.19 Bones of the Foot The bones of the foot are divided into three groups. The posterior foot is formed by the seven tarsal bones. The mid-foot has the five metatarsal bones. The toes contain the phalanges. Thecuboidbone articulates with the anterior end of the calcaneus bone. The cuboid has a deep groove running 296 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton across its inferior surface, which provides passage for a muscle tendon. The talus bone articulates anteriorly with thenavicularbone, which in turn articulates anteriorly with the three cuneiform (“wedge-shaped”) bones. These bones are themedial cuneiform, theintermediate cuneiform, and thelateral cuneiform. Each of these bones has a broad superior surface and a narrow inferior surface, which together produce the transverse (medial-lateral) curvature of the foot. The navicular and lateral cuneiform bones also articulate with the medial side of the cuboid bone. INTERACTIVE LINK Use thistutorial( review the bones of the foot. Which tarsal bones are in the
