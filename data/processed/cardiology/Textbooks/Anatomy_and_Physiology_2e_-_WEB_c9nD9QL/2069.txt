Anatomy and Physiology

can be represented mathematically by the following equation: CO = HR × SV SV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV = EDV – ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance. Normal range for SV would be 55–100 mL. An average resting HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60–100 in some Access for free at openstax.org 19.4 • Cardiac Physiology 789 individuals. Using these numbers, the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0–8.0 L/min. Remember, however, that these numbers refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart. Factors influencing CO are summarized inFigure 19.31. FIGURE19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke volume, both of which are also variable. SVs are also used
