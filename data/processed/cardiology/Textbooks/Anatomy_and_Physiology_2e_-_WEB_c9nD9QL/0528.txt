Fractures are classified by their Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates osteoclast complexity, location, and other features. Common proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. types of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral, Vitamin D plays a synergistic role with PTH in comminuted, impacted, greenstick, open (or stimulating the osteoclasts. Additional functions of compound), and closed (or simple). Healing of PTH include promoting reabsorption of calcium by fractures begins with the formation of a hematoma, kidney tubules and indirectly increasing calcium followed by internal and external calli. Osteoclasts absorption from the small intestine. Calcitonin inhibits resorb dead bone, while osteoblasts create new bone osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by
