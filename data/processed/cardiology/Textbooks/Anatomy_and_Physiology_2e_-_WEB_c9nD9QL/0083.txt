almost unfathomably small. The period at the end of this sentence is millions of atoms wide. Atomic Structure and Energy Atoms are made up of even smaller subatomic particles, three types of which are important: theproton,neutron, andelectron. The number of positively-charged protons and non-charged (“neutral”) neutrons, gives mass to the atom, and the number of protons determines the element. The number of negatively-charged electrons that “spin” around the nucleus at close to the speed of light equals the number of protons. An electron has about 1/2000th the mass of a proton or neutron. Figure 2.3shows two models that can help you imagine the structure of an atom—in this case, helium (He). In the planetary model, helium’s two electrons are shown circling the nucleus in a fixed orbit depicted as a ring. Although this model is helpful in visualizing atomic structure, in reality, electrons do not travel in fixed orbits, but whiz around the nucleus erratically in a so-called electron cloud. FIGURE2.3 Two Models of Atomic Structure (a) In the planetary model, the electrons of helium are shown in fixed orbits, depicted as rings, at a precise distance from the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun. (b) In the electron
