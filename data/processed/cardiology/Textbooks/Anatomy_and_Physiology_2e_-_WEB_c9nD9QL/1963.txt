They squeeze antigens, and those with type O blood have neither A out of the walls of blood vessels through emigration or nor B antigens. The blood plasma contains preformed diapedesis, then may move through tissue fluid or antibodies against the antigens not present on a become attached to various organs where they fight person’s erythrocytes. against pathogenic organisms, diseased cells, or other threats to health. Granular leukocytes, which include A second group of blood antigens is the Rh group, the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, originate with most important of which is Rh D. People with Rh−blood myeloid stem cells, as do the agranular monocytes. do not have this antigen on their erythrocytes, whereas The other agranular leukocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T those who are Rh+do. About 85 percent of Americans cells, arise from the lymphoid stem cell line. The most are Rh+. When a person who is Rh−becomes pregnant abundant leukocytes are the neutrophils, which are with an Rh+fetus, their body may begin to produce first responders to infections, especially with bacteria. anti-Rh antibodies.
