more medial in location; intertwines with the palmar antebrachial venous arches; leads to the basilic vein vein Superficial vein of the arm that arises from the median antebrachial vein, intersects with the Basilic vein median cubital vein, parallels the ulnar vein, and continues into the upper arm; along with the brachial vein, it leads to the axillary vein Median Superficial vessel located in the antecubital region that links the cephalic vein to the basilic vein cubital vein in the form of a v; a frequent site from which to draw blood Cephalic Superficial vessel in the upper arm; leads to the axillary vein vein Subscapular Drains blood from the subscapular region and leads to the axillary vein vein Axillary vein The major vein in the axillary region; drains the upper limb and becomes the subclavian vein TABLE20.14 The Inferior Vena Cava Other than the small amount of blood drained by the azygos and hemiazygos veins, most of the blood inferior to the diaphragm drains into the inferior vena cava before it is returned to the heart (seeFigure 20.36). Lying just beneath the parietal peritoneum in the abdominal cavity, theinferior vena cavaparallels the abdominal aorta, where it can receive blood from
