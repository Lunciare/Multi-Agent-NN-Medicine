Anatomy and Physiology

not form the highly organized NMJs with smooth muscle, as seen between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. Instead, there is a series of neurotransmitter-filled bulges called varicosities as an axon courses through smooth muscle, loosely forming motor units (Figure 10.25). Avaricosityreleases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Also, visceral muscle in the walls of the hollow organs (except the heart) contains pacesetter cells. Apacesetter cellcan spontaneously trigger action potentials and contractions in the muscle. FIGURE10.25 Motor Units A series of axon-like swelling, called varicosities or “boutons,” from autonomic neurons form motor units through the smooth muscle. 386 10 • Muscle Tissue Smooth muscle is organized in two ways: as single-unit smooth muscle, which is much more common; and as multiunit smooth muscle. The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics. Single-unit muscle has its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. This type of smooth muscle is found in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart (which has cardiac muscle in its walls), and so it is commonly calledvisceral muscle. Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the organization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres,
