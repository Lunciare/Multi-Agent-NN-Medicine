three major food classes (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins), which is digested in the mouth, the stomach, and the small intestine? 23.6 Accessory Organs in Digestion: The Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • State the main digestive roles of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder • Identify three main features of liver histology that are critical to its function • Discuss the composition and function of bile • Identify the major types of enzymes and buffers present in pancreatic juice Chemical digestion in the small intestine relies on the activities of three accessory digestive organs: the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder (Figure 23.24). The digestive role of the liver is to produce bile and export it to the duodenum. The gallbladder primarily stores, concentrates, and releases bile. The pancreas produces pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions, and delivers it to the duodenum. FIGURE23.24 Accessory Organs The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are considered accessory digestive organs, but their roles in the digestive system are vital. The Liver Theliveris the largest gland in the body, weighing about three pounds in an adult. It is also one of the most Access
