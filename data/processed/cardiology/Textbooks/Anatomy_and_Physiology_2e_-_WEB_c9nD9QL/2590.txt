partial pressure of carbon dioxide is combined with water with the aid of an dioxide is high in the pulmonary capillaries and low in enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This combination the alveoli. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses across forms carbonic acid, which spontaneously dissociates the respiratory membrane from the blood into the into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. As bicarbonate alveoli. The amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide that builds up in erythrocytes, it is moved across the diffuses across the respiratory membrane is similar. membrane into the plasma in exchange for chloride ions by a mechanism called the chloride shift. At the Ventilation is the process that moves air into and out of pulmonary capillaries, bicarbonate re-enters the alveoli, and perfusion affects the flow of blood in erythrocytes in exchange for chloride ions, and the the capillaries. Both are important in gas exchange, as reaction with carbonic anhydrase is reversed, ventilation must be sufficient to create a high partial recreating carbon dioxide and water.
