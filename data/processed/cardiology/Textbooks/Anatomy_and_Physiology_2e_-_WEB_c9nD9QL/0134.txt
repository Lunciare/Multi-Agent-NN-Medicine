Anatomy and Physiology

with a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below 7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–4M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5M, or 0.00001M. The higher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human urine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water. 60 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization FIGURE2.17 The pH Scale Buffers The pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this slightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO ) constantly being released into 2 the bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO while 2 breathing) normally keep the
