Anatomy and Physiology

barbiturates, or ethanol (or even just holding one’s breath) can also result in hypercapnia.Hypocapnia, or abnormally low blood levels of CO , occurs with any cause of hyperventilation that drives off the CO , such as 2 2 salicylate toxicity, elevated room temperatures, fever, or hysteria. Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance The renal regulation of the body’s acid-base balance addresses the metabolic component of the buffering system. Access for free at openstax.org 26.4 • Acid-Base Balance 1175 Whereas the respiratory system (together with breathing centers in the brain) controls the blood levels of carbonic acid by controlling the exhalation of CO , the renal system controls the blood levels of bicarbonate. A decrease of 2 blood bicarbonate can result from the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase by certain diuretics or from excessive bicarbonate loss due to diarrhea. Blood bicarbonate levels are also typically lower in people who have Addison’s disease (chronic adrenal insufficiency), in which aldosterone levels are reduced, and in people who have renal damage, such as chronic nephritis. Finally, low bicarbonate blood levels can result from elevated levels of ketones (common in unmanaged diabetes mellitus), which bind bicarbonate in the filtrate and prevent its conservation. Bicarbonate ions, HCO -,
