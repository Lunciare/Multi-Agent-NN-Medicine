involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell to the next. This section will concentrate on the chemical type of synapse. An example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue. In the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ. All synapses have common characteristics, which can be summarized in this list: • presynaptic element • neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles) • synaptic cleft • receptor proteins • postsynaptic element • neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, the synaptic cleft is the space between the cells where the neurotransmitter diffuses, the receptor protein is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the postsynaptic element is the sarcolemma of the muscle cell, and the neurotransmitter is eliminated by acetylcholinesterase. Other synapses are similar to this, and the specifics are different, but they all contain the same characteristics. Neurotransmitter Release When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca2+channels in the membrane of the synaptic end bulb open. The concentration of Ca2+increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca2+ion
