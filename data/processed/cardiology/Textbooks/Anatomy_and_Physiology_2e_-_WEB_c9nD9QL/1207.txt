signal of the action potential is changed into the chemical signal of a neurotransmitter and then back to electrical changes in the target cell membrane. What is the importance of voltage-gated calcium channels in the release of neurotransmitters? 482 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue Characteristics of Neurotransmitter Systems System Cholinergic Amino acids Biogenic amines Neuropeptides Serotonin (5-HT), Met-enkephalin, Glutamate, dopamine, beta-endorphin, Neurotransmitters Acetylcholine glycine, GABA norepinephrine, VIP, Substance P, (epinephrine) etc. Receptors are 5-HT receptors, D1 and Glu receptors, gly too numerous to Nicotinic and D2 receptors, α- Receptors receptors, GABA list, but are muscarinic receptors adrenergic and β- receptors specific to the adrenergic receptors peptides.
