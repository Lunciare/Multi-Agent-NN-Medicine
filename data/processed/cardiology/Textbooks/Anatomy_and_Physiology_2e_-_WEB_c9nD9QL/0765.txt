the anterior inferior and narrowed region below the head is the neck; distal to posterior inferior iliac spines. The auricular surface of this is the radial tuberosity. The shaft portions of both the ilium articulates with the sacrum to form the the ulna and radius have an interosseous border, sacroiliac joint. The medial surface of the upper ilium whereas the distal ends of each bone have a pointed forms the iliac fossa, with the arcuate line marking the styloid process. The distal radioulnar joint is found inferior limit of this area. The posterior margin of the between the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of ilium has the large greater sciatic notch. the radius. The distal end of the radius articulates with the proximal carpal bones, but the ulna does not. The posterolateral portion of the hip bone is the ischium. It has the expanded ischial tuberosity, which The base of the hand is formed by eight carpal bones. supports body weight when sitting. The ischial ramus The carpal bones are united into two rows of bones. projects anteriorly and superiorly.
