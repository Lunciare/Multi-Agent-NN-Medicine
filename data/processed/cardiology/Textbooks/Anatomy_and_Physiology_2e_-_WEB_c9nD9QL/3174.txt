Anatomy and Physiology

start to organize into layers. Some grow to form the extra-embryonic membranes needed to support and protect the growing embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion. At the beginning of the second week, the cells of the inner cell mass form into a two-layered disc of embryonic cells, and a space—theamniotic cavity—opens up between it and the trophoblast (Figure 28.8). Cells from the upper layer of the disc (theepiblast) extend around the amniotic cavity, creating a membranous sac that forms into the amnionby the end of the second week. The amnion fills with amniotic fluid and eventually grows to surround the embryo. Early in development, amniotic fluid consists almost entirely of a filtrate of maternal plasma, but as the kidneys of the fetus begin to function at approximately the eighth week, they add urine to the volume of amniotic fluid. Floating within the amniotic fluid, the embryo—and later, the fetus—is protected from trauma and rapid temperature changes. It can move freely within the fluid and can prepare for swallowing and breathing out of the uterus.
