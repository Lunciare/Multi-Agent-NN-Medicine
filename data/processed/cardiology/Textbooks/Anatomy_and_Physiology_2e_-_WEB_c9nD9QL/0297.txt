one-by-one, cytoskeletal component performs unique functions as coded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until well as provides a supportive framework for the cell. the protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the mRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is 3.3The Nucleus and DNA Replication released. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a The nucleus is the command center of the cell, single mRNA molecule at once such that multiple containing the genetic instructions for all of the proteins can be manufactured from the mRNA materials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it concurrently. can perform). The nucleus is encased within a membrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side- 120 3 • Interactive Link Questions 3.5Cell Growth and Division 3.6Cellular Differentiation The life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell One of the major areas of research in biology is that of cycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an how cells specialize to assume their unique structures interphase before it is ready to replicate itself and and functions, since all cells essentially originate from produce daughter cells. This interphase includes two a single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the
