this is not always possible, and these procedures may be implemented. A patient with blood type AB+is known as theuniversal recipient. This patient can theoretically receive any type of blood, because the patient’s own blood—having both A and B antigens on the erythrocyte surface—does not produce anti-A or anti-B antibodies. In addition, an Rh+patient can receive both Rh+and Rh−blood. However, keep in mind that the donor’s blood will contain circulating antibodies, again with possible negative implications.Figure 18.17summarizes the blood types and compatibilities.

In these circumstances, medics may at least try to replace some of the volume of blood that has been lost. This is done by intravenous administration of a saline solution that provides fluids and electrolytes in proportions equivalent to those of normal blood plasma. Research is ongoing to develop a safe and effective artificial blood that would carry out the oxygen-carrying function of blood without the RBCs, enabling transfusions in the field without concern for incompatibility. These blood
