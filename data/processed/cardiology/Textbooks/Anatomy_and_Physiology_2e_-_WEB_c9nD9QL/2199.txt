Anatomy and Physiology

exercise, the body distributes more blood to the body surface where it can dissipate the excess heat generated by increased activity into the environment.

They are summarized inFigure 20.17. 834 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.17 Summary of Factors Maintaining Vascular Homeostasis Adequate blood flow, blood pressure, distribution, and perfusion involve autoregulatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms. Neural Regulation The nervous system plays a critical role in the regulation of vascular homeostasis. The primary regulatory sites include the cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions. In addition, more generalized neural responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors. The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain Neurological regulation of blood pressure
