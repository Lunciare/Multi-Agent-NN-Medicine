that will enlarge to become the nasal cavity. At about this same time, the lung bud forms. Thelung budis a dome-shaped structure composed of tissue that bulges from the foregut. The foregutis endoderm just inferior to the pharyngeal pouches. Thelaryngotracheal budis a structure that forms from the longitudinal extension of the lung bud as development progresses. The portion of this structure nearest the pharynx becomes the trachea, whereas the distal end becomes more bulbous, forming bronchial buds. Abronchial budis one of a pair of structures that will eventually become the bronchi and all other lower respiratory structures (Figure 22.29). 984 22 • The Respiratory System FIGURE22.29 Development of the Lower Respiratory System Weeks 7–16 Bronchial buds continue to branch as development progresses until all of the segmental bronchi have been formed. Beginning around week 13, the lumens of the bronchi begin to expand in diameter. By week 16, respiratory bronchioles form. The fetus now has all major lung structures involved in the airway. Weeks 16–24 Once the respiratory bronchioles form, further development includes extensive vascularization, or the development of the blood vessels, as well as the formation of alveolar ducts and alveolar precursors. At about week 19, the respiratory bronchioles
