NK cells recognize these cells by mechanisms that are still not well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors. NK cells can induce apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell causes its own death by either of two mechanisms: 1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas ligand. Thefas ligandis a surface molecule that binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell and the pathogen within it; or 2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes. Aperforinis a protein that forms pores in the membranes of infected cells. Agranzymeis a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores and triggers apoptosis intracellularly.
