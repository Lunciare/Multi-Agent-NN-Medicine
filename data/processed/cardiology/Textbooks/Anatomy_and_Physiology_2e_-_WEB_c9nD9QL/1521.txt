ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (seeFigure 15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with theganglionic neuron(with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—viagray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye. The spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches thesuperior cervical ganglion, where it synapses with the postganglionic neuron (seeFigure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to asparavertebral ganglia, given their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain. Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as thegreater splanchnic nerveorlesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic
