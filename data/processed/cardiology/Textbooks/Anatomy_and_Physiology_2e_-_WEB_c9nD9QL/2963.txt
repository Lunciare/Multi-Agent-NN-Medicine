A thick muscular wall consisting of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle helps move The kidney glomerulus filters blood mainly based on urine toward the bladder by way of peristaltic particle size to produce a filtrate lacking cells or large contractions. proteins. Most of the ions and molecules in the filtrate are needed by the body and must be reabsorbed 25.3Gross Anatomy of the Kidney farther down the nephron tubules, resulting in the As noted previously, the structure of the kidney is formation of urine. Urine characteristics change divided into two principle regions—the peripheral rim of depending on water intake, exercise, environmental cortex and the central medulla. The two kidneys temperature, and nutrient intake. Urinalysis analyzes receive about 25 percent of cardiac output. They are characteristics of the urine and is used to diagnose protected in the retroperitoneal space by the renal fat diseases.
