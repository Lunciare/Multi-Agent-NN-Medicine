Anatomy and Physiology

During its journey to the uterus, the zygote undergoes five or six rapid mitotic cell divisions. Although eachcleavageresults in more cells, it does not increase the total volume of the conceptus (Figure 28.4). Each daughter cell produced by cleavage is called ablastomere(blastos = “germ,” in the sense of a seed or sprout). Approximately 3 days after fertilization, a 16-cell conceptus reaches the uterus. The cells that had been loosely grouped are now compacted and look more like a solid mass. The name given to this structure is themorula(morula = “little mulberry”). Once inside the uterus, the conceptus floats freely for several more days. It continues to divide, creating a ball of approximately 100 cells, and consuming nutritive endometrial secretions called uterine milk while the uterine lining thickens. The ball of now tightly bound cells starts to secrete fluid and organize themselves around a fluid-filled cavity, theblastocoel. At this developmental stage, the conceptus is referred to as ablastocyst. Within this structure, a group of cells forms into aninner cell mass, which is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are calledtrophoblasts(trophe = “to feed” or “to nourish”). These cells will develop into the chorionic sac and
