Anatomy and Physiology

differentiate into mature formed elements. As you can see inFigure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of which can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors of megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most other organelles before maturing into erythrocytes. Hemopoietic Growth Factors Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These include the following: • Erythropoietin (EPO)is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the interstitial fibroblast cells of the kidneys in response to low oxygen levels. It prompts the production of erythrocytes. Some athletes use synthetic EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (called blood doping) to increase RBC counts and subsequently increase oxygen 718 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood delivery to tissues throughout the body. EPO is a banned substance in most organized sports, but it is also used medically in the treatment of certain anemia, specifically those triggered by certain types of cancer, and other disorders in which increased erythrocyte counts and oxygen levels are desirable. • Thrombopoietin, another glycoprotein hormone, is produced by the liver and kidneys. It triggers
