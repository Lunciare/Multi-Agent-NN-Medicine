asaminopeptidaseand dipeptidase, which further break down peptide chains. This results in molecules small enough to enter the bloodstream (Figure 23.31). FIGURE23.30 Digestion of Protein The digestion of protein begins in the stomach and is completed in the small intestine. 1042 23 • The Digestive System FIGURE23.31 Digestion of Protein Flow Chart Proteins are successively broken down into their amino acid components. Lipid Digestion A healthy diet limits lipid intake to 35 percent of total calorie intake. The most common dietary lipids are triglycerides, which are made up of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acid chains. Small amounts of dietary cholesterol and phospholipids are also consumed. The three lipases responsible for lipid digestion are lingual lipase, gastric lipase, andpancreatic lipase. However, because the pancreas is the only consequential source of lipase, virtually all lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine. Pancreatic lipase breaks down each triglyceride into two free fatty acids and a monoglyceride. The fatty acids include both short-chain (less than 10 to 12 carbons) and long-chain fatty acids. Nucleic Acid Digestion The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are found in most of the foods you eat. Two types ofpancreatic nucleaseare responsible for their digestion:deoxyribonuclease, which digests DNA,
