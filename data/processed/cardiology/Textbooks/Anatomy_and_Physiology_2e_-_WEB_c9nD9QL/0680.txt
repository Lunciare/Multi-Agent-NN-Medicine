Anatomy and Physiology

humerus has theolecranon fossa, a larger depression that receives the olecranon process of the ulna when the forearm is fully extended. Ulna The ulna is the medial bone of the forearm. It runs parallel to the radius, which is the lateral bone of the forearm (Figure 8.6). The proximal end of the ulna resembles a crescent wrench with its large, C-shapedtrochlear notch. This region articulates with the trochlea of the humerus as part of the elbow joint. The inferior margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a prominent lip of bone called thecoronoid process of the ulna. Just below this on the anterior ulna is a roughened area called theulnar tuberosity. To the lateral side and slightly inferior to the trochlear notch is a small, smooth area called theradial notch of the ulna. This area is the site of articulation between the proximal radius and the ulna, forming theproximal radioulnar joint. The posterior and superior portions of the proximal ulna make up theolecranon process, which forms the bony tip of the elbow. FIGURE8.6 Ulna and Radius The ulna is located on the medial side of the forearm, and the radius is on the lateral side. These bones are attached
