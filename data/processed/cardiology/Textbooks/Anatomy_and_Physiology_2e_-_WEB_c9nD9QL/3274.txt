There are two aspects to a person’s genetic makeup. Medical researchers are especially interested in the Their genotype refers to the genetic makeup of the identification of inheritance patterns for genetic chromosomes found in all their cells and the alleles disorders, which provides the means to estimate the that are passed down from their parents. Their risk that a given couple’s offspring will inherit a genetic phenotype is the expression of that genotype, based on disease or disorder. Patterns of inheritance in humans the interaction of the
