Anatomy and Physiology

of eachpectoral girdleis anchored to the axial skeleton by a single, highly mobile joint. This allows for the extensive mobility of the entire pectoral girdle, which in turn enhances movements of the shoulder and upper limb. Clavicle The clavicle is the only long bone that lies in a horizontal position in the body (seeFigure 8.3). The clavicle has 276 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton several important functions. First, anchored by muscles from above, it serves as a strut that extends laterally to support the scapula. This in turn holds the shoulder joint superiorly and laterally from the body trunk, allowing for maximal freedom of motion for the upper limb. The clavicle also transmits forces acting on the upper limb to the sternum and axial skeleton. Finally, it serves to protect the underlying nerves and blood vessels as they pass between the trunk of the body and the upper limb. The clavicle has three regions: the medial end, the lateral end, and the shaft. The medial end, known as thesternal end of the clavicle, has a triangular shape and articulates with the manubrium portion of the sternum. This forms thesternoclavicular joint, which is the only bony articulation between the pectoral girdle
