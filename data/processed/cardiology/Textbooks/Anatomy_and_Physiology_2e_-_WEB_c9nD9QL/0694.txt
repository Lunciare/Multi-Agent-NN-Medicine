Girdle and Pelvis LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define the pelvic girdle and describe the bones and ligaments of the pelvis • Explain the three regions of the hip bone and identify their bony landmarks • Describe the openings of the pelvis and the boundaries of the greater and lesser pelvis Thepelvic girdle(hip girdle) is formed by a single bone, thehip boneorcoxal bone(coxal = “hip”), which serves as the attachment point for each lower limb. Each hip bone, in turn, is firmly joined to the axial skeleton via its attachment to the sacrum of the vertebral column. The right and left hip bones also converge anteriorly to attach to each other. The bonypelvisis the entire structure formed by the two hip bones, the sacrum, and, attached inferiorly to the sacrum, the coccyx (Figure 8.12). Unlike the bones of the pectoral girdle, which are highly mobile to enhance the range of upper limb movements, the bones of the pelvis are strongly united to each other to form a largely immobile, weight-bearing structure. This is important for stability because it enables the weight of the body to be easily transferred laterally from the
