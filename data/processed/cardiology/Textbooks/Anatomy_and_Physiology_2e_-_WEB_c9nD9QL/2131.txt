hepatic portal system • Describe the development of blood vessels and fetal circulation • Compare fetal circulation to that of an individual after birth INTRODUCTION In this chapter, you will learn about the vascular part of the cardiovascular system, that is, the vessels that transport blood throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases, nutrients, and other substances are exchanged with body cells. When vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do not circulate effectively throughout the body. As a result, tissue injury occurs, metabolism is impaired, and the functions of every bodily system are threatened. 810 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare and contrast the three tunics that make up the walls of most blood vessels • Distinguish between elastic arteries, muscular arteries, and arterioles on the basis of structure, location, and function • Describe the basic structure of a capillary bed, from the supplying metarteriole to the venule into which it drains • Explain the structure and function of venous valves in the large veins of the extremities Blood is carried through
