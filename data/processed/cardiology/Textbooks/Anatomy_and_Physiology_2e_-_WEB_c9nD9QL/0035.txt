The brain also signals the adrenal glands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and heat production. 22 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body INTERACTIVE LINK Water concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning. A person’s body retains very tight control on water levels without conscious control by the person. Watch thisvideo( learn more about water concentration in the body. Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body? Positive Feedback Positive feedbackintensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation from the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive feedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood loss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed. Childbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired. Enormous
