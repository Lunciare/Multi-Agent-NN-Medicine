The bladder lies anterior to the uterus in females, posterior to the pubic bone and anterior to the rectum. During late pregnancy, its capacity is reduced due to compression by the enlarging uterus, resulting in increased frequency of urination. In males, the anatomy is similar, minus the uterus, and with the addition of the prostate inferior to the bladder. The bladder is aretroperitoneal organ whose "dome" distends superiorly when the bladder is filling with urine. FIGURE25.4 Bladder (a) Anterior cross section of the bladder.
