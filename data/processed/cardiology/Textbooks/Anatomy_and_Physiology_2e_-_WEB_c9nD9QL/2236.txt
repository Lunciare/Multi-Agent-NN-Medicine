periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes, will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called acerebrovascular accident (CVA). The locations of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of blood. Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial Access for free at openstax.org 20.5 • Circulatory Pathways 849 cavity, and some of these branches form a structure known as thearterial circle(orcircle of Willis), an anastomosis that is remarkably like a traffic circle that sends off branches (in this case, arterial branches to the brain). As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are normally fed by the internal carotid arteries; the remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with the vertebral arteries. The internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain through the carotid foramen where it gives rise to several branches (Figure 20.26andFigure 20.27). One of these branches is theanterior cerebral arterythat supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the middle cerebral artery, supplies blood to the
