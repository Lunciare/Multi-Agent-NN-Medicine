Anatomy and Physiology

Cells Nearly all proteins can function as buffers. Proteins are made up of amino acids, which contain positively charged amino groups and negatively charged carboxyl groups. The charged regions of these molecules can bind hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, and thus function as buffers. Buffering by proteins accounts for two-thirds of the buffering power of the blood and most of the buffering within cells. Hemoglobin as a Buffer Hemoglobin is the principal protein inside of red blood cells and accounts for one-third of the mass of the cell. During the conversion of CO into bicarbonate, hydrogen ions liberated in the reaction are buffered by hemoglobin, 2 Access for free at openstax.org 26.4 • Acid-Base Balance 1173 which is reduced by the dissociation of oxygen. This buffering helps maintain normal pH. The process is reversed in the pulmonary capillaries to re-form CO , which then can diffuse into the air sacs to be exhaled into the atmosphere. 2 This process is discussed in detail in the chapter on the respiratory system. Phosphate Buffer Phosphates are found in the blood in two forms: sodium dihydrogen phosphate ( ), which is a weak acid, and sodium monohydrogen phosphate ( ), which is a weak
