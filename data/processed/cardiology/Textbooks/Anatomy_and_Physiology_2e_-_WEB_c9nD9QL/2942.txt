of the plasma than any other circulating component of the blood. If there is too much Na+present, either due to poor control or excess dietary consumption, a series of metabolic problems ensue. There is an increase in total volume of water, which leads to hypertension (high blood pressure). Over a long period, this increases the risk of serious complications such as heart attacks, strokes, and aneurysms. It can also contribute to system-wide edema (swelling). Mechanisms for regulating Na+concentration include the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and ADH (see Figure 25.14). Aldosterone stimulates the uptake of Na+on the apical cell membrane of cells in the DCT and collecting ducts, whereas ADH helps to regulate Na+concentration indirectly by regulating the reabsorption of water. Regulation of Extracellular K+ Potassium is present in a 30-fold greater concentration inside the cell than outside the cell. A generalization can be made that K+and Na+concentrations will move in opposite directions. When more Na+is reabsorbed, more K+is secreted; when less Na+is reabsorbed (leading to excretion by the kidney), more K+is retained. When aldosterone causes a recovery of Na+in the nephron, a negative electrical gradient is created that promotes the secretion of K+ and Cl–into the lumen. Regulation of Cl– Chloride is
