produced by a deep inhalation, past a tidal inspiration. This is the extra volume that can be brought into the lungs during a forced inspiration.Residual volume (RV)is the air left in the lungs if you exhale as much air as possible. The residual volume makes breathing easier by preventing the alveoli from collapsing. Respiratory volume is 966 22 • The Respiratory System dependent on a variety of factors, and measuring the different types of respiratory volumes can provide important clues about a person’s respiratory health (Figure 22.19). FIGURE22.18 Respiratory Volumes and Capacities These two graphs show (a) respiratory volumes and (b) the combination of volumes that results in respiratory capacity. FIGURE22.19 Pulmonary Function Testing Respiratory capacity is the combination of two or more selected volumes, which further describes the amount of air in the lungs during a given time. For example,total lung capacity (TLC)is the sum of all of the lung volumes (TV, ERV, IRV, and RV), which represents the total amount of air a person can hold in the lungs after a forceful inhalation. TLC is about 6000 mL air for males, and about 4200 mL for females.Vital capacity (VC)is the amount of air a person can move into
