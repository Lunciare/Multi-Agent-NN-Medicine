basal membrane of the cells. When aldosterone output increases, more Na+is recovered from the forming urine and water follows the Na+passively. As the pump recovers Na+for the body, it is also pumping K+into the forming urine, since the pump moves K+in the opposite direction. When aldosterone decreases, more Na+remains in the forming urine and more K+is recovered in the circulation. Symport channels move Na+and Cl–together. Still other channels in the principal cells secrete K+into the collecting duct in direct proportion to the recovery of Na+. Intercalated cells play significant roles in regulating blood pH. Intercalated cells reabsorb K+and HCO –while 3 secreting H+. This function lowers the acidity of the plasma while increasing the acidity of the urine. 25.7 Regulation of Renal Blood Flow LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms and explain how they affect urine volume and composition • Describe the function of the juxtaglomerular apparatus It is vital that the flow of blood through the kidney be at a suitable rate to allow for filtration. This rate determines how much solute is retained or discarded, how much water is retained or discarded, and
