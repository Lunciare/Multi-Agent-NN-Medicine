Anatomy and Physiology

Buffer Phosphates are found in the blood in two forms: sodium dihydrogen phosphate ( ), which is a weak acid, and sodium monohydrogen phosphate ( ), which is a weak base. When comes into contact with a strong acid, such as HCl, the base picks up a second hydrogen ion to form the weak acid and sodium chloride, NaCl. When (the weak acid) comes into contact with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the weak acid reverts back to the weak base and produces water. Acids and bases are still present, but they hold onto the ions. Bicarbonate-Carbonic Acid Buffer The bicarbonate-carbonic acid buffer works in a fashion similar to phosphate buffers. The bicarbonate is regulated in the blood by sodium, as are the phosphate ions. When sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO ), comes into contact with a 3 strong acid, such as HCl, carbonic acid (H CO ), which is a weak acid, and NaCl are formed. When carbonic acid 2 3 comes into contact with a strong base, such as NaOH, bicarbonate and water are formed. As with the phosphate buffer, a weak acid or weak base captures the free ions, and a significant change in pH is
