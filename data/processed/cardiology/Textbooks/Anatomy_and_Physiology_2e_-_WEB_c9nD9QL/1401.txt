within the cochlear duct? 550 14 • The Somatic Nervous System Equilibrium (Balance) Along with audition, the inner ear is responsible for encoding information aboutequilibrium, the sense of balance. A similar mechanoreceptor—a hair cell with stereocilia—senses head position, head movement, and whether our bodies are in motion. These cells are located within the vestibule of the inner ear. Head position is sensed by the utricleandsaccule, whereas head movement is sensed by thesemicircular canals. The neural signals generated in thevestibular ganglionare transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum. The utricle and saccule are both largely composed ofmaculatissue (plural = maculae). The macula is composed of hair cells surrounded by support cells. The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into a viscous gel called theotolithic membrane(Figure 14.11). On top of the otolithic membrane is a layer of calcium carbonate crystals, called otoliths. The otoliths essentially make the otolithic membrane top-heavy. The otolithic membrane moves separately from the macula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes the otolithic membrane to slide over the macula in the direction of gravity. The moving otolithic membrane, in turn, bends the sterocilia, causing some hair cells to depolarize as others hyperpolarize.
