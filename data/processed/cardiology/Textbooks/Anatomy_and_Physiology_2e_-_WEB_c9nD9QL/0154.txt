Anatomy and Physiology

following are bonded: • a hydrogen atom • an alkaline (basic) amino group NH (seeTable 2.1) 2 • an acidic carboxyl group COOH (seeTable 2.1) • a variable group FIGURE2.24 Structure of an Amino Acid Access for free at openstax.org 2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 69 Notice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine = “nitrogen-containing”). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance. What distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain or an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur does not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled. Amino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino acids together is called a peptide bond. Apeptide bondis a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms
