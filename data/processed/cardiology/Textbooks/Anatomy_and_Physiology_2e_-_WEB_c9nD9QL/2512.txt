accessory muscles must also contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the scalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of the abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps to push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the internal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity. Respiratory Volumes and Capacities Respiratory volumeis the term used for various volumes of air moved by or associated with the lungs at a given point in the respiratory cycle. There are four major types of respiratory volumes: tidal, residual, inspiratory reserve, and expiratory reserve (Figure 22.18).Tidal volume (TV)is the amount of air that normally enters the lungs during quiet breathing, which is about 500 milliliters.Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)is the amount of air you can forcefully exhale past a normal tidal expiration, up to 1200 milliliters for males.Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)is produced by a deep inhalation, past a tidal inspiration. This is the extra volume that can be brought into the lungs during a forced inspiration.Residual volume (RV)is the air left
