Anatomy and Physiology

Second-hand smoke in the home has also been linked to a greater number of ear infections in children, as well as worsening symptoms of asthma. 22.3 The Process of Breathing LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the mechanisms that drive breathing • Discuss how pressure, volume, and resistance are related • List the steps involved in pulmonary ventilation • Discuss the physical factors related to breathing • Discuss the meaning of respiratory volume and capacities • Define respiratory rate • Outline the mechanisms behind the control of breathing • Describe the respiratory centers of the medulla oblongata • Describe the respiratory centers of the pons • Discuss factors that can influence the respiratory rate Pulmonary ventilationis the act of breathing, which can be described as the movement of air into and out of the lungs. The major mechanisms that drive pulmonary ventilation are atmospheric pressure (P ); the air pressure atm within the alveoli, called intra-alveolar pressure (P ); and the pressure within the pleural cavity, called intrapleural alv pressure (P ). ip Mechanisms of Breathing The intra-alveolar and intrapleural pressures are dependent on certain physical features of the lung. However,
