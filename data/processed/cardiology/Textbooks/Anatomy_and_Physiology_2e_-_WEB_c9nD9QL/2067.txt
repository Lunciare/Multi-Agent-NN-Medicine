6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the least serious. The most severe is a 6. Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to record both normal and abnormal sounds using specialized electronic stethoscopes. During auscultation, it is common practice for the clinician to ask the patient to breathe deeply. This procedure not only allows for listening to airflow, but it may also amplify heart murmurs. Inhalation increases blood flow into the right side of the heart and may increase the amplitude of right-sided heart murmurs. Expiration partially restricts blood flow into the left side of the heart and may amplify left-sided heart murmurs.Figure 19.30indicates proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope to facilitate auscultation. 788 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart FIGURE19.30 Stethoscope Placement for Auscultation Proper placement of the bell of the stethoscope facilitates auscultation. At each of the four locations on the chest, a different valve can be heard. 19.4 Cardiac Physiology LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Relate heart rate to cardiac output • Describe the effect of exercise on heart rate • Identify cardiovascular centers and cardiac reflexes that
