high concentrations in artificial sweeteners, including aspartame. Therefore, these sweeteners must be avoided. Some animal products and certain starches are also high in phenylalanine, and intake of these foods should be carefully monitored. 24.5 Metabolic States of the Body LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe what defines each of the three metabolic states • Describe the processes that occur during the absorptive state of metabolism • Describe the processes that occur during the postabsorptive state of metabolism • Explain how the body processes glucose when the body is starved of fuel You eat periodically throughout the day; however, your organs, especially the brain, need a continuous supply of glucose. How does the body meet this constant demand for energy? Your body processes the food you eat both to use immediately and, importantly, to store as energy for later demands. If there were no method in place to store excess energy, you would need to eat constantly in order to meet energy demands. Distinct mechanisms are in place to facilitate energy storage, and to make stored energy available during times of fasting and starvation. The Absorptive State Theabsorptive state, or the fed
