at the joint),abductor(moves the bone away from the midline), oradductor(moves the bone toward the midline). 11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the axial muscles of the face, head, and neck • Identify the movement and function of the face, head, and neck muscles The skeletal muscles are divided intoaxial(muscles of the trunk and head) andappendicular(muscles of the arms and legs) categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which are also arranged in this manner. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the boundaries because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The first grouping of the axial muscles you will review includes the muscles of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral column, and finally you will review the oblique and rectus muscles. Muscles That Create Facial Expression The origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does 404 11 • The Muscular System not move).
