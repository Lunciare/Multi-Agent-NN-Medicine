many animals. That lioness might herself be threatened in some other situation. However, the autonomic nervous system is not just about responding to threats. Besides the fight-or-flight response, there are the responses referred to as “rest and digest.” If that lioness is successful in her hunting, then she is going to rest from the exertion. Her heart rate will slow. Breathing will return to normal. The digestive system has a big job to do. Much of the function of the autonomic system is based on the connections within an autonomic, or visceral, reflex. 15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic nervous system • Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system • Describe the signaling molecules and receptor proteins involved in communication within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system The nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces. The
