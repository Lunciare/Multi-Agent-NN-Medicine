Anatomy and Physiology

is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see Figure 1.19d). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Ultrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as gallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the image quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas. 32 1 • Key Terms Key Terms abdominopelvic cavity division of the anterior divides the body or organ into anterior and posterior (ventral) cavity that houses the abdominal and portions pelvic viscera gross anatomy study of the larger structures of the anabolism assembly of more complex molecules body, typically with the unaided eye; also referred to from simpler molecules macroscopic anatomy anatomical position standard reference position growth process of increasing in size used for describing locations and directions on the homeostasis steady state of body systems that living human body organisms maintain anatomy science that studies the form and inferior describes a position below
