Link Questions 1181 that controls the movement of water between cells and (H+). Several substances serve as buffers in the body, their environment. Imbalances of these ions can result including cell and plasma proteins, hemoglobin, in various problems in the body, and their phosphates, bicarbonate ions, and carbonic acid. The concentrations are tightly regulated. Aldosterone and bicarbonate buffer is the primary buffering system of angiotensin II control the exchange of sodium and the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the potassium between the renal filtrate and the renal body. The respiratory and renal systems also play collecting tubule. Calcium and phosphate are regulated major roles in acid-base homeostasis by removing CO 2 by PTH, calcitriol, and calcitonin. and hydrogen ions, respectively, from the body. 26.4Acid-Base Balance 26.5Disorders of Acid-Base Balance A variety of buffering systems exist in the body that Acidosis and alkalosis describe conditions in which a helps maintain the pH of the blood and other fluids person's blood is, respectively, too acidic (pH below within a narrow range—between pH 7.35 and 7.45. A 7.35) and too alkaline (pH above 7.45). Each of these buffer is a substance that prevents a radical change in conditions can be caused
