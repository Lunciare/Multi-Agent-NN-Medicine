Anatomy and Physiology

food in which the body is digesting pathway in which electrons are passed through a food and absorbing the nutrients series of oxidation-reduction reactions that forms acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) starting molecule of water and produces a proton gradient the Krebs cycle energy-consuming phase first phase of glycolysis, in anabolic hormones hormones that stimulate the which two molecules of ATP are necessary to start synthesis of new, larger molecules the reaction anabolic reactions reactions that build smaller energy-yielding phase second phase of glycolysis, molecules into larger molecules during which energy is produced ATP synthase protein pore complex that creates ATP enterokinase enzyme located in the wall of the small basal metabolic rate (BMR) amount of energy intestine that activates trypsin expended by the body at rest evaporation transfer of heat that occurs when water beta (β)-hydroxybutyrate primary ketone body changes from a liquid to a gas produced in the body FADH high-energy molecule needed for glycolysis 2 beta (β)-oxidation fatty acid oxidation fatty acid oxidation breakdown of fatty acids into bile salts salts that are released from the liver in smaller chain fatty acids and acetyl CoA response to lipid ingestion and surround the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) coenzyme
