Anatomy and Physiology

OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Differentiate between the embryonic period and the fetal period • Briefly describe the process of sexual differentiation • Describe the fetal circulatory system and explain the role of the shunts • Trace the development of a fetus from the end of the embryonic period to birth As you will recall, a developing human is called a fetus from the ninth week of gestation until birth. This 30-week period of development is marked by continued cell growth and differentiation, which fully develop the structures and functions of the immature organ systems formed during the embryonic period. The completion of fetal development results in a newborn who, although still immature in many ways, is capable of survival outside the womb. Sexual Differentiation Sexual differentiation does not begin until the fetal period, during weeks 9–12. Embryonic males and females, though genetically distinguishable, are morphologically identical (Figure 28.16). Bipotential gonads, or gonads that can develop into male or female sexual organs, are connected to a central cavity called the cloaca via Müllerian ducts and Wolffian ducts. (The cloaca is an extension of the primitive gut.) Several events lead to sexual differentiation
