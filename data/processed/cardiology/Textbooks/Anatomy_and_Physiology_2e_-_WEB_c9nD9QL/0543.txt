providing for support and movements of the body, the skeleton has protective and storage functions. It protects the internal organs, including the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, and pelvic organs. The bones of the skeleton serve as the primary storage site for important minerals such as calcium and phosphate. The bone marrow found within bones stores fat and houses the blood-cell producing tissue of the body. The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular. The Axial Skeleton The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular. Theaxial skeletonforms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Figure 7.2). It serves to protect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs. The axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including theskull, thevertebral column, and thethoracic cage. The skull is formed by 22 bones. Also associated with the head are an additional seven bones, including the hyoid boneand theear ossicles(three small bones found in
