Anatomy and Physiology

atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is avalve, a specialized structure that ensures one-way flow of blood. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known generically asatrioventricular valves. The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically assemilunar valves. The interventricular septum is visible inFigure 19.9. In this figure, the atrioventricular septum has been removed to better show the bicuspid and tricuspid valves; the interatrial septum is not visible, since its location is covered by the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Since these openings and valves structurally weaken the atrioventricular septum, the remaining tissue is heavily reinforced with dense connective tissue called thecardiac skeleton, or skeleton of the heart. It includes four rings that surround the openings between the atria and ventricles, and the openings to the pulmonary trunk and aorta, and serve as the point of attachment for the heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart electrical conduction system.
