distribution of systemic arteries from the heart into the upper limb.Table 20.9summarizes the arteries serving the upper limbs. FIGURE20.31 Major Arteries Serving the Thorax and Upper Limb The arteries that supply blood to the arms and hands are extensions of the subclavian arteries. 858 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.32 Major Arteries of the Upper Limb The flow chart summarizes the distribution of the major arteries from the heart into the upper limb. Arteries Serving the Upper Limbs Vessel Description Continuation of the subclavian artery as it penetrates the body wall and enters the axillary region; Axillary supplies blood to the region near the head of the humerus (humeral circumflex arteries); the artery majority of the vessel continues into the brachium and becomes the brachial artery Continuation of the axillary artery in the brachium; supplies blood to much of the brachial region; Brachial gives off several smaller branches that provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm in the artery region of the elbow; bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries at the coronoid fossa Formed at the bifurcation of the brachial artery; parallels the radius; gives off smaller branches Radial until it reaches the
