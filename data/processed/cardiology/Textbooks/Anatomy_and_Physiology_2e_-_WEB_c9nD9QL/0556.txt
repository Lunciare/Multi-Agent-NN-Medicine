Anatomy and Physiology

(petrous portion of temporal bone) separates the middle and posterior cranial fossae. Frontal Bone Thefrontal boneis the single bone that forms the forehead. At its anterior midline, between the eyebrows, there is a slight depression called theglabella(seeFigure 7.5). The frontal bone also forms the supraorbital margin of the orbit. Near the middle of this margin, is the supraorbital foramen, the opening that provides passage for a sensory nerve to the forehead. The frontal bone is thickened just above each supraorbital margin, forming rounded brow 236 7 • Axial Skeleton ridges. These are located just behind your eyebrows and vary in size among individuals, although they are generally larger in males. Inside the cranial cavity, the frontal bone extends posteriorly. This flattened region forms both the roof of the orbit below and the floor of the anterior cranial cavity above (seeFigure 7.8b). Occipital Bone Theoccipital boneis the single bone that forms the posterior skull and posterior base of the cranial cavity (Figure 7.9; see alsoFigure 7.8). On its outside surface, at the posterior midline, is a small protrusion called theexternal occipital protuberance, which serves as an attachment site for a ligament of the posterior neck.
