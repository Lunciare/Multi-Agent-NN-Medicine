exposure branches into many subsidiaries and provides a to high altitudes passageway for air to enter and leave the lungs acute mountain sickness (AMS) condition that carbaminohemoglobin bound form of hemoglobin occurs a result of acute exposure to high altitude and carbon dioxide due to a low partial pressure of oxygen carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme that catalyzes the ala (plural = alae) small, flaring structure of a nostril reaction that causes carbon dioxide and water to that forms the lateral side of the nares form carbonic acid alar cartilage cartilage that supports the apex of the cardiac notch indentation on the surface of the left nose and helps shape the nares; it is connected to lung that allows space for the heart the septal cartilage and connective tissue of the central chemoreceptor one of the specialized alae receptors that are located in the brain that sense alveolar dead space air space within alveoli that are changes in hydrogen ion, oxygen, or carbon dioxide unable to participate in gas exchange concentrations in the brain alveolar duct small tube that leads from the terminal chloride shift facilitated diffusion that exchanges bronchiole to the respiratory bronchiole and is the bicarbonate (HCO –) with
