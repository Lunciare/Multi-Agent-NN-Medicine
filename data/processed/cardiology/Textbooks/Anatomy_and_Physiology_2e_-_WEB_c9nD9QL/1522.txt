Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as thegreater splanchnic nerveorlesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (seeFigure 15.3c). Collateral ganglia, also calledprevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are theceliac ganglion, thesuperior mesenteric ganglion, and theinferior mesenteric ganglion(seeFigure 15.2). The word celiac is derived from the Latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system. 594 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System FIGURE15.3 Sympathetic Connections and Chain Ganglia The axon from a central sympathetic neuron in the spinal cord can project to the periphery in a number of different ways.
