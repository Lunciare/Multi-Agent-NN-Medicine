Anatomy and Physiology

Somatic Nervous System the basis of the type of mechanoreceptors that perceive these touch sensations. Other overlooked senses include temperature perception by thermoreceptors and pain perception by nociceptors. Within the realm of physiology, senses can be classified as either general or specific. Ageneral senseis one that is distributed throughout the body and has receptor cells within the structures of other organs. Mechanoreceptors in the skin, muscles, or the walls of blood vessels are examples of this type. General senses often contribute to the sense of touch, as described above, or toproprioception(body movement) andkinesthesia(body movement), or to avisceral sense, which is most important to autonomic functions. Aspecial senseis one that has a specific organ devoted to it, namely the eye, inner ear, tongue, or nose. Each of the senses is referred to as asensory modality. Modality refers to the way that information is encoded, which is similar to the idea of transduction. The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each is transduced. The chemical senses are taste and smell. The general sense that is usually referred to as touch includes chemical sensation in the form of nociception, or pain. Pressure, vibration, muscle stretch, and the movement
