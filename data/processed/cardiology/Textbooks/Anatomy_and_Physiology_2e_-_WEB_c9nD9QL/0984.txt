Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped (wide in the middle and tapered at both ends, somewhat like a football) and have a single nucleus; they range from about 30 to 200μm (thousands of times shorter than skeletal muscle fibers), and they produce their own connective tissue, endomysium. Although they do not have striations and sarcomeres, smooth muscle fibers do have actin and myosin contractile proteins, and thick and thin filaments. These thin filaments are anchored by dense bodies. Adense bodyis analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and is fastened to the sarcolemma. Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by sequestration from the extracellular fluid through membrane indentations called calveoli. Because smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin, cross-bridge formation is not regulated by the troponin- tropomyosin complex but instead by the regulatory proteincalmodulin. In a smooth muscle fiber, external Ca++ions passing through opened calcium channels in the sarcolemma, and additional Ca++released from SR, bind to calmodulin. The Ca++-calmodulin complex
