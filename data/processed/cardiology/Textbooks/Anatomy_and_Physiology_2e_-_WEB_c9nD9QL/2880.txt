The two capillary beds are clearly shown in this figure. The efferent arteriole is the connecting vessel between the glomerulus and the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thislink( view an interactive tutorial of the flow of blood through the kidney. Cortex In a dissected kidney, it is easy to identify the cortex; it appears lighter in color compared to the rest of the kidney. All of the renal corpuscles as well as both theproximal convoluted tubules (PCTs)anddistal convoluted tubules are found here. Some nephrons have a shortloop of Henlethat does not dip beyond the cortex. These nephrons are calledcortical nephrons. About 15 percent of nephrons have long loops of Henle that extend deep into the medulla and are calledjuxtamedullary nephrons.
