lower limb is attached to the vertebral column by the pelvic girdle. Because of our upright stance, different functional demands are placed upon the upper and lower limbs. Thus, the bones of the lower limbs are adapted for weight-bearing support and stability, as well as for body locomotion via walking or running. In contrast, our upper limbs are not required for these functions. Instead, our upper limbs are highly mobile and can be utilized for a wide variety of activities. The large range of upper limb movements, coupled with the ability to easily manipulate objects with our hands and opposable thumbs, has allowed humans to construct the modern world in which we live. 8.1 The Pectoral Girdle LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the bones that form the pectoral girdle • List the functions of the pectoral girdle The appendicular skeleton includes all of the limb bones, plus the bones that unite each limb with the axial skeleton 274 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton (Figure 8.2). The bones that attach each upper limb to the axial skeleton form the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle). This consists of two bones, the scapula and
