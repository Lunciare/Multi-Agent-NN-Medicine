stem cells are then intravenously infused. From the bloodstream, they establish themselves in the recipient’s bone marrow. 18.3 Erythrocytes LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the anatomy of erythrocytes • Discuss the various steps in the lifecycle of an erythrocyte • Explain the composition and function of hemoglobin Theerythrocyte, commonly known as a red blood cell (or RBC), is by far the most common formed element: A single drop of blood contains millions of erythrocytes and just thousands of leukocytes. Specifically, males have about 5.4 million erythrocytes per microliter (µL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million perµL. In fact, erythrocytes are estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body. As you can imagine, they are quite small cells, with a mean diameter of only about 7–8 micrometers (µm) (Figure 18.5). The primary functions of erythrocytes are to pick up inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the body’s tissues, and to pick up some (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide waste at the tissues and transport it to the lungs for exhalation. Erythrocytes remain within the vascular network. Although leukocytes typically leave
