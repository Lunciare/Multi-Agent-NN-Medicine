vertebrae. embryonic development with the appearance of the rod-like notochord along the dorsal length of the early The intervertebral discs fill in the gaps between the embryo. Repeating, paired blocks of tissue called bodies of adjacent vertebrae. They provide strong somites then appear along either side of notochord. As attachments and padding between the vertebrae. The the somites grow, they split into parts, one of which is outer, fibrous layer of a disc is called the anulus called a sclerotome. This consists of mesenchyme, the fibrosus. The gel-like interior is called the nucleus embryonic tissue that will become the bones, pulposus. The disc can change shape to allow for cartilages, and connective tissues of the body. movement between vertebrae. If the anulus fibrosus is weakened or damaged, the nucleus pulposus can Mesenchyme in the head region will produce the bones protrude outward, resulting in a herniated disc. of the skull via two different mechanisms. The bones of the brain case arise via intramembranous ossification The anterior longitudinal ligament runs along the full in which embryonic mesenchyme tissue converts length of the anterior vertebral column, uniting the directly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are vertebral bodies. The
