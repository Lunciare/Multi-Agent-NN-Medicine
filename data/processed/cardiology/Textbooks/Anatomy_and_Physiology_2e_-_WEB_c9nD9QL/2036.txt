cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there is a specialized pathway calledBachmann’s bundleor the interatrial bandthat conducts the impulse directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the pathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node.Figure 19.19illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to Access for free at openstax.org 19.2 • Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity 775 the atrioventricular node. FIGURE19.19 Cardiac Conduction (1) The sinoatrial (SA) node and the remainder of the conduction system are at rest. (2) The SA node initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria. (3) After reaching the atrioventricular node, there is a delay of approximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle. (4) Following the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers, and also reaches the right papillary muscle via the moderator band. (5) The impulse
