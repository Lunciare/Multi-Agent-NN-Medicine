of ATP and becomes fatigued (Figure 10.9). 366 10 • Muscle Tissue FIGURE10.9 Relaxation of a Muscle Fiber Ca++ions are pumped back into the SR, which causes the tropomyosin to reshield the binding sites on the actin strands. A muscle may also stop contracting when it runs out of ATP and becomes fatigued. INTERACTIVE LINK The release of calcium ions initiates muscle contractions. Watch thisvideo( learn more about the role of calcium. (a) What are “T-tubules” and what is their role? (b) Please describe how actin- binding sites are made available for cross-bridging with myosin heads during contraction. The molecular events of muscle fiber shortening occur within the fiber’s sarcomeres (seeFigure 10.10). The contraction of a striated muscle fiber occurs as the sarcomeres, linearly arranged within myofibrils, shorten as myosin heads pull on the actin filaments. The region where thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments. This zone where thin and thick filaments overlap is very important to muscle contraction, as it is the site where filament movement starts. Thin filaments, anchored at their ends by the Z-discs, do not extend completely into the central region that only contains thick
