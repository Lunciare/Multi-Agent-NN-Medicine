and sweat in response to rising internal body temperature. (credit: Phil Roeder/flickr) Development, growth and reproduction Developmentis all of the changes the body goes through in life. Development includes the process of differentiation, in which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function to perform certain tasks in the body. Development also includes the processes of growth and repair, both of which involve cell differentiation. Growthis the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of existing cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and, within very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells. Reproductionis the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by the male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms, without reproduction, the line of organisms would end. 1.4 Requirements for Human Life LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the role of oxygen and nutrients in maintaining human survival • Explain why extreme heat and extreme cold threaten human survival • Explain how the pressure exerted by gases and fluids influences
