it reaches a peak point. The tension at this point is about three to four times greater than the tension of a single twitch, a state referred to as incomplete tetanus. During incomplete tetanus, the muscle goes through quick cycles of contraction with a short relaxation phase for each. If the stimulus frequency is so high that the relaxation phase disappears completely, contractions become continuous in a process called completetetanus (Figure 10.16b). During tetanus, the concentration of Ca++ions in the sarcoplasm allows virtually all of the sarcomeres to form cross- bridges and shorten, so that a contraction can continue uninterrupted (until the muscle fatigues and can no longer produce tension). Treppe When a skeletal muscle has been dormant for an extended period and then activated to contract, with all other things being equal, the initial contractions generate about one-half the force of later contractions. The muscle tension increases in a graded manner that to some looks like a set of stairs. This tension increase is calledtreppe, a condition where muscle contractions become more efficient. It’s also known as the “staircase effect” (Figure 10.17). Access for free at openstax.org 10.5 • Types of Muscle Fibers 377 FIGURE10.17 Treppe When muscle tension
