Anatomy and Physiology

lead to toxic accumulations. Additionally, administration of appropriate drug dosages for those drugs primarily excreted by the kidney requires an accurate assessment of GFR. GFR can be estimated closely by intravenous administration of inulin. Inulin is a plant polysaccharide that is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidney. Its appearance in the urine is directly proportional to the rate at which it is filtered by the renal corpuscle. However, since measuring inulin clearance is cumbersome in the clinical setting, most often, the GFR is estimated by measuring naturally occurring creatinine, a protein-derived molecule produced by muscle metabolism that is not reabsorbed and only slightly secreted by the nephron. 25.6 Tubular Reabsorption LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • List specific transport mechanisms occurring in different parts of the nephron, including active transport, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, and passive electrochemical gradients • List the different membrane proteins of the nephron, including channels, transporters, and ATPase pumps • Compare and contrast passive and active tubular reabsorption • Explain why the differential permeability or impermeability of specific sections of the nephron tubules is necessary for urine formation • Describe how and where water, organic compounds, and ions
