number of bones in each region • Discuss the curves of the vertebral column and how these change after birth • Describe a typical vertebra and determine the distinguishing characteristics for vertebrae in each vertebral region and features of the sacrum and the coccyx • Define the structure of an intervertebral disc • Determine the location of the ligaments that provide support for the vertebral column The vertebral column is also known as the spinal column or spine (Figure 7.20). It consists of a sequence of vertebrae (singular = vertebra), each of which is separated and united by anintervertebral disc. Together, the vertebrae and intervertebral discs form the vertebral column. It is a flexible column that supports the head, neck, and body and allows for their movements. It also protects the spinal cord, which passes down the back through openings in the vertebrae.

The vertebrae are divided into three regions: cervical C1–C7 vertebrae, thoracic T1–T12 vertebrae, and lumbar L1–L5 vertebrae. The vertebral column is curved, with two primary curvatures (thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves)
