primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels in the blood. The normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year of age has a normal respiratory rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about 10 years old, the normal rate is closer to 18 to 30. By adolescence, the normal respiratory rate is similar to that of adults, 12 to 18 breaths per minute. Ventilation Control Centers The control of ventilation is a complex interplay of multiple regions in the brain that signal the muscles used in pulmonary ventilation to contract (Table 22.1). The result is typically a rhythmic, consistent ventilation rate that provides the body with sufficient amounts of oxygen, while adequately removing carbon dioxide. Summary of Ventilation Regulation System component Function Medullary respiratory center Sets the basic rhythm of breathing Ventral respiratory group Generates the breathing rhythm and integrates data coming into the medulla (VRG) Dorsal respiratory group Integrates input from the stretch receptors and the chemoreceptors in the (DRG) periphery Pontine respiratory group Influences and modifies the medulla oblongata’s functions (PRG) Aortic body Monitors blood PCO , PO ,
