lungs that catalyzes the reaction of without mixing with cell contents inactive angiotensin I into active angiotensin II filtration slits formed by pedicels of podocytes; angiotensinogen inactive protein in the circulation substances filter between the pedicels based on produced by the liver; precursor of angiotensin I; size must be modified by the enzymes renin and ACE to forming urine filtrate undergoing modifications be activated through secretion and reabsorption before true anuria absence of urine produced; production of 50 urine is produced mL or less per day glomerular filtration rate (GFR) rate of renal aquaporin protein-forming water channels through filtration the lipid bilayer of the cell; allows water to cross; glomerulus tuft of capillaries surrounded by activation in the collecting ducts is under the control Bowman’s capsule; filters the blood based on size of ADH glycosuria presence of glucose in the urine; caused Bowman’s capsule cup-shaped sack lined by a by high blood glucose levels that exceed the ability simple squamous epithelium (parietal surface) and of the kidneys to reabsorb the glucose; usually the specialized cells called podocytes (visceral surface) result of untreated or poorly controlled diabetes that participate in the filtration process; receives the mellitus filtrate which then passes on
