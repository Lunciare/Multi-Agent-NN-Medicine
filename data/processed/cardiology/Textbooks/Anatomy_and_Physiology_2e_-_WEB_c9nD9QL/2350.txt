and thymus gland. The lymphoid organs are where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack pathogens without harming the cells of the body. Bone Marrow In the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac. As development proceeds, this function is taken over by the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions, although the final stages of the differentiation of some cells may take place in other organs. The redbone marrowis a loose collection of cells where hematopoiesis occurs, and the yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely of fat cells (Figure 21.6). The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone marrow, whereas the immature T cell, called athymocyte, leaves the bone marrow and matures largely in the thymus gland. 900 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System FIGURE21.6 Bone Marrow Red bone marrow fills the head of the femur, and a spot of yellow bone marrow is visible in the center.
