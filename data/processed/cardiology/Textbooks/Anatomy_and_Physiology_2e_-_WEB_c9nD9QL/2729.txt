factor secreted in the stomach binds to vitamin B , preventing its digestion and creating a 12 complex that binds to mucosal receptors in the terminal ileum, where it is taken up by endocytosis. Water Absorption Each day, about nine liters of fluid enter the small intestine. About 2.3 liters are ingested in foods and beverages, and the rest is from GI secretions. About 90 percent of this water is absorbed in the small intestine. Water absorption is driven by the concentration gradient of the water: The concentration of water is higher in chyme than it is in epithelial cells. Thus, water moves down its concentration gradient from the chyme into cells. As noted earlier, much of the remaining water is then absorbed in the colon. 1048 23 • Key Terms Key Terms absorption passage of digested products from the and the rectum intestinal lumen through mucosal cells and into the common bile duct structure formed by the union of bloodstream or lacteals the common hepatic duct and the gallbladder’s accessory digestive organ includes teeth, tongue, cystic duct salivary glands, gallbladder, liver, and pancreas common hepatic duct duct formed by the merger of accessory duct (also, duct of Santorini) duct
