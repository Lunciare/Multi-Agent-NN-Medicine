Although they naturally vary in shape and size from person to person, the labia minora serve to protect the urethra and the entrance to the reproductive tract. The superior, anterior portions of the labia minora come together to encircle theclitoris(or glans clitoris), an organ that originates from the same cells as the glans penis and has abundant nerves that make it important in sexual sensation and orgasm. Thehymenis a thin membrane that sometimes partially covers the entrance to the vagina. An intact hymen cannot be used as an indication of “virginity”; even at birth, this is only a partial membrane, as menstrual fluid and other secretions must be able to exit the body, regardless of penile–vaginal intercourse. The vaginal opening is located between the opening of the urethra and the anus. It is flanked by outlets to the Bartholin’s glands(or greater vestibular glands). 1198 27 • The Reproductive System FIGURE27.10 The Vulva The external female genitalia are referred to collectively as the vulva.
