of carbohydrates in the body • Discuss four types of lipids important in human functioning • Describe the structure of proteins, and discuss their importance to human functioning • Identify the building blocks of nucleic acids, and the roles of DNA, RNA, and ATP in human functioning Organic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often other elements as well. They are found throughout the world, in soils and seas, commercial products, and every cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of carbon. The Chemistry of Carbon What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or accepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds. Commonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming
