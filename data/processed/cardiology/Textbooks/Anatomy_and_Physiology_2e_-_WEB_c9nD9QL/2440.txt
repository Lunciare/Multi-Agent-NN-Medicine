a hemolytic disease of the newborn (Figure 21.30). This disease occurs when people negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive children. During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the birth parent makes a primary anti-Rh antibody response to the fetal blood cells that enter the pregnant person's bloodstream. If the same parent has a second Rh-positive child, IgG antibodies against Rh-positive blood mounted during this secondary response cross the placenta and attack the fetal blood, causing anemia. This is a consequence of the fact that the fetus is not genetically identical to the birth parent, and thus the parent is capable of mounting an immune response against it. This disease is treated with antibodies specific for Rh factor. These are given to the pregnant person during the first and subsequent births, destroying any fetal blood that might enter their system and preventing the immune response.
