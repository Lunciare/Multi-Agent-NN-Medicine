acidosis. In contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with acidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low. Lung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the normal concentration of H+. Metabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions (as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to lose potassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent heartburn or an ulcer. 2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify four types of organic molecules essential to human functioning • Explain the chemistry behind carbon’s affinity for covalently bonding in organic compounds • Provide examples of three types of carbohydrates, and identify the primary functions of carbohydrates in the body • Discuss four types of lipids important in human functioning • Describe the structure of proteins, and discuss their importance to human functioning • Identify
