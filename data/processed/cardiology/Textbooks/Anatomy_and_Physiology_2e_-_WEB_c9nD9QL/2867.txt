Anatomy and Physiology

The urethra tracks posterior and inferior to the pubic symphysis (seeFigure 25.3a). In both males and females, the proximal urethra is lined by transitional epithelium, whereas the terminal portion is a nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. In the male, pseudostratified columnar epithelium lines the urethra between these two cell types. Voiding is regulated by an involuntary autonomic nervous system-controlledinternal urinary sphincter, consisting of smooth muscle and voluntary skeletal muscle that forms theexternal urinary sphincterbelow it. Female Urethra The external urethral orifice is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall inferior to the clitoris, superior to the vaginal opening (introitus), and medial to the labia minora. Its short length, about 4 cm, is less of a barrier to fecal bacteria than the longer male urethra and the best explanation for the greater incidence of UTI in females. Voluntary control of the external urethral sphincter is a function of the pudendal nerve. It arises in the sacral region of the spinal cord, traveling via the S2–S4 nerves of the sacral plexus. Male Urethra The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic symphysis (seeFigure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between people but
