are summarized inFigure 19.31. FIGURE19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke volume, both of which are also variable. SVs are also used to calculateejection fraction, which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the heart with each contraction. To calculate ejection fraction, SV is divided by EDV. Despite the name, the ejection fraction is normally expressed as a percentage. Ejection fractions range from approximately 55–70 percent, with a mean of 58 percent. Exercise and Maximum Cardiac Output In healthy young individuals, HR may increase to 150 bpm during exercise. SV can also increase from 70 to approximately 130 mL due to increased strength of contraction. This would increase CO to approximately 19.5 L/ min, 4–5 times the resting rate. Top cardiovascular athletes can achieve even higher levels. At their peak performance, they may increase resting CO by 7–8 times. Since the heart is a muscle, exercising it increases its efficiency. The difference between maximum and resting CO is known as thecardiac reserve. It measures the residual capacity of the heart to pump blood. Heart Rates HRs vary considerably, not only with exercise and fitness levels, but also
