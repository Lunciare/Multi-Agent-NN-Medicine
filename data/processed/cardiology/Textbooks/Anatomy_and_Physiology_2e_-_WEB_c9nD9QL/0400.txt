If you zoom on the cells at the outermost layer of this section of skin, what do you notice about the cells? The keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum begin the synthesis of keratin and release a water-repelling glycolipid Access for free at openstax.org 5.1 • Layers of the Skin 167 that helps prevent water loss from the body, making the skin relatively waterproof. As new keratinocytes are produced atop the stratum basale, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum granulosum. Stratum Granulosum Thestratum granulosumhas a grainy appearance due to further changes to the keratinocytes as they are pushed from the stratum spinosum. The cells (three to five layers deep) become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and they generate large amounts of the proteins keratin, which is fibrous, andkeratohyalin, which accumulates as lamellar granules within the cells (seeFigure 5.5). These two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in the stratum granulosum and give the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as the
