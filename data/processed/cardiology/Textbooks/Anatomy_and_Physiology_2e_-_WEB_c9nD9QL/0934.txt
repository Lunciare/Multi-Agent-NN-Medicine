cell, which triggers the opening of calcium channels in the membrane of the adjacent SR, causing Ca++to diffuse out of the SR and into the sarcoplasm. It is the arrival of Ca++in the sarcoplasm that initiates contraction of the muscle fiber by its contractile units, or sarcomeres. 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the components involved in a muscle contraction • Explain how muscles contract and relax • Describe the sliding filament model of muscle contraction The sequence of events that result in the contraction of an individual muscle fiber begins with a signal—the neurotransmitter, ACh—from the motor neuron innervating that fiber. The local membrane of the fiber will depolarize Access for free at openstax.org 10.3 • Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation 365 as positively charged sodium ions (Na+) enter, triggering an action potential that spreads to the rest of the membrane which will depolarize, including the T-tubules. This triggers the release of calcium ions (Ca++) from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The Ca++then initiates contraction, which is sustained by ATP (Figure 10.8). As long as Ca++ions remain in the sarcoplasm to bind to
