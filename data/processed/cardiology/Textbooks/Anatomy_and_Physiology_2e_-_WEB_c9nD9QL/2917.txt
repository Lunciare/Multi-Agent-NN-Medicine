membrane. Note the environment now created in the interstitial space: With the “back door exiting” K+, there is one Na+and two Cl–ions left in the interstitium surrounding the ascending loop. Therefore, in comparison to the lumen of the loop, the Access for free at openstax.org 25.6 • Tubular Reabsorption 1135 interstitial space is now a negatively charged environment. This negative charge attracts cations (Na+, K+, Ca++, and Mg++) from the lumen via a paracellular route to the interstitial space and vasa recta. Countercurrent Multiplier System The structure of the loop of Henle and associated vasa recta create acountercurrent multiplier system(Figure 25.20). The countercurrent term comes from the fact that the descending and ascending loops are next to each other and their fluid flows in opposite directions (countercurrent). The multiplier term is due to the action of solute pumps that increase (multiply) the concentrations of urea and Na+deep in the medulla. FIGURE25.20 Countercurrent Multiplier System As discussed above, the ascending loop actively reabsorbs NaCl out of the forming urine into the interstitial spaces. In addition, collecting ducts have urea pumps that actively pump urea into the interstitial spaces. This results in the recovery of NaCl to the circulation via the vasa
