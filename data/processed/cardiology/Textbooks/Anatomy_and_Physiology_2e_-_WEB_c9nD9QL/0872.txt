Anatomy and Physiology

the sixth week, as each limb bud continues to grow and elongate, areas of mesenchyme within the bud begin to differentiate into the hyaline cartilage that will form models for of each of the future bones. The synovial joints will form between the adjacent cartilage models, in an area called thejoint interzone. Cells at the center of this interzone region undergo cell death to form the joint cavity, while surrounding mesenchyme cells will form the articular capsule and supporting ligaments. The process of endochondral ossification, which converts the cartilage models into bone, begins by the twelfth week of embryonic development. At birth, ossification of much of the bone has occurred, but the hyaline cartilage of the epiphyseal plate will remain throughout childhood and adolescence to allow for bone lengthening. Hyaline cartilage is also retained as the articular cartilage that covers the surfaces of the bones at synovial joints. 346 9 • Key Terms Key Terms abduction movement in the coronal plane that moves calcaneofibular ligament intrinsic ligament located a limb laterally away from the body; spreading of the on the lateral side of the ankle joint, between the fingers calcaneus bone and lateral malleolus of the fibula; acetabular labrum lip
