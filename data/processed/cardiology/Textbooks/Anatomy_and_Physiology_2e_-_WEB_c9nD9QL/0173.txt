composed of two carbohydrate monomers bonded by four hydrocarbon rings bonded to a variety of other dehydration synthesis via glycosidic bonds atoms and molecules potential energy stored energy matter possesses substrate reactant in an enzymatic reaction because of the positioning or structure of its suspension liquid mixture in which particles components distributed in the liquid settle out over time product one or more substances produced by a synthesis reaction type of anabolic reaction in which chemical reaction two or more atoms or molecules bond, resulting in prostaglandin lipid compound derived from fatty acid the formation of a larger molecule chains and important in regulating several body triglyceride lipid compound composed of a glycerol processes molecule bonded with three fatty acid chains protein class of organic compounds that are valence shell outermost electron shell of an atom Chapter Review 2.1Elements and Atoms: The Building with other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the Blocks of Matter electrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell, called its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms The human body is composed of elements, the most with eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to abundant of which are oxygen (O), carbon
