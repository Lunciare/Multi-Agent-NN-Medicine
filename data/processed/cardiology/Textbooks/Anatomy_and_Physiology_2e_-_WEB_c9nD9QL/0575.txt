Anatomy and Physiology

Mylohyoid line—This bony ridge extends along the inner aspect of the mandibular body (seeFigure 7.11). The muscle that forms the floor of the oral cavity attaches to the mylohyoid lines on both sides of the mandible. • Mandibular foramen—This opening is located on the medial side of the ramus of the mandible. The opening Access for free at openstax.org 7.2 • The Skull 243 leads into a tunnel that runs down the length of the mandibular body. The sensory nerve and blood vessels that supply the lower teeth enter the mandibular foramen and then follow this tunnel. Thus, to numb the lower teeth prior to dental work, the dentist must inject anesthesia into the lateral wall of the oral cavity at a point prior to where this sensory nerve enters the mandibular foramen. • Lingula—This small flap of bone is named for its shape (lingula = “little tongue”). It is located immediately next to the mandibular foramen, on the medial side of the ramus. A ligament that anchors the mandible during opening and closing of the mouth extends down from the base of the skull and attaches to the lingula.
