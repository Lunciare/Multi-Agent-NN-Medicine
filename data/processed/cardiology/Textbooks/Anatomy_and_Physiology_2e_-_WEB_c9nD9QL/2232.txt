Anatomy and Physiology

5 cm Graceful arc to the left that connects the ascending aorta to the descending aorta; ends at the Aortic arch intervertebral disk between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae Descending Portion of the aorta that continues inferiorly past the end of the aortic arch; subdivided into the aorta thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta TABLE20.5 848 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation Vessel Description Thoracic Portion of the descending aorta superior to the aortic hiatus aorta Abdominal Portion of the aorta inferior to the aortic hiatus and superior to the common iliac arteries aorta TABLE20.5 Coronary Circulation The first vessels that branch from the ascending aorta are the paired coronary arteries (seeFigure 20.25), which arise from two of the three sinuses in the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. These sinuses contain the aortic baroreceptors and chemoreceptors critical to maintain cardiac function. The left coronary artery arises from the left posterior aortic sinus. The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus. Normally, the right posterior aortic sinus does not give rise to a vessel. The coronary arteries encircle the heart, forming a ring-like structure that divides into the next level of
