the scapulais a long and prominent ridge that runs across its upper portion. Extending laterally from the spine is a flattened and expanded region called theacromionoracromial process. The acromion forms the bony tip of the superior shoulder region and articulates with the lateral end of the clavicle, forming theacromioclavicular joint(seeFigure 8.3). Together, the clavicle, acromion, and spine of the scapula form a V-shaped bony line that provides for the attachment of neck and back muscles that act on the shoulder, as well as muscles that pass across the shoulder joint to act on the arm. The scapula has three depressions, each of which is called afossa(plural = fossae). Two of these are found on the posterior scapula, above and below the scapular spine. Superior to the spine is the narrowsupraspinous fossa, and inferior to the spine is the broadinfraspinous fossa. The anterior (deep) surface of the scapula forms the broad subscapular fossa. All of these fossae provide large surface areas for the attachment of muscles that cross the shoulder joint to act on the humerus. The acromioclavicular joint transmits forces from the upper limb to the clavicle. The ligaments around this joint are relatively weak. A hard fall onto the
