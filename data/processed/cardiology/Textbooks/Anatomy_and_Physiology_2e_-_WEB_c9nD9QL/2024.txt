cardiac arrest, but the two are not synonymous. Important risk factors for MI include cardiovascular disease, age, smoking, high blood levels of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often referred to as “bad” cholesterol), low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good” cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, lack of physical exercise, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and use of illegal drugs. Coronary Veins Coronary veinsdrain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (seeFigure 19.15). Thegreat cardiac veincan be seen initially on the surface of the heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface. The great cardiac vein initially parallels the anterior interventricular artery and drains the areas supplied by this vessel. It receives several major branches, including the posterior cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, and the small cardiac vein. Theposterior cardiac veinparallels and drains the areas supplied by the marginal artery branch of the circumflex artery. The middle cardiac veinparallels and drains the areas supplied by the posterior interventricular artery. Thesmall cardiac veinparallels the right coronary artery and drains the blood from the posterior surfaces of the right atrium and ventricle. The coronary sinus is
