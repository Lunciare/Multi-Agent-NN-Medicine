Anatomy and Physiology

the influence of prostaglandins, the spiral arteries of the endometrium constrict and rupture, preventing oxygenated blood from reaching the endometrial tissue. As a result, endometrial tissue dies and blood, pieces of the endometrial tissue, and white blood cells are shed through the vagina during menstruation, or themenses. The first menses after puberty, calledmenarche, can occur either before or after the first ovulation. The Menstrual Cycle Now that we have discussed the maturation of the cohort of tertiary follicles in the ovary, the build-up and then shedding of the endometrial lining in the uterus, and the function of the uterine tubes and vagina, we can put everything together to talk about the three phases of themenstrual cycle—the series of changes in which the uterine lining is shed, rebuilds, and prepares for implantation. The timing of the menstrual cycle starts with the first day of menses, referred to as day one of a period. Cycle length is determined by counting the days between the onset of bleeding in two subsequent cycles. Because the average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, this is the time period used to identify the timing of events in the cycle. However, the length of the
