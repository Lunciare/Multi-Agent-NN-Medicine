Anatomy and Physiology

or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures. Acellis the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small, independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of human anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by cells.

In humans, as in all organisms, cells perform all functions of life. Atissueis a group of many similar cells (though sometimes composed of a few related types) that work together to perform a specific function. Anorganis an anatomically distinct structure of the body composed of two or more tissue types. Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions. Anorgan systemis a group of organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body. This
