Anatomy and Physiology

in the more metabolically active regions of the bone. The nerves sense pain, and it appears the nerves also play roles in regulating blood supplies and in bone growth, hence their concentrations in metabolically active sites of the bone. FIGURE6.15 Diagram of Blood and Nerve Supply to Bone Blood vessels and nerves enter the bone through the nutrient foramen. 206 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( see the microscopic features of a bone. 6.4 Bone Formation and Development LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the function of cartilage • List the steps of intramembranous ossification • List the steps of endochondral ossification • Explain the growth activity at the epiphyseal plate • Compare and contrast the processes of modeling and remodeling In the early stages of embryonic development, the embryo’s skeleton consists of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. By the sixth or seventh week of embryonic life, the actual process of bone development,ossification (osteogenesis), begins. There are two osteogenic pathways—intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification—but bone is the same regardless of the pathway that produces it. Cartilage Templates Bone is a replacement tissue; that is, it
