Anatomy and Physiology

Exams The trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing, which are tested for stretch reflexes. Motor functions of The cerebellum is an important part of motor function the facial nerve are usually obvious if facial expressions in the nervous system. It apparently plays a role in are compromised, but can be tested by having the procedural learning, which would include motor skills patient raise their eyebrows, smile, and frown. such as riding a bike or throwing a football. The basis Movements of the tongue, soft palate, or superior for these roles is likely to be tied into the role the pharynx can be observed directly while the patient cerebellum plays as a comparator for voluntary swallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while the movement. patient says repetitive consonant sounds. The motor The motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres control of the gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in travel along the corticospinal pathway, which passes the vagus nerve and constitutes a test of that nerve through the pons. Collateral branches of these fibers because the parasympathetic functions of that nerve synapse on neurons in the pons, which then project are involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating
