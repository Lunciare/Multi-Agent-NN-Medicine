two papillary muscles on the left—the anterior and posterior—as opposed to three on the right. The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic semilunar valve. Heart Valve Structure and Function A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four heart valves along the same plane (Figure 19.12). The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is theright atrioventricular valve, ortricuspid valve. It typically consists of three flaps, or leaflets, made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue. The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae to the papillary muscles, which control the opening and closing of the valves. FIGURE19.12 Heart Valves With the atria and major vessels removed, all four valves are clearly visible, although it is difficult to distinguish the three separate cusps of the tricuspid valve.
