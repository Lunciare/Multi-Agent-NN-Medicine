Extrinsic Pathway The quicker responding and more directextrinsic pathway(also known as thetissue factorpathway) begins when damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury. Upon contact with blood plasma, the damaged extravascular cells, which are extrinsic to the bloodstream, release factor III (thromboplastin). Sequentially, Ca2+then factor VII (proconvertin),
