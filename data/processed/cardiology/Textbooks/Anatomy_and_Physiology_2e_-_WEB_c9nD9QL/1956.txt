Anatomy and Physiology

when tissues are injured, “self” proteins on their plasma membrane or that opposes prothrombin contain foreign or abnormal markers; provide hypoxemia below-normal level of oxygen saturation generalized, nonspecific immunity of blood (typically <95 percent) neutrophils granulocytes that stain with a neutral dye immunoglobulins (also, antibodies or gamma and are the most numerous of the leukocytes; globulins) antigen-specific proteins produced by especially active against bacteria specialized B lymphocytes that protect the body by oxyhemoglobin molecule of hemoglobin to which binding to foreign objects such as bacteria and oxygen is bound viruses packed cell volume (PCV) (also, hematocrit) volume interleukins signaling molecules that may function in percentage of erythrocytes present in a sample of hemopoiesis, inflammation, and specific immune centrifuged blood responses plasma in blood, the liquid extracellular matrix intrinsic pathway initial coagulation pathway that composed mostly of water that circulates the 746 18 • Chapter Review formed elements and dissolved materials leading to abnormal formation of hemoglobin and throughout the cardiovascular system the destruction of RBCs plasmin blood protein active in fibrinolysis thrombin enzyme essential for the final steps in platelet plug accumulation and adhesion of platelets formation of a fibrin clot at the site of blood vessel injury thrombocytes platelets,
