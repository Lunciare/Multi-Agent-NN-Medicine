contractions become more efficient. It’s also known as the “staircase effect” (Figure 10.17).

The bottom of each wave represents the point of stimulus. It is believed that treppe results from a higher concentration of Ca++in the sarcoplasm resulting from the steady stream of signals from the motor neuron. It can only be maintained with adequate ATP. Muscle Tone Skeletal muscles are rarely completely relaxed, or flaccid. Even if a muscle is not producing movement, it is contracted a small amount to maintain its contractile proteins and producemuscle tone. The tension produced by muscle tone allows muscles to continually stabilize joints and maintain posture. Muscle tone is accomplished by a complex interaction between the nervous system and skeletal muscles that results in the activation of a few motor units at a time, most likely in a cyclical manner. In this manner, muscles never fatigue completely, as some motor units can recover while others are active. The absence of the low-level contractions that lead to muscle tone is referred
