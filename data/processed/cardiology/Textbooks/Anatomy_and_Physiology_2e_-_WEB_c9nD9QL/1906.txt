and their primary functions • Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes • Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets Theleukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the body’s defenses against disease. Leukocytes protect the body against invading microorganisms and body cells with mutated DNA, and they clean up debris. Platelets are essential for the repair of blood vessels when damage to them has occurred; they also provide growth factors for healing and repair. SeeFigure 18.5for a summary of leukocytes and platelets. Characteristics of Leukocytes Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very different from each other in many significant ways. For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes: Typically there are only 5000 to 10,000 perµL. They are also larger than erythrocytes and are the only 728 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood formed elements that are complete cells, possessing a nucleus and organelles. And although there is just one type of erythrocyte, there are many types of leukocytes. Most of these types have a much shorter lifespan than that of erythrocytes, some as short as a few hours
