Secondary caused by a variety of cells, mediators, and lymphoid organs are site in which mature lymphocytes antibacterial proteins such as complement. Within the congregate to mount immune responses.

Additionally, interferons are induced interferons and cytotoxic T cells. Worms are attacked that protect cells from viruses in their vicinity. Finally, by eosinophils.
