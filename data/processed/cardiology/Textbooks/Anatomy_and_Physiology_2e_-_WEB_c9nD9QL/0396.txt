Akeratinocyteis a cell that manufactures and stores the protein keratin.Keratinis an intracellular fibrous protein that gives hair, nails, and skin their hardness and water-resistant properties. The keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are dead and regularly slough away, being replaced by cells from the deeper layers (Figure 5.4).

The basal layer consists of cuboidal cells, whereas the outer layers are squamous, keratinized cells, so the whole epithelium is often described as being keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

If you zoom on the cells at the outermost layer of this section of skin, what do you notice about the cells? Stratum Basale Thestratum basale(also called the stratum germinativum) is the deepest epidermal layer and attaches the epidermis
