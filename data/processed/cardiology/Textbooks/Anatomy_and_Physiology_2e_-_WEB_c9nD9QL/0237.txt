There are many cases in which cells are prone to tension, such as when epithelial cells of the skin are compressed, tugging them in different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor organelles together within a cell and also link cells to other cells by forming special cell-to-cell junctions. 3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the structure and features of the nuclear membrane • List the contents of the nucleus • Explain the organization of the DNA molecule within the nucleus • Describe the process of DNA replication The nucleus is the largest and most prominent of a cell’s organelles (Figure 3.19). The nucleus is generally considered the control center of the cell because it stores all of the genetic instructions for manufacturing proteins. Interestingly, some cells in the body, such as muscle cells, contain more than one nucleus (Figure 3.20), which is known as multinucleated. Other cells, such as mammalian red blood cells (RBCs), do not contain nuclei at all. RBCs eject their nuclei as they mature, making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen throughout the body (Figure 3.21). Without nuclei,
