Anatomy and Physiology

well as larger atoms The human body is composed of elements, the most with eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to abundant of which are oxygen (O), carbon (C), participate in chemical reactions because they are hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N). You obtain these stable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share elements from the foods you eat and the air you electrons in a process that brings the electrons in their breathe. The smallest unit of an element that retains all valence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to of the properties of that element is an atom. But, two). atoms themselves contain many subatomic particles, the three most important of which are protons, 2.2Chemical Bonds neutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, quality from one element to another; rather, what gives hydrogen, and the other elements of the human body an element its distinctive identification is the quantity are making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions are of its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and charged atoms that form when an atom donates or neutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s
