new molecule, which acts as the intracellular mediator of the signal that binds to the receptor. This intracellular mediator is called the second messenger. Different receptors use different second messengers. Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP ). The enzyme adenylate cyclase (an example of an 3 effector protein) makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP . Second messengers, after they 3 are produced by the effector protein, cause metabolic changes within the cell. These changes are most likely the activation of other enzymes in the cell. In neurons, they often modify ion channels, either opening or closing them. These enzymes can also cause changes in the cell, such as the activation of genes in the nucleus, and therefore the increased synthesis of proteins. In neurons, these kinds of changes are often the basis of stronger connections Access for free at openstax.org 12.5 • Communication Between Neurons 481 between cells at the synapse and may be the basis of learning and memory. FIGURE12.28 Receptor Types (a) An ionotropic receptor is a channel that opens when the neurotransmitter binds to it. (b) A metabotropic receptor is a complex that
