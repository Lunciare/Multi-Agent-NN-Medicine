• The Appendicular Skeleton Like the upper limb, the lower limb is divided into three regions. Thethighis that portion of the lower limb located between the hip joint and knee joint. Thelegis specifically the region between the knee joint and the ankle joint. Distal to the ankle is thefoot. The lower limb contains 30 bones. These are the femur, patella, tibia, fibula, tarsal bones, metatarsal bones, and phalanges (seeFigure 8.2). Thefemuris the single bone of the thigh. Thepatellais the kneecap and articulates with the distal femur. Thetibiais the larger, weight-bearing bone located on the medial side of the leg, and thefibulais the thin bone of the lateral leg. The bones of the foot are divided into three groups. The posterior portion of the foot is formed by a group of seven bones, each of which is known as atarsal bone, whereas the mid-foot contains five elongated bones, each of which is ametatarsal bone. The toes contain 14 small bones, each of which is aphalanx bone of the foot. Femur The femur, or thigh bone, is the single bone of the thigh region (Figure 8.16). It is the longest and strongest bone of the body, and accounts for approximately one-quarter of
