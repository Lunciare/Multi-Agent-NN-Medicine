Anatomy and Physiology

opposite eye elicits a normal, bilateral response, the damage is associated with the optic nerve on the nonresponsive side. If light in either eye elicits a response in only one eye, the problem is with the oculomotor system. If light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is intact, which means that the right oculomotor nerve (or Edinger–Westphal nucleus) is damaged. Damage to the right oculomotor connections will be evident when light is shined in the left eye. In that case, the direct reflex is intact but the consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil will constrict while the right does not. 644 16 • The Neurological Exam 16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the arrangement of sensory and motor regions in the spinal cord • Relate damage in the spinal cord to sensory or motor deficits • Differentiate between upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron diseases • Describe the clinical indications of common reflexes Connections between the body and the CNS occur through the spinal cord.
