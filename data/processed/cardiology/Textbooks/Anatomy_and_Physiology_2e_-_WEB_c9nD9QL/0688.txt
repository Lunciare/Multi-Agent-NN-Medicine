the hand from the anterior forearm. The walls and floor of the carpal tunnel are formed by the U-shaped grouping of the carpal bones, and the roof is formed by the flexor retinaculum, a strong ligament that anteriorly unites the bones. Metacarpal Bones The palm of the hand contains five elongated metacarpal bones. These bones lie between the carpal bones of the wrist and the bones of the fingers and thumb (seeFigure 8.7). The proximal end of each metacarpal bone articulates with one of the distal carpal bones. Each of these articulations is acarpometacarpal joint(seeFigure 8.8). The expanded distal end of each metacarpal bone articulates at themetacarpophalangeal jointwith the proximal Access for free at openstax.org 8.2 • Bones of the Upper Limb 283 phalanx bone of the thumb or one of the fingers. The distal end also forms the knuckles of the hand, at the base of the fingers. The metacarpal bones are numbered 1–5, beginning at the thumb. The first metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb, is separated from the other metacarpal bones. This allows it a freedom of motion that is independent of the other metacarpal bones, which is very important for thumb mobility. The remaining
