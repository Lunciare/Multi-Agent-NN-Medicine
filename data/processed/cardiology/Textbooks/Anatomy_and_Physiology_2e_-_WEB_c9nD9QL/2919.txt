urine when it reaches the collecting duct. Thus, the movement of Na+and urea into the interstitial spaces by these mechanisms creates the hyperosmotic environment of the medulla. The net result of this countercurrent multiplier system is to recover both water and Na+in the circulation. The amino acid glutamine can be deaminated by the kidney. As NH from the amino acid is converted into NH and 2 3 pumped into the lumen of the PCT, Na+and HCO –are excreted into the interstitial fluid of the renal pyramid via a 3 symport mechanism. When this process occurs in the cells of the PCT, the added benefit is a net loss of a hydrogen ion (complexed to ammonia to form the weak acid NH +) in the urine and a gain of a bicarbonate ion (HCO –) in the 4 3 blood. Ammonia and bicarbonate are exchanged in a one-to-one ratio. This exchange is yet another means by which the body can buffer and excrete acid. The presence of aquaporin channels in the descending loop allows prodigious 1136 25 • The Urinary System quantities of water to leave the loop and enter the hyperosmolar interstitium of the pyramid, where it is returned to
