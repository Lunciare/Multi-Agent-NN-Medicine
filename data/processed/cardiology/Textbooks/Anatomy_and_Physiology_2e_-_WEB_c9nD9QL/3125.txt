Some researchers believe that the age group tested in the 2002 trial may have been too old to benefit from the therapy, thus skewing the results. In the meantime, intense debate and study of the benefits and risks of replacement therapy is ongoing. Current guidelines approve HT for the reduction of hot flashes or flushes, but this treatment is generally only considered when people first start showing signs of menopausal changes, is used in the lowest dose possible for the shortest time possible (5 years or less), and it is suggested that people on HT have regular pelvic and breast exams. 27.3 Development of the Male and Female Reproductive Systems LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how bipotential tissues are directed to develop into male or female sex organs • Name the rudimentary
