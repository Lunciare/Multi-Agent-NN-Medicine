While forensic pathologists are responsible for determining whether the cause of someone’s death was natural, by suicide, accidental, or by homicide, there are times when uncovering the cause of death is more complex, and other skills are needed. Forensic anthropology brings the tools and knowledge of physical anthropology and human osteology (the study of the skeleton) to the task of investigating a death.
