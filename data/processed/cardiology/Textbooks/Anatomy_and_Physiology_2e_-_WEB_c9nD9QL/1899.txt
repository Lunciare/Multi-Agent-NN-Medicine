At the end of their lifecycle, they are destroyed by macrophages, and their components are recycled. Disorders of Erythrocytes The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a person’s health. When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is deficient, the general condition is calledanemia. There are more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. Anemia 726 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood can be broken down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the morphological approach examines the
