Anatomy and Physiology

are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are the smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid determined and synthesized. When replication is synthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly completed, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each responsible for protein synthesis using its associated one contains one original strand and one newly ribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins synthesized complementary strand. to the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and packaged for delivery to various locations within or 3.4Protein Synthesis outside of the cell. Some of these protein products are DNA stores the information necessary for instructing enzymes destined to break down unwanted material the cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the and are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell. genetic code stored within DNA to build proteins, Cells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, which ultimately determine the structure and function which are the organelles responsible for producing the of the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular cell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals, sequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along respectively.
