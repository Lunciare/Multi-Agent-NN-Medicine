knee resists excessive eversion of the foot. The lateral ankle extension and flexion. During these movements, the is supported by the anterior and posterior talofibular condyles of the femur both roll and glide over the ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament. These surface of the tibia. As the knee comes into full support the ankle joint and also resist excess inversion extension, a slight medial rotation of the femur serves of the foot. An inversion ankle sprain, a common injury, to “lock” the knee into its most stable, weight-bearing will result in injury to one or more of these lateral ankle position. The reverse motion, a small lateral rotation of ligaments. the femur, is required to initiate knee flexion. When the 9.7Development of Joints knee is flexed, some rotation of the leg is available. During embryonic growth, bones and joints develop Two extrinsic ligaments, the tibial collateral ligament from mesenchyme, an embryonic tissue that gives rise on the medial side and the fibular collateral ligament to bone, cartilage, and fibrous connective tissues. In on the lateral side, serve to resist hyperextension or the skull, the bones develop either directly from rotation of the extended knee joint. Two intracapsular mesenchyme through the
