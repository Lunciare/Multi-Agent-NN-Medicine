All of these procedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and underlying collagen tissue to make it look more natural. Bedsores and Stretch Marks Skin and its underlying tissue can be affected by excessive pressure. One example of this is called abedsore. Bedsores, also called decubitis ulcers, are caused by constant, long-term, unrelieved pressure on certain body parts that are bony, reducing blood flow to the area and leading to necrosis (tissue death). Bedsores are most common in elderly patients who have debilitating conditions that cause them to be immobile.
