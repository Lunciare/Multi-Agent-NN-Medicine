the vertebral foramina of all of the vertebrae align to form thevertebral (spinal) canal, which serves as the bony protection and passageway for the spinal cord down the back. When the vertebrae are aligned together in the vertebral column, notches in the margins of the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae together form anintervertebral foramen, the opening through which a spinal nerve exits from the vertebral column (Figure 7.24). Seven processes arise from the vertebral arch. Each pairedtransverse processprojects laterally and arises from the junction point between the pedicle and lamina. The singlespinous process(vertebral spine) projects posteriorly at the midline of the back. The vertebral spines can easily be felt as a series of bumps just under the skin down the middle of the back. The transverse and spinous processes serve as important muscle attachment sites. Asuperior articular processextends or faces upward, and aninferior articular processfaces or projects downward on each side of a vertebrae. The paired superior articular processes of one vertebra join with the corresponding paired inferior articular processes from the next higher vertebra. These junctions form slightly moveable joints between the adjacent vertebrae. The shape and orientation of the articular processes vary in different regions of the vertebral column
