not contract and thus begin to lose structural proteins. Exercising these muscles can help to restore muscle function and minimize functional impairments. Age-related muscle loss is also a target of physical therapy, as exercise can reduce the effects of age-related atrophy and improve muscle function. The goal of a physiotherapist is to improve physical functioning and reduce functional impairments; this is achieved by understanding the cause of muscle impairment and assessing the capabilities of a patient, after which a program to enhance these capabilities is designed. Some factors that are assessed include strength, balance, and endurance, which are continually monitored as exercises are introduced to track improvements in muscle function. Physiotherapists can also instruct patients on the proper use of equipment, such as crutches, and assess whether someone has sufficient strength to use the equipment and when they can function without it. 388 10 • Key Terms Key Terms acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter that binds at a from motor neuron signaling to a skeletal muscle motor end-plate to trigger depolarization fiber to contraction of the fiber’s sarcomeres actin protein that makes up most of the thin extensibility ability to lengthen (extend) myofilaments in a sarcomere muscle fiber fascicle bundle of muscle
