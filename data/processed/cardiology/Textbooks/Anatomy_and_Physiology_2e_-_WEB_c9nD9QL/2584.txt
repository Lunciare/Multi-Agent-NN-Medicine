Anatomy and Physiology

from the lungs to other tissues throughout the potential volume of the lungs. The greater the volume body. The function of the pulmonary circulation is to of the lungs, the lower the air pressure within the aid in gas exchange. The pulmonary artery provides lungs. deoxygenated blood to the capillaries that form Pulmonary ventilation consists of the process of respiratory membranes with the alveoli, and the inspiration (or inhalation), where air enters the lungs, pulmonary veins return newly oxygenated blood to the and expiration (or exhalation), where air leaves the heart for further transport throughout the body. The lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm and external lungs are innervated by the parasympathetic and intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to sympathetic nervous systems, which coordinate the expand and move outward, and expanding the thoracic bronchodilation and bronchoconstriction of the cavity and lung volume. This creates a lower pressure airways. The lungs are enclosed by the pleura, a within the lung than that of the atmosphere, causing air membrane that is composed of visceral and parietal to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration, the pleural layers. The space between these two layers is diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax
