and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers. Sinoatrial (SA) Node Normal cardiac rhythm is established by thesinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized clump of myocardial conducting cells located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the orifice of the superior vena cava. The SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization and is known as thepacemakerof the heart. It initiates thesinus rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart. This impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria through specializedinternodal pathways, to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node. The internodal pathways consist of three bands (anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to the next node in the conduction system, the atrioventricular node (seeFigure 19.18). The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there is a specialized pathway calledBachmann’s bundleor the interatrial bandthat conducts the impulse directly from the
