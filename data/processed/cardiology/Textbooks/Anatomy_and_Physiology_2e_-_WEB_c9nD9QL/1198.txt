When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca2+channels in the membrane of the synaptic end bulb open. The concentration of Ca2+increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca2+ion associates with proteins in the outer surface of neurotransmitter vesicles. The Ca2+facilitates the merging of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane so that the neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis into the small gap between the cells, known as thesynaptic cleft. Once in the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance to the postsynaptic membrane and can interact with neurotransmitter receptors. Receptors are specific for the neurotransmitter, and the two fit together like a key and lock. One neurotransmitter binds to its receptor and will not bind to receptors for other neurotransmitters, making the binding a specific chemical event (Figure 12.27).

The presynaptic element is the synaptic end bulb of the axon where Ca2+enters the bulb to cause vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to its receptor. The neurotransmitter is
