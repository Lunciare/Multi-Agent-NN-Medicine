Anatomy and Physiology

types of aquaporins are known in humans, and six of those are found in the kidney. The function of all aquaporins is to allow the movement of water across the lipid-rich, hydrophobic cell membrane (Figure 25.15). FIGURE25.15 Aquaporin Water Channel Positive charges inside the channel prevent the leakage of electrolytes across the cell membrane, while allowing water to move due to osmosis. 25.5 Physiology of Urine Formation LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor and oppose filtration • Describe glomerular filtration rate (GFR), state the average value of GFR, and explain how clearance rate can be used to measure GFR • Predict specific factors that will increase or decrease GFR • State the percent of the filtrate that is normally reabsorbed and explain why the process of reabsorption is so important • Calculate daily urine production • List common symptoms of kidney failure Having reviewed the anatomy and microanatomy of the urinary system, now is the time to focus on the physiology. You will discover that different parts of the nephron utilize specific processes to produce urine: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. You will learn
