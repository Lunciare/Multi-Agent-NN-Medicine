sympathomimetic drugs. Drugs such as autonomic system has on the heart is not the same as phenylephrine bind to the adrenergic receptors and for other systems. Other organs have smooth muscle or stimulate target organs just as sympathetic activity glandular tissue that is activated or inhibited by the would. Other drugs are sympatholytic because they autonomic system. Cardiac muscle is intrinsically block adrenergic activity and cancel the sympathetic active and is modulated by the autonomic system. The influence on the target organ. Drugs that act on the contradictory signals do not just cancel each other out, parasympathetic system also work by either enhancing they alter the regularity of the heart rate and can cause the postganglionic signal or blocking it. A muscarinic arrhythmias. Both hypertension and arrhythmias are agonist (or parasympathomimetic drug) acts just like risk factors for heart disease. ACh released by the parasympathetic postganglionic fiber. Anticholinergic drugs block muscarinic receptors, Other drugs affect one division of the autonomic suppressing parasympathetic interaction with the system or the other. The sympathetic system is organ. affected by drugs that mimic the actions of adrenergic molecules (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and are Interactive Link Questions 1. Watch thisvideo( 3.
