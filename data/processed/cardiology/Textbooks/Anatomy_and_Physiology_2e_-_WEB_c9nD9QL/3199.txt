Anatomy and Physiology

of the three stages of childbirth A full-term pregnancy lasts approximately 270 days (approximately 38.5 weeks) from conception to birth. Because it is easier to remember the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) than to estimate the date of conception, obstetricians set the due date as 284 days (approximately 40.5 weeks) from the LMP. This assumes that conception occurred on day 14 of the menstrual cycle, which is usually a good approximation. The 40 weeks of an average pregnancy are usually discussed in terms of threetrimesters, each approximately 13 weeks. During the second and third trimesters, the pre-pregnancy uterus—about the size of a fist—grows dramatically to contain the fetus, causing a number of anatomical changes in the pregnant person (Figure 28.18). 1244 28 • Development and Inheritance FIGURE28.18 Size of Uterus throughout Pregnancy The uterus grows throughout pregnancy to accommodate the fetus. Effects of Hormones Virtually all of the effects of pregnancy can be attributed in some way to the influence of hormones—particularly estrogens, progesterone, and hCG. During weeks 7–12 from the LMP, the pregnancy hormones are primarily generated by the corpus luteum. Progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum stimulates the production of decidual cells of the endometrium
