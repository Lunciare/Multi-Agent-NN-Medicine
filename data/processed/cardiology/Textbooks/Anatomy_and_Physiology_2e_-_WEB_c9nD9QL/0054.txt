It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain and the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the size of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of radiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of developing cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans. INTERACTIVE LINK A CT or CAT scan relies on a circling scanner that revolves around the patient’s body. Watch thisvideo ( learn more about CT and CAT scans. What type of radiation does a CT scanner use? Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear physics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves
