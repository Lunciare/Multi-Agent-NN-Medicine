Antibody Structures All antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. (Some antibodies contain multiple units of this four-chain structure.) TheFc regionof the antibody is formed by the two heavy chains coming together, usually linked by disulfide bonds (Figure 21.21). The Fc portion of the antibody is important in that many 922 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System effector cells of the immune system have Fc receptors. Cells having these receptors can then bind to antibody- coated pathogens, greatly increasing the specificity of the effector cells. At the other end of the molecule are two identical antigen-binding sites. FIGURE21.21 Antibody and IgG2 Structures The typical four chain structure of a generic antibody (a) and the corresponding three- dimensional structure of the antibody IgG2 (b). (credit b: modification of work by Tim Vickers) Five Classes of Antibodies and their Functions In general, antibodies have two basic functions. They can act as the B cell antigen receptor or they can be secreted, circulate, and bind to a pathogen, often labeling it for identification by other forms of the immune response. Of the five antibody classes, notice that only two can function as the antigen receptor for naïve
