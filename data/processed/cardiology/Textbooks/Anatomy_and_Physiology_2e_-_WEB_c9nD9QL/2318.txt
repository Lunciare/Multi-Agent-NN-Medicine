smooth muscle in a lambdoid suture that drain the occipital, sagittal, blood vessel and straight sinuses, and leads to the sigmoid vascular tubes rudimentary blood vessels in a sinuses developing fetus trunk large vessel that gives rise to smaller vessels vasoconstriction constriction of the smooth muscle tunica externa (also, tunica adventitia) outermost of a blood vessel, resulting in a decreased vascular layer or tunic of a vessel (except capillaries) diameter tunica intima (also, tunica interna) innermost lining vasodilation relaxation of the smooth muscle in the or tunic of a vessel wall of a blood vessel, resulting in an increased tunica media middle layer or tunic of a vessel (except vascular diameter capillaries) vasomotion irregular, pulsating flow of blood through ulnar artery formed at the bifurcation of the brachial capillaries and related structures artery; parallels the ulna; gives off smaller branches vein blood vessel that conducts blood toward the until it reaches the carpal region where it fuses with heart the radial artery to form the superficial and deep venous reserve volume of blood contained within palmar arches; supplies blood to the lower arm and systemic veins in the integument, bone marrow, and carpal region liver that can be returned to
