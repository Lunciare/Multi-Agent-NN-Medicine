Anatomy and Physiology

for bone resorption, or breakdown, is theosteoclast. They are found on bone surfaces, are multinucleated, and originate from monocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cells, not from osteogenic cells. Osteoclasts are continually breaking down old bone while osteoblasts are continually forming new bone. The ongoing balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is responsible for the constant but subtle reshaping of bone.Table 6.3reviews the bone cells, their functions, and locations. Bone Cells Cell type Function Location Osteogenic Develop into osteoblasts Deep layers of the periosteum and the marrow cells Growing portions of bone, including periosteum and Osteoblasts Bone formation endosteum TABLE6.3 202 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System Cell type Function Location Maintain mineral concentration of Osteocytes Entrapped in matrix matrix Bone surfaces and at sites of old, injured, or unneeded Osteoclasts Bone resorption bone TABLE6.3 Compact and Spongy Bone The differences between compact and spongy bone are best explored via their histology. Most bones contain compact and spongy osseous tissue, but their distribution and concentration vary based on the bone’s overall function. Compact bone is dense so that it can withstand compressive forces, while spongy (cancellous) bone has open spaces and supports shifts in weight distribution. Compact
