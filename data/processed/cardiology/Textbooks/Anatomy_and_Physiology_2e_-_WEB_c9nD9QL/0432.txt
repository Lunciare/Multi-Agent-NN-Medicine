Additionally, invasive techniques include collagen injections to plump the tissue and injections of BOTOX®(the name brand of the botulinum neurotoxin) that paralyze the muscles that crease the skin and cause wrinkling. Vitamin D Synthesis The epidermal layer of human skin synthesizesvitamin Dwhen exposed to UV radiation. In the presence of sunlight, a form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol is synthesized from a derivative of the steroid cholesterol in the 3 skin. The liver converts cholecalciferol to calcidiol, which is then converted to calcitriol (the active chemical form of the vitamin) in the kidneys. Vitamin D is essential for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, which are required for healthy bones. The absence of sun exposure can lead to a lack of vitamin D in the body, leading to a condition calledrickets, a painful condition in children where the bones are misshapen due to a lack of calcium, causing bowleggedness. Elderly individuals who suffer from vitamin D deficiency can develop a condition called osteomalacia, a softening of the bones.
