3 • The Cellular Level of Organization The Cell Cycle One “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. Interphaseis the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase most of the time.Mitosisis the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new, fully functional, nuclei are formed.Cytokinesisdivides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells. Interphase A cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G (Figure 3.30).G 1 1 phase(gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G is followed 1 by replication of the DNA, during the S phase. TheS phase(synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates its DNA. FIGURE3.30 Cell Cycle The two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase, when the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2phases. After the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G phase. TheG
