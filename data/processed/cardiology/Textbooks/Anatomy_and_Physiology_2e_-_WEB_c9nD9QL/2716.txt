glucose;maltasebreaks down maltose and maltotriose into two and three glucose molecules, respectively; and lactasebreaks down lactose into one molecule of glucose and one molecule of galactose. Insufficient lactase can lead to lactose intolerance. FIGURE23.29 Carbohydrate Digestion Flow Chart Carbohydrates are broken down into their monomers in a series of steps. Protein Digestion Proteins are polymers composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds to form long chains. Digestion reduces them to their constituent amino acids. You usually consume about 15 to 20 percent of your total calorie intake as protein.

Chemical digestion in the small intestine is continued by pancreatic enzymes, including chymotrypsin and trypsin, each of which act on specific bonds in amino acid sequences. At the same time, the cells of the brush border secrete enzymes such asaminopeptidaseand dipeptidase, which further break down peptide chains. This results in molecules small enough to enter the bloodstream (Figure 23.31). FIGURE23.30 Digestion of Protein The digestion of protein begins in
