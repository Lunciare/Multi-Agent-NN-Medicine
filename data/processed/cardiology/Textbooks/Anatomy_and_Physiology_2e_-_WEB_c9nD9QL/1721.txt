on the basis of The prefrontal cortex contains structures important for the function that is lost. Damage from acute injuries planning, judgment, reasoning, and working memory. such as strokes may result in specific functions being Damage to these areas can result in changes to lost, whereas broader effects in infection or personality, mood, and behavior. The famous case of developmental disorders may result in general losses Phineas Gage suggests a role for this cortex in across an entire section of the neurological exam. personality, as does the outdated practice of prefrontal lobectomy. 16.2The Mental Status Exam 16.3The Cranial Nerve Exam The cerebrum, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the location of important cognitive functions that are the The cranial nerves can be separated into four major focus of the mental status exam. The regionalization of groups associated with the subtests of the cranial the cortex, initially described on the basis of nerve exam. First are the sensory nerves, then the anatomical evidence of cytoarchitecture, reveals the nerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the distribution of functionally distinct areas. Cortical oral cavity and superior pharynx, and the nerve that regions can be described as primary sensory or motor controls movements
