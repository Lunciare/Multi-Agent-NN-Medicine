Anatomy and Physiology

upper teeth is the alveolar process of the maxilla(Figure 7.14). Each tooth is anchored into a deep socket called an alveolus. On the anterior maxilla, just below the orbit, is the infraorbital foramen. This is the point of exit for a sensory nerve that supplies the nose, upper lip, and anterior cheek. On the inferior skull, thepalatine processfrom each maxillary bone can be seen joining together at the midline to form the anterior three-quarters of the hard palate (seeFigure 7.8a). Thehard palateis the bony plate that forms the roof of the mouth and floor of the nasal cavity, separating the oral and nasal cavities.

Each maxilla also forms the lateral floor of each orbit and the majority of the hard palate. Palatine Bone Thepalatine boneis one of a pair of irregularly shaped bones that contribute small areas to the lateral walls of the nasal cavity and the medial wall of each orbit. The largest region of each of the palatine bone is thehorizontal plate. The plates from the right and left palatine bones join together
