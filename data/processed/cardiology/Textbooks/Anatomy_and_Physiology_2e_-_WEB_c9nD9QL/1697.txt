Anatomy and Physiology

all point to a role in the motor system. Location and Connections of the Cerebellum The cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the brain stem, centered on the pons. The name of the pons is derived from its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to the thick bundle of myelinated axons that form a bulge on its ventral surface. Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of the pons into the contralateral cerebellar cortex. These fibers make up themiddle cerebellar peduncle (MCP)and are the major physical connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem (Figure 16.14). Two other white matter bundles connect the cerebellum to the other regions of the brain stem. Thesuperior cerebellar peduncle (SCP)is the connection of the cerebellum to the midbrain and forebrain. Theinferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP)is the connection to the medulla. FIGURE16.14 Cerebellar Peduncles The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles, which are close to each other. The ICP arises from the medulla—specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a bulge on the ventral surface of the brain stem. The MCP is the ventral surface of the pons. The SCP
