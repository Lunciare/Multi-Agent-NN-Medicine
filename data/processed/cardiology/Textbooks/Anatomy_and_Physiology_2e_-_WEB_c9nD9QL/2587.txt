Anatomy and Physiology

participates Oxygen is primarily transported through the blood by in gas exchange, because it does not reach functional erythrocytes. These cells contain a metalloprotein alveoli. Respiratory rate is the number of breaths taken called hemoglobin, which is composed of four subunits per minute, which may change during certain diseases with a ring-like structure. Each subunit contains one or conditions. atom of iron bound to a molecule of heme. Heme binds oxygen so that each hemoglobin molecule can bind up Both respiratory rate and depth are controlled by the to four oxygen molecules. When all of the heme units in respiratory centers of the brain, which are stimulated the blood are bound to oxygen, hemoglobin is by factors such as chemical and pH changes in the considered to be saturated. Hemoglobin is partially blood. These changes are sensed by central saturated when only some heme units are bound to chemoreceptors, which are located in the brain, and oxygen. An oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation peripheral chemoreceptors, which are located in the curve is a common way to depict the relationship of aortic arch and carotid arteries. A rise in carbon dioxide how easily oxygen binds to or dissociates from or a decline in oxygen
