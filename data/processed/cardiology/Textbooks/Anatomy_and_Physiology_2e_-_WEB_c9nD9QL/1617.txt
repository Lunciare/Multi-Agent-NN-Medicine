In what order were the sections of the neurological exam tested in this video, and which section seemed to be left out? Causes of Neurological Deficits Damage to the nervous system can be limited to individual structures or can be distributed across broad areas of the brain and spinal cord. Localized, limited injury to the nervous system is most often the result of circulatory problems.

The loss of blood flow to part of the brain is known as astroke, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). There are two main types of stroke,
