Embryos The epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is develop a cartilaginous skeleton and various replaced by osseous tissue as the organ grows in membranes. During development, these are replaced length. The medullary cavity has a delicate by bone during the ossification process.

Growth hormone increases the length endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing of long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves hyaline cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate bone density. Thyroxine stimulates bone growth and enables bones to grow in length. Modeling allows promotes the synthesis of bone matrix. The sex bones to grow in diameter. Remodeling occurs as bone hormones (estrogen and testosterone) promote is resorbed and replaced by new bone.
