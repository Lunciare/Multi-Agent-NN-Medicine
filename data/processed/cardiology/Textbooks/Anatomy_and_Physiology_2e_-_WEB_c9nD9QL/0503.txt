Anatomy and Physiology

small pieces between two large segments Impacted One fragment is driven into the other, usually as a result of compression Greenstick A partial fracture in which only one side of the bone is broken Open (or A fracture in which at least one end of the broken bone tears through the skin; carries a high compound) risk of infection Closed (or A fracture in which the skin remains intact simple) TABLE6.4 Bone Repair When a bone breaks, blood flows from any vessel torn by the fracture. These vessels could be in the periosteum, osteons, and/or medullary cavity. The blood begins to clot, and about six to eight hours after the fracture, the clotting blood has formed afracture hematoma(Figure 6.21a). The disruption of blood flow to the bone results in the death of bone cells around the fracture. FIGURE6.21 Stages in Fracture Repair The healing of a bone fracture follows a series of progressive steps: (a) A fracture hematoma forms. (b) Internal and external calli form. (c) Cartilage of the calli is replaced by trabecular bone. (d) Remodeling occurs. Within about 48 hours after the fracture, chondrocytes from the endosteum have created aninternal callus(plural = calli) by secreting a fibrocartilaginous matrix
