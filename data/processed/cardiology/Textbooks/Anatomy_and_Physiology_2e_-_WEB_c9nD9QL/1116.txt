At some point in the future, will this type of technology lead to the ability to augment our nervous systems? (credit: U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons) CHAPTER OBJECTIVES After studying this chapter, you will be able to: • Name the major divisions of the nervous system, both anatomical and functional • Describe the functional and structural differences between gray matter and white matter structures • Name the parts of the multipolar neuron in order of polarity • List the types of glial cells and assign each to the proper division of the nervous system, along with their function(s) • Distinguish the major functions of
