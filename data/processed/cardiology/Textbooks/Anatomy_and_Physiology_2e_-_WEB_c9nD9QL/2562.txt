the lungs become inflated after birth Development of the respiratory system begins early in the fetus. It is a complex process that includes many structures, most of which arise from the endoderm. Towards the end of development, the fetus can be observed making breathing movements. Until birth, however, the pregnant person provides all of the oxygen to the fetus as well as removes all of the fetal carbon dioxide via the placenta. Time Line The development of the respiratory system begins at about week 4 of gestation. By week 28, enough alveoli have matured that a baby born prematurely at this time can usually breathe on its own. The respiratory system, however, is not fully developed until early childhood, when a full complement of mature alveoli is present. Weeks 4–7 Respiratory development in the embryo begins around week 4. Ectodermal tissue from the anterior head region invaginates posteriorly to form olfactory pits, which fuse with endodermal tissue of the developing pharynx. An olfactory pitis one of a pair of structures that will enlarge to become the nasal cavity. At about this same time, the lung bud forms. Thelung budis a dome-shaped structure composed of tissue that bulges from the foregut.
