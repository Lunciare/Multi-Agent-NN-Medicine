across a minute space called the synaptic cleft and bind to the receptors. The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord, with a smaller number located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face, head, and neck. These neurons have long processes, called axons, which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distances— in this case, all the way from the spinal cord to the muscle itself (which may be up to three feet away). The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form nerves, like wires bundled together in a cable. 364 10 • Muscle Tissue Signaling begins when a neuronalaction potentialtravels along the axon of a motor neuron, and then along the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ. At the NMJ, the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter, calledacetylcholine (ACh). The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the synaptic cleftand bind to ACh receptors located within themotor end-plateof the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse. Once ACh binds, a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber, causing it todepolarize, meaning
