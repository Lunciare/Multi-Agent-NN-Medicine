The liver is divided into two primary lobes: a large right lobe and a much smaller left lobe. In the right lobe, some anatomists also identify an inferior quadrate lobe and a posterior caudate lobe, which are defined by internal features.

The lesser omentum tethers the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach. Theporta
