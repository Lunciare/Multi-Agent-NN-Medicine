of the dominant tall allele. Mendel deduced that a 3:1 ratio of dominant to recessive would be produced by the random segregation of heritable factors (genes) when crossing two heterozygous pea plants. In other words, for any given gene, parents are equally likely to pass down either one of their alleles to their offspring in a haploid gamete, and the result will be expressed in a dominant–recessive pattern if both parents are heterozygous for the trait. Because of the random segregation of gametes, the laws of chance and probability come into play when predicting the likelihood of a given phenotype. Consider a cross between an individual with two dominant alleles for a trait (AA) and an individual with two recessive alleles for the same trait (aa). All of the parental gametes from the dominant individual would beA, and all of the parental gametes from the recessive individual would bea(Figure 28.25). All of the offspring of that second generation, inheriting one allele from each parent, would have the genotypeAa, and the probability of expressing the phenotype of the dominant allele would be 4 out of 4, or 100 percent. This seems simple enough, but the inheritance pattern gets interesting when the
