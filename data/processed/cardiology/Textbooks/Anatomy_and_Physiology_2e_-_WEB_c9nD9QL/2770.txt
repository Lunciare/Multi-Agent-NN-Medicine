arenicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)andflavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Their respective reduced coenzymes areNADHandFADH , which are energy-containing molecules used to transfer energy during the 2 creation of ATP. 24.2 Carbohydrate Metabolism LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the processes of glycolysis • Describe the pathway of a pyruvate molecule through the Krebs cycle • Explain the transport of electrons through the electron transport chain • Describe the process of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation • Summarize the process of gluconeogenesis Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The family of carbohydrates includes both simple and complex sugars. Glucose and fructose are examples of simple sugars, and starch, glycogen, and cellulose are all examples of complex sugars. The complex sugars are also called polysaccharidesand are made of multiplemonosaccharidemolecules. Polysaccharides serve as energy storage (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g., chitin in insects and cellulose in plants). During digestion, carbohydrates are broken down into simple, soluble sugars that can be transported across the intestinal wall into the circulatory system to be transported throughout the body. Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth with the action ofsalivary amylaseon starches
