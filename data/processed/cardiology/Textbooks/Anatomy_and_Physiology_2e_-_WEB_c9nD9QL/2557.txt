atmospheric pressure. Although the proportion of oxygen relative to gases in the atmosphere remains at 21 percent, its partial pressure decreases (Table 22.4). As a result, it is more difficult for a body to achieve the same level of oxygen saturation at high altitude than at low altitude, due to lower atmospheric pressure. In fact, hemoglobin saturation is lower at high altitudes compared to hemoglobin saturation at sea level. For example, hemoglobin saturation is about 67 percent at 19,000 feet above sea level, whereas it reaches about 98 percent at sea level. 982 22 • The Respiratory System Partial Pressure of Oxygen at Different Altitudes Altitude (feet above Atmospheric pressure Partial pressure of oxygen Example location sea level) (mm Hg) (mm Hg) New York City, New 0 760 159 York Boulder, Colorado 5000 632 133 Aspen, Colorado 8000 565 118 Pike’s Peak, Colorado 14,000 447 94 Denali (Mt.

A lower partial pressure of oxygen means that there is a smaller difference in
