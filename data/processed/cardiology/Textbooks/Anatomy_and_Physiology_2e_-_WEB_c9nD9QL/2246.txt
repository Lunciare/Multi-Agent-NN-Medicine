Anatomy and Physiology

to the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. Theinferior mesenteric arterysupplies blood to the distal segment of the large intestine, including the rectum. It arises approximately 5 cm superior to the common iliac arteries. In addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the way. These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the lumbar arteries. Eachinferior phrenic arteryis a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the inferior surface of the diaphragm. Theadrenal arterysupplies blood to the adrenal (suprarenal) glands and arises near the superior mesenteric artery. Eachrenal arterybranches approximately 2.5 cm inferior to the superior mesenteric arteries and supplies a kidney. The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left of the vertebral column and the vessel must travel a greater distance to reach its target. Renal arteries branch repeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys. Eachgonadal arterysupplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive organs, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon the
