Anatomy and Physiology

This section will examine the gross anatomy of bone first and then move on to its histology. Gross Anatomy of Bone The structure of a long bone allows for the best visualization of all of the parts of a bone (Figure 6.7). A long bone has two parts: thediaphysisand theepiphysis. The diaphysis is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal and distal ends of the bone. The hollow region in the diaphysis is called themedullary cavity, which is filled with yellow marrow. The walls of the diaphysis are composed of dense and hardcompact bone. FIGURE6.7 Anatomy of a Long Bone A typical long bone shows the gross anatomical characteristics of bone. The wider section at each end of the bone is called the epiphysis (plural = epiphyses), which is filled with spongy bone. Red marrow fills the spaces in the spongy bone. Each epiphysis meets the diaphysis at the metaphysis, the narrow area that contains theepiphyseal plate(growth plate), a layer of hyaline (transparent) cartilage in a growing bone. When the bone stops growing in early adulthood (approximately 18–21 years), the cartilage is replaced by osseous tissue and the epiphyseal plate becomes an epiphyseal line. The medullary cavity has a
