Anatomy and Physiology

getting a walk to first base. Or maybe the batter’s team is so far ahead, it would be fun to just swing away. Controlling the Body The nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of a functional difference in responses. The somatic nervous system (SNS)is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses. Voluntary motor response means the contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always voluntary in the sense that you have to want to perform them. Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen without a conscious decision to perform them. If your friend jumps out from behind a corner and yells “Boo!” you will be startled and you might scream or leap back. You didn’t decide to do that, and you may not have wanted to give your friend a reason to laugh at your expense, but it is a reflex involving skeletal muscle contractions. Other motor responses become automatic (in other words, unconscious) as a person learns motor skills (referred to as “habit learning” or “procedural memory”). Theautonomic nervous system (ANS)is responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of homeostasis (regulation of the internal
