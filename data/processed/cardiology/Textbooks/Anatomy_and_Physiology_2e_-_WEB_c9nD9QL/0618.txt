the sternum. Instead, each rib ends in acostal cartilage. These cartilages are made of hyaline cartilage and can extend for several inches. Most ribs are then attached, either directly or indirectly, to the sternum via their costal cartilage (seeFigure 7.32). The ribs are classified into three groups based on their relationship to the sternum. Ribs 1–7 are classified astrue ribs(vertebrosternal ribs). The costal cartilage from each of these ribs attaches directly to the sternum. Ribs 8–12 are calledfalse ribs(vertebrochondral ribs). The costal cartilages from these ribs do not attach directly to the sternum. For ribs 8–10, the costal cartilages are attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib. Thus, the cartilage of rib 10 attaches to the cartilage of rib 9, rib 9 then attaches to rib 8, and rib 8 is attached to rib 7. The last two false ribs (11–12) are also calledfloating ribs(vertebral ribs). These are short ribs that do not attach to the sternum at all. Instead, their small costal cartilages terminate within the musculature of the lateral abdominal wall. 7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the two types
