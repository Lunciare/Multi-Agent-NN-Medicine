exterior to cells; hypophosphatemia abnormally low blood phosphate includes the interstitial fluid, blood plasma, and levels fluids found in other reservoirs in the body interstitial fluid (IF) fluid in the small spaces fluid compartment fluid inside all cells of the body between cells not contained within blood vessels constitutes a compartment system that is largely intracellular fluid (ICF) fluid in the cytosol of cells segregated from other systems metabolic acidosis condition wherein a deficiency of hydrostatic pressure pressure exerted by a fluid bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly acidic against a wall, caused by its own weight or pumping metabolic alkalosis condition wherein an excess of force bicarbonate causes the blood to be overly alkaline hypercalcemia abnormally increased blood levels of plasma osmolality ratio of solutes to a volume of calcium solvent in the plasma; plasma osmolality reflects a hypercapnia abnormally elevated blood levels of CO person’s state of hydration 2 hyperchloremia higher-than-normal blood chloride respiratory acidosis condition wherein an excess of levels carbonic acid or CO causes the blood to be overly 2 hyperkalemia higher-than-normal blood potassium acidic levels respiratory alkalosis condition wherein a deficiency hypernatremia abnormal increase in blood sodium of carbonic acid/CO levels causes the blood
