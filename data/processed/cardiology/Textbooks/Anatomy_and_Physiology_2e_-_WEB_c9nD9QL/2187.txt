Anatomy and Physiology

Additionally, as air pressure within the thorax drops, blood pressure in the thoracic veins also decreases, falling below the pressure in the abdominal veins. This causes blood to flow along its pressure gradient from veins outside the thorax, where pressure is higher, into the thoracic region, where pressure is now lower. This in turn promotes the return of blood from the thoracic veins to the atria. During exhalation, when air pressure increases within the thoracic cavity, pressure in the thoracic veins increases, speeding blood flow into the heart while valves in the veins prevent blood from flowing backward from the thoracic and abdominal veins. Pressure Relationships in the Venous System Although vessel diameter increases from the smaller venules to the larger veins and eventually to the venae cavae (singular = vena cava), the total cross-sectional area actually decreases (seeFigure 20.15aandb). The individual veins are larger in diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower. Also notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (seeFigure 20.15c), but the blood velocity actually increases (seeFigure 20.15). This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart. Again,
