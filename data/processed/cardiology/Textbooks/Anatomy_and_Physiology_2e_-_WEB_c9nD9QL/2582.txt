of the lung that are directly involved in alveolar pressures is called transpulmonary pressure. gas exchange: the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. In addition, intra-alveolar pressure will equalize with the atmospheric pressure. Pressure is determined by The lining of the conducting zone is composed mostly the volume of the space occupied by a gas and is of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with influenced by resistance. Air flows when a pressure goblet cells. The mucus traps pathogens and debris, gradient is created, from a space of higher pressure to whereas beating cilia move the mucus superiorly a space of lower pressure. Boyle’s law describes the toward the throat, where it is swallowed. As the relationship between volume and pressure. A gas is at bronchioles become smaller and smaller, and nearer lower pressure in a larger volume because the gas the alveoli, the epithelium thins and is simple molecules have more space to in which to move. The squamous epithelium in the alveoli. The endothelium same quantity of gas in a smaller volume results in gas of the surrounding capillaries, together with the molecules crowding together, producing increased alveolar epithelium, forms the respiratory membrane. pressure. This is a blood-air barrier through which gas
