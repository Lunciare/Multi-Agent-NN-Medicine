as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis. Thus, 12 both are critical for the synthesis of new cells, including erythrocytes. Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid phagocytic cell called amacrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The components of the degraded erythrocytes’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows: • Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone marrow to be used in the production of new erythrocytes. Hemoglobin that is not phagocytized is broken down in the circulation, releasing alpha and beta chains that are removed from circulation by the kidneys. • The iron contained in the heme portion of hemoglobin may be stored in the liver or spleen, primarily in the form of ferritin or hemosiderin, or carried through the bloodstream by transferrin to the red bone marrow for recycling into new erythrocytes. • The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste productbiliverdin, a green pigment, and then into another waste product,bilirubin, a yellow pigment. Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the liver, which
