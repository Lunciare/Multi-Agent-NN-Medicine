that are activated in the cell membrane. Types of Graded Potentials For the unipolar cells of sensory neurons—both those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulations—graded potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell. This is called agenerator potential. For other sensory receptor cells, such as taste cells or photoreceptors of the retina, graded potentials in their membranes result in the release of neurotransmitters at synapses with sensory neurons. This is called areceptor potential.

Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is called anexcitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)because it causes the membrane potential to move toward threshold. Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is aninhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)because it causes the membrane potential to move away from threshold. Summation All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of a membrane. These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together,
