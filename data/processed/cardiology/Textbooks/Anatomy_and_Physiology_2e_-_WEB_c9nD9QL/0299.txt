Anatomy and Physiology

These differences in gene expression ultimately dictate Once a cell has completed interphase and is ready for a cell’s unique morphological and physiological cell division, it proceeds through four separate stages characteristics. The primary mechanism that of mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and determines which genes will be expressed and which telophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the ones will not is through the use of different cytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter transcription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and cells. This process takes place in all normally dividing promote or hinder the transcription of different genes. cells of the body except for the germ cells that produce Through the action of these transcription factors, cells eggs and sperm. specialize into one of hundreds of different cell types in the human body.
