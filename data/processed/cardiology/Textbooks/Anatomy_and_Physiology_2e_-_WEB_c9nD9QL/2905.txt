Anatomy and Physiology

of glucose and, in certain situations, Na+ions, is an example of facilitated diffusion. In some cases of mediated transport, two different substances share the same channel protein port; these mechanisms are described by the terms symport and antiport. Symport mechanisms move two or more substances in the same direction at the same time, whereas antiport mechanisms move two or more substances in opposite directions across the cell membrane. Both mechanisms may utilize concentration gradients maintained by ATP pumps. As described previously, when active transport powers the transport of another substance in this way, it is called “secondary active transport.” Glucose reabsorption in the kidneys is by secondary active transport. Na+/K+ATPases on the basal membrane of a tubular cell constantly pump Na+out of the cell, maintaining a strong electrochemical gradient for Na+to move into the cell from the tubular lumen. On the luminal (apical) surface, a Na+/glucose symport protein assists both Na+ and glucose movement into the cell. The cotransporter moves glucose into the cell against its concentration gradient as Na+moves down the electrochemical gradient created by the basal membranes Na+/K+ATPases. The glucose molecule then diffuses across the basal membrane by facilitated diffusion into the interstitial space and from there into
