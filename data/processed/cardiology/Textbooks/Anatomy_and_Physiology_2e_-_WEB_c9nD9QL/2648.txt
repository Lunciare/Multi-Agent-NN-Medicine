Anatomy and Physiology

Esophagus Theesophagusis a muscular tube that connects the pharynx to the stomach. It is approximately 25.4 cm (10 in) in 1014 23 • The Digestive System length, located posterior to the trachea, and remains in a collapsed form when not engaged in swallowing. As you can see inFigure 23.13, the esophagus runs a mainly straight route through the mediastinum of the thorax. To enter the abdomen, the esophagus penetrates the diaphragm through an opening called the esophageal hiatus. Passage of Food through the Esophagus Theupper esophageal sphincter, which is continuous with the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, controls the movement of food from the pharynx into the esophagus. The upper two-thirds of the esophagus consists of both smooth and skeletal muscle fibers, with the latter fading out in the bottom third of the esophagus. Rhythmic waves of peristalsis, which begin in the upper esophagus, propel the bolus of food toward the stomach. Meanwhile, secretions from the esophageal mucosa lubricate the esophagus and food. Food passes from the esophagus into the stomach at thelower esophageal sphincter(also called the gastroesophageal or cardiac sphincter). Recall that sphincters are muscles that surround tubes and serve as valves, closing the tube when the sphincters contract and opening
