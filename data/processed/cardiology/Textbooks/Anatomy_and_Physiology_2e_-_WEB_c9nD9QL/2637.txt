food and initiate the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates. Small amounts of saliva are also secreted by the labial glands in the lips. In addition, the buccal glands in the cheeks, palatal glands in the palate, and lingual glands in the tongue help ensure that all areas of the mouth are supplied with adequate saliva. The Major Salivary Glands Outside the oral mucosa are three pairs of major salivary glands, which secrete the majority of saliva into ducts that open into the mouth: • Thesubmandibular glands, which are in the floor of the mouth, secrete saliva into the mouth through the submandibular ducts. • Thesublingual glands, which lie below the tongue, use the lesser sublingual ducts to secrete saliva into the oral cavity. • Theparotid glandslie between the skin and the masseter muscle, near the ears. They secrete saliva into the mouth through the parotid duct, which is located near the second upper molar tooth (Figure 23.9). Saliva Salivais essentially (98 to 99.5 percent) water. The remaining 4.5 percent is a complex mixture of ions, glycoproteins, enzymes, growth factors, and waste products. Perhaps the most important ingredient in saliva from the perspective of digestion is the enzymesalivary amylase, which initiates the
