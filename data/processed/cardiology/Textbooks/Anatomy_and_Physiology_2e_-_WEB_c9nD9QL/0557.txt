Anatomy and Physiology

the posterior midline, is a small protrusion called theexternal occipital protuberance, which serves as an attachment site for a ligament of the posterior neck. Lateral to either side of this bump is asuperior nuchal line(nuchal = “nape” or “posterior neck”). The nuchal lines represent the most superior point at which muscles of the neck attach to the skull, with only the scalp covering the skull above these lines. On the base of the skull, the occipital bone contains the large opening of theforamen magnum, which allows for passage of the spinal cord as it exits the skull. On either side of the foramen magnum is an oval-shaped occipital condyle. These condyles form joints with the first cervical vertebra and thus support the skull on top of the vertebral column. FIGURE7.9 Posterior View of Skull This view of the posterior skull shows attachment sites for muscles and joints that support the skull. Sphenoid Bone Thesphenoid boneis a single, complex bone of the central skull (Figure 7.10). It serves as a “keystone” bone, because it joins with almost every other bone of the skull. The sphenoid forms much of the base of the central skull (seeFigure 7.8) and also extends laterally to
