involuntary control. The attachment junctions hold adjacent cells together across the dynamic pressures changes of the cardiac cycle. Smooth muscletissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs. It forms the contractile component of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the airways and arteries. Each cell is spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18).

In looking through a microscope how could you distinguish skeletal muscle tissue from smooth muscle? 4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the classes of cells that make up nervous tissue • Discuss how nervous tissue mediates perception and response Nervous tissue is characterized as being excitable
