4 cross the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and be taken up by cells. The remaining 99 percent of circulating T and T 3 4 is bound to specialized transport proteins called thyroxine-binding globulins (TBGs), to albumin, or to other plasma proteins. This “packaging” prevents their free diffusion into body cells. When blood levels of T and T begin to 3 4 decline, bound T and T are released from these plasma proteins and readily cross the membrane of target cells. T 3 4 3 is more potent than T , and many cells convert T to T through the removal of an iodine atom. 4 4 3 Regulation of TH Synthesis The release of T and T from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). As shown in 3 4 Figure 17.13, low blood levels of T and T stimulate the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the 3 4 hypothalamus, which triggers secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary. In turn, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete T and T . The levels of TRH, TSH, T , and T are regulated by a negative feedback system in which 3 4 3 4 increasing levels
