Anatomy and Physiology

arises from embryonic mesoderm. of intermediate filaments involved in pulling the Somites give rise to myoblasts and fuse to form a sarcolemma toward the fiber’s middle, shortening it in myotube. The nucleus of each contributing myoblast the process. Ca++ions trigger contraction when they remains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell, are released from SR and enter through opened resulting in a mature, multinucleate cell. Satellite cells voltage-gated calcium channels. Smooth muscle help to repair skeletal muscle cells. Smooth muscle contraction is initiated when the Ca++binds to tissue can regenerate from stem cells called pericytes, intracellular calmodulin, which then activates an whereas dead cardiac muscle tissue is replaced by scar enzyme called myosin kinase that phosphorylates tissue. Aging causes muscle mass to decrease and be myosin heads so they can form the cross-bridges with replaced by noncontractile connective tissue and actin and then pull on the thin filaments. Smooth adipose tissue. muscle can be stimulated by pacesetter cells, by the Interactive Link Questions 1. Watch thisvideo( 2.
