The most superficial and visible muscle of the calf is thegastrocnemius. Deep to the gastrocnemius is the wide, flatsoleus. Theplantarisruns obliquely between the two; some people may have two of these muscles, whereas no plantaris is observed in about seven percent of other cadaver dissections. The plantaris tendon is a desirable substitute for the fascia lata in hernia repair, tendon transplants, and repair of ligaments. There are four deep muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg as well: thepopliteus,flexor digitorum longus,flexor hallucis longus, andtibialis posterior. The foot also has intrinsic muscles, which originate and insert within it (similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand). These muscles primarily provide support for the foot and its arch, and contribute to movements of the toes (Figure 11.34andFigure 11.35). The principal support for the longitudinal arch of the foot is a deep fascia calledplantar aponeurosis, which runs from the calcaneus bone to the toes (inflammation of this tissue is the cause of “plantar fasciitis,” which can affect runners. The intrinsic muscles of the foot consist of two groups. Thedorsal group includes only one muscle, theextensor digitorum brevis. The second group is theplantar group, which consists of four layers, starting with the most
