Essential to Human Chemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are Functioning broken and formed, require an initial investment of energy. Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion, Organic compounds essential to human functioning fuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and are necessary if their old bonds are to break and new nucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic ones to form. All molecules store potential energy, because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. which is released when their bonds are broken. Carbon atoms in organic compounds readily share electrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually Four forms of energy essential to human functioning oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also are: chemical energy, which is stored and released as may bond with one or more functional groups such as chemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical carboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates. energy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They energy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which electrical energy, the power of moving electrons. can in turn be broken by hydrolysis. Chemical reactions begin with
