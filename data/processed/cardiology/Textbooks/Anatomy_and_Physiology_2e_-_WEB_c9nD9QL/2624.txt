nutrients are put to work. This occurs through the process ofabsorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen of the alimentary canal into the bloodstream through the epithelial cells that make up the mucosa. Lipids are absorbed into lacteals and are transported via the lymphatic vessels to the bloodstream (the subclavian veins near the heart). The details of these processes will be discussed later. Indefecation, the final step in digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. 1004 23 • The Digestive System Aging and the...
