Anatomy and Physiology

glenohumeral (shoulder) joint is a multiaxial ball- plantar flexion of the foot. and-socket joint that provides flexion/extension, Condyloid and saddle joints are biaxial. These allow for abduction/adduction, circumduction, and medial/ flexion and extension, and abduction and adduction. lateral rotation of the humerus. The head of the The sequential combination of flexion, adduction, humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the extension, and abduction produces circumduction. scapula. The glenoid labrum extends around the Multiaxial plane joints provide for only small motions, margin of the glenoid cavity. Intrinsic ligaments, but these can add together over several adjacent joints including the coracohumeral ligament and to produce body movement, such as inversion and glenohumeral ligaments, provide some support for the eversion of the foot. Similarly, plane joints allow for shoulder joint. However, the primary support comes flexion, extension, and lateral flexion movements of the from muscles crossing the joint whose tendons form vertebral column. The multiaxial ball and socket joints the rotator cuff. These muscle tendons are protected allow for flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and from friction against the scapula by the subacromial circumduction. In addition, these also allow for medial bursa and subscapular bursa. (internal) and lateral (external) rotation. Ball-and- The elbow is a uniaxial
