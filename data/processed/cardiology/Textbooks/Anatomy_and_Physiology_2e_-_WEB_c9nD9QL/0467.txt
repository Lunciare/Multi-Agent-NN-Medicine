System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define bone, cartilage, and the skeletal system • List and describe the functions of the skeletal system Bone, orosseous tissue, is a hard, dense connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton, the support structure of the body. In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage and joints), cartilage, a semi-rigid form of connective tissue, provides flexibility and smooth surfaces for movement. The skeletal systemis the body system composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions for the human body: 192 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System • supports the body • facilitates movement • protects internal organs • produces blood cells • stores and releases minerals and fat Support, Movement, and Protection The most apparent functions of the skeletal system are the gross functions—those visible by observation. Simply by looking at a person, you can see how the bones support, facilitate movement, and protect the human body. Just as the steel beams of a building provide a scaffold to support its weight, the bones and cartilage of your skeletal system compose the scaffold
