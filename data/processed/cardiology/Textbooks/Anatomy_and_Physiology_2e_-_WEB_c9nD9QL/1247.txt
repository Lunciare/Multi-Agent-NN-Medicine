embryo to the posterior end. Beginning at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior portion becomes the spinal cord. This is the most basic arrangement of tissue in the nervous system, and it gives rise to the more complex structures by the fourth week of development. Primary Vesicles As the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the result is the production of sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins to take on a new shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are calledprimary vesicles. These vesicles are given names that are based on Greek words, the main root word beingenkephalon, which means “brain” (en- = “inside”; kephalon = “head”). The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system. Theprosencephalon(pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to meanforebrain. Themesencephalon(mes- = “middle”) is the next vesicle, which can be called themidbrain. The third vesicle at this stage is therhombencephalon. The first part of this word is also the root of
