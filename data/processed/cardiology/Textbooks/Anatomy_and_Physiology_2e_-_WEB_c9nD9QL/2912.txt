very powerful and 3 fast-acting buffer. An important enzyme is used to catalyze this mechanism: carbonic anhydrase (CA). This same enzyme and reaction is used in red blood cells in the transportation of CO , in the stomach to produce hydrochloric 2 acid, and in the pancreas to produce HCO –to buffer acidic chyme from the stomach. In the kidney, most of the CA 3 is located within the cell, but a small amount is bound to the brush border of the membrane on the apical surface of the cell. In the lumen of the PCT, HCO –combines with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid (H CO ). This is 3 2 3 enzymatically catalyzed into CO and water, which diffuse across the apical membrane into the cell. Water can move 2 osmotically across the lipid bilayer membrane due to the presence of aquaporin water channels. Inside the cell, the reverse reaction occurs to produce bicarbonate ions (HCO –). These bicarbonate ions are cotransported with Na+ 3 across the basal membrane to the interstitial space around the PCT (Figure 25.19). At the same time this is occurring, a Na+/H+antiporter excretes H+into the lumen, while it recovers Na+. Note how the
