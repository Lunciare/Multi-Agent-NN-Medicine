the lower right side of the specialized clump of myocardial conducting cells heart that ejects blood into the pulmonary circuit via located in the superior portion of the right atrium the pulmonary trunk and receives blood from the that has the highest inherent rate of depolarization right atrium that then spreads throughout the heart ventricular ejection phase second phase of Access for free at openstax.org 19 • Chapter Review 805 ventricular systole during which blood is pumped from the ventricle Chapter Review 19.1Heart Anatomy potential for the conductive cells consists of a prepotential phase with a slow influx of Na+followed The heart resides within the pericardial sac and is by a rapid influx of Ca2+and outflux of K+. Contractile located in the mediastinal space within the thoracic cells have an action potential with an extended plateau cavity. The pericardial sac consists of two fused layers: phase that results in an extended refractory period to an outer fibrous capsule and an inner parietal allow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood pericardium lined with a serous membrane. Between effectively. Recognizable points on the ECG include the the pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial P wave that corresponds to
