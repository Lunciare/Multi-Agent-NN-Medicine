plasma entering Bowman’s capsule per minute. It is the Glomerular renal plasma flow times the fraction that enters the renal capsule (19 percent). filtration 110 rate 578*0.19 = 110 mL filtrate/min The filtrate not recovered by the kidney is the urine that will be eliminated. It is the GFR times the fraction of the filtrate that is not reabsorbed (0.8 percent). 1296 ml/ 110*.008 = 0.9 mL urine /min Urine day Multiply urine/min times 60 minutes times 24 hours to get daily urine production. 0.9*60*24 = 1296 mL/day urine TABLE25.4 GFR is influenced by the hydrostatic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure on either side of the capillary membrane of the glomerulus. Recall that filtration occurs as pressure forces fluid and solutes through a semipermeable barrier with the solute movement constrained by particle size. Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure produced by a fluid against a surface. If you have a fluid on both sides of a barrier, both fluids exert a pressure in opposing directions. Net fluid movement will be in the direction of the lower pressure. Osmosis is the movement of solvent (water) across a membrane that is impermeable to a solute in the solution. This creates a pressure, osmotic
