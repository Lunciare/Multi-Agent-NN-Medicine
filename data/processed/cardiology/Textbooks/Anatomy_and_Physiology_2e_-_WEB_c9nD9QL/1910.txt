(Figure 18.11). FIGURE18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to five lobes. An eosinophil’s granules are slightly larger and stain reddish-orange, and its nucleus has two to three lobes. A basophil has large granules that stain dark blue to purple and a two-lobed nucleus. The most common of all the leukocytes,neutrophilswill normally comprise 50–70 percent of total leukocyte count. They are 10–12µm in diameter, significantly larger than erythrocytes. They are called neutrophils because their granules show up most clearly with stains that are chemically neutral (neither acidic nor basic). The granules are numerous but quite fine and normally appear light lilac. The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes, the number increasing with the age of the cell. Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes and are often referred to aspolymorphonuclear(a nucleus with many forms), or simply “polys.” Younger and immature neutrophils begin to develop lobes and are known as “bands.” Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria. Their granules includelysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants
