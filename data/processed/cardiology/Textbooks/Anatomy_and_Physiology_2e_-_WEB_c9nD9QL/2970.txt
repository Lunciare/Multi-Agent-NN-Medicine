to other areas of the body during powerfully and directly influenced by the hormone times of stress. The arteriolar myogenic mechanism ADH. Even so, it only influences the last 10 percent of maintains a steady blood flow by causing arteriolar water available for recovery after filtration at the smooth muscle to contract when blood pressure glomerulus, because 90 percent of water is recovered increases and causing it to relax when blood pressure before reaching the collecting ducts. Depending on the decreases. Tubuloglomerular feedback involves body’s fluid status at any given time, the collecting paracrine signaling at the JGA to cause ducts can recover none or almost all of the water vasoconstriction or vasodilation to maintain a steady reaching them. rate of blood flow. Mechanisms of solute recovery include active 25.8Endocrine Regulation of Kidney transport, simple diffusion, and facilitated diffusion. Function Most filtered substances are reabsorbed. Urea, NH , 3 Endocrine hormones act from a distance and paracrine creatinine, and some drugs are filtered or secreted as hormones act locally. The renal enzyme renin converts wastes. H+and HCO –are secreted or reabsorbed as 3 angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. The lung enzyme, needed to maintain acid–base balance. Movement of ACE, converts angiotensin
