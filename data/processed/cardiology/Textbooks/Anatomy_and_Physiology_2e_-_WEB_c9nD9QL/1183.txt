Anatomy and Physiology

• The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue has two gates. One is theactivation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV. The other gate is theinactivation gate, which closes after a specific period of time—on the order of a fraction of a millisecond. When a cell is at rest, the activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. However, when the threshold is reached, the activation gate opens, allowing Na+to rush into the cell. Timed with the peak of depolarization, the inactivation gate closes. During repolarization, no more sodium can enter the cell. When the membrane potential passes -55 mV again, the activation gate closes. After that, the inactivation gate re-opens, making the channel ready to start the whole process over again. The voltage-gated K+channel has only one gate, which is sensitive to a membrane voltage of -50 mV. However, it does not open as quickly as the voltage-gated Na+channel does. It might take a fraction of a millisecond for the channel to open once that voltage has been reached. The timing of this coincides exactly with when the Na+flow peaks, so voltage-gated K+channels open just as the voltage-gated Na+channels are being inactivated. As the membrane
