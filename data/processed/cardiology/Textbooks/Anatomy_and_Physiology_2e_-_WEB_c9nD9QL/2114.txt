pattern of the heart membrane potential increases as sodium ions sinus venosus develops into the posterior portion of diffuse through the always-open sodium ion the right atrium, the SA node, and the coronary channels and causes the electrical potential to rise sinus primitive atrium portion of the primitive heart tube small cardiac vein parallels the right coronary artery that eventually becomes the anterior portions of and drains blood from the posterior surfaces of the both the right and left atria, and the two auricles right atrium and ventricle; drains into the coronary primitive heart tube singular tubular structure that sinus, middle cardiac vein, or right atrium forms from the fusion of the two endocardial tubes spontaneous depolarization (also, prepotential primitive ventricle portion of the primitive heart tube depolarization) the mechanism that accounts for the that eventually forms the left ventricle autorhythmic property of cardiac muscle; the pulmonary arteries left and right branches of the membrane potential increases as sodium ions pulmonary trunk that carry deoxygenated blood diffuse through the always-open sodium ion from the heart to each of the lungs channels and causes the electrical potential to rise pulmonary capillaries capillaries surrounding the stroke volume (SV) amount of blood pumped
