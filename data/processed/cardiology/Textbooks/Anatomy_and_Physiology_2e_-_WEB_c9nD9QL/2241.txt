cerebral Another branch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the temporal and parietal artery lobes of the cerebrum Ophthalmic Branch of the internal carotid artery; supplies blood to the eyes artery Anterior communicating An anastomosis of the right and left internal carotid arteries; supplies blood to the brain artery Posterior Branches of the posterior cerebral artery that form part of the posterior portion of the arterial communicating circle; supplies blood to the brain artery Posterior Branch of the basilar artery that forms a portion of the posterior segment of the arterial circle cerebral artery of Willis; supplies blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem Formed from the fusion of the two vertebral arteries; sends branches to the cerebellum, brain Basilar artery stem, and the posterior cerebral arteries; the main blood supply to the brain stem TABLE20.6 Thoracic Aorta and Major Branches The thoracic aorta begins at the level of vertebra T5 and continues through to the diaphragm at the level of T12, initially traveling within the mediastinum to the left of the vertebral column. As it passes through the thoracic region, the thoracic aorta gives rise to several branches, which are collectively referred to
