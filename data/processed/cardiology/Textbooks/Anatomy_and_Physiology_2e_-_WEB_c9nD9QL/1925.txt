vessel. Coagulation then enables the repair of the vessel wall once the leakage of blood has stopped. (b) The synthesis of fibrin in blood clots involves either an intrinsic pathway or an extrinsic pathway, both of which lead to a common pathway. (credit a: Kevin MacKenzie) Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation In the coagulation cascade, chemicals calledclotting factors(or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still more coagulation factors. The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways: • The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma. • The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel. 736 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Both of these merge into a third pathway, referred to as the common pathway (seeFigure 18.14b). All three pathways are dependent upon the 12 known clotting factors, including Ca2+and vitamin K (Table 18.1). Clotting factors are secreted primarily by the liver and the platelets. The liver requires the fat-soluble vitamin K to produce many of them. Vitamin K (along with biotin and folate) is somewhat unusual among vitamins in that it is not only consumed in the diet but is also synthesized by
