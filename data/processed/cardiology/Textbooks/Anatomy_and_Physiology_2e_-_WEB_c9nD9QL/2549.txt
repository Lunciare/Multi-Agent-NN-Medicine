Anatomy and Physiology

is not large, as the partial pressure of oxygen in fetal blood at the placenta is about 20 mm Hg. Therefore, there is not as much diffusion of oxygen into the fetal blood supply. The fetus’ hemoglobin overcomes this problem by having a greater affinity for oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (Figure 22.27). Both fetal and adult hemoglobin have four subunits, but two of the subunits of fetal hemoglobin have a different structure that causes fetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin. FIGURE22.27 Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curves in Fetus and Adult Fetal hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin. Carbon Dioxide Transport in the Blood Carbon dioxide is transported by three major mechanisms. The first mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is by blood plasma, as some carbon dioxide molecules dissolve in the blood. The second mechanism is transport in the form of bicarbonate (HCO –), which also dissolves in plasma. The third mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is 3 similar to the transport of oxygen by erythrocytes (Figure 22.28). FIGURE22.28 Carbon Dioxide Transport Carbon dioxide is transported by three different methods: (a) in erythrocytes; (b) after forming carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is
