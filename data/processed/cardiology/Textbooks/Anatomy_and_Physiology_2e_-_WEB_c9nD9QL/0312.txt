and organs associated with the each of the three germ layers. Note that epithelial tissue originates in all three layers, whereas nervous tissue derives primarily from the ectoderm and muscle tissue from mesoderm. 128 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization FIGURE4.3 Embryonic Origin of Tissues and Major Organs INTERACTIVE LINK View thisslideshow( learn more about stem cells. How do somatic stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells? Tissue Membranes Atissue membraneis a thin layer or sheet of cells that covers the outside of the body (for example, skin), the organs (for example, pericardium), internal passageways that lead to the exterior of the body (for example, mucosa of stomach), and the lining of the moveable joint cavities. There are two basic types of tissue membranes: connective tissue and epithelial membranes (Figure 4.4).

Connective Tissue Membranes Theconnective tissue membraneis formed solely from connective tissue. These membranes encapsulate organs, such
