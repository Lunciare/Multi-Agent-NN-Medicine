cell responsible for resorbing bone epiphyseal plate osteocyte primary cell in mature bone; responsible epiphyseal plate (also, growth plate) sheet of hyaline for maintaining the matrix cartilage in the metaphysis of an immature bone; osteogenic cell undifferentiated cell with high mitotic replaced by bone tissue as the organ grows in length activity; the only bone cells that divide; they epiphysis wide section at each end of a long bone; differentiate and develop into osteoblasts filled with spongy bone and red marrow osteoid uncalcified bone matrix secreted by external callus collar of hyaline cartilage and bone osteoblasts that forms around the outside of a fracture osteon (also, Haversian system) basic structural unit flat bone thin and curved bone; serves as a point of of compact bone; made of concentric layers of attachment for muscles and protects internal calcified matrix organs osteoporosis disease characterized by a decrease in fracture broken bone bone mass; occurs when the rate of bone resorption fracture hematoma blood clot that forms at the site exceeds the rate of bone formation, a common of a broken bone occurrence as the body ages hematopoiesis production of blood cells, which perforating canal (also, Volkmann’s canal) channel occurs in the red
