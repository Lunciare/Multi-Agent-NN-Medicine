loss of water to the urine, causing blood osmolarity to rise. In other words, when blood osmolarity goes up, filtration and urine formation decrease and water is retained. When blood osmolarity goes down, filtration and urine formation increase and water is lost by way of the urine. The net result of these opposing actions is to keep the rate of filtration relatively constant. A second function of the macula densa cells is to regulate renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent arteriole (Figure 25.14). Active renin is a protein comprised of 304 amino acids that cleaves several amino acids fromangiotensinogento produce angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is not biologically active until converted to angiotensin II byangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)from the lungs.Angiotensin IIis a systemic vasoconstrictor that helps to regulate blood pressure by increasing it. Angiotensin II also stimulates the release of the steroid hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone stimulates Na+reabsorption by the kidney, which also results in water retention and increased blood pressure. 1124 25 • The Urinary System FIGURE25.14 Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II The enzyme renin converts the pro-enzyme angiotensin I; the lung- derived enzyme ACE converts angiotensin I into active angiotensin II.
