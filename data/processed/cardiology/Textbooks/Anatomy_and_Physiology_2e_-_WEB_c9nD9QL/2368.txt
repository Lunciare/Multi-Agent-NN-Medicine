tissue: Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the lungs. Aneutrophilis a phagocytic cell that is attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues. These spherical cells are granulocytes. A granulocyte contains cytoplasmic granules, which in turn contain a variety of vasoactive mediators such as histamine. In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes. An agranulocyte has few or no cytoplasmic granules. Whereas macrophages act like sentries, always on guard against infection, neutrophils can be thought of as military reinforcements that are called into a battle to hasten the destruction of the enemy. Although, usually thought of as the primary pathogen-killing cell of the inflammatory process of the innate immune response, new research has suggested that neutrophils play a role in the adaptive immune response as well, just as macrophages do. Amonocyteis a circulating precursor cell that differentiates into either a macrophage or dendritic cell, which can be 908 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System rapidly attracted to areas of infection by signal molecules of inflammation.
