they are mixed together with digestive juices in the stomach until they are converted into chyme, which is released into the small intestine. As you will see in the sections that follow, the stomach plays several important roles in chemical digestion, including the continued digestion of carbohydrates and the initial digestion of proteins and triglycerides. Little if any nutrient absorption occurs in the stomach, with the exception of the negligible amount of nutrients in alcohol. Structure There are four main regions in thestomach: the cardia, fundus, body, and pylorus (Figure 23.15). Thecardia(or Access for free at openstax.org 23.4 • The Stomach 1017 cardiac region) is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach and through which food passes into the stomach. Located inferior to the diaphragm, above and to the left of the cardia, is the dome-shapedfundus. Below the fundus is thebody, the main part of the stomach. The funnel-shapedpylorusconnects the stomach to the duodenum. The wider end of the funnel, thepyloric antrum, connects to the body of the stomach. The narrower end is called thepyloric canal, which connects to the duodenum. The smooth musclepyloric sphincteris located at this latter point of connection and controls stomach emptying. In the
