there, the blood continues toward the heart to be pumped to the lungs for reoxygenation. FIGURE13.16 Dural Sinuses and Veins Blood drains from the brain through a series of sinuses that connect to the jugular veins. Protective Coverings of the Brain and Spinal Cord The outer surface of the CNS is covered by a series of membranes composed of connective tissue called the meninges, which protect the brain. Thedura materis a thick fibrous layer and a strong protective sheath over the entire brain and spinal cord. It is anchored to the inner surface of the cranium and vertebral cavity. Thearachnoid materis a membrane of thin fibrous tissue that forms a loose sac around the CNS. Beneath the arachnoid is a thin, filamentous mesh called thearachnoid trabeculae, which looks like a spider web, giving this layer its name. Directly adjacent to the surface of the CNS is thepia mater, a thin fibrous membrane that follows the convolutions of gyri and sulci in the cerebral cortex and fits into other grooves and indentations (Figure 13.17). 514 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System FIGURE13.17 Meningeal Layers of Superior Sagittal Sinus The layers of the meninges in the longitudinal fissure of the superior
