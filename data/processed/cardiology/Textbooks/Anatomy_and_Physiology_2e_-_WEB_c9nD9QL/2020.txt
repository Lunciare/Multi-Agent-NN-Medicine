Anatomy and Physiology

or more marginal arteries arise from the right coronary artery inferior to the right atrium. Themarginal arteriessupply blood to the superficial portions of the right ventricle. On the posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery gives rise to theposterior interventricular artery, also known as the posterior descending artery. It runs along the posterior portion of the interventricular sulcus toward the apex of the heart, giving rise to branches that supply the interventricular septum and portions of both ventricles.Figure 19.15presents views of the coronary circulation from both the anterior and posterior views. FIGURE19.15 Coronary Circulation The anterior view of the heart shows the prominent coronary surface vessels. The posterior view of the heart shows the prominent coronary surface vessels. Diseases of the… Heart: Myocardial Infarction Myocardial infarction (MI) is the formal term for what is commonly referred to as a heart attack. It normally results from a lack of blood flow (ischemia) and oxygen (hypoxia) to a region of the heart, resulting in death of the cardiac muscle cells. An MI often occurs when a coronary artery is blocked by the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque consisting of lipids, cholesterol and fatty acids, and white blood cells, primarily macrophages. It
