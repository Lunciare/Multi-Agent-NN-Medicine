organ system gets involved, and what part of the brain coordinates the two systems for the entire response, including epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol? 15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare the structure of somatic and autonomic reflex arcs • Explain the differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes • Differentiate between short and long reflexes • Determine the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the regulation of the various organ systems on the basis of the signaling molecules involved • Describe the effects of drugs that affect autonomic function The autonomic nervous system regulates organ systems through circuits that resemble the reflexes described in the somatic nervous system. The main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what target tissues are effectors. Somatic responses are solely based on skeletal muscle contraction. The autonomic system, however, targets cardiac and smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue. Whereas the basic circuit is areflex arc, there are differences in the structure of those reflexes for the somatic and autonomic systems. The Structure of Reflexes One difference between asomatic reflex, such as the withdrawal reflex, and avisceral reflex, which
