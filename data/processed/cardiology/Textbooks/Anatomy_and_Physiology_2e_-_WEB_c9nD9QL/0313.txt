Anatomy and Physiology

include mucous membranes, serous membranes, and the cutaneous membrane, in other words, the skin. Connective Tissue Membranes Theconnective tissue membraneis formed solely from connective tissue. These membranes encapsulate organs, such as the kidneys, and line our movable joints. Asynovial membraneis a type of connective tissue membrane that lines the cavity of a freely movable joint. For example, synovial membranes surround the joints of the shoulder, elbow, and knee. Fibroblasts in the inner layer of the synovial membrane release hyaluronan into the joint cavity. The hyaluronan effectively traps available water to form the synovial fluid, a natural lubricant that enables the bones of a joint to move freely against one another without much friction. This synovial fluid readily exchanges water and nutrients with blood, as do all body fluids. Epithelial Membranes Theepithelial membraneis composed of epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue, for example, your skin. Themucous membraneis also a composite of connective and epithelial tissues. Sometimes called mucosae, these epithelial membranes line the body cavities and hollow passageways that open to the external environment, and include the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive tracts. Mucus, produced by the epithelial exocrine 130 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization glands, covers
