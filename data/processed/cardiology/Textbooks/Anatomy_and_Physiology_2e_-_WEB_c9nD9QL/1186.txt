beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment. There is a high density of voltage-gated Na+channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here. Going down the length of the axon, the action potential is propagated because more voltage-gated Na+channels are opened as the depolarization spreads. This spreading occurs because Na+enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell membrane. As the Na+moves, or flows, a short distance along the cell membrane, its positive charge depolarizes a little more of the cell membrane. As that depolarization spreads, new voltage-gated Na+channels open and more ions rush into the cell, spreading the depolarization a little farther. Because voltage-gated Na+channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again for a brief time—the absolute refractory period. Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously opened channels has no effect. The action potential must propagate toward the axon terminals; as a result, the Access for free at openstax.org 12.4 • The Action Potential 475 polarity of the neuron is maintained, as mentioned above. Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter
