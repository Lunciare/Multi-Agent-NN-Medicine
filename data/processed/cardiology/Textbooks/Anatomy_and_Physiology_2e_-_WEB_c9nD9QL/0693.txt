resulting from a fall onto the hand. Deep pain at the lateral wrist may yield an initial diagnosis of a wrist sprain, but a radiograph taken several weeks after the injury, after tissue swelling has subsided, will reveal the fracture. Due to the poor blood supply to the scaphoid bone, healing will be slow and there is the danger of bone necrosis and subsequent degenerative joint disease of the wrist. FIGURE8.11 Fractures of the Humerus and Radius Falls or direct blows can result in fractures of the surgical neck or shaft of the humerus. Falls onto the elbow can fracture the distal humerus. A Colles fracture of the distal radius is the most common forearm fracture.

When would surgery be required and how would the fracture be repaired in this case? 8.3 The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define the pelvic girdle and describe the bones and ligaments of the pelvis
