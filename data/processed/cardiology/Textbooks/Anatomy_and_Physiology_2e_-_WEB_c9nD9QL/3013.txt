Bicarbonate Bicarbonate is the second most abundant anion in the blood. Its principal function is to maintain your body’s acid- base balance by being part of buffer systems. This role will be discussed in a different section. Bicarbonate ions result from a chemical reaction that starts with carbon dioxide (CO ) and water, two molecules that 2 are produced at the end of aerobic metabolism. Only a small amount of CO can be dissolved in body fluids. Thus, 2 over 90 percent of the CO is converted into bicarbonate ions, HCO –, through the following reactions: 2 3 Access for free at openstax.org 26.3 • Electrolyte Balance 1169 The bidirectional arrows indicate that the reactions can go in either direction, depending on the concentrations of the reactants and products. Carbon dioxide is produced in large amounts in tissues that have a high metabolic rate. Carbon dioxide is converted into bicarbonate in the cytoplasm of red blood cells through the action of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. Bicarbonate is transported in the
