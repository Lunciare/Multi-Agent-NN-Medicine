No and, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers striations are evident because the actin and myosin fall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are filaments do not align in the cytoplasm. thick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers 4.5Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception that are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin and Response fibers that are thin and elastic. The most prominent cell of the nervous tissue, the The major types of connective tissue are connective neuron, is characterized mainly by its ability to receive tissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose stimuli and respond by generating an electrical signal, connective tissue proper includes adipose tissue, known as an action potential, which can travel rapidly areolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold over great distances in the body. A typical neuron organs and other tissues in place and, in the case of displays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body adipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The branches out into short extensions called dendrites, matrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue which receive chemical signals from other neurons, although adipose tissue does not have much and a long
