Anatomy and Physiology

the anteroinferior hip bone between the ischium and pubis is theobturator foramen. This space is largely filled in by a layer of connective tissue and serves for the attachment of muscles on both its internal and external surfaces. Several ligaments unite the bones of the pelvis (Figure 8.14). The largely immobile sacroiliac joint is supported by a pair of strong ligaments that are attached between the sacrum and ilium portions of the hip bone. These are the anterior sacroiliac ligamenton the anterior side of the joint and theposterior sacroiliac ligamenton the posterior side. Also spanning the sacrum and hip bone are two additional ligaments. Thesacrospinous ligamentruns from the sacrum to the ischial spine, and thesacrotuberous ligamentruns from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity. These ligaments help to support and immobilize the sacrum as it carries the weight of the body. FIGURE8.14 Ligaments of the Pelvis The posterior sacroiliac ligament supports the sacroiliac joint. The sacrospinous ligament spans the sacrum to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament spans the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments contribute to the formation of the greater and lesser sciatic foramina. 288 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo(
