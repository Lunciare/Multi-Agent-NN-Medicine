Anatomy and Physiology

results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers also release ACh, but the receptors on their targets are muscarinic receptors, which are G protein–coupled receptors and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, except for fibers that project to sweat glands and to blood vessels associated with skeletal muscles, which release ACh (Table 15.1). 598 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System Autonomic System Signaling Molecules Sympathetic Parasympathetic Acetylcholine → Preganglionic Acetylcholine → nicotinic receptor nicotinic receptor Norepinephrine → α- or β-adrenergic receptors Acetylcholine → Postganglionic Acetylcholine → muscarinic receptor (associated with sweat glands and muscarinic the blood vessels associated with skeletal muscles only receptor TABLE15.1 Signaling molecules can belong to two broad groups. Neurotransmitters are released at synapses, whereas hormones are released into the bloodstream. These are simplistic definitions, but they can help to clarify this point. Acetylcholine can be considered a neurotransmitter because it is released by axons at synapses. The adrenergic system, however, presents a challenge. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, which can be considered a neurotransmitter. But the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into circulation, so they should be considered hormones. What are referred to here
