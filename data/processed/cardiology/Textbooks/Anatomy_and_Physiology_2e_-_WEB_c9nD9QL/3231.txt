highly vulnerable to the bilirubin circulating in the blood. Indeed, hyperbilirubinemia, a high level of circulating bilirubin, is the most common condition requiring medical attention in newborns. Newborns with hyperbilirubinemia are treated with phototherapy because UV light helps to break down the bilirubin quickly. 1256 28 • Development and Inheritance 28.7 Patterns of Inheritance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Differentiate between genotype and phenotype • Describe how alleles determine a person’s traits • Summarize Mendel’s experiments and relate them to human genetics • Explain the inheritance of autosomal dominant and recessive and sex-linked genetic disorders We have discussed the events that lead to the development of a newborn. But what makes each newborn unique? The answer lies, of course, in the DNA in the sperm and oocyte that combined to produce that first diploid cell, the human zygote. From Genotype to Phenotype Each human body cell has a full complement of DNA stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes.Figure 28.24shows the pairs in a systematic arrangement called akaryotype. Among these is one pair of chromosomes, called thesex chromosomes, that determines the sex of the individual (XX in females, XY in males). The
