• Production of the Formed Elements 717 specialized stem cells (Figure 18.4): • Lymphoid stem cellsgive rise to a class of leukocytes known as lymphocytes, which include the various T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which function in immunity. However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes progresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells quickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, where their production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone marrow, while T cells mature in the thymus. • Myeloid stem cellsgive rise to all the other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that produce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. FIGURE18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the formed elements of blood. Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements. As you can see inFigure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of which can be recognized by their
