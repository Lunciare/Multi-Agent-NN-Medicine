and Lower Limbs LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the appendicular muscles of the pelvic girdle and lower limb • Identify the movement and function of the pelvic girdle and lower limb The appendicular muscles of the lower body position and stabilize thepelvic girdle, which serves as a foundation for the lower limbs. Comparatively, there is much more movement at the pectoral girdle than at the pelvic girdle. There is very little movement of the pelvic girdle because of its connection with the sacrum at the base of the axial skeleton. The pelvic girdle is less range of motion because it was designed to stabilize and support the body. Muscles of the Thigh What would happen if the pelvic girdle, which attaches the lower limbs to the torso, were capable of the same range of motion as the pectoral girdle? For one thing, walking would expend more energy if the heads of the femurs were not secured in the acetabula of the pelvis. The body’s center of gravity is in the area of the pelvis. If the center of gravity were not to remain fixed, standing up would be difficult as
