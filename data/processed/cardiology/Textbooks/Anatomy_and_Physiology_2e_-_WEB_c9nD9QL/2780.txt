The Krebs cycle is also commonly called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During the Krebs cycle, high-energy molecules, including ATP, NADH, and FADH , are created. NADH and FADH then pass 2 2 electrons through the electron transport chain in the mitochondria to generate more ATP molecules. FIGURE24.7 Krebs Cycle During the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate that is generated by glycolysis is converted into a two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule. The acetyl CoA is systematically processed through the cycle and produces high-energy NADH, FADH2, and ATP molecules. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisanimation( observe the Krebs cycle. The three-carbon pyruvate molecule generated during glycolysis moves from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is converted by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase into a two-carbonacetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA)molecule. This reaction is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction. It converts the three-carbon pyruvate into a 1070 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition two-carbon acetyl CoA molecule, releasing carbon dioxide and transferring two electrons that combine with NAD+to form NADH.
