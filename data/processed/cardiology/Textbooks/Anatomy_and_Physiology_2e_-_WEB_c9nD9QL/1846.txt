Synthesis of the amino These are typically associated with a G protein, which acid–derived T and T hormones requires iodine. 3 4 becomes activated when the hormone binds the Insufficient amounts of iodine in the diet can lead to receptor. This initiates a signaling cascade that involves goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders. a second messenger, such as cyclic adenosine 17.5The Parathyroid Glands monophosphate (cAMP). Second messenger systems greatly amplify the hormone signal, creating a broader, Calcium is required for a variety of important more efficient, and faster response. physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood calcium levels are closely Hormones are released upon stimulation that is of regulated.
