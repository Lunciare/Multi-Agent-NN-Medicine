Hormones derived from amino acids include amines, peptides, and proteins. Those derived from lipids include steroids (Figure 17.3). These chemical groups affect a hormone’s distribution, the type of receptors it binds to, and other aspects of its function.

Typically, the original structure of the amino acid is modified such that a –COOH, or carboxyl, group
