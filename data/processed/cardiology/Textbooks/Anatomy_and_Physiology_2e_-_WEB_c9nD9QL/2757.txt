materials in the cell. This chapter will take you through some of the chemical reactions essential to life, the sum of which is referred to as metabolism. The focus of these discussions will be anabolic reactions and catabolic reactions. You will examine the various chemical reactions that are important to sustain life, including why you must have oxygen, how mitochondria transfer energy, and the importance of certain “metabolic” hormones and vitamins. Metabolism varies, depending on age, sex, activity level, fuel consumption, and lean body mass. Your own metabolic rate fluctuates throughout life. By modifying your diet and exercise regimen, you can increase both lean body mass and metabolic rate. Factors affecting metabolism also play important roles in controlling muscle mass. Aging is known to decrease the metabolic rate by as much as 5 percent per year. Additionally, because males tend have more lean muscle mass then females, their basal metabolic rate (metabolic rate at rest) is higher; therefore, males tend to burn more calories than females do. Lastly, an individual’s inherent metabolic rate is a function of the 1058 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition proteins and enzymes derived from their genetic background. Thus, your genes play a big role in
