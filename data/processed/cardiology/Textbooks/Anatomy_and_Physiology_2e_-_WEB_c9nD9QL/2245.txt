aorta (see Figure 20.28). This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the peritoneal cavity. It formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common iliac arteries. Before this division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches. A singleceliac trunk(artery) emerges and divides into theleft gastric arteryto supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the splenic arteryto supply blood to the spleen, and thecommon hepatic artery, which in turn gives rise to the hepatic artery properto supply blood to the liver, theright gastric arteryto supply blood to the stomach, the cystic arteryto supply blood to the gall bladder, and several branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and another to supply blood to the pancreas. Two additional single vessels arise from the abdominal aorta. These are the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Thesuperior mesenteric arteryarises approximately 2.5 cm after the celiac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. Theinferior mesenteric arterysupplies blood to the distal segment of the large intestine, including
