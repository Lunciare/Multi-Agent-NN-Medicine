Anatomy and Physiology

end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the barrier defenses of the body • Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps guide and prepare the body for adaptive immune responses • Describe various soluble factors that are part of the innate immune response • Explain the steps of inflammation and how they lead to destruction of a pathogen • Discuss early induced immune responses and their level of effectiveness The immune system can be divided into two overlapping mechanisms to destroy pathogens: the innate immune response, which is relatively rapid but nonspecific and thus not always effective, and the adaptive immune response, which is slower in its development during an initial infection with a pathogen, but is highly specific and effective at attacking a wide variety of pathogens (Figure 21.12). 906 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System FIGURE21.12 Cooperation between Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses The innate immune system enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective. Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the physical barriers that prevent pathogens from entering the body, destroy them after they enter, or flush them out before they
