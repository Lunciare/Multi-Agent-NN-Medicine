Anatomy and Physiology

the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis.Peristalsisconsists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (Figure 23.5). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head. FIGURE23.5 Peristalsis Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation. Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes.Mechanical digestionis a purely physical process that does not change the chemical nature of the food. Instead, it makes the food smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. It includesmastication, or chewing, as well as tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix food with saliva. Although there may be a tendency to think that mechanical digestion is limited to the first steps of the digestive process, it occurs after the food leaves the mouth, as well. The mechanical churning of food in the stomach serves to further break it apart and expose more of its surface
