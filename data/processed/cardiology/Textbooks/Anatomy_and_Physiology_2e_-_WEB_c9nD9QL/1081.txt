thetibialis anterior, a long and thick muscle on the lateral surface of the tibia, theextensor hallucis longus, deep under it, and theextensor digitorum longus, lateral to it, all contribute to raising the front of the foot when they contract. Thefibularis tertius, a small muscle that originates on the anterior surface of the fibula, is associated with the extensor digitorum longus and sometimes fused to it, but is not present in all people. Thick bands of connective tissue called thesuperior extensor retinaculum(transverse ligament of the ankle) and theinferior extensor retinaculum, hold the tendons of these muscles in place during dorsiflexion.

The superficial muscles in theposterior compartment of the legall insert onto the calcaneal tendon(Achilles tendon), a strong tendon that inserts into the calcaneal bone of the ankle. The muscles in this compartment are large and strong and keep humans upright. The most superficial and visible muscle of the calf is thegastrocnemius. Deep to the gastrocnemius is the wide, flatsoleus. Theplantarisruns obliquely between the two; some people may have two of
