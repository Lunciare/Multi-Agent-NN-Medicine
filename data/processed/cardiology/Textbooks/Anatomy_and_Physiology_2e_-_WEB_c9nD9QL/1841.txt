calcium short-term stress; also called noradrenaline hyperthyroidism clinically abnormal, elevated level osmoreceptor hypothalamic sensory receptor that is of thyroid hormone in the blood; characterized by an stimulated by changes in solute concentration increased metabolic rate, excess body heat, (osmotic pressure) in the blood sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, and increased heart oxytocin hypothalamic hormone stored in the rate posterior pituitary gland and important in hypoparathyroidism disorder caused by stimulating uterine contractions in labor, milk underproduction of PTH that results in abnormally ejection during breastfeeding, and feelings of low blood calcium attachment (produced by males and females) hypophyseal portal system network of blood vessels pancreas organ with both exocrine and endocrine that enables hypothalamic hormones to travel into functions located posterior to the stomach that is the anterior lobe of the pituitary without entering important for digestion and the regulation of blood the systemic circulation glucose hypothalamus region of the diencephalon inferior to pancreatic islets specialized clusters of pancreatic the thalamus that functions in neural and endocrine cells that have endocrine functions; also called signaling islets of Langerhans hypothyroidism clinically abnormal, low level of paracrine chemical signal that elicits a response in thyroid hormone in the blood; characterized by low neighboring cells;
