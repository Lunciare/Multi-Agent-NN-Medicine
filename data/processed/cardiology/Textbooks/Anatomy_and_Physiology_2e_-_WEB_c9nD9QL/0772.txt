Anatomy and Physiology

selective cell death separates the developing muscle tendon from rubbing against the femur. fingers and toes. At the same time, mesenchyme within The leg contains the large tibia on the medial side and the limb bud begins to differentiate into hyaline the slender fibula on the lateral side. The tibia bears cartilage, forming models for future bones. During the the weight of the body, whereas the fibula does not seventh week, the upper limbs rotate laterally and the bear weight. The interosseous border of each bone is lower limbs rotate medially, bringing the limbs into the attachment site for the interosseous membrane of their final positions. the leg, the connective tissue sheet that unites the tibia Endochondral ossification, the process that converts and fibula. the hyaline cartilage model into bone, begins in most The proximal tibia consists of the expanded medial and appendicular bones by the twelfth fetal week. This lateral condyles, which articulate with the medial and begins as a primary ossification center in the diaphysis, lateral condyles of the femur to form the knee joint. followed by the later appearance of one or more Between the tibial condyles is the intercondylar secondary ossifications centers in the regions of
