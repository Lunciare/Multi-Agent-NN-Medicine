of energy for the human body. Triglycerides yield more than twice the energy per unit mass when compared to carbohydrates and proteins. Therefore, when glucose levels are low, triglycerides can be converted into acetyl CoA molecules and used to generate ATP through aerobic respiration. The breakdown of fatty acids, calledfatty acid oxidationorbeta (β)-oxidation, begins in the cytoplasm, where fatty acids are converted into fatty acyl CoA molecules. This fatty acyl CoA combines with carnitine to create a fatty acyl carnitine molecule, which helps to transport the fatty acid across the mitochondrial membrane. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acyl carnitine molecule is converted back into fatty acyl CoA and then into acetyl CoA (Figure 24.13). The newly formed acetyl CoA enters the Krebs cycle and is used to produce ATP in the same way as acetyl CoA derived from pyruvate. 1078 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition FIGURE24.13 Breakdown of Fatty Acids During fatty acid oxidation, triglycerides can be broken down into acetyl CoA molecules and Access for free at openstax.org 24.3 • Lipid Metabolism 1079 used for energy when glucose levels are low.
