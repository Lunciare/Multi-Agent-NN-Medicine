contamination, but this is not an abnormal condition. Now that you understand what the normal characteristics of urine are, the next section will introduce you to how you store and dispose of this waste product and how you make it. 25.2 Gross Anatomy of Urine Transport LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra, as well as their location, structure, histology, and function • Compare and contrast male and female urethras • Describe the micturition reflex • Describe voluntary and involuntary neural control of micturition Rather than start with urine formation, this section will start with urine excretion. Urine is a fluid of variable composition that requires specialized structures to remove it from the body safely and efficiently. Blood is filtered, 1114 25 • The Urinary System and the filtrate is transformed into urine at a relatively constant rate throughout the day. This processed liquid is stored until a convenient time for excretion. All structures involved in the transport and storage of the urine are large enough to be visible to the naked eye. This transport and storage system not only stores the waste, but it protects
