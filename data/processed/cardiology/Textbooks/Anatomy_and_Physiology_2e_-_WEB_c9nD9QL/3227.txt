is secreted (the let-down).Figure 28.23summarizes the positive feedback loop of thelet- down reflex. 1254 28 • Development and Inheritance FIGURE28.23 Let-Down Reflex A positive feedback loop ensures continued milk production as long as the infant continues to breastfeed. The prolactin-mediated synthesis of milk changes with time. Frequent milk removal by breastfeeding (or pumping) will maintain high circulating prolactin levels for several months. However, even with continued breastfeeding, baseline prolactin will decrease over time to its pre-pregnancy level. In addition to prolactin and oxytocin, growth hormone, cortisol, parathyroid hormone, and insulin contribute to lactation, in part by facilitating the transport of maternal amino acids, fatty acids, glucose, and calcium to breast milk. Changes in the Composition of Breast Milk In the final weeks of pregnancy, the alveoli swell withcolostrum, a thick, yellowish substance that is high in protein but contains less fat and glucose than mature breast milk (Table 28.3). Before childbirth, some people experience leakage of colostrum from the nipples. In contrast, mature breast milk does not leak during pregnancy and is not secreted until several days after childbirth.
