Blood from the more superficial portions of the head, scalp, and cranial regions, including thetemporal veinandmaxillary vein, flow into eachexternal jugular vein. Although the external and internal jugular veins are separate vessels, there are anastomoses between them close to the thoracic region. Blood from the
