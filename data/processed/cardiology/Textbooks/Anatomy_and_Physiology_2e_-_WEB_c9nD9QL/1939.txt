by certain B lymphocytes called plasma cells, attach to the antigens on the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause them to adhere to one another. • Because the arms of the Y-shaped antibodies attach randomly to more than one nonself erythrocyte surface, they form clumps of erythrocytes. This process is calledagglutination. • The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients. • As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process calledhemolysis, their hemoglobin is released into the bloodstream. This hemoglobin travels to the kidneys, which are responsible for filtration of the blood. However, 740 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood the load of hemoglobin released can easily overwhelm the kidney’s capacity to clear it, and the patient can quickly develop kidney failure. More than 50 antigens have been identified on erythrocyte membranes, but the most significant in terms of their potential harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood group. The ABO Blood Group Although theABO blood groupname consists of three letters, ABO blood typing designates the presence or absence of just two antigens, A and B. Both are glycoproteins. People
