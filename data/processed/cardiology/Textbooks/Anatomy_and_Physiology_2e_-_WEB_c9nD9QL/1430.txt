across the midline to the other side of the brain or spinal cord. In the dorsal column system, this decussation takes place in the brain stem; in the spinothalamic pathway, it takes place in the spinal cord at the same spinal cord level at which the information entered. The third neurons in the two pathways are essentially the same. In both, the second neuron synapses in the thalamus, and the thalamic neuron projects to the somatosensory cortex. FIGURE14.19 Anterior View of Ascending Sensory Pathways of the Spinal Cord The dorsal column system and spinothalamic tract are the major ascending pathways that connect the periphery with the brain. Access for free at openstax.org 14.2 • Central Processing 561 The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. As with the previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons. First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of three locations. Thespinal trigeminal nucleusof the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either thechief
