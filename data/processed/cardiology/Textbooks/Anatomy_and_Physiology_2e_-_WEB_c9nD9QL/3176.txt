become part of the urinary bladder. Together, the stalks of the yolk sac and allantois establish the outer structure of the umbilical cord. The last of the extra-embryonic membranes is thechorion, which is the one membrane that surrounds all others. The development of the chorion will be discussed in more detail shortly, as it relates to the growth and development of the placenta. Embryogenesis As the third week of development begins, the two-layered disc of cells becomes a three-layered disc through the process ofgastrulation, during which the cells transition from totipotency to multipotency. The embryo, which takes the shape of an oval-shaped disc, forms an indentation called theprimitive streakalong the dorsal surface of the epiblast. A node at the caudal or “tail” end of the primitive streak emits growth factors that direct cells to multiply and migrate. Cells migrate toward and through the primitive streak and then move laterally to create two new layers of cells. The first layer is theendoderm, a sheet of cells that displaces the hypoblast and lies adjacent to the yolk sac. The second layer of cells fills in as the middle layer, ormesoderm. The cells of the epiblast that remain (not having migrated through the
