The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into thecerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain. The aqueduct opens into thefourth ventricle, which is the space between the cerebellum and the pons and upper medulla (Figure 13.18). 516 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System FIGURE13.18 Cerebrospinal Fluid Circulation The choroid plexus in the four ventricles produce CSF, which is circulated through the ventricular system and then enters the subarachnoid space through the median and lateral apertures. The CSF is then reabsorbed into the blood at the arachnoid granulations, where the arachnoid membrane emerges into the dural sinuses. As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within the skull. The telencephalon is the most anterior region of what was the neural tube, but cannot grow past the limit of the frontal bone of the skull. Because the cerebrum fits into this space, it takes on a C-shaped formation, through the frontal, parietal, occipital, and finally temporal regions. The space within the telencephalon is stretched into this same C- shape. The two ventricles are in the left and right sides, and were at one
