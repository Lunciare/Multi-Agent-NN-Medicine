Anatomy and Physiology

other plexus from the cervical level is thebrachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve from this plexus is theradial nervefrom which theaxillary nervebranches to go to the armpit region. The radial nerve continues through the arm and is paralleled by theulnar nerveand themedian nerve. Thelumbar plexus arises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg. Thefemoral nerveis one of the major nerves from this plexus, which gives rise to thesaphenous nerveas a branch that extends through the anterior lower leg. Thesacral plexuscomes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and the sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come from this plexus is thesciatic nerve, which is a combination of thetibial nerveand thefibular nerve. The sciatic nerve extends across the hip joint and is most commonly associated with the conditionsciatica, which is the result of compression or irritation of the nerve or any of the spinal nerves giving rise to it. These plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise
