head down to the toes. 11.1 Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare and contrast agonist and antagonist muscles • Describe how fascicles are arranged within a skeletal muscle • Explain the major events of a skeletal muscle contraction within a muscle in generating force 396 11 • The Muscular System To move the skeleton, the tension created by the contraction of the fibers in most skeletal muscles is transferred to the tendons. The tendons are strong bands of dense, regular connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. The bone connection is why this muscle tissue is called skeletal muscle. Interactions of Skeletal Muscles in the Body To pull on a bone, that is, to change the angle at its synovial joint, which essentially moves the skeleton, a skeletal muscle must also be attached to a fixed part of the skeleton. The moveable end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being pulled is called the muscle’sinsertion, and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed (stabilized) bone is called theorigin. During forearmflexion—bending the elbow—the brachioradialis assists the brachialis.
