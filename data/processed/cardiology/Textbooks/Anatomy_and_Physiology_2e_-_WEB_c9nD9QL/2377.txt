FIGURE21.14 This reaction also brings in the cells of the innate immune system, allowing them to get rid of the sources of a possible infection. Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response. The process not only brings fluid and cells into the site to destroy the pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to isolate the site, limiting the spread of the pathogen.Acute inflammationis a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to the body. If the cause of the inflammation is not resolved, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which is associated with major tissue destruction and fibrosis.Chronic inflammationis ongoing inflammation. It can be caused by foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are four important parts to the inflammatory response: • Tissue Injury.The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release ofmast cellgranules and their potent inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.Histamineincreases the diameter of
