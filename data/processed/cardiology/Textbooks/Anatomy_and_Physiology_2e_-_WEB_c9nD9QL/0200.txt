of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed together, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively permeable. A membrane that hasselective permeabilityallows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass through it unaided. In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the lipid bilayer (remember, the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids, oxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials—like glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes—need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods, which are categorized based on whether or not energy is required.Passive transportis the movement of Access for free at openstax.org 3.1 • The Cell Membrane 85 substances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy. In contrast,active transportis the movement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Passive Transport In order to understandhowsubstances move passively across a cell membrane, it is necessary to understand concentration gradients and diffusion. Aconcentration gradientis the difference in concentration
