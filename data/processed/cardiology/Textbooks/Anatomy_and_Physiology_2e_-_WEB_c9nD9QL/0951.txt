Anatomy and Physiology

DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin, it was thought that introducing healthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment. Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible for muscle development, and ideally, they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed for normal muscle contraction. This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans. A recent approach has involved attempting to boost the muscle’s production of utrophin, a protein similar to dystrophin that may be able to assume the role of dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring. 10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain concentric, isotonic, and eccentric contractions • Describe the length-tension relationship • Describe the three phases of a muscle twitch • Define wave summation, tetanus, and treppe To move an object, referred to as load, the sarcomeres in the muscle fibers of the skeletal muscle must shorten. The force generated by the contraction of the muscle (or shortening of the sarcomeres) is calledmuscle tension. However, muscle tension also is generated when the muscle is contracting against a load that does not move, resulting in
