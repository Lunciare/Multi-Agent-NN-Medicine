composed of visceral and parietal to be drawn into the lungs. During expiration, the pleural layers. The space between these two layers is diaphragm and intercostals relax, causing the thorax called the pleural cavity. The mesothelial cells of the and lungs to recoil. The air pressure within the lungs pleural membrane create pleural fluid, which serves as increases to above the pressure of the atmosphere, both a lubricant (to reduce friction during breathing) causing air to be forced out of the lungs. However, and as an adhesive to adhere the lungs to the thoracic during forced exhalation, the internal intercostals and wall (to facilitate movement of the lungs during abdominal muscles may be involved in forcing air out of ventilation). the lungs. 22.3The Process of Breathing Respiratory volume describes the amount of air in a Pulmonary ventilation is the process of breathing, given space within the lungs, or which can be moved by which is driven by pressure differences between the the lung, and is dependent on a variety of factors. Tidal 990 22 • Chapter Review volume refers to the amount of air that enters the lungs pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. If ventilation is during quiet breathing,
