a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center. Thecontrol centeris the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value deviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. Aneffectoris the component in a feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.

(a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is regulated by negative feedback. In order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that is, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose, specific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic beta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat
