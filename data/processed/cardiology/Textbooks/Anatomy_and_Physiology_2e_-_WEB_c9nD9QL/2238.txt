branches supplying the brain. FIGURE20.26 Arteries Supplying the Head and Neck The common carotid artery gives rise to the external and internal carotid arteries. The external carotid artery remains superficial and gives rise to many arteries of the head. The internal carotid artery first forms the carotid sinus and then reaches the brain via the carotid canal and carotid foramen, emerging into the cranium via the foramen lacerum. The vertebral artery branches from the subclavian artery and passes through the transverse foramen in the cervical vertebrae, entering the base of the skull at the vertebral foramen. The subclavian artery continues toward the arm as the axillary artery. 850 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation FIGURE20.27 Arteries Serving the Brain This inferior view shows the network of arteries serving the brain. The structure is referred to as the arterial circle or circle of Willis. Aortic Arch Branches and Brain Circulation Vessel Description Single vessel located on the right side of the body; the first vessel branching from the aortic Brachiocephalic arch; gives rise to the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery; supplies artery blood to the head, neck, upper limb, and wall of the thoracic
