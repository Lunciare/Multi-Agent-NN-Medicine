benefits of moderate exercise are undeniable. Clinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis Any disorder that affects blood volume, vascular tone, or any other aspect of vascular functioning is likely to affect vascular homeostasis as well. That includes hypertension, hemorrhage, and shock. Hypertension and Hypotension New guidelines in 2017 from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association list normal blood pressure (BP) as less than 120/80 mm Hg and elevated BP as systolic P between 120–129 and diastolic P less than 80 mm Hg. Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically ashypertension. The new guidelines list hypertension that should be treated as 130/80 mm Hg. Tens of millions of Americans currently suffer from hypertension. Unfortunately, hypertension is typically a silent disorder; therefore, hypertensive patients may fail to recognize the seriousness of their condition and fail to follow their treatment plan. The result is often a heart attack or stroke. Hypertension may also lead to an aneurysm (ballooning of a blood vessel caused by a weakening of the wall), peripheral arterial disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of the body), chronic kidney disease, or heart failure.
