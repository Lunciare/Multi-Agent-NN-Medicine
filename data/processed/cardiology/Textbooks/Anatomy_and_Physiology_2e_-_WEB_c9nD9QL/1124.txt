Anatomy and Physiology

names are specific to whether the structure is central or peripheral. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as anucleus. In the PNS, a cluster of neuron cell bodies is referred to as aganglion.Figure 12.4indicates how the term nucleus has a few different meanings within anatomy and physiology. It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the center of a cell, where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS. There is also a potentially confusing use of the word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation. In the central nervous system, there is a group of nuclei that are connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before “ganglion” became accepted as a description for a peripheral structure. Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the “basal nuclei” to avoid confusion. 454 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue FIGURE12.4 What Is a Nucleus?
