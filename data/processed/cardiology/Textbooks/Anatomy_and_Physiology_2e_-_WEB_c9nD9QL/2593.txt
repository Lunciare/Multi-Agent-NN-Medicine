respiratory stimulus, motor neuron activation of skeletal muscles, bronchioles and alveolar ducts form, and extensive and the activation of proprioceptors in the muscles, vascularization occurs. Alveolar type I cells also begin joints, and tendons. As a result, hyperpnea related to to take shape. Type II pulmonary cells develop and exercise is initiated when exercise begins, as opposed begin to produce small amounts of surfactant. As the to when tissue oxygen demand actually increases. fetus grows, the respiratory system continues to expand as more alveoli develop and more surfactant is In contrast, acute exposure to a high altitude, produced. Beginning at about week 36 and lasting into particularly during times of physical exertion, does childhood, alveolar precursors mature to become fully result in low blood and tissue levels of oxygen. This functional alveoli. At birth, compression of the thoracic change is caused by a low partial pressure of oxygen in cavity forces much of the fluid in the lungs to be the air, because the atmospheric pressure at high expelled. The first inhalation inflates the lungs. Fetal altitudes is lower than the atmospheric pressure at sea breathing movements begin around week 20 or 21, and level. This can lead to a
