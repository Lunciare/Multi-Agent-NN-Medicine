Anatomy and Physiology

into the anterior and posterior tibial veins. Theanterior tibial veindrains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and combines with the posterior tibial vein and the fibular vein to form the popliteal vein. Theposterior tibial veindrains the posterior surface of the tibia and joins the popliteal vein. Thefibular veindrains the muscles and integument in proximity to the fibula and also joins the popliteal vein. Thesmall saphenous veinlocated on the lateral surface of the leg drains blood from the superficial regions of the lower leg and foot, and flows into to thepopliteal vein. As the popliteal vein passes behind the knee in the popliteal region, it becomes the femoral vein. It is palpable in patients without excessive adipose tissue. Close to the body wall, the great saphenous vein, the deep femoral vein, and the femoral circumflex vein drain into the femoral vein. Thegreat saphenous veinis a prominent surface vessel located on the medial surface of the leg and thigh that collects blood from the superficial portions of these areas. Thedeep femoral vein, as the name suggests, drains blood from the deeper portions of the thigh. Thefemoral circumflex veinforms a loop around the femur just inferior to the trochanters and drains blood
