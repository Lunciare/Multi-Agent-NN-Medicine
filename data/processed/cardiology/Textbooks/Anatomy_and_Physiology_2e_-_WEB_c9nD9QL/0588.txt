thus is not part of the skull (Figure 7.19). It is a small U-shaped bone located in the upper neck near the level of the inferior mandible, with the tips of the “U” pointing posteriorly. The hyoid serves as the base for the tongue above, and is attached to the larynx below and the pharynx posteriorly. The hyoid is held in position by a series of small muscles that attach to it either from above or below. These muscles act to move the hyoid up/down or forward/back. Movements of the hyoid are coordinated with movements of the tongue, larynx, and pharynx during swallowing and speaking. 248 7 • Axial Skeleton FIGURE7.19 Hyoid Bone The hyoid bone is located in the upper neck and does not join with any other bone. It provides attachments for muscles that act on the tongue, larynx, and pharynx. 7.3 The Vertebral Column LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe each region of the vertebral column and the number of bones in each region • Discuss the curves of the vertebral column and how these change after birth • Describe a typical vertebra and determine the distinguishing characteristics
