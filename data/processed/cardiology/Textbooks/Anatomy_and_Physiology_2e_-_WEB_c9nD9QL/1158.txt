Anatomy and Physiology

Sensory symptoms or motor deficits are common, and autonomic failures can lead to changes in the heart rhythm or a drop in blood pressure, especially when standing, which causes dizziness. 12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Distinguish the major functions of the nervous system: sensation, integration, and response • List the sequence of events in a simple sensory receptor–motor response pathway Having looked at the components of nervous tissue, and the basic anatomy of the nervous system, next comes an understanding of how nervous tissue is capable of communicating within the nervous system. Before getting to the nuts and bolts of how this works, an illustration of how the components come together will be helpful. An example is summarized inFigure 12.14. FIGURE12.14 Testing the Water (1) The sensory neuron has endings in the skin that sense a stimulus such as water temperature. The strength of the signal that starts here is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. (2) The graded potential from the sensory endings, if strong enough, will initiate an action potential at the initial segment of the axon (which is immediately adjacent to
