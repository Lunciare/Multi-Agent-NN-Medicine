On the anterior side of the proximal tibia is epiphyses. Each secondary ossification center is the tibial tuberosity, which is continuous inferiorly with separated from the primary ossification center by an the anterior border of the tibia. On the posterior side, epiphyseal plate. Continued growth of the epiphyseal the proximal tibia has the curved soleal line. The bony plate cartilage provides for bone lengthening. expansion on the medial side of the distal tibia is the Disappearance of the epiphyseal plate is followed by medial malleolus. The groove on the lateral side of the fusion of the bony components to form a single, adult distal tibia is the fibular notch. bone. The head of the fibula forms the proximal end and The clavicle develops via intramembranous articulates with the underside of the lateral condyle of ossification, in which mesenchyme is converted the tibia. The distal fibula articulates with the fibular directly into bone tissue. Ossification within the clavicle notch of the tibia. The expanded distal end of the fibula
