the femoral region of the lower leg (Figure 20.33). As it passes through the body wall, it is renamed thefemoral artery. It gives off several smaller branches as well as the lateraldeep femoral arterythat in turn gives rise to alateral circumflex artery. These arteries supply blood to the deep muscles of the thigh as well as ventral and lateral regions of the integument. The femoral artery also gives rise to thegenicular artery, which provides blood to the region of the knee. As the femoral artery passes posterior to the knee near the popliteal fossa, it is called the popliteal artery. Thepopliteal arterybranches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Theanterior tibial arteryis located between the tibia and fibula, and supplies blood to the muscles and integument of the anterior tibial region. Upon reaching the tarsal region, it becomes thedorsalis pedis artery, which branches repeatedly and provides blood to the tarsal and dorsal regions of the foot. Theposterior tibial arteryprovides blood to the muscles and integument on the posterior surface of the tibial region. The fibular or peroneal artery branches from the posterior tibial artery. It bifurcates and becomes themedial plantar arteryandlateral plantar artery, providing blood to the plantar surfaces. There
