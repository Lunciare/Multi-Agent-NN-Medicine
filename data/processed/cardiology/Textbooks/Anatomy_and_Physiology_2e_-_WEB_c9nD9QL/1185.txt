than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but only by a stronger stimulus than the one that initiated the current action potential. This is because of the flow of K+ out of the cell. Because that ion is rushing out, any Na+that tries to enter will not depolarize the cell, but will only keep the cell from hyperpolarizing. FIGURE12.24 Stages of an Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the events of the action potential can be related to specific changes in the membrane voltage. (1) At rest, the membrane voltage is -70 mV. (2) The membrane begins to depolarize when an external stimulus is applied. (3) The membrane voltage begins a rapid rise toward +30 mV. (4) The membrane voltage starts to return to a negative value. (5) Repolarization continues past the resting membrane voltage, resulting in hyperpolarization. (6) The membrane voltage returns to the resting value shortly after hyperpolarization. Propagation of the Action Potential The action potential is initiated at the beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment. There is a high density of voltage-gated Na+channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here. Going down the
