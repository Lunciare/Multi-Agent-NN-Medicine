have an allele for an enzyme that facilitates the production of surface antigen A on their erythrocytes. This allele is designatedIA. In the same manner, people are blood type B if they express an enzyme for the production of surface antigen B. People who have alleles for both enzymes (IAandIB) produce both surface antigens A and B. As a result, they are blood type AB. Because the effect of both alleles (or enzymes) is observed, we say that theIAandIBalleles are codominant. There is also a third allele that determines blood type. This allele (i) produces a nonfunctional enzyme. People who have twoialleles do not produce either A or B surface antigens: they have type O blood. If a person hasIAandialleles, the person will have blood type A. Notice that it does not make any difference whether a person has twoIAalleles or oneIAand oneiallele. In both cases, the person is blood type A. BecauseIAmasksi, we say thatIAis dominant toi.
