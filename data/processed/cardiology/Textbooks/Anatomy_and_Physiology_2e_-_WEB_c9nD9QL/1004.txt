Anatomy and Physiology

the organization of actin three mechanisms for ATP regeneration are creatine and myosin resulting in the banding pattern of phosphate, anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic myofibrils. metabolism. Creatine phosphate provides about the 10.3Muscle Fiber Contraction and first 15 seconds of ATP at the beginning of muscle Relaxation contraction. Anaerobic glycolysis produces small amounts of ATP in the absence of oxygen for a short A sarcomere is the smallest contractile portion of a period. Aerobic metabolism utilizes oxygen to produce muscle. Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin much more ATP, allowing a muscle to work for longer filaments. Thick filaments are composed of the protein periods. Muscle fatigue, which has many contributing myosin; thin filaments are composed of the protein factors, occurs when muscle can no longer contract. An actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory oxygen debt is created as a result of muscle use. The proteins. three types of muscle fiber are slow oxidative (SO), fast Muscle contraction is described by the sliding filament oxidative (FO) and fast glycolytic (FG). SO fibers use model of contraction. ACh is the neurotransmitter that aerobic metabolism to produce low power contractions binds at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger over long periods and
