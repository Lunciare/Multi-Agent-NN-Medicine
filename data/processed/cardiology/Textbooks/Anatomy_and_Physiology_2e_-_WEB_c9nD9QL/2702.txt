through the liver. This largely explains why the liver is the most common site for the metastasis of cancers that originate in the alimentary canal. FIGURE23.25 Microscopic Anatomy of the Liver The liver receives oxygenated blood from the hepatic artery and nutrient-rich deoxygenated blood from the hepatic portal vein. 1034 23 • The Digestive System Histology The liver has three main components: hepatocytes, bile canaliculi, and hepatic sinusoids. Ahepatocyteis the liver’s main cell type, accounting for around 80 percent of the liver's volume. These cells play a role in a wide variety of secretory, metabolic, and endocrine functions. Plates of hepatocytes called hepatic laminae radiate outward from the portal vein in eachhepatic lobule. Between adjacent hepatocytes, grooves in the cell membranes provide room for eachbile canaliculus(plural = canaliculi). These small ducts accumulate the bile produced by hepatocytes. From here, bile flows first into bile ductules and then into bile ducts. The bile ducts unite to form the larger right and left hepatic ducts, which themselves merge and exit the liver as thecommon hepatic duct. This duct then joins with the cystic duct from the gallbladder, forming thecommon bile ductthrough which bile flows into the small intestine. Ahepatic sinusoidis an open,
