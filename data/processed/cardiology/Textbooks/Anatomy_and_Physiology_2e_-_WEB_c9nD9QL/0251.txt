a region of DNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The triplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the complementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26). Acodonis a three-base sequence of mRNA, so-called because they directly encode amino acids. Like DNA replication, there are three stages to transcription: initiation, elongation, and termination. FIGURE3.26 Transcription: from DNA to mRNA In the first of the two stages of making protein from DNA, a gene on the DNA molecule is transcribed into a complementary mRNA molecule. Stage 1: Initiation.A region at the beginning of the gene called apromoter—a particular sequence of nucleotides—triggers the start of transcription. Stage 2: Elongation.Transcription starts when RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA segment. One strand, referred to as the coding strand, becomes the template with the genes to be coded. The polymerase then aligns the correct nucleic acid (A, C, G, or U) with its complementary base on the coding strand of DNA.RNA polymeraseis an enzyme that adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA. This process builds a strand of mRNA. Stage 3: Termination.At the
