membrane to the interstitial space around the PCT (Figure 25.19). At the same time this is occurring, a Na+/H+antiporter excretes H+into the lumen, while it recovers Na+. Note how the hydrogen ion is recycled so that bicarbonate can be recovered. Also, note that a Na+gradient is created by the Na+/K+pump. The significant recovery of solutes from the PCT lumen to the interstitial space creates an osmotic gradient that promotes water recovery. As noted before, water moves through channels created by the aquaporin proteins. These proteins are found in all cells in varying amounts and help regulate water movement across membranes and through cells by creating a passageway across the hydrophobic lipid bilayer membrane. Changing the number of aquaporin proteins in membranes of the collecting ducts also helps to regulate the osmolarity of the blood. The movement of many positively charged ions also creates an electrochemical gradient. This charge promotes the movement of negative ions toward the interstitial spaces and the movement of positive ions toward the lumen. 1134 25 • The Urinary System FIGURE25.19 Reabsorption of Bicarbonate from the PCT Reabsorption and Secretion in the Loop of Henle The loop of Henle consists of two sections: thick and thin descending
