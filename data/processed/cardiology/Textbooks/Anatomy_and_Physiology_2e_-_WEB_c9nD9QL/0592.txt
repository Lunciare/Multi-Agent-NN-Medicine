Anatomy and Physiology

The four adult curvatures are classified as either primary or secondary curvatures. Primary curves are retained from the original fetal curvature, while secondary curvatures develop after birth. 250 7 • Axial Skeleton During fetal development, the body is flexed anteriorly into the fetal position, giving the entire vertebral column a single curvature that is concave anteriorly. In the adult, this fetal curvature is retained in two regions of the vertebral column as thethoracic curve, which involves the thoracic vertebrae, and thesacrococcygeal curve, formed by the sacrum and coccyx. Each of these is thus called aprimary curvebecause they are retained from the original fetal curvature of the vertebral column. Asecondary curvedevelops gradually after birth as the child learns to sit upright, stand, and walk. Secondary curves are concave posteriorly, opposite in direction to the original fetal curvature. Thecervical curveof the neck region develops as the infant begins to hold their head upright when sitting. Later, as the child begins to stand and then to walk, thelumbar curveof the lower back develops. In adults, the lumbar curve is generally deeper in females. Disorders associated with the curvature of the spine includekyphosis(an excessive posterior curvature of the thoracic region),lordosis(an excessive anterior curvature of
