Anatomy and Physiology

rounded portion of a bone is enclosed within a ring formed partially by the articulation with another bone and partially by a ligament (seeFigure 9.10a). The bone rotates within this ring. Since the rotation is around a single axis, pivot joints are functionally classified as a uniaxial diarthrosis type of joint. An example of a pivot joint is the atlantoaxial joint, found between the C1 (atlas) and C2 (axis) vertebrae. Here, the upward projecting dens of the axis articulates with the inner aspect of the atlas, where it is held in place by a ligament.

Here, the head of the radius is largely encircled by a ligament that holds it in place as it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna. Rotation of the radius allows for forearm movements. Hinge Joint In ahinge joint, the convex end of one bone articulates with the concave end of the adjoining bone (seeFigure 9.10b). This type of joint allows only for bending and straightening motions along a single
