convex, umbrella shaped, apical surfaces. As the bladder fills with urine, this epithelium loses its convolutions and the apical cells transition from cuboidal to squamous. It appears thicker and more multi-layered when the bladder is empty, and more stretched out and less stratified when the bladder is full and distended.Figure 4.8summarizes the different categories of epithelial cell tissue cells. 136 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization FIGURE4.8 Summary of Epithelial Tissue Cells INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( find out more about the anatomy of epithelial tissues.

Most glands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as anendocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or anexocrine glandwhose secretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”). Endocrine Glands The secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused into the bloodstream,
