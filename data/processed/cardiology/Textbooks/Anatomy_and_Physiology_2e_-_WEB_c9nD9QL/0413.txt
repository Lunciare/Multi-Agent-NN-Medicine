Anatomy and Physiology

of sweat glands and sebaceous glands Accessory structures of the skin include hair, nails, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. These structures embryologically originate from the epidermis and can extend down through the dermis into the hypodermis. Hair Hairis a keratinous filament growing out of the epidermis. It is primarily made of dead, keratinized cells. Strands of hair originate in an epidermal penetration of the dermis called thehair follicle. Thehair shaftis the part of the hair not anchored to the follicle, and much of this is exposed at the skin’s surface. The rest of the hair, which is anchored in the follicle, lies below the surface of the skin and is referred to as thehair root. The hair root ends deep in the dermis at thehair bulb, and includes a layer of mitotically active basal cells called thehair matrix. The hair bulb surrounds thehair papilla, which is made of connective tissue and contains blood capillaries and nerve endings from the dermis (Figure 5.11).

Just as the basal layer of the epidermis forms the layers of
