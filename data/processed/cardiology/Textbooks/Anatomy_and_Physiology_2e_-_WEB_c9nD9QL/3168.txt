is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are calledtrophoblasts(trophe = “to feed” or “to nourish”). These cells will develop into the chorionic sac and the fetal portion of theplacenta(the organ of nutrient, waste, and gas exchange between a pregnant person and the developing offspring). The inner mass of embryonic cells is totipotent during this stage, meaning that each cell has the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the human body. Totipotency lasts for only a few days before the cells’ fates are set as being the precursors to a specific lineage of cells.

As the blastocyst forms, the trophoblast excretes enzymes that begin to degrade the zona pellucida. In a process called “hatching,” the conceptus breaks free of the zona pellucida in preparation for implantation. INTERACTIVE LINK View this time-lapsemovie( a conceptus starting at day 3.
