system. Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed in the gut uses this system. Cells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their way from interstitial spaces back into the circulation, but they also use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical immune responses. Alymph nodeis one of the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thiswebsite( an overview of the lymphatic system. What are the three main components of the lymphatic system? Structure of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic vessels begin as a blind ending, or closed at one end, capillaries, which feed into larger and larger lymphatic vessels, and eventually empty into the bloodstream by a series of ducts. Along the way, the lymph travels through the lymph nodes, which are commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen. Humans have about 500–600 lymph nodes throughout the body (Figure 21.2).
