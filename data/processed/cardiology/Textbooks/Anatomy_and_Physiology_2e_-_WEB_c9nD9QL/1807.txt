loss. Chronically elevated glucose levels are also associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition to hyperglycemia, chronically elevated glucocorticoids compromise immunity, resistance to infection, and memory, and can result in rapid weight gain and hair loss. In contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in Addison’s disease, a rare disorder that causes low blood glucose levels and low blood sodium levels. The signs and symptoms of Addison’s disease are vague and are typical of other disorders as well, making diagnosis difficult. They may include general weakness, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food. 17.7 The Pineal Gland LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland • Discuss the function of melatonin Recall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain, sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the thalamus. Inferior but somewhat posterior to the thalamus is thepineal gland, a tiny endocrine gland whose functions are not entirely clear. Thepinealocytecells that make up the pineal gland are known to produce and secrete the amine hormonemelatonin, which is derived from serotonin. The secretion of melatonin
