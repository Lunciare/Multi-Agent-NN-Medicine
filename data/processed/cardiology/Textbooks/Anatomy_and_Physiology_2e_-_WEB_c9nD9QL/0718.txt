the larger, weight-bearing bone located on the medial side of the leg. The fibula is the slender bone of the lateral side of the leg and does not bear weight. The proximal end of the tibia is greatly expanded. The two sides of this expansion form themedial condyle of the tibiaand thelateral condyle of the tibia. The tibia does not have epicondyles. The top surface of each condyle is smooth and flattened. These areas articulate with the medial and lateral condyles of the femur to form theknee joint. Between the articulating surfaces of the tibial condyles is theintercondylar eminence, an irregular, elevated area that serves as the inferior attachment point for two supporting ligaments of the knee. Thetibial tuberosityis an elevated area on the anterior side of the tibia, near its proximal end. It is the final site of attachment for the muscle tendon associated with the patella. More inferiorly, theshaft of the tibiabecomes triangular in shape. The anterior apex of this triangle forms theanterior border of the tibia, which begins at the tibial tuberosity and runs inferiorly along the length of the tibia. Both the anterior border and the medial side of the triangular shaft are located immediately under
