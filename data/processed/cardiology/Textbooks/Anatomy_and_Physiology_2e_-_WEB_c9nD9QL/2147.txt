vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of smooth muscle. The importance of the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of blood pressure. The precise diameter of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and chemical controls, and vasoconstriction and vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for distribution of blood flow. Capillaries Acapillaryis a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues, a process calledperfusion. Exchange of gases and other substances occurs between the blood in capillaries and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid (interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5–10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described asmicrocirculation. The wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by a basement membrane with occasional Access for free at openstax.org 20.1 • Structure and Function of Blood Vessels 815 smooth muscle fibers. There is some variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial cells bordering each other may line the lumen; in a small capillary, there may be only a single
