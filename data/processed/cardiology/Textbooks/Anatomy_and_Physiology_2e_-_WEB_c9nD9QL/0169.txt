the nucleus of transfer of components an atom functional group group of atoms linked by strong base compound that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) in covalent bonds that tends to behave as a distinct solution unit in chemical reactions with other atoms bond electrical force linking atoms hydrogen bond dipole-dipole bond in which a buffer solution containing a weak acid or a weak base hydrogen atom covalently bonded to an that opposes wide fluctuations in the pH of body electronegative atom is weakly attracted to a fluids second electronegative atom carbohydrate class of organic compounds built from inorganic compound substance that does not contain sugars, molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and both carbon and hydrogen oxygen in a 1-2-1 ratio ion atom with an overall positive or negative charge catalyst substance that increases the rate of a ionic bond attraction between an anion and a cation chemical reaction without itself being changed in isotope one of the variations of an element in which the process the number of neutrons differ from each other cation atom with a positive charge kinetic energy energy that matter possesses because chemical energy form of energy that is absorbed as of its motion chemical bonds form, stored
