Anatomy and Physiology

is the muscular sac that into primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles. Early holds the testes outside of the body cavity. tertiary follicles with their fluid-filled antrum will be stimulated by an increase in FSH, a gonadotropin Spermatogenesis begins with mitotic division of produced by the anterior pituitary, to grow in the spermatogonia (stem cells) to produce primary 28-day ovarian cycle. Supporting granulosa and theca spermatocytes that undergo the two divisions of cells in the growing follicles produce estrogens, until meiosis to become secondary spermatocytes, then the the level of estrogen in the bloodstream is high enough haploid spermatids. During spermiogenesis, that it triggers negative feedback at the hypothalamus spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa (formed and pituitary. This results in a reduction of FSH and LH, sperm). Upon release from the seminiferous tubules, and most tertiary follicles in the ovary undergo atresia sperm are moved to the epididymis where they (they die). One follicle, usually the one with the most continue to mature. During ejaculation, sperm exit the FSH receptors, survives this period and is now called epididymis through the ductus deferens, a duct in the the dominant follicle. The dominant follicle produces spermatic cord that leaves the scrotum. The ampulla
