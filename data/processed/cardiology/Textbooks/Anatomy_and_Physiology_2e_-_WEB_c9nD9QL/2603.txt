about the apple, but your stomach and intestines are busy digesting it and absorbing its vitamins and other nutrients. By the time any waste material is excreted, the body has appropriated all it can use from the apple. In short, whether you pay attention or not, the organs of the digestive system perform their specific functions, allowing you to use the food you eat to keep you going. This chapter examines the structure and functions of these organs, and explores the mechanics and chemistry of the digestive processes. 23.1 Overview of the Digestive System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the organs of the alimentary canal from proximal to distal, and briefly state their function • Identify the accessory digestive organs and briefly state their function • Describe the four fundamental tissue layers of the alimentary canal • Contrast the contributions of the enteric and autonomic nervous systems to digestive system functioning • Explain how the peritoneum anchors the digestive organs 996 23 • The Digestive System The function of the digestive system is to break down the foods you eat, release their nutrients, and absorb those nutrients into the body.
