Anatomy and Physiology

gray matter and white matter structures of the nervous system to the structure of neurons • List the basic functions of the nervous system The picture you have in your mind of the nervous system probably includes thebrain, the nervous tissue contained within the cranium, and thespinal cord, the extension of nervous tissue within the vertebral column. That suggests it is made of two organs—and you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a very complex structure. Within the brain, many different and separate regions are responsible for many different and separate functions. It is as if the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and can only be differentiated using tools such as the microscope or electrophysiology. In comparison, it is easy to see that the stomach is different than the esophagus or the liver, so you can imagine the digestive system as a collection of specific organs. The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems The nervous system can be divided into two major regions: the central and peripheral nervous systems. Thecentral nervous system (CNS)is the brain and spinal cord, and theperipheral nervous system (PNS)is everything else (Figure
