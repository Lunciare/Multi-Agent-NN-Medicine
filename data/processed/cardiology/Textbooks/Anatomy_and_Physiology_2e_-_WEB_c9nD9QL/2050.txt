of an ECG. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thissite( a more detailed analysis of ECGs. FIGURE19.23 Electrocardiogram A normal tracing shows the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. Also indicated are the PR, QT, QRS, and ST intervals, plus the P-R and S-T segments. FIGURE19.24 ECG Tracing Correlated to the Cardiac Cycle This diagram correlates an ECG tracing with the electrical and mechanical events of a heart contraction. Each segment of an ECG tracing corresponds to one event in the cardiac cycle. Everyday Connection ECG Abnormalities Occassionally, an area of the heart other than the SA node will initiate an impulse that will be followed by a Access for free at openstax.org 19.2 • Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity 781 premature contraction. Such an area, which may actually be a component of the conduction system or some other contractile cells, is known as an ectopic focus or ectopic pacemaker. An ectopic focus may be stimulated by localized ischemia; exposure to certain drugs, including caffeine, digitalis, or acetylcholine; elevated stimulation by both sympathetic or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system; or a number of disease or pathological conditions. Occasional occurences are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes
