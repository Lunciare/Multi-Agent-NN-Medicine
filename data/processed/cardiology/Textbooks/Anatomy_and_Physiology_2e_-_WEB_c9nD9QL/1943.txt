0.7 3.6 3.9 4.7 8.0 TABLE18.2 In contrast to the ABO group antibodies, which are preformed, antibodies to the Rh antigen are produced only in Rh− individuals after exposure to the antigen. This process, called sensitization, occurs following a transfusion with Rh- incompatible blood or, more commonly, with the birth of an Rh+baby to an Rh−person. Problems are rare in a first pregnancy, since the baby’s Rh+cells rarely cross the placenta (the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the fetus and the pregnant person). However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh−parent can be exposed to the baby’s Rh+cells (Figure 18.15). Research has shown that this occurs in about 13−14 percent of such pregnancies. After exposure, the immune system of the person who has given birth begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies. If the same person should then become pregnant with another Rh+baby, the Rh antibodies they have produced can cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy the fetal RBCs. This condition, known ashemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly
