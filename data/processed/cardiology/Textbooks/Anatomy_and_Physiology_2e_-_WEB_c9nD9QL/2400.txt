TGF-β and IL-10 TABLE21.5 21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how B cells mature and how B cell tolerance develops • Discuss how B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells • Describe the structure of the antibody classes and their functions Antibodies were the first component of the adaptive immune response to be characterized by scientists working on the immune system. It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re- Access for free at openstax.org 21.4 • The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies 921 infection with the same pathogen. Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a fresh culture of the same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope. The
