thisvideo( a tutorial on the anatomy of the hip joint. What is a possible consequence following a fracture of the femoral neck within the capsule of the hip joint? INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn more about the anatomy of the hip joint, including bones, joints, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Where is the articular cartilage thickest within the hip joint? Knee Joint The knee joint is the largest joint of the body (Figure 9.19). It actually consists of three articulations. The femoropatellar jointis found between the patella and the distal femur. Themedial tibiofemoral jointandlateral tibiofemoral jointare located between the medial and lateral condyles of the femur and the medial and lateral 340 9 • Joints condyles of the tibia. All of these articulations are enclosed within a single articular capsule. The knee functions as a hinge joint, allowing flexion and extension of the leg. This action is generated by both rolling and gliding motions of the femur on the tibia. In addition, some rotation of the leg is available when the knee is flexed, but not when extended. The knee is well constructed for weight bearing in its extended position, but is vulnerable to injuries associated with hyperextension, twisting, or
