Anatomy and Physiology

at lower rates than those of nonathletes. Enlarged hearts are not always a result of exercise; they can result from pathologies, such ashypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cause of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown, but the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in apparently otherwise healthy young people. Chambers and Circulation through the Heart The human heart consists of four chambers: The left side and the right side each have oneatriumand one ventricle. Each of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left ventricle. The ventricles serve as the primary pumping chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body. There are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Although both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases. Thepulmonary circuittransports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers carbon dioxide for exhalation. Thesystemic circuittransports oxygenated blood to virtually all
