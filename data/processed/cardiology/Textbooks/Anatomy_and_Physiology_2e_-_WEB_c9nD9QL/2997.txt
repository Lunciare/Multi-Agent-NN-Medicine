part to assist drainage, massage and compression of the areas to move the fluid out of the tissues, and decreased salt intake to decrease sodium and water retention. 26.2 Water Balance LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how water levels in the body influence the thirst cycle • Identify the main route by which water leaves the body • Describe the role of ADH and its effect on body water levels • Define dehydration and identify common causes of dehydration On a typical day, the average adult will take in about 2500 mL (almost 3 quarts) of aqueous fluids. Although most of the intake comes through the digestive tract, about 230 mL (8 ounces) per day is generated metabolically, in the last steps of aerobic respiration. Additionally, each day about the same volume (2500 mL) of water leaves the body by different routes; most of this lost water is removed as urine. The kidneys also can adjust blood volume though mechanisms that draw water out of the filtrate and urine. The kidneys can regulate water levels in the body; they conserve water if you are dehydrated, and they can make urine
