insertions. From the sides and the back of the neck, thesplenius capitisinserts onto the head region, and thesplenius cervicisextends onto the cervical region. These muscles can extend the head, laterally flex it, and rotate it (Figure 11.15).

Theerector spinae groupforms the majority of the muscle mass of the back and it is the primary extensor of the vertebral column. It controls flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation of the vertebral column, and maintains the lumbar curve. The erector spinae comprises the iliocostalis (laterally placed) group, the longissimus (intermediately placed) group, and the spinalis (medially placed) group. Theiliocostalis groupincludes theiliocostalis cervicis, associated with the cervical region; theiliocostalis thoracis, associated with the thoracic region; and theiliocostalis lumborum, associated with the lumbar region. The three muscles of thelongissimus groupare thelongissimus capitis, associated with the head region; the longissimus cervicis, associated with the cervical region; and thelongissimus thoracis, associated with the thoracic region. The third group, thespinalis group, comprises thespinalis capitis(head region), thespinalis cervicis(cervical region), and
