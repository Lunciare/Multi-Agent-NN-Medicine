The oculomotor fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both initiate salivation. The vagus nerve primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. INTERACTIVE LINK Visit thissite( read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of vision.
