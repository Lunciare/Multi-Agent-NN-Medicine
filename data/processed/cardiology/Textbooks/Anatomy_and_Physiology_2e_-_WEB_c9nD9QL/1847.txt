Anatomy and Physiology

levels are closely Hormones are released upon stimulation that is of regulated. The parathyroid glands are small structures either chemical or neural origin. Regulation of hormone located on the posterior thyroid gland that produce release is primarily achieved through negative parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates blood feedback. Various stimuli may cause the release of calcium levels. Low blood calcium levels cause the hormones, but there are three major types. Humoral production and secretion of PTH. In contrast, elevated stimuli are changes in ion or nutrient levels in the blood calcium levels inhibit secretion of PTH and blood. Hormonal stimuli are changes in hormone levels trigger secretion of the thyroid hormone calcitonin. that initiate or inhibit the secretion of another Underproduction of PTH can result in hormone. Finally, a neural stimulus occurs when a hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of nerve impulse prompts the secretion or inhibition of a PTH can result in hyperparathyroidism. hormone. 17.6The Adrenal Glands 17.3The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, The hypothalamus–pituitary complex is located in the consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal diencephalon of the brain.
