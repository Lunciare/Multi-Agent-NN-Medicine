hair shaft dermis layer of skin between the epidermis and keloid type of scar that has layers raised above the hypodermis, composed mainly of connective tissue skin surface and containing blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat keratin type of structural protein that gives skin, hair, glands, and other structures and nails its hard, water-resistant properties desmosome structure that forms an impermeable keratinocyte cell that produces keratin and is the junction between cells most predominant type of cell found in the eccrine sweat gland type of sweat gland that is epidermis common throughout the skin surface; it produces a keratohyalin granulated protein found in the stratum hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation granulosum eczema skin condition due to an allergic reaction, Langerhans cell specialized dendritic cell found in which resembles a rash the stratum spinosum that functions as a elastin fibers fibers made of the protein elastin that macrophage increase the elasticity of the dermis lunula basal part of the nail body that consists of a eleiden clear protein-bound lipid found in the crescent-shaped layer of thick epithelium stratum lucidum that is derived from keratohyalin medulla in hair, the innermost layer of keratinocytes and helps to prevent water loss originating from the hair matrix
