is in metabolic acidosis. The most common cause of metabolic acidosis is the presence of organic acids or excessive ketone bodies in the blood.Table 26.2lists some other causes of metabolic acidosis. Common Causes of Metabolic Acidosis and Blood Metabolites Cause Metabolite Diarrhea Bicarbonate Uremia Phosphoric, sulfuric, and lactic acids Diabetic ketoacidosis Increased ketone bodies Strenuous exercise Lactic acid Methanol Formic acid* Paraldehyde β-Hydroxybutyric acid* Isopropanol Propionic acid* Ethylene glycol Glycolic acid, and some oxalic and formic acids* Salicylate/aspirin Sulfasalicylic acid (SSA)* TABLE26.2*Acid metabolites from ingested chemical. The first three of the eight causes of metabolic acidosis listed are medical (or unusual physiological) conditions. 1178 26 • Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Balance Strenuous exercise can cause temporary metabolic acidosis due to the production of lactic acid. The last five causes result from the ingestion of specific substances. The active form of aspirin is its metabolite, sulfasalicylic acid. An overdose of aspirin causes acidosis due to the acidity of this metabolite. Metabolic acidosis can also result from uremia, which is the retention of urea and uric acid. Metabolic acidosis can also arise from diabetic ketoacidosis, wherein an excess of ketone bodies are present in the blood. Other causes of metabolic acidosis are
