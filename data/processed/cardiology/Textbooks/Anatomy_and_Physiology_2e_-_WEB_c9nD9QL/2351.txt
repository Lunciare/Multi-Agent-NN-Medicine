visible in the center. The white reference bar is 1 cm. Thymus Thethymusgland is a bilobed organ found in the space between the sternum and the aorta of the heart (Figure 21.7). Connective tissue holds the lobes closely together but also separates them and forms a capsule. FIGURE21.7 Location, Structure, and Histology of the Thymus The thymus lies above the heart. The trabeculae and lobules, including the darkly staining cortex and the lighter staining medulla of each lobule, are clearly visible in the light micrograph of the thymus of a newborn. LM × 100.

The connective tissue capsule further divides the thymus into lobules via extensions called trabeculae. The outer region of the organ is known as the cortex and contains large numbers of thymocytes with some epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (two types of phagocytic cells that are derived from monocytes). The cortex is Access for free at openstax.org 21.1 • Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems 901 densely packed so it stains more intensely than the rest of
