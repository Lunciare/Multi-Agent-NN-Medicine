aspect of the palm, and theintermediatemuscles are midpalmar. The thenar muscles include theabductor pollicis brevis,opponens pollicis,flexor pollicis brevis, and the adductor pollicis. These muscles form thethenar eminence, the rounded contour of the base of the thumb, and all act on the thumb. The movements of the thumb play an integral role in most precise movements of the hand. The hypothenar muscles include theabductor digiti minimi,flexor digiti minimi brevis, and theopponens digiti minimi. These muscles form thehypothenar eminence, the rounded contour of the little finger, and as such, they all act on the little finger. Finally, the intermediate muscles act on all the fingers and include thelumbrical, the palmar interossei, and thedorsal interossei. FIGURE11.28 Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within the hand. These muscles provide the fine motor control of the fingers by flexing, extending, abducting, and adducting the more distal finger and thumb segments.
