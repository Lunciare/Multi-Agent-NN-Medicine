a large prominence, themastoid process, which serves as a muscle attachment site. The mastoid process can easily be felt on the side of the head just behind your earlobe. On the interior of the skull, the petrous portion of each temporal bone forms the prominent, diagonally orientedpetrous ridgein the floor of the cranial cavity. Located inside each petrous ridge are small cavities that house the structures of the middle and inner ears. 234 7 • Axial Skeleton FIGURE7.7 Temporal Bone A lateral view of the isolated temporal bone shows the squamous, mastoid, and zygomatic portions of the temporal bone. Important landmarks of the temporal bone, as shown inFigure 7.8, include the following: • External acoustic meatus(ear canal)—This is the large opening on the lateral side of the skull that is associated with the ear. • Internal acoustic meatus—This opening is located inside the cranial cavity, on the medial side of the petrous ridge. It connects to the middle and inner ear cavities of the temporal bone. • Mandibular fossa—This is the deep, oval-shaped depression located on the external base of the skull, just in front of the external acoustic meatus. The mandible (lower jaw) joins with the skull at this
