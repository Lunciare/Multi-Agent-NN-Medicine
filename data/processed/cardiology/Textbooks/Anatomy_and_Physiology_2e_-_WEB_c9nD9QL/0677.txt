bones, each called ametacarpal bone. The fingers and thumb contain a total of 14 bones, each of which is aphalanx bone of the hand. Humerus The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm region (Figure 8.5). At its proximal end is thehead of the humerus. This is the large, round, smooth region that faces medially. The head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The margin of the smooth area of the head is theanatomical neckof the humerus. Located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus is an expanded bony area called the greater tubercle. The smallerlesser tubercleof the humerus is found on the anterior aspect of the humerus. Both the greater and lesser tubercles serve as attachment sites for muscles that act across the shoulder joint. Passing between the greater and lesser tubercles is the narrowintertubercular groove (sulcus), which is also known as the bicipital groovebecause it provides passage for a tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. Thesurgical neckis located at the base of the expanded, proximal end of the humerus, where it joins the narrowshaft of the humerus. The surgical neck is a common site of arm fractures.
