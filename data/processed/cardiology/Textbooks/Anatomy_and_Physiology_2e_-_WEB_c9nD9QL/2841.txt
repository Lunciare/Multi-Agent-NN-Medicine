aid in digestive molecules, which provide electrons to the oxidative processes, and digestive proenzymes are released phosphorylation process that generates more high- from the pancreas (trypsinogen and energy ATP molecules. For each molecule of glucose chymotrypsinogen). Enterokinase, an enzyme located that is processed in glycolysis, a net of 36 ATPs can be in the wall of the small intestine, activates trypsin, created by aerobic respiration. which in turn activates chymotrypsin. These enzymes liberate the individual amino acids that are then Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited transported via sodium-amino acid transporters across to those generated by glycolysis. While a total of four the intestinal wall into the cell. The amino acids are ATPs are produced by glycolysis, two are needed to then transported into the bloodstream for dispersal to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP the liver and cells throughout the body to be used to molecules. create new proteins. When in excess, the amino acids In conditions of low glucose, such as fasting, are processed and stored as glucose or ketones. The starvation, or low carbohydrate diets, glucose can be nitrogen waste that is liberated in this process is synthesized from lactate, pyruvate,
