necessary for carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism • Explain the processes that regulate glucose levels during the absorptive and postabsorptive states • Explain how metabolism is essential to maintaining body temperature (thermoregulation) • Summarize the importance of vitamins and minerals in the diet INTRODUCTION Eating is essential to life. Many of us look to eating as not only a necessity, but also a pleasure. You may have been told since childhood to start the day with a good breakfast to give you the energy to get through most of the day. You most likely have heard about the importance of a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables. But what does this all mean to your body and the physiological processes it carries out each day? You need to absorb a range of nutrients so that your cells have the building blocks for metabolic processes that release the energy for the cells to carry out their daily jobs, to manufacture new proteins, cells, and body parts, and to recycle materials in the cell. This chapter will take you through some of the chemical reactions essential to life, the sum of which is referred to as metabolism. The focus of
