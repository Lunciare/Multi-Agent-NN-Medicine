stomach through vomiting, potassium depletion due to the use of diuretics for hypertension, and the excessive use of laxatives. Respiratory Acidosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO Excess 2 Respiratory acidosisoccurs when the blood is overly acidic due to an excess of carbonic acid, resulting from too much CO in the blood. Respiratory acidosis can result from anything that interferes with respiration, such as 2 pneumonia, emphysema, or congestive heart failure. Respiratory Alkalosis: Primary Carbonic Acid/CO Deficiency 2 Respiratory alkalosisoccurs when the blood is overly alkaline due to a deficiency in carbonic acid and CO levels in 2 the blood. This condition usually occurs when too much CO is exhaled from the lungs, as occurs in hyperventilation, 2 which is breathing that is deeper or more frequent than normal. An elevated respiratory rate leading to hyperventilation can be due to extreme emotional upset or fear, fever, infections, hypoxia, or abnormally high levels of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Surprisingly, aspirin overdose—salicylate toxicity—can result in respiratory alkalosis as the body tries to compensate for initial acidosis.
