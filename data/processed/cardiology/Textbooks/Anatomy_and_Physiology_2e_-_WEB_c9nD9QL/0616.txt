Anatomy and Physiology

junction between these two components is not flat, but forms a slight bend. The second rib attaches to the sternum at the sternal angle. Since the first rib is hidden behind the clavicle, the second rib is the highest rib that can be identified by palpation. Thus, the sternal angle and second rib are important landmarks for the identification and counting of the lower ribs. Ribs 3–7 attach to the sternal body. The inferior tip of the sternum is thexiphoid process. This small structure is cartilaginous early in life, but gradually becomes ossified starting during middle age. Ribs Each rib is a curved, flattened bone that contributes to the wall of the thorax. The ribs articulate posteriorly with the T1–T12 thoracic vertebrae, and most attach anteriorly via their costal cartilages to the sternum. There are 12 pairs 260 7 • Axial Skeleton of ribs. The ribs are numbered 1–12 in accordance with the thoracic vertebrae. Parts of a Typical Rib The posterior end of a typical rib is called thehead of the rib(seeFigure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with the costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal
