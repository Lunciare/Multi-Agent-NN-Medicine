Anatomy and Physiology

of the femur and tibia are two articular discs, themedial meniscusand lateral meniscus(seeFigure 9.19b). Each is a C-shaped fibrocartilage structure that is thin along its inside margin and thick along the outer margin. They are attached to their tibial condyles, but do not attach to the femur. While both menisci are free to move during knee motions, the medial meniscus shows less movement because it is anchored at its outer margin to the articular capsule and tibial collateral ligament. The menisci provide padding between the bones and help to fill the gap between the round femoral condyles and flattened tibial condyles. Some areas of each meniscus lack an arterial blood supply and thus these areas heal poorly if damaged. The knee joint has multiple ligaments that provide support, particularly in the extended position (seeFigure 9.19c). Outside of the articular capsule, located at the sides of the knee, are two extrinsic ligaments. Thefibular collateral ligament(lateral collateral ligament) is on the lateral side and spans from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. Thetibial collateral ligament(medial collateral ligament) of the medial knee runs from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibia. As it crosses
