person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive, the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form of polycythemia is chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes. Some elite athletes train at high elevations specifically to induce this phenomenon. Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera (from the Greek vera = “true”) causes an excessive production of immature erythrocytes. Polycythemia vera can dangerously elevate the viscosity of blood, raising blood pressure and making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body. It is a relatively rare disease that occurs more often in males than in females, and is more likely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age. 18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the general characteristics of leukocytes • Classify leukocytes according to their lineage, their main structural features, and their primary functions • Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes • Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets Theleukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell
