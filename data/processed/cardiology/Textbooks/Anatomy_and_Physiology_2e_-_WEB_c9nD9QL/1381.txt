Anatomy and Physiology

Japanese word that means “delicious taste,” and is often translated to mean savory. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste for fats, or lipids. Gustation is the special sense associated with the tongue. The surface of the tongue, along with the rest of the oral cavity, is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. Raised bumps calledpapillae(singular = papilla) contain the structures for gustatory transduction. There are four types of papillae, based on their appearance (Figure 14.3): circumvallate, foliate, filiform, and fungiform. Within the structure of the papillae aretaste budsthat contain specializedgustatory receptor cellsfor the transduction of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the chemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the chemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.

Different types of papillae are found in different regions of the tongue. The taste buds
