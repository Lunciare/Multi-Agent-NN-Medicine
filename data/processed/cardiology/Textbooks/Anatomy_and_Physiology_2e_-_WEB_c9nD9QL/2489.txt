22.10), which then leads to an alveolar duct, opening into a cluster of alveoli. 956 22 • The Respiratory System FIGURE22.10 Respiratory Zone Bronchioles lead to alveolar sacs in the respiratory zone, where gas exchange occurs. Alveoli Analveolar ductis a tube composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue, which opens into a cluster of alveoli. Analveolusis one of the many small, grape-like sacs that are attached to the alveolar ducts. Analveolar sacis a cluster of many individual alveoli that are responsible for gas exchange. An alveolus is approximately 200 μm in diameter with elastic walls that allow the alveolus to stretch during air intake, which greatly increases the surface area available for gas exchange. Alveoli are connected to their neighbors byalveolar pores, which help maintain equal air pressure throughout the alveoli and lung (Figure 22.11).
