of these brain stem structures. The Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli and vestibular system enters the brain stem and influences are the basis for most aspects of somatosensation, as activity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral well as being the basis of audition and equilibrium in cortex. the inner ear. Thermoreceptors are sensitive to The visual pathway segregates information from the temperature changes, and photoreceptors are two eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to sensitive to light energy. the other side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas, The nerves that convey sensory information from the the perception of the stimuli and their location is periphery to the CNS are either spinal nerves, passed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal. connected to the spinal cord, or cranial nerves, The ventral visual stream connects to structures in the connected to the brain. Spinal nerves have mixed temporal lobe that are important for long-term populations of fibers; some are motor fibers and some memory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts are sensory. The sensory fibers connect to the spinal with the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and cord through the dorsal root, which is
