The unpaired vomer bone, often referred to simply as the vomer, is triangular-shaped and forms the posterior- inferior part of the nasal septum (seeFigure 7.11). The vomer is best seen when looking from behind into the posterior openings of the nasal cavity (seeFigure 7.8a). In this view, the vomer is seen to form the entire height of the nasal septum. A much smaller portion of the vomer can also be seen when looking into the anterior opening of the nasal cavity. Mandible Themandibleforms the lower jaw and is the only moveable bone of the skull. At the time of birth, the mandible consists of paired right and left bones, but these fuse together during the first year to form the single U-shaped mandible of the adult skull. Each side of the mandible consists of a horizontal body and posteriorly, a vertically orientedramus of the mandible(ramus = “branch”). The outside margin of the mandible, where the body and ramus come together is called theangle of the mandible(Figure 7.15). The ramus on each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony projections. The more anterior projection is the flattenedcoronoid process of the mandible, which provides attachment for one of the biting muscles.
