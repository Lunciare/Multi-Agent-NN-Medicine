of transport: blood. 18.1 An Overview of Blood LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis • Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative proportions in a blood sample • Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood • Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins Recall thatbloodis a connective tissue. Like all connective tissues, it is made up of cellular elements and an 712 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood extracellular matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as theformed elements—includered blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and cell fragments calledplatelets. The extracellular matrix, calledplasma, makes blood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system. Functions of Blood The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also
