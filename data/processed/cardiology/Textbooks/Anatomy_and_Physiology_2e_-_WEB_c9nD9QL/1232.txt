Often, the interactive game that demonstrates the use of this action potentials occur so rapidly that watching a technology and compares it with other types of screen to see them occur is not helpful. A speaker imaging technologies. Also, the results from an MRI is powered by the signals recorded from a neuron session are compared with images obtained from x- and it “pops” each time the neuron fires an action ray or computed tomography. How do the imaging potential. These action potentials are firing so fast techniques shown in this game indicate the that it sounds like static on the radio. separation of white and gray matter compared with Electrophysiologists can recognize the patterns the freshly dissected tissue shown earlier? within that static to understand what is happening. 2.
