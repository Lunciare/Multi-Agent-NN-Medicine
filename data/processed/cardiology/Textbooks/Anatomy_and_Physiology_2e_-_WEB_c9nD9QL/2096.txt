blocker drugs include propranolol and pronethalol, and are credited with revolutionizing treatment of cardiac patients experiencing angina pectoris. There is also a large class of dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine, and benzothiazepine calcium channel blockers that may be administered decreasing the strength of contraction and SV. Afterload Afterloadrefers to the tension that the ventricles must develop to pump blood effectively against the resistance in the vascular system. Any condition that increases resistance requires a greater afterload to force open the semilunar valves and pump the blood. Damage to the valves, such as stenosis, which makes them harder to open will also increase afterload. Any decrease in resistance decreases the afterload.Figure 19.34summarizes the major factors influencing SV,Figure 19.35summarizes the major factors influencing CO, andTable 19.3andTable 19.4 summarize cardiac responses to increased and decreased blood flow and pressure in order to restore homeostasis. 798 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart FIGURE19.34 Major Factors Influencing Stroke Volume Multiple factors impact preload, afterload, and contractility, and are the major considerations influencing SV. FIGURE19.35 Summary of Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output The primary factors influencing HR include autonomic innervation plus endocrine control. Not shown are environmental factors, such as electrolytes, metabolic products, and temperature. The primary factors
