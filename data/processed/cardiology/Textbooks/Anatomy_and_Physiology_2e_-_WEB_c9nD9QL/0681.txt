of the elbow. FIGURE8.6 Ulna and Radius The ulna is located on the medial side of the forearm, and the radius is on the lateral side. These bones are attached to each other by an interosseous membrane. More distal is theshaft of the ulna. The lateral side of the shaft forms a ridge called theinterosseous border of the 280 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton ulna. This is the line of attachment for theinterosseous membrane of the forearm, a sheet of dense connective tissue that unites the ulna and radius bones. The small, rounded area that forms the distal end is thehead of the ulna. Projecting from the posterior side of the ulnar head is thestyloid process of the ulna, a short bony projection. This serves as an attachment point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the ulna and radius. In the anatomical position, with the elbow fully extended and the palms facing forward, the arm and forearm do not form a straight line. Instead, the forearm deviates laterally by 5–15 degrees from the line of the arm. This deviation is called the carrying angle. It allows the forearm and hand to swing freely or to
