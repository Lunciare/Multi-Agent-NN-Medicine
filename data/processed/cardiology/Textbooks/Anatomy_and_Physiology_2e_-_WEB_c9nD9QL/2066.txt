1 2 3 produced by a galloping horse. The fourth heart sound, S , results from the contraction of the atria pushing blood 4 into a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, indicating failure of the left ventricle. S occurs prior to S and the collective 4 1 sounds S , S , and S are referred to by some cardiologists as the “Tennessee gallop,” because of their similarity to 4 1 2 the sound produced by a galloping horse with a different gait. A few individuals may have both S and S , and this 3 4 combined sound is referred to as S . 7 Access for free at openstax.org 19.3 • Cardiac Cycle 787 FIGURE19.29 Heart Sounds and the Cardiac Cycle In this illustration, the x-axis reflects time with a recording of the heart sounds. The y-axis represents pressure. The termmurmuris used to describe an unusual sound coming from the heart that is caused by the turbulent flow of blood. Murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being the most common, the most difficult sound to detect, and the least serious. The most severe is a 6. Phonocardiograms or auscultograms can be used to
