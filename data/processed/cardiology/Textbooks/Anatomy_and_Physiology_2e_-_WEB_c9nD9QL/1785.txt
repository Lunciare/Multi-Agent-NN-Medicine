Anatomy and Physiology

I–) results in iodine (I ), 2 which passes through the follicle cell membrane into the colloid. 3. In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two intermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines. When one of each of these intermediaries is linked by covalent bonds, the resulting compound istriiodothyronine(T ), a thyroid 3 hormone with three iodines. Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming tetraiodothyronine, also known asthyroxine(T ), a thyroid hormone with four iodines. 4 These hormones remain in the colloid center of the thyroid follicles until TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid back into the follicle cells. There, lysosomal enzymes break apart the thyroglobulin colloid, releasing free T and T , 3 4 which diffuse across the follicle cell membrane and enter the bloodstream. In the bloodstream, less than one percent of the circulating T and T remains unbound. This free T and T can 3 4 3 4 cross the lipid bilayer of cell membranes and be taken up by cells. The remaining 99 percent of circulating T and T 3 4 is bound to specialized transport
