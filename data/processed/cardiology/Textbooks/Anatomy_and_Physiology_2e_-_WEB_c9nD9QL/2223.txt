the aorta and its major branches, to the most significant arteries feeding into the right and left upper and lower limbs • Create a flow chart showing the major systemic veins through which blood travels from the feet to the right atrium of the heart Virtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system. This includes the generalized and more specialized functions of transport of materials, capillary exchange, maintaining health by transporting white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body temperature, and helping to maintain acid-base balance. In addition to these shared functions, many systems enjoy a unique relationship with the circulatory system.Figure 20.22summarizes these relationships.

These pairs of vessels will be traced through only one side of the body. Where differences occur in branching patterns or when vessels
