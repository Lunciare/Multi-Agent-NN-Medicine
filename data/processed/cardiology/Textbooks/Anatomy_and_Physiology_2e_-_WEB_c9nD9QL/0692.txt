oxygen) due to reduced blood flow can quickly produce irreparable damage to the 284 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton forearm muscles. In addition, four major nerves for shoulder and upper limb muscles are closely associated with different regions of the humerus, and thus, humeral fractures may also damage these nerves. Another frequent injury following a fall onto an outstretched hand is a Colles fracture (“col-lees”) of the distal radius (seeFigure 8.11). This involves a complete transverse fracture across the distal radius that drives the separated distal fragment of the radius posteriorly and superiorly. This injury results in a characteristic “dinner fork” bend of the forearm just above the wrist due to the posterior displacement of the hand. This is the most frequent forearm fracture and is a common injury in persons over the age of 50, particularly in older people with osteoporosis. It also commonly occurs following a high-speed fall onto the hand during activities such as snowboarding or skating. The most commonly fractured carpal bone is the scaphoid, often resulting from a fall onto the hand. Deep pain at the lateral wrist may yield an initial diagnosis of a wrist sprain, but a radiograph taken several weeks after the
