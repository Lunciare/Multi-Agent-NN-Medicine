Anatomy and Physiology

the different types of cells in the human body. 3.1 The Cell Membrane LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the molecular components that make up the cell membrane • Explain the major features and properties of the cell membrane • Differentiate between materials that can and cannot diffuse through the lipid bilayer • Compare and contrast different types of passive transport with active transport, providing examples of each Despite differences in structure and function, all living cells in multicellular organisms have a surrounding cell membrane. As the outer layer of your skin separates your body from its environment, the cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane) separates the inner contents of a cell from its exterior environment. This cell membrane provides a protective barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out. Structure and Composition of the Cell Membrane Thecell membraneis an extremely pliable structure composed primarily of back-to-back phospholipids (a “bilayer”). Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various proteins embedded within the membrane that have a variety of functions. A single phospholipid molecule has a phosphate
