the oocyte, but only a few hundred glycoprotein membrane that lies just outside the actually reach it. The number of sperm that reach the oocyte’s plasma membrane. When capacitated sperm oocyte is greatly reduced because of conditions within make contact with the oocyte, they release the the female reproductive tract. Many sperm are digestive enzymes in the acrosome (the acrosomal overcome by the acidity of the vagina, others are reaction) and are thus able to attach to the oocyte and blocked by mucus in the cervix, whereas others are burrow through to the oocyte’s zona pellucida. One of attacked by phagocytic leukocytes in the uterus. Those the sperm will then break through to the oocyte’s sperm that do survive undergo a change in response to plasma membrane and release its haploid nucleus into those conditions. They go through the process of the oocyte. The oocyte’s membrane structure changes capacitation, which improves their motility and alters in response (cortical reaction), preventing any further the membrane surrounding the acrosome, the cap-like penetration by another sperm and forming a structure in the head of a sperm that contains the fertilization membrane. Fertilization is complete upon digestive enzymes needed for it to attach to
