for each individual except identical twins. FIGURE2.29 DNA In the DNA double helix, two strands attach via hydrogen bonds between the bases of the component nucleotides. In contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is created during protein synthesis to carry the genetic instructions from the DNA to the cell’s protein manufacturing plants in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes. Adenosine Triphosphate The nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate groups (Figure 2.30). ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three phosphates store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy bonds helps fuel the body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to anabolic chemical reactions. 74 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization FIGURE2.30 Structure of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) When a phosphate group is cleaved from ATP, the products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P). This hydrolysis reaction can be written: i Removal of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these
