common way to depict the relationship of aortic arch and carotid arteries. A rise in carbon dioxide how easily oxygen binds to or dissociates from or a decline in oxygen levels in the blood stimulates an hemoglobin as a function of the partial pressure of increase in respiratory rate and depth. oxygen. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases, 22.4Gas Exchange the more readily hemoglobin binds to oxygen. At the same time, once one molecule of oxygen is bound by The behavior of gases can be explained by the hemoglobin, additional oxygen molecules more readily principles of Dalton’s law and Henry’s law, both of bind to hemoglobin. Other factors such as which describe aspects of gas exchange. Dalton’s law temperature, pH, the partial pressure of carbon states that each specific gas in a mixture of gases dioxide, and the concentration of exerts force (its partial pressure) independently of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate can enhance or inhibit the other gases in the mixture. Henry’s law states that the binding of hemoglobin and oxygen as well. Fetal amount of a specific gas that dissolves in a liquid is a hemoglobin has a different structure than adult function of its partial pressure. The greater the
