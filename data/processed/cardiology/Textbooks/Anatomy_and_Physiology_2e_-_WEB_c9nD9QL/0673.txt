and lateral borders, is the location of the glenoid cavity(glenoid fossa). This shallow depression articulates with the humerus bone of the arm to form the glenohumeral joint(shoulder joint). The small bony bumps located immediately above and below the glenoid cavity are thesupraglenoid tubercleand theinfraglenoid tubercle, respectively. These provide attachments for muscles of the arm.

The scapula also has two prominent projections. Toward the lateral end of the superior border, between the suprascapular notch and glenoid cavity, is the hook-likecoracoid process(coracoid = “shaped like a crow’s beak”). This process projects anteriorly and curves laterally. At the shoulder, the coracoid process is located inferior to the lateral end of the clavicle. It is anchored to the clavicle by a strong ligament, and serves as the attachment site for muscles of the anterior chest and arm. On the posterior aspect, thespine of the scapulais a long and prominent ridge that runs across its upper portion. Extending laterally from the spine is a flattened and expanded region called theacromionoracromial process. The acromion forms
