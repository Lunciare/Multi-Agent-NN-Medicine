along the length of that unique vertebra. Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to innervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are not straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into asystemic nerve. This occurs at four places along the length of the vertebral column, each identified as anerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves directly correspond to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe networks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies. Of the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level (Figure 13.24). Thecervical plexusis composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the posterior neck and head, as well as thephrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of the thoracic cavity. The other plexus from the cervical level is thebrachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1 reorganize through this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name
