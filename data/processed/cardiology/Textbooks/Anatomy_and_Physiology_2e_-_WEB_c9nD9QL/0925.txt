Anatomy and Physiology

referred to as muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells, with diameters up to 100μm and lengths up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in the Sartorius of the upper leg. During early development, embryonic myoblasts, each with its own nucleus, fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers. Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes, permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle Access for free at openstax.org 10.2 • Skeletal Muscle 361 contraction. Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greeksarco, which means “flesh.” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called thesarcolemma, the cytoplasm is referred to assarcoplasm, and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which stores, releases, and retrieves calcium ions (Ca++) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)(Figure 10.4). As will soon be described, the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere, a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilamentsactin(thin filament) andmyosin (thick filament), along with other support proteins. FIGURE10.4 Muscle Fiber A skeletal muscle fiber is surrounded by a plasma membrane called the sarcolemma, which contains sarcoplasm, the cytoplasm of muscle cells.
