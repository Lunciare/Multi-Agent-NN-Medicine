located at the base of the expanded, proximal end of the humerus, where it joins the narrowshaft of the humerus. The surgical neck is a common site of arm fractures. Thedeltoid tuberosityis a roughened, V-shaped region located on the lateral side in the middle of the humerus shaft. As its name indicates, it is the site of attachment for the deltoid muscle. FIGURE8.5 Humerus and Elbow Joint The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm region. It articulates with the radius and ulna bones of the forearm to form the elbow joint. Distally, the humerus becomes flattened. The prominent bony projection on the medial side is themedial epicondyle of the humerus. The much smallerlateral epicondyle of the humerusis found on the lateral side of the distal humerus. The roughened ridge of bone above the lateral epicondyle is thelateral supracondylar ridge. All of these areas are attachment points for muscles that act on the forearm, wrist, and hand.
