If this vertical plane runs directly down the middle of the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a parasagittal plane or less commonly a longitudinal section. • Thefrontal planeis the plane that divides the body or an organ into an anterior (front) portion and a posterior (rear) portion. The frontal plane is often referred to as a coronal plane. (“Corona” is Latin for “crown.”) • Thetransverse planeis the plane that divides the body or organ horizontally into upper and lower portions. 26 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body Transverse planes produce images referred to as cross sections. FIGURE1.14 Planes of the Body The three planes most commonly used in anatomical and medical imaging are the sagittal, frontal (or coronal), and transverse plane. Body Cavities and Serous Membranes The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate compartments. Thedorsal (posterior) cavityand theventral (anterior) cavityare the largest body compartments (Figure 1.15). These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as
