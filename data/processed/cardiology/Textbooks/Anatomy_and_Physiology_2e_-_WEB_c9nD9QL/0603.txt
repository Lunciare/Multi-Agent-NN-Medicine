for articulation with the head (end) of a rib. An additional facet is located on the transverse process for articulation with the tubercle of a rib. FIGURE7.26 Thoracic Vertebrae A typical thoracic vertebra is distinguished by the spinous process, which is long and projects downward to overlap the next inferior vertebra. It also has articulation sites (facets) on the vertebral body and a transverse process for rib attachment. FIGURE7.27 Rib Articulation in Thoracic Vertebrae Thoracic vertebrae have superior and inferior articular facets on the vertebral body for articulation with the head of a rib, and a transverse process facet for articulation with the rib tubercle.

They have short transverse processes and a short, blunt spinous process that projects posteriorly. The articular processes are large, with the superior process facing backward and the inferior facing forward. FIGURE7.28 Lumbar Vertebrae Lumbar vertebrae are characterized by having a large, thick body and a short, rounded spinous process. Sacrum and Coccyx The sacrum is a triangular-shaped bone
