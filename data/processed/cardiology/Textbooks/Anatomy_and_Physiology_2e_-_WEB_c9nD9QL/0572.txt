that forms the anterior, medial wall of the orbit (seeFigure 7.4and Figure 7.5). The anterior portion of the lacrimal bone forms a shallow depression called thelacrimal fossa, and extending inferiorly from this is thenasolacrimal canal. The lacrimal fluid (tears of the eye), which serves to maintain the moist surface of the eye, drains at the medial corner of the eye into the nasolacrimal canal. This duct then extends downward to open into the nasal cavity, behind the inferior nasal concha. In the nasal cavity, the lacrimal fluid normally drains posteriorly, but with an increased flow of tears due to crying or eye irritation, some fluid will also drain anteriorly, thus causing a runny nose. Inferior Nasal Conchae The right and left inferior nasal conchae form a curved bony plate that projects into the nasal cavity space from the lower lateral wall (seeFigure 7.13). The inferior concha is the largest of the nasal conchae and can easily be seen when looking into the anterior opening of the nasal cavity. Vomer Bone The unpaired vomer bone, often referred to simply as the vomer, is triangular-shaped and forms the posterior- inferior part of the nasal septum (seeFigure 7.11). The vomer is best seen
