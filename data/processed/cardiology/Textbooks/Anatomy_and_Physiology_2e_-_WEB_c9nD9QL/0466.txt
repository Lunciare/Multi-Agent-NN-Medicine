Anatomy and Physiology

• List and describe the functions of bones • Describe the classes of bones • Discuss the process of bone formation and development • Explain how bone repairs itself after a fracture • Discuss the effect of exercise, nutrition, and hormones on bone tissue • Describe how an imbalance of calcium can affect bone tissue INTRODUCTION Bones make good fossils. While the soft tissue of a once living organism will decay and fall away over time, bone tissue will, under the right conditions, undergo a process of mineralization, effectively turning the bone to stone. A well-preserved fossil skeleton can give us a good sense of the size and shape of an organism, just as your skeleton helps to define your size and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve a number of important functions, including some necessary to maintain homeostasis. 6.1 The Functions of the Skeletal System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define bone, cartilage, and the skeletal system • List and describe the functions of the
