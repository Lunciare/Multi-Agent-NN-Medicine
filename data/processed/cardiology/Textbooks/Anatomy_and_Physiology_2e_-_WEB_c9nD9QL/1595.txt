The central neuron projects from the spinal amygdala is a structure within the limbic system that cord or brain stem to synapse on the ganglionic neuron influences the hypothalamus in the regulation of the that projects to the effector. The afferent branch of the autonomic system, as well as the endocrine system. somatic and visceral reflexes is very similar, as many These higher centers have descending control of the somatic and special senses activate autonomic autonomic system through brain stem centers, responses. However, there are visceral senses that do primarily in the medulla, such as the cardiovascular not form part of conscious perception. If a visceral center. This collection of medullary nuclei regulates sensation, such as cardiac pain, is strong enough, it will cardiac function, as well as blood pressure. Sensory rise to the level of consciousness. However, the input from the heart, aorta, and carotid sinuses project sensory homunculus does not provide a representation to these regions of the medulla. The solitary nucleus of the internal structures to the same degree as the increases sympathetic tone of the cardiovascular surface of the body, so visceral sensations are often
