and the medial wall of each orbit. The largest region of each of the palatine bone is thehorizontal plate. The plates from the right and left palatine bones join together at the midline to form the posterior quarter of the hard palate (seeFigure 7.8a). Thus, the palatine bones are best seen in an inferior view of the skull and hard palate. HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate During embryonic development, the right and left maxilla bones come together at the midline to form the upper jaw. At the same time, the muscle and skin overlying these bones join together to form the upper lip. Inside the mouth, the palatine processes of the maxilla bones, along with the horizontal plates of the right and left palatine bones, join together to form the hard palate. If an error occurs in these developmental processes, a birth defect of cleft lip or cleft palate may result. Cleft lip is a common development defect that affects approximately 1:1000 births, most of which are male. This defect involves a partial or complete failure of the right and left portions of the upper lip to fuse together, leaving a cleft (gap). A more severe developmental defect
