The different between the shaft and end of a long bone. Being types of synovial joints are the ball-and-socket joint less dense than bone, the area of epiphyseal (shoulder joint), hinge joint (knee), pivot joint cartilage is seen on this radiograph as the dark (atlantoaxial joint, between C1 and C2 vertebrae of epiphyseal gaps located near the ends of the long the neck), condyloid joint (radiocarpal joint of the bones, including the radius, ulna, metacarpal, and wrist), saddle joint (first carpometacarpal joint, phalanx bones. Which of the bones in this image do between the trapezium carpal bone and the first not show an epiphyseal plate (epiphyseal gap)? metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb), and plane joint (facet joints of vertebral column, between superior and inferior articular processes).
