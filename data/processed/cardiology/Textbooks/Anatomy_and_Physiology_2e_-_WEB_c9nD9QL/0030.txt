much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to the body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing some of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution. The dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the pressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body tissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the pulsating flow of pressurized blood. 1.5 Homeostasis LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning • Contrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism Maintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body temperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point. Aset pointis the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. Anormal rangeis the restricted set of values that is optimally
