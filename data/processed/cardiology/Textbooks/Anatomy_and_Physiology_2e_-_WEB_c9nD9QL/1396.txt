waves move the region of the basilar membrane that is near the tip of the cochlea. FIGURE14.7 Cross Section of the Cochlea The three major spaces within the cochlea are highlighted. The scala tympani and scala 548 14 • The Somatic Nervous System vestibuli lie on either side of the cochlear duct. The organ of Corti, containing the mechanoreceptor hair cells, is adjacent to the scala tympani, where it sits atop the basilar membrane. The organs of Corti containhair cells, which are named for the hair-likestereociliaextending from the cell’s apical surfaces (Figure 14.8). The stereocilia are an array of microvilli-like structures arranged from tallest to shortest. Protein fibers tether adjacent hairs together within each array, such that the array will bend in response to movements of the basilar membrane. The stereocilia extend up from the hair cells to the overlyingtectorial membrane, which is attached medially to the organ of Corti. When the pressure waves from the scala move the basilar membrane, the tectorial membrane slides across the stereocilia. This bends the stereocilia either toward or away from the tallest member of each array. When the stereocilia bend toward the tallest member of their array, tension in the protein tethers opens
