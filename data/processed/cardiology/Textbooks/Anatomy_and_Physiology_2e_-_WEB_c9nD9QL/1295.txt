Anatomy and Physiology

System 513 INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisanimation( see how blood flows to the brain and passes through the circle of Willis before being distributed through the cerebrum. The circle of Willis is a specialized arrangement of arteries that ensure constant perfusion of the cerebrum even in the event of a blockage of one of the arteries in the circle. The animation shows the normal direction of flow through the circle of Willis to the middle cerebral artery. Where would the blood come from if there were a blockage just posterior to the middle cerebral artery on the left? Venous Return After passing through the CNS, blood returns to the circulation through a series ofdural sinusesand veins (Figure 13.16). Thesuperior sagittal sinusruns in the groove of the longitudinal fissure, where it absorbs CSF from the meninges. The superior sagittal sinus drains to the confluence of sinuses, along with theoccipital sinusesand straight sinus, to then drain into thetransverse sinuses. The transverse sinuses connect to thesigmoid sinuses, which then connect to thejugular veins. From there, the blood continues toward the heart to be pumped to the lungs for reoxygenation.
