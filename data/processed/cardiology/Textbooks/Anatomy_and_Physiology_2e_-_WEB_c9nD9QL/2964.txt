Excessive vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves enter and leave at quantities of urine may indicate diabetes insipidus or the renal hilum. The renal arteries arise directly from diabetes mellitus. The pH range of urine is 4.5 to 8.0, the aorta, and the renal veins drain directly into the and is affected by diet. Osmolarity ranges from 50 to inferior vena cava. Kidney function is derived from the 1200 milliosmoles, and is a reflection of the amount of actions of about 1.3 million nephrons per kidney; these water being recovered or lost by renal nephrons. are the “functional units.” A capillary bed, the 25.2Gross Anatomy of Urine Transport glomerulus, filters blood and the filtrate is captured by Bowman’s capsule. A portal system is formed when the The urethra is the only urinary structure that differs blood flows through a second capillary bed significantly between males and females. This is due to surrounding the proximal and distal convoluted tubules the dual role of the male urethra in transporting both and the loop of Henle. Most water and solutes are urine and semen. The urethra arises from the
