Anatomy and Physiology

the basis for how the membrane potential is established and changes in electrochemical signaling. If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible. Normally the concentration of K+is higher inside the neuron than outside. After the repolarizing phase of the action potential, K+leakage channels and the Na+/K+pump ensure that the ions return to their original locations. Following a stroke or other ischemic event, extracellular K+levels are elevated. The astrocytes in the area are equipped to clear excess K+to aid the pump. But when the level is far out of balance, the effects can be irreversible. Astrocytes can become reactive in cases such as these, which impairs their ability to maintain the local chemical environment. The glial cells enlarge and their processes swell. They lose their K+buffering ability and the function of the pump is affected, or even reversed. One of the early signs of cell disease is this "leaking" of sodium ions into the body cells. This sodium/potassium imbalance negatively affects the internal chemistry of cells, preventing them from functioning normally.
