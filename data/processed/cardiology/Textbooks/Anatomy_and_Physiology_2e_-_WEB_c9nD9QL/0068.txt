Homeostasis is nineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that regulated by negative feedback loops and, much less anatomists and physicians discovered non-surgical frequently, by positive feedback loops. Both have the methods to look inside a living body. Since then, many same components of a stimulus, sensor, control center, other techniques, including CT scans, MRI scans, PET and effector; however, negative feedback loops work to scans, and ultrasonography, have been developed, prevent an excessive response to the stimulus, providing more accurate and detailed views of the form whereas positive feedback loops intensify the and function of the human body.
