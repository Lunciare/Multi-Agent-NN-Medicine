Anatomy and Physiology

due to T cell tolerance. Some B cells do Blood transfusion and organ transplantation both not need T cell cytokines to make antibody, and they require an understanding of the immune response to bypass this need by the crosslinking of their surface prevent medical complications. Blood needs to be immunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate residues typed so that natural antibodies against mismatched found in the cell walls of many bacterial species. blood will not destroy it, causing more harm than good Others require T cells to become activated. to the recipient. Transplanted organs must be matched by their MHC molecules and, with the use of 21.5The Immune Response against immunosuppressive drugs, can be successful even if an Pathogens exact tissue match cannot be made. Another aspect to Early childhood is a time when the body develops the immune response is its ability to control and much of its immunological memory that protects it eradicate cancer. Although this has been shown to from diseases in adulthood. The components of the occur with some rare cancers and those caused by immune response that have the maximum known viruses, the normal immune response to most effectiveness against a pathogen are often associated cancers is
