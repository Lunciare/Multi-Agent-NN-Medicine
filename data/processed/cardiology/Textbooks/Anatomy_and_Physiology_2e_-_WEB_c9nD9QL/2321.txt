tunica intima, tunica Arteries transport blood away from the heart and media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites composed of a simple squamous epithelium known as of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. back to small vessels known as venules that flow into The tunica media is a thicker area composed of the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest 888 20 • Chapter Review arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of identical so there is no net exchange, whereas connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains reabsorption predominates at the venule end of the some smooth muscle.
