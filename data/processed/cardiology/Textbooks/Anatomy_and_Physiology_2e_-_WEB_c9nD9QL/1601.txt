of the learn about the pupillary reflexes. The pupillary autonomic nervous system causing system-wide light reflex involves sensory input through the optic changes as it prepares for extreme responses. What nerve and motor response through the oculomotor two changes does adrenaline bring about to help nerve to the ciliary ganglion, which projects to the the skeletal muscle response? circular fibers of the iris. As shown in this short 2. Watch thisvideo( animation, pupils will constrict to limit the amount nervsystem1)to learn more about the nervous of light falling on the retina under bright lighting system. As described in this video, the nervous conditions. What constitutes the afferent and system has a way to deal with threats and stress efferent branches of the competing reflex that is separate from the conscious control of the (dilation)? somatic nervous system. The system comes from a 5. Watch thisvideo( time when threats were about survival, but in the to learn about physical responses to emotion. The modern age, these responses become part of stress autonomic system, which is important for regulating and anxiety.
