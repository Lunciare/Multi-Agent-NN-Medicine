(internal) surface of the upper ilium is called theiliac fossa. The inferior margin of this space is formed by thearcuate line of the ilium, the ridge formed by the pronounced change in curvature between the upper and lower portions of the ilium. The large, inverted U-shaped indentation located on the posterior margin of the lower ilium is called thegreater sciatic notch. Ischium The ischium forms the posterolateral portion of the hip bone (seeFigure 8.13). The large, roughened area of the inferior ischium is theischial tuberosity. This serves as the attachment for the posterior thigh muscles and also carries the weight of the body when sitting. You can feel the ischial tuberosity if you wiggle your pelvis against the seat of a chair. Projecting superiorly and anteriorly from the ischial tuberosity is a narrow segment of bone called the ischial ramus. The slightly curved posterior margin of the ischium above the ischial tuberosity is thelesser sciatic notch. The bony projection separating the lesser sciatic notch and greater sciatic notch is theischial spine.
