Anatomy and Physiology

nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point. Aset pointis the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. Anormal rangeis the restricted set of values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is approximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to fluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other parts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback.Negative feedbackis a mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters within their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all times, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology. Negative Feedback A negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). Asensor, also referred to a receptor, is a component of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center. Thecontrol centeris the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value
