to the heart, especially to the heart valves. On the other hand, some theories propose that having multiple common infectious diseases actually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune diseases are rare in countries that have a high incidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in this chapter. There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that an individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if one’s MHC molecules are not able to present a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than 80 different autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly.Table 21.7lists several of the most common autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune response that causes the damage. Autoimmune Diseases Disease Autoantigen Symptoms Celiac disease Tissue transglutaminase Damage to small intestine Diabetes Low insulin production; inability to Beta cells of pancreas mellitus type I regulate serum glucose Graves’ Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody blocks Hyperthyroidism disease receptor) Hashimoto’s Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody Hypothyroidism thyroiditis mimics hormone and stimulates receptor) Lupus Nuclear DNA
