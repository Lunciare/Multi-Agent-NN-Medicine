and granzymes. Aperforinis a protein that forms pores in the membranes of infected cells. Agranzymeis a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores and triggers apoptosis intracellularly. Both mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells. If apoptosis is induced before the virus has the ability to synthesize and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released from the cell, thus preventing further infection. Recognition of Pathogens Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen-specific molecules, such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins, using pattern recognition receptors. Apattern recognition receptor (PRR)is a membrane-bound receptor that recognizes characteristic features of a pathogen and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells. These receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell surface whether they are needed or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the fact that each receptor type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make receptors able to recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is
