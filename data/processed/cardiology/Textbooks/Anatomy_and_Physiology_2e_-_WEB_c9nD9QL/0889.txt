The gap between the is the pubic symphysis of the pelvis, the cartilaginous bones may be wide and filled with a fibrous joint that strongly unites the right and left hip bones of interosseous membrane, or it may narrow with the pelvis. The cartilaginous joints in which vertebrae ligaments spanning between the bones. Syndesmoses are united by intervertebral discs provide for small are found between the bones of the forearm (radius movements between the adjacent vertebrae and are and ulna) and the leg (tibia and fibula). Fibrous joints also an amphiarthrosis type of joint. Thus, based on strongly unite adjacent bones and thus serve to provide their movement ability, both fibrous and cartilaginous protection for internal organs, strength to body regions, joints are functionally classified as a synarthrosis or or weight-bearing stability. amphiarthrosis.
