Review 9.3Cartilaginous Joints and a muscle tendon. Tendon sheaths contain a lubricating fluid and surround tendons to allow for There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A smooth movement of the tendon as it crosses a joint. synchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis Based on the shape of the articulating bone surfaces is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long and the types of movement allowed, synovial joints are bone, which is lost when the epiphyseal plate ossifies classified into six types. At a pivot joint, one bone is as the bone reaches maturity. The synchondrosis is held within a ring by a ligament and its articulation with thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent a second bone. Pivot joints only allow for rotation synchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first around a single axis. These are found at the articulation sternocostal joint and between the anterior ends of the between the C1 (atlas) and the dens of the C2 (axis) bony ribs and the junction with their costal cartilage. A vertebrae, which provides the side-to-side rotation of symphysis is where the bones are joined by the
