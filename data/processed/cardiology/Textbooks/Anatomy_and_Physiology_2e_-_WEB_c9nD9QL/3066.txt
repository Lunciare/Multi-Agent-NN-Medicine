Anatomy and Physiology

female reproductive tract. Role of the Epididymis From the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, the immotile sperm are surrounded by testicular fluid and moved to theepididymis(plural = epididymides), a coiled tube attached to the testis where newly formed sperm continue to mature (seeFigure 27.4). Though the epididymis does not take up much room in its tightly coiled state, it would be approximately 6 m (20 feet) long if straightened. It takes an average of 12 days for sperm to move through the coils of the epididymis, with the shortest recorded transit time in humans being one day. Sperm enter the head of the epididymis and are moved along predominantly by the contraction of smooth muscles lining the epididymal tubes. As they are moved along the length of the epididymis, the sperm further mature and acquire the ability to move under their own power. Once inside the female reproductive tract, they will use this ability to move independently toward the unfertilized egg. The more mature sperm are then stored in the tail of the epididymis (the final section) until ejaculation occurs. Duct System During ejaculation, sperm exit the tail of the epididymis and are pushed by smooth muscle contraction to theductus
