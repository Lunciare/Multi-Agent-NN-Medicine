bone, because it joins with almost every other bone of the skull. The sphenoid forms much of the base of the central skull (seeFigure 7.8) and also extends laterally to contribute to the sides of the skull (seeFigure 7.5). Inside the cranial cavity, the right and leftlesser wings of the sphenoid bone, which resemble the wings of a flying bird, form the lip of a prominent ridge that marks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae. Thesella turcica (“Turkish saddle”) is located at the midline of the middle cranial fossa. This bony region of the sphenoid bone is named for its resemblance to the horse saddles used by the Ottoman Turks, with a high back and a tall front. The rounded depression in the floor of the sella turcica is thehypophyseal (pituitary) fossa, which houses the pea- sized pituitary (hypophyseal) gland. Thegreater wings of the sphenoid boneextend laterally to either side away from the sella turcica, where they form the anterior floor of the middle cranial fossa. The greater wing is best seen on the outside of the lateral skull, where it forms a rectangular area immediately anterior to the squamous portion of the temporal bone. On the
