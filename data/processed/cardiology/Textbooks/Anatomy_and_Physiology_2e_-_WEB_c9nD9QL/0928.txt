Anatomy and Physiology

the region from one Z-line to the next Z-line, is the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber. The Neuromuscular Junction Another specialization of the skeletal muscle is the site where a motor neuron’s terminal meets the muscle fiber—called theneuromuscular junction (NMJ). This is where the muscle fiber first responds to signaling by the motor neuron. Every skeletal muscle fiber in every skeletal muscle is innervated by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Excitation signals from the neuron are the only way to functionally activate the fiber to contract. INTERACTIVE LINK Every skeletal muscle fiber is supplied by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Watch thisvideo( skelmuscfiber)to learn more about what happens at the NMJ. (a) What is the definition of a motor unit? (b) What is the structural and functional difference between a large motor unit and a small motor unit? (c) Can you give an example of each? (d) Why is the neurotransmitter acetylcholine degraded after binding to its receptor? Excitation-Contraction Coupling All living cells have membrane potentials, or electrical gradients across their membranes. The inside of the membrane is usually around -60 to -90 mV, relative to the outside. This is referred to as a cell’s membrane
