Anatomy and Physiology

activated B cells are known as plasma cells. T Cells TheT cell, on the other hand, does not secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive immune response. Different T cell types have the ability to either secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells of the adaptive immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens. The roles of T and B Access for free at openstax.org 21.1 • Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems 899 lymphocytes in the adaptive immune response will be discussed further in this chapter. Plasma Cells Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell. Aplasma cellis a B cell that has differentiated in response to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in morphology from standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein- synthesizing machinery known as rough endoplasmic reticulum. Natural Killer Cells A fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response. Anatural killer cell (NK)is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares this mechanism
