interstitial spaces. In addition, collecting ducts have urea pumps that actively pump urea into the interstitial spaces. This results in the recovery of NaCl to the circulation via the vasa recta and creates a high osmolar environment in the depths of the medulla. Ammonia (NH ) is a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism. It is formed as amino acids are deaminated by liver 3 hepatocytes. That means that the amine group, NH , is removed from amino acids as they are broken down. Most of 2 the resulting ammonia is converted into urea by liver hepatocytes. Urea is not only less toxic but is utilized to aid in the recovery of water by the loop of Henle and collecting ducts. At the same time that water is freely diffusing out of the descending loop through aquaporin channels into the interstitial spaces of the medulla, urea freely diffuses into the lumen of the descending loop as it descends deeper into the medulla, much of it to be reabsorbed from the forming urine when it reaches the collecting duct. Thus, the movement of Na+and urea into the interstitial spaces by these mechanisms creates the hyperosmotic environment of the medulla. The net result
