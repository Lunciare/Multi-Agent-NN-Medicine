a specific type of stimulus (Figure 14.2). The pain and temperature receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve endings. Also located in the dermis of the skin are lamellated corpuscles, neurons with encapsulated nerve endings that respond to pressure and touch. The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a specialized receptor, aphotoreceptor. FIGURE14.2 Receptor Classification by Cell Type Receptor cell types can be classified on the basis of their structure. Sensory neurons can have either (a) free nerve endings or (b) encapsulated endings. Photoreceptors in the eyes, such as rod cells, are examples of (c) specialized receptor cells. These cells release neurotransmitters onto a bipolar cell, which then synapses with the optic nerve neurons. Another way that receptors can be classified is based on their location relative to the stimuli. Anexteroceptoris a receptor that is located near a stimulus in the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are located in the skin. Aninteroceptoris one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the receptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the aorta or carotid sinus. Finally, aproprioceptoris a receptor
