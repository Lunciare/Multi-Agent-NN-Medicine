Goldsmith) CHAPTER OBJECTIVES After studying this chapter, you will be able to: • Identify the components and anatomy of the lymphatic system • Discuss the role of the innate immune response against pathogens • Describe the power of the adaptive immune response to cure disease • Explain immunological deficiencies and over-reactions of the immune system • Discuss the role of the immune response in transplantation and cancer • Describe the interaction of the immune and lymphatic systems with other body systems INTRODUCTION In June 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in Atlanta, Georgia, published a report of an unusual cluster of five patients in Los Angeles, California. All five were diagnosed with a rare pneumonia caused by a fungus calledPneumocystis jirovecii(formerly known asPneumocystis carinii). Why was this unusual? Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in individuals with suppressed or underdeveloped immune systems. The very young, whose immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are particularly susceptible.
