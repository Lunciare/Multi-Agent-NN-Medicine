Anatomy and Physiology

Theelectron transport chain (ETC)uses the NADH and FADH produced by the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. 2 Electrons from NADH and FADH are transferred through protein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial 2 membrane by a series of enzymatic reactions. The electron transport chain consists of a series of four enzyme complexes (Complex I – Complex IV) and two coenzymes (ubiquinone and Cytochrome c), which act as electron carriers and proton pumps used to transfer H+ions into the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Figure 24.8). The ETC couples the transfer of electrons between a donor (like NADH) and an electron acceptor (like O ) with the transfer of protons (H+ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, enabling the 2 process ofoxidative phosphorylation. In the presence of oxygen, energy is passed, stepwise, through the electron carriers to collect gradually the energy needed to attach a phosphate to ADP and produce ATP. The role of molecular oxygen, O , is as the terminal electron acceptor for the ETC. This means that once the electrons have passed 2 through the entire ETC, they must be passed to another, separate molecule. These electrons, O , and H+ions from 2 the matrix combine
