vagina is home to a normal population of microorganisms that help to protect against infection by pathogenic bacteria, yeast, or other organisms that can enter the vagina. In a healthy person, the most predominant type of vaginal bacteria is from the genusLactobacillus. This family of beneficial bacterial flora secretes lactic acid, and thus protects the vagina by maintaining an acidic pH (below 4.5). Potential pathogens are less likely to survive in these acidic conditions. Lactic acid, in combination with other vaginal secretions, makes the vagina a self-cleansing organ. However, douching—or washing out the vagina with fluid—can disrupt the normal balance of healthy microorganisms, and actually increase risk for infections and irritation. Indeed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that people do not douche, and that they allow the vagina to maintain its normal healthy population of protective microbial flora. Ovaries Theovariesare the female gonads (seeFigure 27.9). Paired ovals, they are each about 2 to 3 cm in length, about the size of an almond. The ovaries are located within the pelvic cavity, and are supported by the mesovarium, an extension of the peritoneum that connects the ovaries to thebroad ligament. Extending from the mesovarium itself is the suspensory
