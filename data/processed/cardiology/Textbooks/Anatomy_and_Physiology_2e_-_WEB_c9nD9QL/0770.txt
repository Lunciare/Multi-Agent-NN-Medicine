Anterior to the talus is the navicular bone, and anterior to this are the medial, intermediate, and The femur is the single bone of the thigh. Its rounded lateral cuneiform bones. The cuboid bone is anterior to head articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to the calcaneus. form the hip joint. The head has the fovea capitis for attachment of the ligament of the head of the femur. The five metatarsal bones form the anterior foot. The The narrow neck joins inferiorly with the greater and base of these bones articulate with the cuboid or lesser trochanters. Passing between these bony cuneiform bones. The metatarsal heads, at their distal expansions are the intertrochanteric line on the ends, articulate with the proximal phalanges of the anterior femur and the larger intertrochanteric crest on toes. The big toe (toe number 1) has proximal and the posterior femur. On the posterior shaft of the femur distal phalanx bones. The remaining toes have is the gluteal tuberosity proximally and
