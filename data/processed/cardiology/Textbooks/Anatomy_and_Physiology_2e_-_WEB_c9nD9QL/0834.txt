radioulnar joint. This crossing over brings the radius and ulna into an X- shape position.Supinationis the opposite motion, in which rotation of the radius returns the bones to their parallel positions and moves the palm to the anterior facing (supinated) position. It helps to remember that supination is the motion you use when scooping up soup with a spoon (seeFigure 9.13g). Dorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion Dorsiflexionandplantar flexionare movements at the ankle joint, which is a hinge joint. Lifting the front of the foot, so that the top of the foot moves toward the anterior leg is dorsiflexion, while lifting the heel of the foot from the ground or pointing the toes downward is plantar flexion. These are the only movements available at the ankle joint (seeFigure 9.13h). Inversion and Eversion Inversion and eversion are complex movements that involve the multiple plane joints among the tarsal bones of the posterior foot (intertarsal joints) and thus are not motions that take place at the ankle joint.Inversionis the turning of the foot to angle the bottom of the foot toward the midline, whileeversionturns the bottom of the foot away from the midline. The foot has a greater range of inversion than eversion motion.
