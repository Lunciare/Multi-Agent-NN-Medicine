result for the membrane potential. INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn about summation. The process of converting electrical signals to chemical signals and back requires subtle changes that can result in transient increases or decreases in membrane voltage. To cause a lasting change in the target cell, multiple signals are usually added together, or summated. Does spatial summation have to happen all at once, or can the separate signals arrive on the postsynaptic neuron at slightly different times? Explain your answer. 478 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue Synapses There are two types of connections between electrically active cells, chemical synapses and electrical synapses. In achemical synapse, a chemical signal—namely, a neurotransmitter—is released from one cell and it affects the other cell. In anelectrical synapse, there is a direct connection between the two cells so that ions can pass directly from one cell to the next. If one cell is depolarized in an electrical synapse, the joined cell also depolarizes because the ions pass between the cells. Chemical synapses involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell to the next. This section will concentrate on the chemical type of synapse. An example of a chemical synapse is the
