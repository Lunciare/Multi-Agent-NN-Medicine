sodium ion from the heart to each of the lungs channels and causes the electrical potential to rise pulmonary capillaries capillaries surrounding the stroke volume (SV) amount of blood pumped by each alveoli of the lungs where gas exchange occurs: ventricle per contraction; also, the difference carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters between EDV and ESV pulmonary circuit blood flow to and from the lungs sulcus (plural = sulci) fat-filled groove visible on the pulmonary trunk large arterial vessel that carries surface of the heart; coronary vessels are also blood ejected from the right ventricle; divides into located in these areas the left and right pulmonary arteries superior vena cava large systemic vein that returns pulmonary valve (also, pulmonary semilunar valve, blood to the heart from the superior portion of the the pulmonic valve, or the right semilunar valve) body valve at the base of the pulmonary trunk that systemic circuit blood flow to and from virtually all of prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle; the tissues of the body consists of three flaps systole period of time when the heart muscle is pulmonary veins veins that carry highly oxygenated contracting blood into the left atrium,
