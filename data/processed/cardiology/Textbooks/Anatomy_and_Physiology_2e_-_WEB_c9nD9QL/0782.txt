(credit: Graham Richardson/flickr.com) CHAPTER OBJECTIVES After this chapter, you will be able to: • Discuss both functional and structural classifications for body joints • Describe the characteristic features for fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints and give examples of each • Define and identify the different body movements • Discuss the structure of specific body joints and the movements allowed by each • Explain the development of body joints INTRODUCTION The adult human body has 206 bones, and with the exception of the hyoid bone in the neck, each bone is connected to at least one other bone. Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow for movement between the bones. At these joints, the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones can move smoothly against each other. However, the bones of other joints may be joined to each other by connective tissue or cartilage. These joints are designed for stability and provide for little or no movement. Importantly, joint stability and movement are related to each other. This means
