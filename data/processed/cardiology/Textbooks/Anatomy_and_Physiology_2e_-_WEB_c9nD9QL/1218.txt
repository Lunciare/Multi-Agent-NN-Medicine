from separate presynaptic elements that dendrites add up to initiate an action potential propagation movement of an action potential along spinal cord organ of the central nervous system the length of an axon found within the vertebral cavity and connected receptor potential graded potential in a specialized with the periphery through spinal nerves; mediates sensory cell that directly causes the release of reflex behaviors neurotransmitter without an intervening action stimulus an event in the external or internal potential environment that registers as activity in a sensory refractory period time after the initiation of an action neuron potential when another action potential cannot be summate to add together, as in the cumulative generated change in postsynaptic potentials toward reaching relative refractory period time during the refractory threshold in the membrane, either across a span of period when a new action potential can only be the membrane or over a certain amount of time initiated by a stronger stimulus than the current synapse narrow junction across which a chemical action potential because voltage-gated K+channels signal passes from neuron to the next, initiating a are not closed new electrical signal in the target cell repolarization return of the membrane potential to synaptic cleft
