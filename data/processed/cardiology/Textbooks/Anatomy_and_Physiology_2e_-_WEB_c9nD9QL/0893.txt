These joints allow the secreted by the synovial membrane. bones to slide or rotate against each other, but the range of motion is usually slight and tightly limited by Synovial joints are strengthened by the presence of ligaments or surrounding bones. This type of joint is ligaments, which hold the bones together and resist found between the articular processes of adjacent excessive or abnormal movements of the joint. vertebrae, at the acromioclavicular joint, or at the Ligaments are classified as extrinsic ligaments if they intercarpal joints of the hand and intertarsal joints of are located outside of the articular capsule, intrinsic the foot. Ball-and-socket joints, in which the rounded ligaments if they are fused to the wall of the articular head of a bone fits into a large depression or socket, capsule, or intracapsular ligaments if they are located are found at the shoulder and hip joints. Both plane inside the articular capsule. Some synovial joints also and ball-and-sockets joints are classified functionally have an articular disc (meniscus), which can provide as multiaxial joints. However, ball-and-socket joints padding between the bones, smooth their movements, allow for large movements, while the motions between or strongly join the
