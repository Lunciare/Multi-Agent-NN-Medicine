embryo thicken into the neural plate. During the fourth week, tissues on either side of the plate fold upward into aneural fold. The two folds converge to form theneural tube. The tube lies atop a rod-shaped, mesoderm-derivednotochord, which eventually becomes the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. Block-like structures calledsomitesform on either side of the tube, eventually differentiating into the axial skeleton, skeletal muscle, and dermis. During the fourth and fifth weeks, the anterior neural tube dilates and subdivides to form vesicles that will become the brain structures.

A deficiency of maternal folate in the first weeks of pregnancy can result in neural tube defects, including spina bifida—a birth defect in which spinal tissue protrudes through the newborn’s vertebral column, which has failed to completely close. A more severe neural tube defect is anencephaly, a partial or complete absence of brain tissue. FIGURE28.13 Neurulation The embryonic process of neurulation establishes the rudiments of the future central nervous system and skeleton. The embryo, which begins as a flat sheet of cells, begins to acquire a cylindrical
