plus the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone to the petrous ridge sacrum and coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into the (petrous portion of temporal bone). The right and left cervical region (C1–C7 vertebrae), the thoracic region sides are separated at the midline by the sella turcica, (T1–T12 vertebrae), and the lumbar region (L1–L5 which surrounds the shallow hypophyseal fossa. vertebrae). The sacrum arises from the fusion of five Openings through the skull in the floor of the middle sacral vertebrae and the coccyx from the fusion of four fossa include the optic canal and superior orbital small coccygeal vertebrae. The vertebral column has fissure, which open into the posterior orbit, the four curvatures, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen sacrococcygeal curves. The thoracic and spinosum, and the exit of the carotid canal with its sacrococcygeal curves are primary curves retained underlying foramen lacerum. The deep posterior from the original fetal curvature. The cervical and cranial fossa extends from the petrous ridge to the lumbar curves develop after birth and thus are occipital bone. Openings here include the large secondary curves. The cervical curve develops as the foramen magnum, plus the internal acoustic meatus, infant
