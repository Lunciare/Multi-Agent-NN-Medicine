Anatomy and Physiology

rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to proper treatment and the extent of recovery that is possible. The exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections. The first of these is themental status exam, which assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation, and language. Then there is thecranial nerve exam, which tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures associated with them. The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable. Two major sections, thesensory examand themotor exam, test the sensory and motor functions associated with spinal nerves. Finally, thecoordination examtests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements. Thegait exam, which is often considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement. Neuroanatomy and the Neurological Exam Localization of functionis the concept that circumscribed locations are responsible for specific functions. The neurological exam highlights this relationship. For example, the cognitive functions that are assessed in the mental status exam are based on functions in the cerebrum, mostly in the
