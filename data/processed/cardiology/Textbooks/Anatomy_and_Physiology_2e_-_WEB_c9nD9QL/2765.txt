lungs, and stimulates gluconeogenesis TABLE24.1 Anabolic Hormones Hormone Function Growth Synthesized and released from the pituitary gland; stimulates the growth of cells, tissues, and hormone bones (GH) Insulin-like growth Stimulates the growth of muscle and bone while also inhibiting cell death (apoptosis) factor (IGF) Produced by the beta cells of the pancreas; plays an essential role in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, controls blood glucose levels, and promotes the uptake of glucose into body cells; Insulin causes cells in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to take up glucose from the blood and store it in the liver and muscle as glycogen; its effect is the opposite of glucagon; glucagon and insulin are a part of a negative-feedback system that stabilizes blood glucose levels TABLE24.2 1062 24 • Metabolism and Nutrition Hormone Function Produced by the testes in males and the ovaries in females; stimulates an increase in muscle Testosterone mass and strength as well as the growth and strengthening of bone Produced primarily by the ovaries, it is also produced by the liver and adrenal glands; its anabolic Estrogen functions include increasing metabolism and fat deposition TABLE24.2 Disorders of the...
