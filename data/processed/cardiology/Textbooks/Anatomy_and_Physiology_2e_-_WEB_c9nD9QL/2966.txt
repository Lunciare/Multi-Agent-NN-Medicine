Anatomy and Physiology

of Cortical nephrons have short loops of Henle, whereas voiding the urine and involves both involuntary and juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops of Henle voluntary actions. Voluntary control of micturition extending into the medulla. About 15 percent of requires a mature and intact sacral micturition center. nephrons are juxtamedullary. The glomerulus is a It also requires an intact spinal cord. Loss of control of capillary bed that filters blood principally based on micturition is called incontinence and results in voiding particle size. The filtrate is captured by Bowman’s when the bladder contains about 250 mL urine. The capsule and directed to the PCT. A filtration membrane ureters are retroperitoneal and lead from the renal is formed by the fused basement membranes of the pelvis of the kidney to the trigone area at the base of 1150 25 • Chapter Review podocytes and the capillary endothelial cells that they whereas that of peritubular capillaries and vasa recta is embrace. Contractile mesangial cells further perform a due to osmolarity and concentration gradients. The role in regulating the rate at which the blood is filtered. PCT is the most metabolically active part of the Specialized cells in the JGA produce paracrine signals nephron
