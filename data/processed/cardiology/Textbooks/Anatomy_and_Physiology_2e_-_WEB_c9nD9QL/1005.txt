SO fibers use model of contraction. ACh is the neurotransmitter that aerobic metabolism to produce low power contractions binds at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger over long periods and are slow to fatigue. FO fibers use depolarization, and an action potential travels along aerobic metabolism to produce ATP but produce higher the sarcolemma to trigger calcium release from SR. tension contractions than SO fibers. FG fibers use The actin sites are exposed after Ca++enters the anaerobic metabolism to produce powerful, high- sarcoplasm from its SR storage to activate the tension contractions but fatigue quickly. troponin-tropomyosin complex so that the tropomyosin 10.6Exercise and Muscle Performance shifts away from the sites. The cross-bridging of myosin heads docking into actin-binding sites is Hypertrophy is an increase in muscle mass due to the followed by the “power stroke”—the sliding of the thin addition of structural proteins. The opposite of filaments by thick filaments. The power strokes are hypertrophy is atrophy, the loss of muscle mass due to powered by ATP. Ultimately, the sarcomeres, the breakdown of structural proteins. Endurance myofibrils, and muscle fibers shorten to produce exercise causes an increase in cellular mitochondria, movement. myoglobin, and capillary networks in SO fibers. Endurance athletes
