the necessary energy production, you would produce excess CO (and 2 lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold). In order to balance the increased acid production, the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO . This helps to keep you from developing acidosis. 2 The body regulates the respiratory rate by the use of chemoreceptors, which primarily use CO as a signal. 2 Peripheral blood sensors are found in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries. These sensors signal the brain to provide immediate adjustments to the respiratory rate if CO levels rise or fall. Yet other sensors are found in the 2 brain itself. Changes in the pH of CSF affect the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, which can directly modulate breathing rate to bring the pH back into the normal range. Hypercapnia, or abnormally elevated blood levels of CO , occurs in any situation that impairs respiratory functions, 2 including pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Reduced breathing (hypoventilation) due to drugs such as morphine, barbiturates, or ethanol (or even just holding one’s breath) can also result in hypercapnia.Hypocapnia, or abnormally low blood levels of CO , occurs with any cause of hyperventilation that drives
