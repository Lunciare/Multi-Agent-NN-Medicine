catabolic hormones hormones that stimulate the hexokinase cellular enzyme, found in most tissues, breakdown of larger molecules that converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate catabolic reactions reactions that break down larger upon uptake into the cell molecules into their constituent parts hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) molecule cellular respiration production of ATP from glucose created in the first step of the creation of ketone oxidation via glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and bodies from acetyl CoA oxidative phosphorylation inactive proenzymes forms in which proteases are cholecystokinin (CCK) hormone that stimulates the stored and released to prevent the inappropriate release of pancreatic lipase and the contraction of digestion of the native proteins of the stomach, the gallbladder to release bile salts pancreas, and small intestine chylomicrons vesicles containing cholesterol and insulin hormone secreted by the pancreas that triglycerides that transport lipids out of the stimulates the uptake of glucose into the cells intestinal cells and into the lymphatic and ketone bodies alternative source of energy when circulatory systems glucose is limited, created when too much acetyl chymotrypsin pancreatic enzyme that digests protein CoA is created during fatty acid oxidation chymotrypsinogen proenzyme that is activated by Krebs cycle also called the citric acid cycle or the
