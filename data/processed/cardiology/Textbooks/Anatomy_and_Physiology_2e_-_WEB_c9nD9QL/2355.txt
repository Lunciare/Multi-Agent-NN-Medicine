Anatomy and Physiology

in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs, which include the lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All of these tissues have many features in common, including the following: • The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of lymphocytes, with specific B cell-rich and T cell- rich areas • An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed macrophages • Germinal centers, which are the sites of rapidly dividing and differentiating B lymphocytes • Specialized post-capillary vessels known ashigh endothelial venules; the cells lining these venules are thicker and more columnar than normal endothelial cells, which allow cells from the blood to directly enter these tissues Lymph Nodes Lymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and are thus sometimes referred to as the “filters of the lymph” (Figure 21.8). Any bacteria that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic capillaries and transported to a regional lymph node. Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize and kill many of the pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The lymph node is also the 902 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System site of adaptive
