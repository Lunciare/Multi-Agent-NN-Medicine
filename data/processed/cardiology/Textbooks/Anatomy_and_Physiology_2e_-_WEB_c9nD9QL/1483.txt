the ear closer to the sound source will hear primary pathway a slightly more intense sound fasciculus cuneatus lateral division of the dorsal interaural time difference cue used to help with column system composed of fibers from sensory sound localization in the horizontal plane that neurons in the upper body compares the relative time of arrival of sounds at fasciculus gracilis medial division of the dorsal the two ears, because the ear closer to the sound column system composed of fibers from sensory source will receive the stimulus microseconds neurons in the lower body before the other ear fibrous tunic outer layer of the eye primarily internal capsule segment of the descending motor composed of connective tissue known as the sclera pathway that passes between the caudate nucleus and cornea and the putamen fovea exact center of the retina at which visual interoceptor sensory receptor that is positioned to stimuli are focused for maximal acuity, where the interpret stimuli from internal organs, such as retina is thinnest, at which there is nothing but stretch receptors in the wall of blood vessels photoreceptors ipsilateral word meaning on the same side, as in free nerve ending configuration of a sensory receptor axons
