As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted, muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source.Glycolysisis an anaerobic (non-oxygen-dependent) process that breaks down glucose (sugar) to produce ATP; however, glycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate. Thus, the switch to glycolysis results in a slower rate of ATP availability to the muscle. The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by metabolizing glycogen that is stored in the muscle. The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and two molecules ofpyruvic acid, which can be used in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low, converted to lactic acid (Figure 10.12b). If oxygen is available, pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration. However, if oxygen is not available, pyruvic acid is converted tolactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue. This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme NAD+from NADH, which is needed for glycolysis to continue. This occurs during strenuous exercise when high amounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle. Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very long (approximately 1 minute of muscle activity), but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high- intensity
