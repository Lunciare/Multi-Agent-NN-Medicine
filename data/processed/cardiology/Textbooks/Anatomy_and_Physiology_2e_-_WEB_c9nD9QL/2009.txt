chordae tendineae to two papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle. At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or theaortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta. It normally is composed of three flaps. When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to flow back into the ventricle from the aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound. InFigure 19.13a, the two atrioventricular valves are open and the two semilunar valves are closed. This occurs when both atria and ventricles are relaxed and when the atria contract to pump blood into the ventricles.Figure 19.13bshows a frontal view. Although only the left side of the heart is illustrated, the process is virtually identical on the right. FIGURE19.13 Blood Flow from the Left Atrium to the Left Ventricle (a) A transverse section through the heart illustrates the four heart valves. The two atrioventricular valves are open; the two semilunar valves are closed. The atria and vessels have been removed. (b) A frontal section through the heart illustrates blood flow through the mitral valve. When the mitral valve is open, it allows blood to move from the
