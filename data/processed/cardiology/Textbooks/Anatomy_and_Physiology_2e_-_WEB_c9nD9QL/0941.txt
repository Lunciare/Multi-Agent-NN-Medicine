thin filament occurs at this step (Figure 10.11c). In the absence of ATP, the myosin head will not detach from actin. One part of the myosin head attaches to the binding site on the actin, but the head has another binding site for ATP.

After this occurs, ATP is converted to ADP and P by the intrinsicATPaseactivity of myosin. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle i of the myosin head into a cocked position (Figure 10.11e). The myosin head is now in position for further movement. When the myosin head is cocked, myosin is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke, and at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the formed cross-bridge is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. As long as ATP is available, it readily attaches to myosin, the cross-bridge cycle can recur, and muscle contraction can continue. Note
