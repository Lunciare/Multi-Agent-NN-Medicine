Anatomy and Physiology

They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its conversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes. 2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Compare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds • Identify the properties of water that make it essential to life • Explain the role of salts in body functioning • Distinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH • Discuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis Access for free at openstax.org 2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 55 The concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for geology as well as biology. This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic. • Aninorganic compoundis a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such
