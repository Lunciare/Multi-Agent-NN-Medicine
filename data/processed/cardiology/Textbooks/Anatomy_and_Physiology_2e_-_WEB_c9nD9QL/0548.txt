Anatomy and Physiology

by theperpendicular plate of the ethmoid boneand the lower portion is thevomer bone. Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows superiorly. When looking into the nasal cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting from each lateral wall. The larger of these is theinferior nasal concha, an independent bone of the skull. Located just above the inferior concha is themiddle nasal concha, which is part of the ethmoid bone. A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is thesuperior nasal concha. It is much smaller and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is located just lateral to the perpendicular plate, in the upper nasal cavity. Lateral View of Skull A view of the lateral skull is dominated by the large, rounded brain case above and the upper and lower jaws with their teeth below (Figure 7.5). Separating these areas is the bridge of bone called the zygomatic arch. The zygomatic archis the bony arch on the side of skull that spans from the area of the cheek to just above the ear canal. It is formed by the
