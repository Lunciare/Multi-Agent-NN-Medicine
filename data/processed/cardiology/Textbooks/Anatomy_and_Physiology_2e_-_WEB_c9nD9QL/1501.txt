Anatomy and Physiology

neurons are the the level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds cells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause similar sensation information from the head to these contractions. These neurons project through the spinal pathways. nerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular The auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in junctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple the brain stem in which additional information is muscle fibers within a target muscle. The number of extracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed fibers that are innervated by a single motor neuron by the cochlea. Sound localization is made possible varies on the basis of the precision necessary for that Access for free at openstax.org 14 • Interactive Link Questions 585 muscle and the amount of force necessary for that spinal cord and the motor neuron that projects to a motor unit. The quadriceps, for example, have many muscle. Antagonist and postural muscles can be fibers controlled by single motor neurons for powerful coordinated with the withdrawal, making the contractions that do not need to be precise. The connections more complex. The simple, single extraocular muscles have only a small number of fibers neuronal connection is the basis of
