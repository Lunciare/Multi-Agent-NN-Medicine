of Michigan WebScope( explore the tissue sample in greater detail. If you zoom in on the dorsal root ganglion, you can see smaller satellite glial cells surrounding the large cell bodies of the sensory neurons. From what structure do satellite cells derive during embryologic development? Another type of sensory ganglion is acranial nerve ganglion. This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion, except that it is associated with acranial nerveinstead of aspinal nerve. The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium, whereas the ganglia are outside the skull. For example, thetrigeminal ganglionis superficial to the temporal bone whereas its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem. The neurons of 520 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System cranial nerve ganglia are also unipolar in shape with associated satellite cells. The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system, which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thesympathetic chain gangliaconstitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. Superior to the chain ganglia are threeparavertebral gangliain the cervical region. Three other autonomic ganglia
