spontaneously, a condition not consistent with life.) Then, thrombin converts factor I, the soluble fibrinogen, into the insoluble fibrin protein strands. Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on the fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces (seeFigure 18.14a). This process also wrings out of the clot a small amount of fluid calledserum, which is blood plasma without its clotting factors. To restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed.Fibrinolysisis the gradual degradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein- catabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the activeplasmin, which gradually breaks down the fibrin of the clot. Additionally, bradykinin, a vasodilator, is released, reversing the effects of the serotonin and prostaglandins from the platelets. This allows the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessels to relax and helps to restore the circulation. 738 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Plasma Anticoagulants Ananticoagulantis any substance that
