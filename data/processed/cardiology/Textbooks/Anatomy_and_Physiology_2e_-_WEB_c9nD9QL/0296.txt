genetic code lies in the particular cell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals, sequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along respectively. Biochemical reactions within the DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must mitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into perform two sequential steps. In the first step, the usable form of cellular energy known as ATP. transcription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful code. A molecule of messenger RNA that is substances such as free radicals into oxygen and water. complementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a Cells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein process similar to DNA replication. The molecule of filaments that extend throughout its interior. Three mRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the different kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton process of translation, the mRNA attaches to a (in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments, ribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each appropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one, cytoskeletal component performs unique functions as coded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until well as provides a supportive framework for the cell. the protein is fully synthesized.
