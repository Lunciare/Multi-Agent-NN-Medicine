is an integral membrane protein that transports Cl–ions out of the cell. In a person who has CF, the gene for the CFTR is mutated, thus, the cell manufactures a defective channel protein that typically is not incorporated into the membrane, but is instead degraded by the cell. The CFTR requires ATP in order to function, making its Cl–transport a form of active transport. This characteristic puzzled researchers for a long time because the Cl–ions are actually flowingdowntheir Access for free at openstax.org 3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles 91 concentration gradient when transported out of cells. Active transport generally pumps ionsagainsttheir concentration gradient, but the CFTR presents an exception to this rule. In normal lung tissue, the movement of Cl–out of the cell maintains a Cl–-rich, negatively charged environment immediately outside of the cell. This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system. Respiratory epithelial cells secrete mucus, which serves to trap dust, bacteria, and other debris. A cilium (plural = cilia) is one of the hair-like appendages found on certain cells. Cilia on the epithelial cells move the mucus and its trapped particles up the airways away from the lungs and toward the outside.
