factors. Tidal 990 22 • Chapter Review volume refers to the amount of air that enters the lungs pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. If ventilation is during quiet breathing, whereas inspiratory reserve insufficient and the partial pressure of oxygen drops in volume is the amount of air that enters the lungs when the alveolar air, the capillary is constricted and blood a person inhales past the tidal volume. Expiratory flow is redirected to alveoli with sufficient ventilation. reserve volume is the extra amount of air that can leave External respiration refers to gas exchange that occurs with forceful expiration, following tidal expiration. in the alveoli, whereas internal respiration refers to gas Residual volume is the amount of air that is left in the exchange that occurs in the tissue. Both are driven by lungs after expelling the expiratory reserve volume. partial pressure differences. Respiratory capacity is the combination of two or more 22.5Transport of Gases volumes. Anatomical dead space refers to the air within the respiratory structures that never participates Oxygen is primarily transported through the blood by in gas exchange, because it does not reach functional erythrocytes. These cells contain a metalloprotein alveoli. Respiratory rate is the number
