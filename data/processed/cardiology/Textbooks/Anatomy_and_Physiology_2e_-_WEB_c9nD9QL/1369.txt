Sensory neurons are activated by a stimulus, which is sent to the central nervous system, and a motor response is sent out to the skeletal muscles that control this movement. CHAPTER OBJECTIVES After studying this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe the components of the somatic nervous system • Name the modalities and submodalities of the sensory systems • Distinguish between general and special senses • Describe regions of the central nervous system that contribute to somatic functions • Explain the stimulus-response motor pathway INTRODUCTION The somatic nervous system is traditionally considered a division within the peripheral nervous system. However, this misses an important point: somatic refers to a functional division, whereas peripheral refers to an anatomic division. The somatic nervous system is responsible for our conscious perception of the environment and for our voluntary responses to that perception by means of skeletal muscles. Peripheral sensory neurons receive input from environmental stimuli,
