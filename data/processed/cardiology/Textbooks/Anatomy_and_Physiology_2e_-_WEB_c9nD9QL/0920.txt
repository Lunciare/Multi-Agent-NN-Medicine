Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion insmooth muscle, the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber (which has only a single nucleus) has a uniform, nonstriated appearance (resulting in the name smooth muscle). However, the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient. Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system; and smooth muscle in the skin, visceral organs, and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body. 10.2 Skeletal Muscle LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the layers of connective tissues packaging skeletal muscle • Explain how muscles work with tendons to move the body • Identify areas of the skeletal muscle fibers • Describe excitation-contraction coupling The best-known feature of skeletal muscle is its ability
