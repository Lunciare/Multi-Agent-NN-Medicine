for three planes of motions. joint, the articulating bone surfaces are not directly united to each other, but come together within a fluid- 9.2Fibrous Joints filled joint cavity. Fibrous joints are where adjacent bones are strongly The functional classification of body joints is based on united by fibrous connective tissue. The gap filled by the degree of movement found at each joint. A connective tissue may be narrow or wide. The three synarthrosis is a joint that is essentially immobile. This types of fibrous joints are sutures, gomphoses, and type of joint provides for a strong connection between syndesmoses. A suture is the narrow fibrous joint that the adjacent bones, which serves to protect internal unites most bones of the skull. At a gomphosis, the structures such as the brain or heart. Examples include root of a tooth is anchored across a narrow gap by the fibrous joints of the skull sutures and the periodontal ligaments to the walls of its socket in the cartilaginous manubriosternal joint. A joint that allows bony jaw. A syndesmosis is the type of fibrous joint for limited movement is an amphiarthrosis. An example found between parallel bones. The gap between the is the pubic
