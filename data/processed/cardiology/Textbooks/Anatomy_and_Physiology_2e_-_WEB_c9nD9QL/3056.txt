ducts aid the process of sperm maturation and transport the sperm and other seminal components to the penis, which may deliver sperm to the female reproductive tract. In this section, we examine each of these different structures, and discuss the process of sperm production and transport.

Sperm exit the scrotum through the ductus deferens, which is bundled in the spermatic cord. The seminal vesicles and prostate gland add fluids to the sperm to create semen. Scrotum The testes are located in a skin-covered, highly pigmented, muscular sack called thescrotumthat extends from the body behind the penis (seeFigure 27.2). This location is important in sperm production, which occurs within the testes, and proceeds more efficiently when the testes are kept 2 to 4°C below core body temperature. The dartos muscle makes up the subcutaneous muscle layer of the scrotum (Figure 27.3). It continues internally to make up the scrotal septum, a wall that divides the scrotum into
