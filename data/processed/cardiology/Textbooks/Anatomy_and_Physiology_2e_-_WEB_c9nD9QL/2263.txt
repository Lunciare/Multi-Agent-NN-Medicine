smallerhemiazygos vein(hemi- = “half”) on the left of the vertebral column, drain blood from the thoracic region. The hemiazygos vein does not drain directly into the superior vena cava but enters the brachiocephalic vein via the superior intercostal vein. The azygos vein passes through the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity on the right side of the vertebral column and begins in the lumbar region of the thoracic cavity. It flows into the superior vena cava at approximately the level of T2, making a significant contribution to the flow of blood. It combines with the two large left and right brachiocephalic veins to form the superior vena cava. Table 20.11summarizes the veins of the thoracic region that flow into the superior vena cava. FIGURE20.36 Veins of the Thoracic and Abdominal Regions Veins of the thoracic and abdominal regions drain blood from the area above the diaphragm, returning it to the right atrium via the superior vena cava. 866 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation Veins of the Thoracic Region Vessel Description Superior vena Large systemic vein; drains blood from most areas superior to the diaphragm; empties into cava the right atrium Located deep in the thoracic cavity; formed
