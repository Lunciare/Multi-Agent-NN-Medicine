Anatomy and Physiology

antigens to regional draining lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are the locations in which most T cell responses against pathogens of the interstitial tissues are mounted. Macrophages are found in the skin and in the lining of mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, lungs, and intestines. B cells may also present antigens to T cells, which are necessary for certain types of antibody responses, to be covered later in this chapter. Classes of Antigen-presenting Cells MHC Cell type Phagocytic? Function Class Many No Stimulates cytotoxic T cell immune response I Class Stimulates phagocytosis and presentation at primary Macrophage Yes II infection site Class Dendritic Yes, in tissues Brings antigens to regional lymph nodes II Class Yes, internalizes surface Ig and B cell Stimulates antibody secretion by B cells II antigen TABLE21.4 T Cell Development and Differentiation The process of eliminating T cells that might attack the cells of one’s own body is referred to asT cell tolerance. While thymocytes are in the cortex of the thymus, they are referred to as “double negatives,” meaning that they do not bear the CD4 or CD8 molecules that you can use to follow their pathways of differentiation (Figure 21.18). In the cortex
