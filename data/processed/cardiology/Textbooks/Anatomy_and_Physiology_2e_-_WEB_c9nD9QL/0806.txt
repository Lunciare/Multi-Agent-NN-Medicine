smoothly against each other within the joint cavity, and the freedom of joint movement this provides, means that each synovial joint is functionally classified as a diarthrosis. Outside of their articulating surfaces, the bones are connected together by ligaments, which are strong bands of fibrous connective tissue. These strengthen and support the joint by anchoring the bones together and preventing their separation. Ligaments allow for normal movements at a joint, but limit the range of these motions, thus preventing excessive or abnormal joint movements. Ligaments are classified based on their relationship to the fibrous articular capsule. Anextrinsic ligamentis located outside of the articular capsule, anintrinsic ligamentis fused to or incorporated into the wall of the articular capsule, and anintracapsular ligamentis located inside of the articular capsule. At many synovial joints, additional support is provided by the muscles and their tendons that act across the joint. A tendonis the dense connective tissue structure that attaches a muscle to bone. As forces acting on a joint increase, 322 9 • Joints the body will automatically increase the overall strength of contraction of the muscles crossing that joint, thus allowing the muscle and its tendon to serve as a “dynamic ligament” to resist
