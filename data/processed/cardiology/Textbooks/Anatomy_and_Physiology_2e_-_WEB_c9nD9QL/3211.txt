Anatomy and Physiology

every 3–30 minutes and last only 20–40 seconds; however, by the end of this stage, contractions may occur as frequently as every 1.5–2 minutes and last for a full minute. Each contraction sharply reduces oxygenated blood flow to the fetus. For this reason, it is critical that a period of relaxation occur after each contraction. Fetal distress, measured as a sustained decrease or increase in the fetal Access for free at openstax.org 28.4 • Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and Birth 1249 heart rate, can result from severe contractions that are too powerful or lengthy for oxygenated blood to be restored to the fetus. Such a situation can be cause for an emergency birth with vacuum, forceps, or surgically by Caesarian section. The amniotic membranes rupture before the onset of labor in about 12 percent of people; they typically rupture at the end of the dilation stage in response to excessive pressure from the fetal head entering the birth canal. Expulsion Stage Theexpulsionstage begins when the fetal head enters the birth canal and ends with birth of the newborn. It typically takes up to 2 hours, but it can last longer or be completed in minutes, depending in part on the
