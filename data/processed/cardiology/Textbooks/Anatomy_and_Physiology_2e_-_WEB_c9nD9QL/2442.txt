the latter will often mount a cytotoxic T cell response to the organ and reject it. Histologically, if a biopsy of a transplanted organ exhibits massive infiltration of T lymphocytes within the first weeks after transplant, it is a sign that the transplant is likely to fail. The response is a classical, and very specific, primary T cell immune response. As far as medicine is concerned, the immune response in this scenario does the patient no good at all and causes significant harm. 936 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System Partial Table of Alleles of the Human MHC (Class I) Gene # of alleles # of possible MHC I protein components A 2132 1527 B 2798 2110 C 1672 1200 E 11 3 F 22 4 G 50 16 TABLE21.8 Partial Table of Alleles of the Human MHC (Class II) Gene # of alleles # of possible MHC II protein components DRA 7 2 DRB 1297 958 DQA1 49 31 DQB1 179 128 DPA1 36 18 DPB1 158 136 DMA 7 4 DMB 13 7 DOA 12 3 DOB 13 5 TABLE21.9 Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A have made transplants more successful, but matching the MHC molecules is
