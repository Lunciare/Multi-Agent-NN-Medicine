suprahyoid muscles neck muscles that are superior vastus medialis quadricep muscle on the medial to the hyoid bone aspect of the thigh supraspinatus muscle that abducts the arm Chapter Review 11.1Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their pulled is called the muscle’s insertion and the end of Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever the muscle attached to a fixed, or stabilized, bone is Systems called the origin. The muscle primarily responsible for a movement is called the prime mover, and muscles Skeletal muscles each have an origin and an insertion. that assist in this action are called synergists. A The end of the muscle that attaches to the bone being synergist that makes the insertion site more stable is 446 11 • Chapter Review called a fixator. Meanwhile, a muscle with the opposite cervicis, and the spinalis thoracis. The action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. transversospinales include the semispinalis capitis, Several factors contribute to the force generated by a semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus, skeletal muscle. One is the arrangement of the and rotatores. The segmental muscles include the fascicles in the skeletal muscle. Fascicles can be interspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the parallel, circular, convergent, pennate, fusiform, or scalenes include
