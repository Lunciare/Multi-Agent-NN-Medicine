By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain how bipotential tissues are directed to develop into male or female sex organs • Name the rudimentary duct systems in the embryo that are precursors to male or female internal sex organs • Describe the hormonal changes that bring about puberty, and the secondary sex characteristics The development of the reproductive systems begins soon after fertilization of the egg, with primordial gonads beginning to develop approximately one month after conception. Reproductive development continues in utero, but Access for free at openstax.org 27.3 • Development of the Male and Female Reproductive Systems 1213 there is little change in the reproductive system between infancy and puberty. Development of the Sexual Organs in the Embryo and Fetus Mammalian sex determination is generally determined by X and Y chromosomes. Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female in sex and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. The presence of a Y chromosome triggers the development of a certain set of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. Nondisjunction during meiosis can produce other combinations such as XXY, XYY, and XO which are called chromosomal intersex. Without much chemical prompting, all fertilized
