Anatomy and Physiology

the formation of scar tissue between the articular capsule and surrounding structures, thus reducing shoulder mobility, a condition called adhesive capsulitis (“frozen shoulder”). INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( a tutorial on the anatomy of the shoulder joint. What movements are available at the shoulder joint? INTERACTIVE LINK Watch thisvideo( learn more about the anatomy of the shoulder joint, including bones, joints, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. What is the shape of the glenoid labrum in cross- section, and what is the importance of this shape? Elbow Joint Theelbow jointis a uniaxial hinge joint formed by thehumeroulnar joint, the articulation between the trochlea of the humerus and the trochlear notch of the ulna. Also associated with the elbow are thehumeroradial jointand the proximal radioulnar joint. All three of these joints are enclosed within a single articular capsule (Figure 9.17). The articular capsule of the elbow is thin on its anterior and posterior aspects, but is thickened along its outside margins by strong intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments prevent side-to-side movements and hyperextension. On the medial side is the triangularulnar collateral ligament. This arises from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and attaches to the medial side of the proximal ulna. The strongest part
