altitudes results in a lower oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin in the blood. In Access for free at openstax.org 22.7 • Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System 983 turn, the tissue levels of oxygen are also lower. As a result, the kidneys are stimulated to produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of erythrocytes, resulting in a greater number of circulating erythrocytes in an individual at a high altitude over a long period. With more red blood cells, there is more hemoglobin to help transport the available oxygen. Even though there is low saturation of each hemoglobin molecule, there will be more hemoglobin present, and therefore more oxygen in the blood. Over time, this allows the person to partake in physical exertion without developing AMS. 22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Create a timeline of the phases of respiratory development in the fetus • Propose reasons for fetal breathing movements • Explain how the lungs become inflated after birth Development of the respiratory system begins early in the fetus. It is a complex process that includes many structures, most of which arise from
