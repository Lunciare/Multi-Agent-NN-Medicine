down. Nucleic acids are present in most of the foods you eat. During digestion, nucleic acids including DNA and various RNAs are broken down into their constituent nucleotides. These nucleotides are readily absorbed and transported throughout the body to be used by individual cells during nucleic acid metabolism.

Anabolic reactions combine monosaccharides to form polysaccharides, fatty acids to form triglycerides, amino acids to form proteins, and nucleotides to form nucleic acids. These processes require energy in the form of ATP molecules generated by catabolic reactions. Anabolic reactions, also calledbiosynthesis reactions, create new molecules that form new cells and tissues, and revitalize organs. Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism Catabolic and anabolic hormones in the body help regulate metabolic processes.Catabolic hormonesstimulate the breakdown of molecules and the production of energy. These include cortisol, glucagon, adrenaline/epinephrine, and cytokines. All of these hormones are mobilized at specific times to meet the needs of the body.Anabolic hormonesare required for the synthesis of molecules and include growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor, insulin, testosterone, and estrogen.Table 24.1summarizes the function of
