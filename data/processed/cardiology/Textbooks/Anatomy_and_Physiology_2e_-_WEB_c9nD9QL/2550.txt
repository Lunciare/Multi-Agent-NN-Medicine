transport of oxygen by erythrocytes (Figure 22.28). FIGURE22.28 Carbon Dioxide Transport Carbon dioxide is transported by three different methods: (a) in erythrocytes; (b) after forming carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is dissolved in plasma; (c) and in plasma. 980 22 • The Respiratory System Dissolved Carbon Dioxide Although carbon dioxide is not considered to be highly soluble in blood, a small fraction—about 7 to 10 percent—of the carbon dioxide that diffuses into the blood from the tissues dissolves in plasma. The dissolved carbon dioxide then travels in the bloodstream and when the blood reaches the pulmonary capillaries, the dissolved carbon dioxide diffuses across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled during pulmonary ventilation. Bicarbonate Buffer A large fraction—about 70 percent—of the carbon dioxide molecules that diffuse into the blood is transported to the lungs as bicarbonate. Most bicarbonate is produced in erythrocytes after carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillaries, and subsequently into red blood cells.Carbonic anhydrase (CA)causes carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid (H CO ), which dissociates into two ions: bicarbonate (HCO –) and hydrogen (H+). The following formula 2 3 3 depicts this reaction: Bicarbonate tends to build up in the erythrocytes, so
