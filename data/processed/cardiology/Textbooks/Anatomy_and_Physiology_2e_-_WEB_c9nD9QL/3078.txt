during puberty, activating characteristic physical changes and initiating spermatogenesis. Functions of Testosterone The continued presence of testosterone is necessary to keep the male reproductive system working properly, and Access for free at openstax.org 27.1 • Anatomy and Physiology of the Testicular Reproductive System 1195 Leydig cells produce approximately 6 to 7 mg of testosterone per day. Testicular steroidogenesis (the manufacture of androgens, including testosterone) results in testosterone concentrations that are 100 times higher in the testes than in the circulation. Maintaining these normal concentrations of testosterone promotes spermatogenesis, whereas low levels of testosterone can lead to infertility. In addition to intratesticular secretion, testosterone is also released into the systemic circulation and plays an important role in muscle development, bone growth, the development of secondary sex characteristics, and maintaining libido (sex drive) in both males and females. In females, the ovaries secrete small amounts of testosterone, although most is converted to estradiol. A small amount of testosterone is also secreted by the adrenal glands in both sexes. Control of Testosterone The regulation of testosterone concentrations throughout the body is critical for male reproductive function. The intricate interplay between the endocrine system and the reproductive system is shown inFigure 27.8. FIGURE27.8 Regulation
