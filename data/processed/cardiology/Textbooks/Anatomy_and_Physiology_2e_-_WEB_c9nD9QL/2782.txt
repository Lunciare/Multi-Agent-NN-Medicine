Anatomy and Physiology

aconitase enzyme converts citrate into isocitrate. In two successive steps of oxidative decarboxylation, two molecules of CO and two NADH molecules are produced when isocitrate dehydrogenase converts isocitrate into 2 the five-carbon α-ketoglutarate, which is then catalyzed and converted into the four-carbon succinyl CoA by α- ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The enzyme succinyl CoA dehydrogenase then converts succinyl CoA into succinate and forms the high-energy molecule GTP, which transfers its energy to ADP to produce ATP. Succinate dehydrogenase then converts succinate into fumarate, forming a molecule of FADH . Fumarase then converts 2 fumarate into malate, which malate dehydrogenase then converts back into oxaloacetate while reducing NAD+to NADH. Oxaloacetate is then ready to combine with the next acetyl CoA to start the Krebs cycle again (seeFigure 24.7). For each turn of the cycle, three NADH, one ATP (through GTP), and one FADH are created. Each carbon of 2 pyruvate is converted into CO , which is released as a byproduct of oxidative (aerobic) respiration. 2 Oxidative Phosphorylation and the Electron Transport Chain Theelectron transport chain (ETC)uses the NADH and FADH produced by the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. 2 Electrons from NADH and FADH are transferred through protein complexes embedded in the
