no muscle across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies are connected by a broad tendon called theepicranial aponeurosis, or galea aponeurosis (galea = “helmet”). The physicians originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked like a helmet. A large portion of the face is composed of thebuccinatormuscle, which compresses the cheek. This muscle allows you to whistle, blow, and suck; and it contributes to the action of chewing. There are several small facial muscles, one of which is thecorrugator supercilii, which is the prime mover of the eyebrows. Place your finger on your eyebrows at the point of the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you were surprised and lower your eyebrows as if you were frowning. With these movements, you can feel the action of the corrugator supercilii. Additional muscles of facial expression are presented inFigure 11.8.
