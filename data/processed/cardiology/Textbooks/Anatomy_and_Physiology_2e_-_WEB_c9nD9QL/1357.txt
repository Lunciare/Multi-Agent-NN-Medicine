The hypothalamus coordinates 13.4The Peripheral Nervous System homeostatic functions through the autonomic and endocrine systems. The PNS is composed of the groups of neurons 534 13 • Interactive Link Questions (ganglia) and bundles of axons (nerves) that are strictly sensory in function, strictly motor in function, or outside of the brain and spinal cord. Ganglia are of two a combination of the two functions. Sensory fibers are types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain axons of sensory ganglia that carry sensory information unipolar sensory neurons and are found on the dorsal
