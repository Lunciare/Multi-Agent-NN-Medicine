results in gas of the surrounding capillaries, together with the molecules crowding together, producing increased alveolar epithelium, forms the respiratory membrane. pressure. This is a blood-air barrier through which gas exchange occurs by simple diffusion. Resistance is created by inelastic surfaces, as well as the diameter of the airways. Resistance reduces the 22.2The Lungs flow of gases. The surface tension of the alveoli also The lungs are the major organs of the respiratory influences pressure, as it opposes the expansion of the system and are responsible for performing gas alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant helps to reduce exchange. The lungs are paired and separated into the surface tension so that the alveoli do not collapse lobes; The left lung consists of two lobes, whereas the during expiration. The ability of the lungs to stretch, right lung consists of three lobes. Blood circulation is called lung compliance, also plays a role in gas flow. very important, as blood is required to transport The more the lungs can stretch, the greater the oxygen from the lungs to other tissues throughout the potential volume of the lungs. The greater the volume body. The function of the pulmonary circulation is to of the lungs, the
