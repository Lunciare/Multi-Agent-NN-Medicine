Anatomy and Physiology

sex assigned at birth. In this chapter and the next chapter, "female" and "male" refer to sex only, and the typical reproductive anatomy of XX and XY individuals is discussed. Unique for its role in reproduction, agameteis a specialized sex cell, which in humans carries 23 chromosomes—one half the number in body cells. In almost all sexually reproducing species, these two haploid cells differ in size; the smaller gamete is called the male gamete and the larger one is called the female gamete. At fertilization, the chromosomes in one male gamete, called asperm(or spermatozoon), combine with the chromosomes in one female gamete, called an oocyte. The function of the male, or testicular, reproductive system (Figure 27.2) is to produce sperm and transfer them to the female reproductive tract. The paired testes are a crucial component in this process, as they produce both sperm and androgens, the hormones that support male reproductive physiology. In male humans, the most important androgen is testosterone. For people with a penis, several accessory organs and ducts aid the process of sperm maturation and transport the sperm and other seminal components to the penis, which may deliver sperm to the female reproductive tract.
