by the openings of the orbits and the nasal cavity. Also seen are the upper and lower jaws, with their respective teeth (Figure 7.4). Theorbitis the bony socket that houses the eyeball and muscles that move the eyeball or open the upper eyelid. The upper margin of the anterior orbit is thesupraorbital margin. Located near the midpoint of the supraorbital margin is a small opening called thesupraorbital foramen. This provides for passage of a sensory nerve to the skin of the forehead. Below the orbit is theinfraorbital foramen, which is the point of emergence for a sensory nerve that supplies the anterior face below the orbit.

Inside the nasal area of the skull, thenasal cavityis divided into halves by thenasal septum. The upper portion of the nasal septum is formed by theperpendicular plate of the ethmoid boneand the lower portion is thevomer bone. Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows
