remarkable adaptations of the newborn to life outside the womb. An offspring’s normal development depends upon the appropriate synthesis of structural and functional proteins. This, in turn, is governed by the genetic material inherited from the egg and sperm, as well as environmental factors. 28.1 Fertilization LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the obstacles that sperm must overcome to reach an oocyte • Explain capacitation and its importance in fertilization • Summarize the events that occur as a sperm fertilizes an oocyte Fertilizationoccurs when a sperm and an oocyte (egg) combine and their nuclei fuse. Because each of these 1224 28 • Development and Inheritance reproductive cells is a haploid cell containing half of the genetic material needed to form a human being, their combination forms a diploid cell. This new single cell, called azygote, contains all of the genetic material needed to form a human—half from each biological parent. Transit of Sperm Fertilization is a numbers game. During ejaculation, hundreds of millions of sperm (spermatozoa) are released into the vagina. Almost immediately, millions of these sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina (approximately pH 3.8), and millions more
