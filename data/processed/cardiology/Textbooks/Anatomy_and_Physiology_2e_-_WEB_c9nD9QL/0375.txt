tissue membrane that is covered single layer of cube-shaped cells; promotes by protective mucous and lines tissue exposed to secretion and absorption in ducts and tubules the outside environment simple squamous epithelium tissue that consists of muscle tissue type of tissue that is capable of a single layer of flat scale-like cells; promotes contracting and generating tension in response to diffusion and filtration across surface stimulation; produces movement. skeletal muscle usually attached to bone, under myelin layer of lipid inside some neuroglial cells that voluntary control, each cell is a fiber that is wraps around the axons of some neurons multinucleated and striated myocyte muscle cells smooth muscle under involuntary control, moves necrosis accidental death of cells and tissues internal organs, cells contain a single nucleus, are nervous tissue type of tissue that is capable of spindle-shaped, and do not appear striated; each sending and receiving impulses through cell is a fiber electrochemical signals. stratified columnar epithelium tissue that consists neuroglia supportive neural cells of two or more layers of column-like cells, contains neuron excitable neural cell that transfer nerve glands and is found in some ducts impulses stratified cuboidal epithelium tissue that consists of oligodendrocyte neuroglial cell that produces
