cytoplasm and all of the cytoplasmic organelles in the developing embryo are of egg-derived origin. This includes mitochondria, which contain their own DNA. Scientific research in the 1980s determined that mitochondrial DNA was maternally inherited, meaning that you can trace your mitochondrial DNA directly to your biological mother, her mother, and so on back through your female ancestors. Everyday Connection Mapping Human History with Mitochondrial DNA When we talk about human DNA, we’re usually referring to nuclear DNA; that is, the DNA coiled into chromosomal bundles in the nucleus of our cells. We inherit half of our nuclear DNA from one parent, and half from the other parent. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) comes only from the mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the fat ovum we inherit from our mother. Our mother received mtDNA from their mother, who got it from their mother, and so on. Each of our cells contains approximately 1700 mitochondria, with each mitochondrion packed with mtDNA containing approximately 37 genes.

By analyzing these mutational
