Anatomy and Physiology

cerebellum. A person’s conscious experiences are based on neural activity in the brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain. The coordination of reflexes depends on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord. 500 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System The Cerebrum The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most of the mass of the brain, is the cerebrum(Figure 13.6). The wrinkled portion is thecerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering. There is a large separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called thelongitudinal fissure. It separates the cerebrum into two distinct halves, a right and leftcerebral hemisphere. Deep within the cerebrum, the white matter of thecorpus callosumprovides the major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. FIGURE13.6 The Cerebrum The cerebrum is a large component of the CNS in humans, and the most obvious aspect of it is the folded surface called the cerebral cortex. Many of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral function. The complexity of the cerebrum is different across
