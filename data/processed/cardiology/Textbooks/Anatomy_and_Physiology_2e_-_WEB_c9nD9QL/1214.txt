dendrites opens under specific conditions, such as voltage muscarinic receptor type of acetylcholine receptor change or physical deformation protein that is characterized by also binding to generator potential graded potential from dendrites muscarine and is a metabotropic receptor of a unipolar cell which generates the action myelin lipid-rich insulating substance surrounding potential in the initial segment of that cell’s axon the axons of many neurons, allowing for faster glial cell one of the various types of neural tissue transmission of electrical signals cells responsible for maintenance of the tissue, and myelin sheath lipid-rich layer of insulation that largely responsible for supporting neurons surrounds an axon, formed by oligodendrocytes in graded potential change in the membrane potential the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS; facilitates that varies in size, depending on the size of the the transmission of electrical signals stimulus that elicits it nerve cord-like bundle of axons located in the gray matter regions of the nervous system containing peripheral nervous system that transmits sensory cell bodies of neurons with few or no myelinated input and response output to and from the central axons; actually may be more pink or tan in color, but nervous system called gray in
