Anatomy and Physiology

joins with the ilium portion of the hipbone to form the immobile sacroiliac joints of the pelvis. Passing inferiorly through the sacrum is a bony tunnel called thesacral canal, which terminates at thesacral hiatusnear the inferior tip of the sacrum. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the sacrum have a series of paired openings calledsacral foramina(singular = foramen) that connect to the sacral canal. Each of these openings is called aposterior (dorsal) sacral foramenoranterior (ventral) sacral foramen. These openings allow for the anterior and posterior branches of the sacral spinal nerves to exit the sacrum. Thesuperior articular process of the sacrum, one of which is found on either side of the superior opening of the sacral canal, articulates with the inferior articular processes from the L5 vertebra. The coccyx, or tailbone, is derived from the fusion of four very small coccygeal vertebrae (seeFigure 7.29). It articulates with the inferior tip of the sacrum. It is not weight bearing in the standing position, but may receive some body weight when sitting. 256 7 • Axial Skeleton FIGURE7.29 Sacrum and Coccyx The sacrum is formed from the fusion of five sacral vertebrae, whose lines of fusion are indicated by the transverse ridges.
