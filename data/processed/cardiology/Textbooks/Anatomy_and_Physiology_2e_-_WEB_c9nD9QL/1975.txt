is a living, sophisticated muscle. As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and muscle. Although the term “heart” is an English word, cardiac (heart-related) terminology can be traced back to the Latin term, “kardia.” Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal primarily with the heart. 752 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart 19.1 Heart Anatomy LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the location and position of the heart within the body cavity • Describe the internal and external anatomy of the heart • Identify the tissue layers of the heart • Relate the structure of the heart to its function as a pump • Compare systemic circulation to pulmonary circulation • Identify the veins and arteries of the coronary circulation system • Trace the pathway of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood thorough the chambers of the heart The vital importance of the heart is obvious. If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions per minute, a human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million times in one year,
