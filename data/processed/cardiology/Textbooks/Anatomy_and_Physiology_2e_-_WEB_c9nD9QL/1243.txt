place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible. 494 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System 13.1 The Embryologic Perspective LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the growth and differentiation of the neural tube • Relate the different stages of development to the adult structures of the central nervous system • Explain the expansion of the ventricular system of the adult brain from the central canal of the neural tube • Describe the connections of the diencephalon and cerebellum on the basis of patterns of embryonic development The brain is a complex organ composed of gray parts and white matter, which can be hard to distinguish. Starting from an embryologic perspective allows you to understand more easily how the parts relate to each other. The embryonic nervous system begins as a very simple structure—essentially just a straight line, which then gets increasingly complex. Looking at the development of the nervous system with a couple of early snapshots makes it easier to understand the whole complex system. Many structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not connected, and the connections that exist may seem arbitrary. But
