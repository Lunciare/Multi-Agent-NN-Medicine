compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water. Instead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the nonpolar oil. 2.3 Chemical Reactions LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Distinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions • Identify four forms of energy important in human functioning • Describe the three basic types of chemical reactions • Identify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions One characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go on to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism can proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules break, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy. The Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions Chemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the
