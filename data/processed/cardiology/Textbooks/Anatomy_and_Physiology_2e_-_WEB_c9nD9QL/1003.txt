muscle fibers are organized into circulatory system. groups called fascicles. Blood vessels and nerves enter Smooth muscle is found in the skin, where it is the connective tissue and branch in the cell. Muscles 390 10 • Chapter Review attach to bones directly or through tendons or together to produce a stronger muscle contraction. aponeuroses. Skeletal muscles maintain posture, Tetanus is the fusion of contractions to produce a stabilize bones and joints, control internal movement, continuous contraction. Increasing the number of and generate heat. motor neurons involved increases the amount of motor units activated in a muscle, which is called recruitment. Skeletal muscle fibers are long, multinucleated cells. Muscle tone is the constant low-level contractions that The membrane of the cell is the sarcolemma; the allow for posture and stability. cytoplasm of the cell is the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a form of endoplasmic 10.5Types of Muscle Fibers reticulum. Muscle fibers are composed of myofibrils. ATP provides the energy for muscle contraction. The The striations are created by the organization of actin three mechanisms for ATP regeneration are creatine and myosin resulting in the banding pattern of phosphate, anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic myofibrils. metabolism. Creatine phosphate provides about
