As the anterior known as the basal ganglia), which have two end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the pathways that process information within the primary vesicles that establish the forebrain, cerebrum. As shown in this video, the indirect midbrain, and hindbrain. Those structures continue pathway is the longer pathway through the system to develop throughout the rest of embryonic that results in decreased activity in the cerebral development and into adolescence. They are the cortex, and therefore less motor activity. The basis of the structure of the fully developed adult indirect pathway has an extra couple of connections brain.
