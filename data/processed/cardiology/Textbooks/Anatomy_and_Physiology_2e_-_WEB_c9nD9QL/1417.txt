are two types of photoreceptors—rods and cones—which differ in the shape of their outer segment. The rod-shaped outer segments of therod photoreceptorcontain a stack of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin. The cone-shaped outer segments of thecone photoreceptorcontain their photosensitive pigments in infoldings of the cell membrane. There are three cone photopigments, calledopsins, which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light. The wavelength of visible light determines its color. The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green, and blue. 556 14 • The Somatic Nervous System FIGURE14.16 Photoreceptor (a) All photoreceptors have inner segments containing the nucleus and other important organelles and outer segments with membrane arrays containing the photosensitive opsin molecules. Rod outer segments are long columnar shapes with stacks of membrane-bound discs that contain the rhodopsin pigment. Cone outer segments are short, tapered shapes with folds of membrane in place of the discs in the rods. (b) Tissue of the retina shows a dense layer of nuclei of the rods and cones. LM × 800.
