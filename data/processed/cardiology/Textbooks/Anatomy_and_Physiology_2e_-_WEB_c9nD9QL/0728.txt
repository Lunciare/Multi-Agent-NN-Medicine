Anatomy and Physiology

subsequent depression or collapse of the longitudinal arches, particularly on the medial side of the foot. This condition is called pes planus (“flat foot” or “fallen arches”). 8.5 Development of the Appendicular Skeleton LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Describe the growth and development of the embryonic limb buds • Discuss the appearance of primary and secondary ossification centers Embryologically, the appendicular skeleton arises from mesenchyme, a type of embryonic tissue that can differentiate into many types of tissues, including bone or muscle tissue. Mesenchyme gives rise to the bones of the upper and lower limbs, as well as to the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Development of the limbs begins near the end of the fourth embryonic week, with the upper limbs appearing first. Thereafter, the development of the upper and lower limbs follows similar patterns, with the lower limbs lagging behind the upper limbs by a few days. Limb Growth Each upper and lower limb initially develops as a small bulge called alimb bud, which appears on the lateral side of the early embryo. The upper limb bud appears near the end of the fourth week of development, with the lower
