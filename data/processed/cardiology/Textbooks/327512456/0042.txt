or treatment on their health. In contrast, PREMs measure quality of care in relation to the patient’s experience while they were receiving care. This is often considered a quality indicator rather than a direct quality measure.49 However, a consistent positive association between patient experience, safety, and clinical effectiveness has been found across a range of clinical specialities,50 demonstrating patients are able to distinguish between safety, clinical effectiveness, and experience.51 Thus, patient experience should be considered a core measurement in assessing healthcare outcomes in the delivery of high-quality care.52 Use of PROMs and PREMs in advancing high-quality care PROs are predominately measured using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), usually in the form of a standardized questionnaire. PROMs can be used ‘actively’ at the patient level for shared decision-making or ‘passively’ at the aggregated level to inform clinical guidelines and commissioning, for performance assessment and benchmarking, and for research and QI. While many clinical guidelines, including those from the ESC, do now refer to the need for PROM assessment, there is little evidence of extensive use at the individual patient level, despite its value in shared decision- making, personalized care, and values-based care. However, greater PRO use occurs at the aggregate level. For
