It is IHI’s belief that QIs must be developed to simultaneously pursue the three dimensions of the IHI Triple Aim34: ● Improving the patient experience of care. ● Improving the health of populations. ● Reducing the per capita cost of healthcare. Quality management—the Juran Trilogy (1986) The Juran Trilogy, also known as the Quality Trilogy (➤ Fig. 2.3),35 was developed by Dr Joseph Juran in 1986 as an approach to manage quality. It has become the basis for most quality management best practices worldwide and consists of three quality-related functions: planning, control, and improvement. Together these functions p. 38 provide an active interrelated approach for high-performance management and improved patient outcomes. Fig. 2.3 The Quality Trilogy.
