over time. This can be done using run charts and control (Shewhart) charts. A run chart is the simplest of charts and consists of a single line plotting data over time with a central median line (➤ Fig. 2.5). Fig. 2.5 Example of a run chart. Run charts provide a valuable tool at the beginning of a project, as they can reveal important information about a process before enough data have been collected to create a control chart. Run charts can be used for: ● Displaying data to monitor performance of one or more process/es. ● Determining if a change has resulted in improvement. ● Demonstrating whether the improved performance has been sustained.41 Control charts also plot a single line of data over time with a central median line but include upper and lower control limits. These limits are calculated based on the data being plotted and can demonstrate if the system is stable (within the control limits) or unstable (outside the control limits) (➤ Fig. 2.6). Fig. 2.6 Example of a control chart. Control charts are used to monitor the redesigned process to ensure it sustains the improved performance (with new upper and lower control limits), reduced variation, and
