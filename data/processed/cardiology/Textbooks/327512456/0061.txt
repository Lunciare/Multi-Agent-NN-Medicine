common disease of the heart), is a major cause of disability in developed countries, and also a primary contributor to the development of heart failure, which in turn is the principal cause of hospitalizations in older adults. A patient- and family-centred care approach is increasingly being recognized as an important component of the treatment and management of cardiovascular diseases. Recent developments have heightened the need for further implementation of patient- and family-centred care interventions in cardiovascular nursing and medicine, particularly during the initial periods following an acute cardiac event (e.g. acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmias). A systematic review found that the highest effectiveness of patient- and family-centred care interventions was reached when delivered to acute patients, for example, those being affected by myocardial infarction. However, there is substantial evidence of positive effects also when patient- and family-centred care is implemented for chronic patients with exacerbations. With regard to this, the experience of Ekman and colleagues (2012) is noteworthy.70 They implemented a randomized controlled trial by recruiting patients with chronic heart failure hospitalized for worsening of symptoms. The study intervention was based on three patient- and family-centred care goals (initiating, working, and safeguarding the partnership) and provided evidence
