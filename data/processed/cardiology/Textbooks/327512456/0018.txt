important to understand if the research design was appropriate to the research question, if the data were collected appropriately, and if there are any potential issues of bias. Quantitative data should be robust, reproducible, and generalizable. Qualitative data should be trustworthy and authentic. Nurses need to understand that not all research is of the same calibre. To address this, the ESC uses classes of recommendations and levels of evidence to identify the strength of the evidence (➤ Fig. 2.2). Fig. 2.2 Definitions of the ESC levels of evidence and classes of recommendation. Care must be timely Access to care at the right time is critical to ensure that cardiovascular conditions are well managed. In the acute setting, access to primary percutaneous intervention, or where that is not available, thrombolysis, can reduce the likelihood of myocardial damage, and therefore of subsequent heart failure or death (see Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 for tools to deliver timely care in emergency situations). Timely care is also important in p. 35 ensuring patients have access to medications. Heart failure nurses play a critical role in identifying early signs of worsening heart failure, and this has been demonstrated to prevent hospitalizations and death. Delays in
