Organizational Performance (2nd edition). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers; 2009 with permission from John Wiley and Sons. The Model for Improvement is an approach to continuous improvement where changes are tested in small rapid cycles that involve Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) cycles. The PDSA cycle creates the structure for testing and implementing the change. Testing the change under a variety of conditions can demonstrate that the improvement can be sustained in the future. Implementation of the change should be managed as a series of PDSA cycles as these small-scale tests of change are central to iterative improvement.39 PDSA cycles form the foundation for implementation of a successful intervention and increase the chances of long-term success. The scale and spread approach in QI is where smaller incremental steps within services can grow and lead to larger, sustainable organizational change.40 Data over time—run charts and control (Shewhart) charts QI requires change to occur; however, not all changes result in improvement. One of the fundamental tools of QI is to understand the variation in the process over time. This can be done using run charts and control (Shewhart) charts. A run chart is the simplest of charts and consists of a single line plotting data over
