DIAGNOSTICS

remains a helpful tool for evaluating risk, it is no longer used as a target for intervention with lipid-lowering medication. LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is also very strongly correlated with risk of cardiovascular disease: as LDL concentrations increase, so does the risk for cardiovascular events.113,124,126 Importantly, use of statin medication in patients with elevated LDL concentrations reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and death.113,126 Both the US and European guidelines for lipid management use LDL as the primary biomarker for determining CVD risk and the need for intervention with medication therapy.113,126 Of all the lipid markers, LDL is the most established for identifying risk and guiding medication interventions to lower risk of CVD and death. HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN High-density lipoprotein (HDL), sometimes referred to as “good cholesterol,” is inversely associated with CVD; so, unlike other forms of lipid biomarkers, as HDL increases, the risk of CVD declines.124,127 The concentrations of HDL are reported in most lipid panels and provide clinicians with additional insight about CVD risk. However, unlike LDL, drug therapies to raise HDL do not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials, and it is unlikely that low HDL itself is a cause of CVD.128-29
