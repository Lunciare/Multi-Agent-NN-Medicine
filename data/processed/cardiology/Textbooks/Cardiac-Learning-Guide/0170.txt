In statistics, a number that specifies how much members of a group differ from the group average. Stasis: A slow down or complete stoppage of a normal flow. STEMI (pronounced: stem–eee): A type of myocardial infarction characterized by ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram test. ST2: An emerging circulating biomarker used in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. Stent: Mesh wire tube placed inside a blood vessel to prop it open. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging: An imaging test that evaluates how well blood flows into the cardiac tissue. Stethoscope: A medical instrument most often used to externally evaluate the heart and lungs; one end of the device fits into the clinician’s ears and the other, round end is placed against the chest wall. Stroke: A potentially life-threatening event where adequate blood supply to a portion of the brain is cutoff, resulting in permanent damage. There are two primary mechanisms for this: 1) ischemic, which is usually caused by a blood clot and 2) hemorrhagic, which is caused by a blood vessel in the brain bursting. Superimposed: Occurring in addition to or on top of something else. Systole: The phase of the cardiac pumping cycle that involves contraction of the heart muscle, pushing
