Lee CW, Kim Y-H, et al. “Catastrophic Catecholamine-Induced Cardiomyopathy Mimicking Acute Myocardial Infarction, Rescued by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in Pheochromocytoma.” Journal of Korean Medical Science. 2008;23(2):350-354. No MI Identified In many cases, patients presenting with symptoms of ACS are not experiencing an MI. Patients who have negative biomarkers after repeat measurement are usually referred for additional testing based on their risk factors for ACS. Patients at high risk for coronary artery disease may still undergo an angiography procedure, but many patients, especially individuals with low or moderate risk for coronary artery disease, are referred for other types of tests. Treadmill ECG, stress myocardial perfusion imaging, coronary CT angiography, and other diagnostic tests are useful, non-invasive tools for identifying undiagnosed coronary artery disease in these patients.7 If a patient is determined to have coronary artery disease, they are at an increased risk for having an MI. In this situation, doctors will work with the patient to lower the risk of a future MI with medication and lifestyle changes.7 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 21 SECTION 2: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.
