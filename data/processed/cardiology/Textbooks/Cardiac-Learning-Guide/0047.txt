chronic heart failure, and significant trauma to the heart.7 Likewise, a myriad of non-cardiac problems, such as renal dysfunction, sepsis, burns, respiratory failure, and drug toxicity, can also cause elevations in troponin. Indeed, because troponin is partially removed by the kidney, individuals with end-stage renal disease may have chronic elevations of troponin.7,24 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 25 Table 3-1. Reasons for Troponin Elevations Not Related to Myocardial Infarction15,17,23 CARDIAC NON-CARDIAC Hypertensive emergency Critical illness Arrhythmias Sepsis Heart failure Pulmonary embolism or hypertension Myocarditis Kidney dysfunction Cardiomyopathy Serious neurological events (e .g ., stroke) Aortic dissection Thyroid disease Structural heart disease (e .g ., valve disease) Drug toxicity (e .g ., chemotherapy, cocaine) Physical trauma to the heart Extreme endurance exercise Heart surgery/procedure (e .g ., PCI*) Rhabdomyolysis *PCI – percutaneous coronary intervention Because troponin elevation can have other, non-cardiac causes, it is essential that clinicians employ good clinical judgment during the risk stratification process for ACS. This process begins by taking a history from the patient and assessing symptoms, followed by a physical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and then biomarker measurement. Only when all of these features are considered together can an accurate diagnosis be made. The ACC/AHA guidelines for NSTEMI
