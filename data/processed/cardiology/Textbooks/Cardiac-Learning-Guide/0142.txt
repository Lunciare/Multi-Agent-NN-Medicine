DIAGNOSTICS

BiomarCARE study, investigators examined data from multiple trials that included more than 74,000 European participants who were free from cardiovascular disease.137 Researchers determined that hsTnI measurements provide better prognostic data for predicting CVD and CVD-related death when used in conjunction with the SCORE risk assessment tool than the SCORE tool alone.137 In another study of over 9,000 individuals without cardiovascular disease, hsTnI performed better than hsCRP at predicting cardiovascular risk over more than 13 years of follow-up.149 Furthermore, when hsTnI was added to established cardiovascular disease risk prediction models, it led to significantly greater net reclassification improvement than adding hsCRP to the models.149 An important difference in normal troponin concentrations between men and women has also been identified with the advent of high-sensitivity assays. The HUNT study found not only do women in a normal population have a lower hsTnI concentration than men, but hsTnI concentrations were stronger predictors of death due to cardiovascular disease in women than in men.138 Another group of researchers used data from a long-term population study, the Dallas Heart Study, to evaluate sex-specific differences in an array of biomarkers, including hsTn.139 Similar to findings in the HUNT study, women were found to have lower concentrations
