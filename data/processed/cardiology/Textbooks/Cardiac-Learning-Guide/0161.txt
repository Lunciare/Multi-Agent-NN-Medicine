DIAGNOSTICS

Heparin: A medication that interferes with the clotting cascade used to thin the blood; it is used in many clinical scenarios, including myocardial infarction. HFmrEF (Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction): A newer heart failure classification used to describe patients with heart failure symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40- 49 percent. HFpEF (Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction): A heart failure classification used to describe patients with heart failure symptoms and an ejection fraction in the normal range, usually over 45 percent. HFrEF (Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction): A heart failure classification used to describe patients with heart failure symptoms and a reduced ejection fraction, usually under 45 percent. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 68 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP): A circulating biomarker for inflammation in the body; in cardiology practice, it can be used as a screening tool for identifying patients at risk for cardiac disease when other tools are not adequate. Homocysteine: An amino acid synthesized by the body; elevated concentrations are associated with inflammation and an increased risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke in a generally healthy population, but its usefulness as a screening tool is uncertain. Hormone: A “messenger” substance produced by the body
