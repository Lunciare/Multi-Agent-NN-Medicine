DIAGNOSTICS

x-ray device to evaluate the flow of blood through the coronary arteries.12 As the dye flows through, it will opacify the coronary arteries and display their branches like the branches of a tree (Figure 2-5). During this procedure, narrowings that indicate a blockage or lesion may be seen. If a blockage is identified, sometimes it can be opened using a balloon and stent (similar to the treatment of a STEMI), and sometimes extensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is identified that cannot be treated with PCI and stenting. Severe, extensive atherosclerosis may be treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which is sometimes referred to as open-heart bypass surgery. Occasionally, there is no atherosclerosis, and the MI was caused by something else (as sometimes occurs with type 2 MI). If this is the case, it is important to identify and treat the underlying cause of the MI to prevent further myocardial ischemia. Figure 2-5.
