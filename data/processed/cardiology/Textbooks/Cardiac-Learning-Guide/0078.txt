pericarditis, drug toxicities (e.g., certain types of chemotherapy, other cancer treatments, and alcohol), endocrine disorders like thyroid disease, collagen vascular diseases like scleroderma, and arrhythmias with persistently elevated heart rates.50,52 In the absence of coronary artery disease, it is believed that most cases of HFrEF have a genetic predisposition with a superimposed insult such as longstanding hypertension, excessive alcohol intake, or viral syndrome.61 CONSEQUENCES OF HEART FAILURE As discussed in Section 1, maintaining strong pumping ability is essential for the heart to function appropriately. When the heart doesn’t pump effectively as a result of heart failure, a cascade of negative effects occurs throughout the body. Organs and tissues may not receive adequate oxygen to function appropriately, especially if any additional strain (like exercise or illness) is placed on the cardiac system.62 The kidneys, in particular, are remarkably sensitive to the changes in cardiac performance and, as a result, many patients with heart failure have coexisting kidney disease.62 As a result of the continued neurohormonal activation in heart failure, the heart itself undergoes more changes. The structure of the ventricle undergoes further modification, causing it to be even less effective at pumping blood.62 This process is often termed remodeling, and it
