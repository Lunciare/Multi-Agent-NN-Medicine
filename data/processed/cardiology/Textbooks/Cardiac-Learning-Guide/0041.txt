levels of oxygen (low oxygen saturations) measured on pulse oximetry d. A and B are both correct e. B and C are both correct f. All of the above are correct 4. The preferred cardiac biomarker for diagnosing MI is _____________________________________________ . LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 22 SECTION 3 THE ROLE OF CARDIAC BIOMARKERS IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS) LEARNING OBJECTIVES When you complete this section, you will be able to: 1. Describe the role of troponin in ACS 2. Discuss differences between high-sensitivity and conventional troponin assays 3. Understand important considerations for implementing high-sensitivity troponin assays within an institution 4. Recognize other cardiac biomarkers with potential roles in ACS LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 23 As explained in Section 2, cardiac biomarkers, specifically cardiac troponin, are essential for the identification of myocardial necrosis and infarction. However, advances in the measurements of cardiac troponins are changing how acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients are evaluated and risk-stratified. And new biomarkers are also emerging that, in the future, may have potential roles in diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of patients with ACS. TROPONIN Troponin is an abundant protein contained in the cardiac myocytes. It works inside the cell as part of the contractile mechanism to facilitate
