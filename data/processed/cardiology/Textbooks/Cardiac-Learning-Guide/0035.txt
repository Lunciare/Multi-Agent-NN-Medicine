guide the next steps in treatment. 1 ECG Changes After an initial ECG that is normal or non-diagnostic, current guidelines recommend that the ECG should be repeated several times during the first hour after presentation (usually at 15 or 30 minute intervals), especially if the patient’s symptoms return.7 This will allow physicians to evaluate for any new ECG changes that could indicate ischemia. Additionally, the ECG can be checked any time there is a change in patient status. It is common for patients with chest pain to have multiple ECGs over the course of evaluation in the emergency department or hospitalization. 2 Cardiac Biomarkers It can be several hours after an ischemic event occurs before the cardiac troponin is detected in the blood using traditional assays; therefore, conventional cardiac troponins are measured several times in the first hours after symptom onset and presentation to the hospital.7 The American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend measuring conventional cardiac troponin at the time of initial presentation and then repeating this measurement three to six hours after the symptoms began.7 If high-sensitivity troponin is available, it is recommended that this test be repeated three hours after arrival in the emergency department
