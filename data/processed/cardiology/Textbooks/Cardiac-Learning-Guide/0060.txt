DIAGNOSTICS

a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm for managing ACS patients will be important to promote appropriate use of the new test.23 In addition, laboratory personnel will need to assess the quality control measures required for the new assay and will also need to work with other key stakeholders to decide on thresholds for the new assay, especially given that age and gender may influence normal values.28,38 Practical considerations in the collection and processing of specimens need to be considered as well; hemolysis in the blood sample and the extent of centrifugation can both render the hsTn assays less accurate.38 Similarly, practitioners should be reminded of other potential non-cardiac causes of troponin elevations, such as the increase in troponin T in patients with skeletal muscle disease or damage.20,21 In the 2015 NSTEMI guidelines, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends the use of hsTnT or hsTnI over conventional troponin assays.23 In addition, ESC makes the general recommendation to measure hsTn at presentation and then repeat it 3 hours later as part of a rule-out algorithm.23 The European guidelines also emphasize that hsTn is a quantitative measure, so the higher the number, the greater the likelihood of myocardial necrosis.23 For
