future risk of coronary disease, regardless of a change in cholesterol concentrations.135 It was noted that treatment with the statin appeared to lower hsTn concentrations at the one-year measurement, which also correlated with a lower risk of coronary disease events.135 Another trial, JUPITER, which examined the effectiveness of rosuvastatin (another statin medication) for preventing CVD events in individuals without cardiovascular disease, also evaluated hsTnI as a biomarker in over 12,000 participants.136 In this trial, participants with the highest hsTnI concentrations also had the highest risk of a cardiovascular event or death from any cause.136 Treatment with rosuvastatin lowered the risk of CVD events in individuals with and without elevated hsTnI concentrations.136 Both of these trials highlight that the information provided by hsTnI can be used to help improve patient outcomes; not only is hsTnI useful in identifying patients who are at risk, but these patients will also benefit from intervention (treatment with a statin). The use of hsTn in conjunction with traditional scoring tools has also been examined. In the BiomarCARE study, investigators examined data from multiple trials that included more than 74,000 European participants who were free from cardiovascular disease.137 Researchers determined that hsTnI measurements provide better prognostic data
