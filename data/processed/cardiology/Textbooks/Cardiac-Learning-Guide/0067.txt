the consequences of heart failure 4. Explain tests that can be used to assess patients with heart failure LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 33 Heart failure, in the simplest of terms, indicates that a problem with the ventricles is preventing the heart from filling and/or pumping correctly. It is the result of a complex mechanical and neurohumoral syndrome resulting in stasis (or slow movement) of blood in the lungs and peripheral tissues. It is estimated that over 26 million people worldwide are living with heart failure, and it is the number one cause of hospitalization in the United States (US) and Europe.47 In the US, it is estimated that over 6.5 million adults are living with heart failure and that figure is predicted to grow to over eight million by 2030.48 Registries of heart failure patients in the US and Europe report mortality to be anywhere from 23 to 36 percent during the first year after a heart failure hospitalization.49 DEFINING HEART FAILURE Heart failure initiates structural, functional, and neurohumoral abnormalities that prevent the ventricles from either properly filling with blood or properly ejecting blood. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, this results in poor cardiac performance. Section 1 of this guide described
