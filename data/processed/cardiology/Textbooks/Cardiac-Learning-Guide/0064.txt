ischemic event.42 The natriuretic peptides can provide information about the size of the infarct area in the heart and also the function of the left ventricle before and during the ischemic event.42 Perhaps more importantly, natriuretic peptides provide additional prognostic information for patients experiencing STEMI and NSTEMI and can predict mortality and heart failure after an ACS event.42 BNP has been approved by the FDA as a prognostic aid in acute coronary syndromes.43 There are many other biomarkers currently being investigated for both diagnostic and prognostic use in ACS, and their exact role in the management of patients has not yet been defined. Ischemia-modified albumin has been cleared by the FDA as a diagnostic test for ischemia in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes.44 Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (or cMyC) recently demonstrated usefulness in early identification of acute MI, but researchers are still unsure if it offers any advantage over hsTn.45 Similarly, two other emerging biomarkers have shown some promise for improving prognostic information in patients with ACS: GDF15 and ST2. The GDF15 protein is one of the transforming growth factor-ß cytokines. In studies, it has shown some usefulness in predicting future cardiovascular disease events and mortality.42,46 Likewise, ST2, an
