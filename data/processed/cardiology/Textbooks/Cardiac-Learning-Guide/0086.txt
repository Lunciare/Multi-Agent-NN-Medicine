DIAGNOSTICS

the only imaging tool that can truly characterize the actual cardiac tissue, it is not suitable for everyone, such as patients with certain metal implants; it is also not available at all centers and may be more expensive than other imaging techniques. Laboratory Testing During an initial diagnostic workup for heart failure, a considerable amount of laboratory testing is performed. Renal and liver panels, lipid measurements, thyroid function tests, complete blood counts, and iron studies may be ordered to evaluate for underlying causes and comorbidities and also to assess the appropriateness of heart failure therapies.52 In addition, several circulating biomarkers are useful in the diagnosis and management of heart failure. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 39 Natriuretic Peptides The natriuretic peptides (NPs), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), play a central role in heart failure. Although BNP was initially called brain natriuretic peptide because it was first identified in the brains of pigs, this was a misnomer as it is very specific to the heart.65 BNP is a hormone released by the cardiac myocytes when they are under strain, and NT-proBNP is an inactive fragment cleaved from the BNP molecule.66 These NPs are released when the ventricles, particularly
