needs more oxygen because it is beating more rapidly than normal, as often occurs in a severe infection, and more oxygen is unable to flow to the tissue because of the plaque accumulation, then a type 2 MI occurs. Moreover, in some cases, the coronary arteries may be completely normal and healthy, but something else has led to an imbalance in the supply and demand resulting in an MI. Examples of this would include very high myocyte oxygen demand from an ongoing high heart rate or severe anemia where there are too few red blood cells circulating to bring the myocytes adequate oxygen. Type 3: Cardiac Death MI Patients who suffer cardiac death, with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia accompanied by presumed new ischaemic ECG changes or ventricular fibrillation, but die before blood samples for biomarkers can be obtained, or before increases in cardiac biomarkers can be identified, or MI is detected by autopsy examination. Other Types of MI There are two other types of MI that should be mentioned for completeness. A type 4 MI is related to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure or a problem with a stent (a thin, mesh wire tube that props open a
