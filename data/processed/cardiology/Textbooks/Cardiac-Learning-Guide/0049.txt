conventional troponin several times over a three- to six-hour period (or even longer period for higher risk patients) should yield a positive result if a patient is experiencing an NSTEMI. This process can result in prolonged ED admission times for patients who are ultimately “ruled out” (not experiencing an MI) and delays in initiation of treatments for patients who are eventually determined to be experiencing an NSTEMI. Another limitation of conventional troponin assays is that they may lack enough sensitivity to detect small elevations in troponin that can occur in a less extensive MI or in those with lower circulating levels of troponin, such as women or patients presenting early after the onset of symptoms.26,27 This scenario could cause an NSTEMI patient to be erroneously sent home, where they may go on to suffer cardiac complications or, in the worst case, may die. The potential to miss the diagnosis of MI completely (incorrect “rule-out”) and the extended time required to identify MI (delayed “rule-in”) are the primary limitations of conventional troponin tests in clinical practice. The need to overcome these limitations led to the development of more sensitive and precise troponin assays. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 26 HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN ASSAYS Due
