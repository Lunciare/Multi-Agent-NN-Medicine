eliminated primarily by the kidneys and BNP is eliminated through multiple pathways, NT-proBNP is more susceptible to elevations in patients with kidney disease than BNP.66 In severe kidney disease, BNP is also affected, but NT-proBNP continues to be more severely altered.66 Likewise, several studies have also documented that NT-proBNP is increased in patients with atrial fibrillation; because this is a common comorbidity in patients with heart failure, clinicians must consider this when evaluating NT-proBNP measurements.83,84 Increasing age and female sex both appear to increase the NP measurements regardless of underlying cardiac function, whereas obesity may decrease measured NP concentrations.85 Lastly, a newer class of drug for heart failure, the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), may influence BNP concentrations because BNP is one of multiple peptides that can be cleaved by neprilysin. However, there is evidence that human BNP may be less sensitive to neprilysin degradation while retaining affinity for it. At the high concentrations of BNP (>916 pg/mL) that are frequently seen in HF patients, neprilysin activity may actually be inhibited or impaired.86,87 This would limit the efficacy of drugs designed to inhibit the enzyme such as ARNI. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine if there are clinically significant
