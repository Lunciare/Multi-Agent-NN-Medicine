a lower concentration of oxygen and carries a large amount of carbon dioxide produced by body tissues. From the vena cava, the oxygen-poor blood flows into the right atrium, then through a valve called the tricuspid valve, and into the right ventricle. From there, the blood is pumped out through the pulmonary valve, into the pulmonary artery, and to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood moves into capillaries, which are tiny, thin-walled blood vessels that allow for the exchange of gases (like oxygen and carbon dioxide). The carbon dioxide in the oxygen-poor blood is exchanged for new oxygen from the air through the thin capillary walls. After this exchange, the blood contains high levels of oxygen and can be described as oxygen-rich. The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. From the pulmonary veins, the oxygen-rich blood enters the left atrium. The blood continues from the left atrium, passes through the mitral valve, and empties into the left ventricle. The left ventricle, which is the largest and strongest of the four chambers of the heart, pumps the oxygen-rich blood through the aortic valve and out into a very large vessel called the aorta. From the
