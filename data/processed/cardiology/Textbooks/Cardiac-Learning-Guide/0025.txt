DIAGNOSTICS

thought . cTnI and cTnT are the preferred biomarkers for the evaluation of myocardial injury, and high-sensitivity (hs)-cTn assays are recommended for routine clinical use . Other biomarkers, e .g ., creatine kinase MB isoform (CKMB), are less sensitive and less specific . Myocardial injury is defined as being present when blood levels of cTn are increased above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) . The injury my be acute, as evidenced by a newly detected dynamic rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values above the 99th percentile URL, or chronic, in the setting of persistently elevated cTn levels . Criteria for prior or silent/unrecognized myocardial infarction Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior or silent/unrecognized MI: • Abnormal Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non-ischaemic causes • Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium in a pattern consistent with ischaemic aetiology • Patho-anatomical findings of a prior MI From: Thygesen K, Alpert JS, Jaffe AS, Simoons ML, Chaitman BR, White HD, the Joint ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction .
