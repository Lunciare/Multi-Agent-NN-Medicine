body. Anticoagulant: Medications that decrease the blood’s ability to clot (thin the blood) by interfering with the body’s normal clotting cascade. Antiplatelet: Medications that decrease the blood’s ability to clot (thin the blood) by interfering with the normal activity of platelets. Angiography: A procedure done to examine the blood flow in the coronary arteries; it involves inserting a catheter into a large artery (in the groin or wrist) and threading it up to the heart. In the heart, a dye is released that will flow into the coronary arteries, and an x-ray device is used to evaluate the flow of blood through the coronary arteries. Angiotensin receptor blocking agents (ARB): A class of medication used in patients with heart failure and high blood pressure; in heart failure, it can block some of the maladaptive neurohormonal activity. Angiotensin II receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI): A new class of medication for heart failure that blocks the maladaptive neurohormonal response. Aorta: The largest artery in the body; it receives blood pumped out of the left ventricle. Artery: Blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the organs and tissues. ASCVD scoring tool: A scoring tool used to assess risk for future atherosclerotic cardiovascular
