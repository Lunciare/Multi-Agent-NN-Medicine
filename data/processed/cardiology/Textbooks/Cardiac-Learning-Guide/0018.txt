of the heart’s electrical activity from each of these 12 areas of the body because they each reflect a unique view of the heart. On the ECG report, each lead produces a tracing, and the tracings are labeled I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. An ECG is useful for diagnosing a range of cardiac problems, including arrhythmias. In ACS, paramedics, nurses, and physicians use the ECG to differentiate a STEMI from other causes of ACS symptoms. An ECG can even identify which coronary artery is likely obstructed by looking at which leads have ST elevation (Figure 2-1).

The name ST-elevation MI is describing the changes that happen during a STEMI on an ECG: the ST segment in the ECG tracing is more elevated than normal. This test is useful for distinguishing a STEMI from other types of MI.
