begin refilling with more blood in preparation for the next contraction. At this time, systole of the ventricles occurs, and the walls of both ventricles contract to push blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery (the right ventricle pumps to the pulmonary artery, and the left ventricle pumps to the aorta). After systole is complete, the ventricles return to diastole and begin refilling with blood again. Both systole and diastole are energy-dependent phases of the cardiac cycle, meaning the cardiac cells require energy to perform these functions. Dysfunction of either one or both of these phases can lead to heart failure. In a healthy heart, the muscle tissue has an elastic quality, meaning it stretches easily but can quickly return to its original shape (similar to a rubber band). This quality is sometimes referred to as elasticity. During diastole, the muscle actively stretches as the heart fills with blood, and during systole, it springs back and contracts to smaller ventricular chamber sizes to pump the blood out. Systole of the ventricles is significantly more powerful than systole of the atria because the ventricles are thicker and force the blood to travel much further. The left ventricle, the largest and thickest
