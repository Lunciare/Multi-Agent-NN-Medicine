of galectin-3 are associated with a variety of diseases, including heart failure, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.89 In heart failure, galectin-3 is secreted by macrophages in the myocardium after a cardiac injury.90 It serves as a mediator for the development of fibrosis and also appears to contribute to inflammation in the cardiac tissue.90 Galectin-3 can be categorized as a biomarker for cardiac remodeling because concentrations increase when the cardiac tissue experiences inflammation and progressing fibrosis. In clinical studies of patients with heart failure, galectin-3 is more useful for long-term prognosis than initial diagnosis. When galectin-3 is measured over time, an increase of 15 percent or more has been correlated with an increased risk of mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure.91 Galectin-3 has also shown added benefit when used in conjunction with NP measurements in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath. In this scenario, galectin-3 can provide long-term prognostic information about mortality, especially in individuals with low concentrations of NP on presentation.92 Galectin-3 is also a useful marker to measure at discharge after a heart failure hospitalization, as it provides prognostic data on the likelihood of readmission within 60 days.70 Importantly, galectin-3 has also
