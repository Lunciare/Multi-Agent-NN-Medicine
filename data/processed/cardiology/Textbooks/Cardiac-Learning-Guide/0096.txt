pathophysiology of heart failure. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 43 Differences in Natriuretic Peptide Assay Types Although most studies indicate that BNP and NT-proBNP assays have similar sensitivity and specificity, clinicians should be aware of several differences.66 For example, NT-proBNP has a longer half-life than BNP, although this does not appear to have significant clinical implications.66 In addition, because the normal value ranges differ between the two types of assays, NT-proBNP concentrations measure higher and have more variability than BNP concentrations. It is essential that clinicians be aware of which assay is being used in the facility and be familiar with normal ranges of both tests (Figure 5-1).66 Notably, BNP and NT-proBNP values are not interchangeable: there is no recognized “conversion factor” that works to convert a BNP result into an NT-proBNP result. Finally, all commercially available BNP assays standardize to an upper limit of normal of 100 pg/ml.66 However, there is no universal cutpoint for normal for NT-proBNP. Most laboratories give a spectrum of upper limit values based on age categories ranging from 125 pg/mL to 2000 pg/mL, depending on the study population and assay used.66 BNP Clinical Gray Zone* Elevated NORMAL 100 pg/mL 500 pg/mL 1000 pg/mL 1500 pg/mL NT-proBNP
