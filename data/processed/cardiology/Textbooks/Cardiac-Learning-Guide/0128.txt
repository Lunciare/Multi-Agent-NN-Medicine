tool, the Framingham risk assessment, which calculated risk for coronary heart disease. The Framingham General CVD tool broadened this focus to predict CVD risk, which included cerebrovascular events (such as stroke and transient ischemic attack), peripheral arterial disease, and heart failure in addition to coronary heart disease events.115 It was developed using information from a US cohort, but it has been validated as a useful tool in other nations throughout the world.116 The tool incorporates age, gender, smoking, blood pressure, diabetes diagnosis, and either cholesterol or body mass index to assess a 10-year risk for a CVD event.115 An online risk calculator is available at The Framingham General CVD tool can assess risk in a broader age range, 30 to 74 years, and it also incorporates obesity as a risk factor if the body mass index version is used.115 Limitations of the Framingham CVD risk tool include that it is based on information from a comparatively small cohort of participants in the US and there are other major CVD risks not incorporated into the score, such as lifestyle factors and family history of CVD (Table 6-1).117 Reynolds Risk Score The Reynolds risk score is another tool designed to predict the
