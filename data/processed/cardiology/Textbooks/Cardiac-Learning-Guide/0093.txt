and progression of heart failure. This section will build on the previous discussions of biomarkers used in heart failure and also introduce several emerging biomarkers for this disease process. AS A GROUP, THE CARDIAC BIOMARKERS USED IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE CAN GENERALLY BE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE AREAS • M arkers of myocardial stretch/pressure and neurohormonal activation: These include natriuretic peptides and several emerging biomarkers (MR-proADM, copeptin). Rising concentrations of these biomarkers reflect increasing neurohormonal activation that can result from heart failure. • M arkers of cardiac remodeling: These include galectin-3 and several emerging biomarkers (ST2, GDF15). When markers in this group rise, they can indicate myocyte changes are occurring that lead to fibrosis in heart failure. • M arkers of myocardial injury/ischemia: These include cardiac troponins. Ischemia and injury may occur in heart failure, and biomarkers that reflect this process have demonstrated prognostic capability in heart failure patients. As discussed in Sections 2 and 3, the primary application of these markers is in patients with Evaluating each of these aspects of heart failure provides essential information on the status and prognosis of an individual patient. However, the usefulness of various biomarkers differs according to the clinical scenario. MARKERS OF
