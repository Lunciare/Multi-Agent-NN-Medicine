a “closed circulatory system,” like a closed circuit; this means that blood can only go “back” when it cannot go “forward.” When the heart does not pump the blood forward effectively as a result of stiffness or pump failure, the blood begins to “back up” into the lungs. With blood moving more slowly through the pulmonary system, fluid leaks out into the lungs and begins to accumulate. When a patient with heart failure stands or sits upright, this fluid falls to the bottom of the lungs and may not interfere with breathing; however, when the patient lays down flat, the fluid pools throughout the lungs which may lead to difficulty breathing. Eventually, the increased pressure in the lungs may lead to congestion in the right ventricle. Because the right ventricle receives blood from the rest of the body, as the right ventricular performance is affected, a further “back up” of blood will occur into the peripheral tissues. This results in fluid accumulation in the peripheral tissues that manifests as swelling (or edema), first in the legs and feet (due to gravity), and then it may spread to the abdomen and even to organs such as the liver. This process whereby
