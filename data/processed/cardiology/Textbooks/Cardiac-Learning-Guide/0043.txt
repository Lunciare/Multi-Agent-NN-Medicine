troponin protein was initially identified in 1965, the first assay for measuring troponin I in the serum was not developed until 1987.16 An assay for troponin T followed in 1989.16 Through the 1990s and 2000s, improvements in the immunoassays significantly increased the precision and sensitivity of these tests. The conventional troponin assays in current use are one hundred to one thousand times more sensitive than the original assays developed in the 1980s.17 Assays for troponins T and I are both used today in the care of patients with suspected ACS, which may exhibit one or more of the following biological variations: 1. D iurnal variation: The amount of circulating troponin may vary throughout the day in individuals not experiencing myocardial infarction (MI).18 2. K idney disease and diseases of the skeletal muscle: Some assays measuring troponin in these settings exhibits less variation than other assays, and some troponins can be chronically elevated in patients with End Stage Renal Disease.19,20,21,25 3. S T-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): In this category of patients, the concentration of some subunits of troponin appear to follow a linear decline after the event, whereas some appear to decline and then peak again shortly after the MI.22 4.
