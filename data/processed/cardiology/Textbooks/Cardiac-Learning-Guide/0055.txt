DIAGNOSTICS

an MI with less troponin elevation completely.23 This can be a significant problem in women, and, predictably, the use of hsTn assays have demonstrated the ability to increase the diagnosis of MI in women.26 In identifying patients with MI earlier and more often, the hsTn assays also overcome two problems associated with the conventional assays. First, they reduce the delay to appropriate treatment for MI because it shortens the time for diagnosis in many situations. And second, it reduces the risk of missing an MI completely and the associated risk of cardiac complications and death (Figure 3-3). LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 28 HsTn Assays: Things to Consider It is essential to emphasize that the high-sensitivity assays for troponin trade specificity for increased sensitivity. There may be more troponin elevations detected with hsTn assays that are not related to ACS. But it remains important for clinicians to be mindful that other conditions such as heart failure, sepsis, and kidney failure that can cause elevation of the conventional troponin assays also, to a greater degree, cause elevations of hsTn sensitivity troponin elevations are not MI. Thus, each patient with an elevated value needs careful consideration for both the MI and non-MI determinants. As
