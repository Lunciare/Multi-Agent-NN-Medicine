therapy; however, this is controversial, and due to conflicting evidence without a proven benefit in heart failure patient outcomes, guidelines do not recommend monitoring NP levels to guide therapy.56,58,77 Identifying Patients at Risk for Heart Failure The natriuretic peptide assays BNP and NT-proBNP have established usefulness in stratifying patients who are at high risk for heart failure based on risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and vascular disease.56 Elevated NP concentrations have demonstrated utility in identifying patients in the general population who are at increased risk for developing heart failure, both in individuals who already have some high-risk characteristic and in individuals without high-risk characteristics (although NPs appear to be stronger predictors for individuals already at high risk).75,78,79 However, they appear to be a better tool for identifying patients at risk for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).80 Importantly, NP measurements have demonstrated relevance in identifying patients who benefit from medical intervention to prevent heart failure, ultimately resulting in improved patient outcomes. In a large-scale trial (STOP-HF), NP concentrations were used to screen and stratify individuals at risk for heart failure; participants with BNP concentrations over 50 pg/mL in the intervention group
