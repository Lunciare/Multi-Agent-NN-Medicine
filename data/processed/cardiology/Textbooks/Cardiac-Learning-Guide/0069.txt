activation occurs over a long period, as it does in heart failure, these compensations worsen the functional ability of the heart rather than improving it. 50,51 DEFINING HEART FAILURE BY PUMP FUNCTION: HFPEF AND HFREF To clarify the functional problem in heart failure, clinicians typically separate heart failure into two different categories: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (Figure 4-1). In HFpEF, the primary problem is the left ventricle not filling properly with blood.51 Conversely, in HFrEF, the primary problem is poor ejection of blood from the left ventricle.51 DIASTOLIC (HFpEF) SYSTOLIC (HFrEF) Stretched and thin Stiff and thick chambers chambers Heart can’t fill Heart can’t pump Figure 4-1. Structural changes to the ventricles of the heart in heart failure: in HFpEF (left) the ventricle walls stiffen and can’t fill appropriately and in HFrEF (right) the ventricle dilates and the walls are stretched thin, impairing the normal pumping activity LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 34 Heart Failure and a Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) In HFpEF, as the name implies, the ejection fraction of the left ventricle is normal (usually over 45 percent), so the heart is still pumping out the appropriate percentage of
