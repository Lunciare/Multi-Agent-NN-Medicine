Second, a biomarker must demonstrate through a statistical assessment that it is calibrated to what it measures, or that the biomarker’s prediction aligns with the observed results.123 And third, a biomarker must demonstrate that it improves a patient’s risk characterization over previous methods, a concept known as net reclassification improvement.123 CARDIOVASCULAR RISK BIOMARKERS Lipids Circulating lipids often referred to as cholesterol, are essential building blocks for plaque in atherosclerotic disease. As such, lipid measurements are useful as predictors of cardiovascular disease and were some of the earliest circulating biomarkers used for assessing cardiovascular risk. Moreover, when medications, specifically statins, are employed to normalize certain lipid biomarkers, the rate of cardiovascular events and death is significantly reduced. As such, lipids are a cornerstone of cardiovascular risk assessment and are included in many risk prediction scoring tools. TOTAL CHOLESTEROL Higher concentrations of total cholesterol have long been associated with an increased risk for CVD.124-25 Because of this correlation, total cholesterol concentrations are included in many CVD risk assessment tools. Although this measure remains a helpful tool for evaluating risk, it is no longer used as a target for intervention with lipid-lowering medication. LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is also very strongly correlated
