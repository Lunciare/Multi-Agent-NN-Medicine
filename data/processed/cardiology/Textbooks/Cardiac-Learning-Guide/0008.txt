than normal. In this situation, the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal glands release a hormone called norepinephrine. Norepinephrine changes how the heart responds to electrical stimulation resulting in an increased heart rate and contractility of the pumping chambers. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 8 THE PUMPING ACTION OF THE HEART: SYSTOLE AND DIASTOLE Another concept that is important to understand about the heart is systole and diastole. In simple terms, systole means contraction of the myocardium and diastole means relaxation of the myocardium. However, the atria and ventricles do not contract or relax at the same time. For a brief period, both atria and both ventricles are in diastole allowing blood from the vena cava or pulmonary veins to flow in passively. Once the SA node begins spreading its electrical impulse, the muscles of atria begin contracting to create atrial systole. During atrial systole, the walls of the left and right atrium contract to push blood into the ventricles (which are still in diastole). The atria quickly return to diastole and begin refilling with more blood in preparation for the next contraction. At this time, systole of the ventricles occurs, and the walls of both ventricles contract to push blood into
