DIAGNOSTICS

symptoms could be attributed to, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.51,52,54 Patients with HFrEF also respond more favorably to treatment with medications than those with HFpEF.51,52 Indeed multiple classes of medications, as well as implantable devices, reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in HFrEF. These include medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, certain beta-blocking agents, valsartan/sacubitril, ivabradine, the combination of long-acting nitrates and hydralazine, and digoxin, as well as devices such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization devices.52,56 What is a Normal Ejection Fraction? Heart failure is often defined in terms of the heart’s left ventricular ejection fraction (or EF), so what is a normal EF for the left ventricle? Although definitions vary, the normal range of EF (measured when a person is at rest) is generally described as approximately 50 to 70 percent. However, in 2015, the American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging released collaborative recommendations that offer a more precise definition. In this document, a normal left ventricular EF was defined as 52 to 72 percent for men and 54 to 74 percent for women.57 Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF) A new term,
