the pressure in the arteries during ventricular systole and at the end of ventricular diastole; it is important that blood pressure isn’t too high or too low d. T he right atrium and ventricle contract first, pushing blood to the lungs, and the left atrium and ventricle contract second, pushing blood to the rest of the body 3. _____________________________________________ arteries supply the myocardium with oxygen-rich blood. 4. S ystole means _____________________________________________________ and diastole means ________________________________________________________ . The ____________________________________________________ ventricle creates the strongest contraction because it must pump blood to the entire body. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 10 SECTION 2 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME LEARNING OBJECTIVES When you complete this section, you will be able to: 1. Describe the different types of acute coronary syndromes 2. Discuss the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia and infarction 3. Explain the process of diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome 4. Understand the role of cardiac biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 11 Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death worldwide, and they affect individuals from all backgrounds, incomes, and nations.2 Of the estimated 17 million deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease worldwide
