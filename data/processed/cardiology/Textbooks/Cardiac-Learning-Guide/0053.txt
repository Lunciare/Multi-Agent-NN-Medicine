Employing sex-specific thresholds also aided in identifying women at high risk for complications and death after MI.26 HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN ASSAYS IN PRACTICE: “RULE OUT” AND “RULE IN” The hsTn assays have several significant advantages over the conventional assays that can be categorized as improving either “rule-in” or “rule-out” of MI. Rule Out One of the primary advantages of hsTn assays is that they have higher negative predictive value for acute MI than conventional tests. Since they can reliably detect very low levels of troponin, physicians can rule out MI in patients with these very low levels with more confidence than ever before (very low levels were unreportable with conventional assays). When studied in the clinical setting, the hsTn assays have shown a great deal of promise. There is increasing evidence to indicate that when patients with suspected ACS are tested with a hsTn assay on arrival to the ED using a risk-stratification algorithm, a negative hsTn measurement has over 95 percent negative predictive value for ruling out an MI.14,31 At three hours after presentation, this number rises to over 99 percent, and accordingly, a repeat measurement of hsTn is recommended in all patients three to six hours after presentation.32 The
