assays allows for measurement of troponin in normal healthy individuals, whereas earlier generation assays were only sensitive enough to detect troponin elevation resulting from significant necrosis in MI, or occasionally, severe damage from other causes Adapted from: Garg P, Morris P, Fazlanie AL, et al. “Cardiac Biomarkers of Acute Coronary Syndrome: from History to High-sensitivity Cardiac Troponin.” Internal and Emergency Medicine. 2017;12(2):147-155. Used under CC BY modified from original. There have been varying proposals on how to define and differentiate high-sensitivity assays from conventional troponin assays. In 2012, a task force created by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) proposed that hsTn assays be defined using two parameters: • The total imprecision (coefficient of variation) at the 99th percentile value should be ≤10 percent28 • M easurable concentrations below the 99th percentile should be attainable with an assay at a concentration value above the assay’s limit of detection (LOD) for at least 50 percent (and ideally >95 percent) of healthy individuals28 – I n 2018, the IFCC/AACC Task Force expanded on this point by requiring both men and women individually attain measurable concentrations, with at least 50% measurable concentrations above the assay’s LoD148 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 27 Multiple high-sensitivity
