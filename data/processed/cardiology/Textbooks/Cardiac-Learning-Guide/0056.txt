DIAGNOSTICS

greater degree, cause elevations of hsTn sensitivity troponin elevations are not MI. Thus, each patient with an elevated value needs careful consideration for both the MI and non-MI determinants. As such, it is even more imperative that physicians employ good clinical judgment when evaluating patients with suspected ACS. All aspects of the patient’s presentation should be assessed to appropriately stratify a patient’s risk for ACS, including symptoms, medical history, physical exam information, ECG, and troponin concentrations. It is also important to remember that to meet the biomarker criteria for an MI; troponin concentrations must be rising or falling over time. Given the increased sensitivity of these new assays, there has been renewed debate about how this rise or fall should be defined, and at the time of this publication, there is no formal consensus. Notably, none of the prior definitions of MI utilized high-sensitivity troponin values, and the AHA/ACC guideline recommendations on the percentage change in troponin concentrations required for MI are for conventional assays.6, 7 However, researchers have been exploring how these new high-sensitivity assays may modify the definition of change in troponin concentrations. A study by Keller et al. examining the use of high- sensitivity troponin assays for
