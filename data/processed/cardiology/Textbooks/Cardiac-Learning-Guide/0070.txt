DIAGNOSTICS

In HFpEF, as the name implies, the ejection fraction of the left ventricle is normal (usually over 45 percent), so the heart is still pumping out the appropriate percentage of blood with each contraction.51 However, the problem in HFpEF is an impairment in the heart’s ability to relax during the process of filling with blood.51,52 The left ventricle cannot relax and fill with blood normally because its walls are abnormally stiff and thickened; the walls of the ventricle are also not working in a coordinated fashion with the blood vessels that receive the blood.51 This results in poor cardiac performance even though the ejection fraction is still within a normal range. Women, the obese, and elderly individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with HFpEF than men, individuals in a normal weight range, and younger people.51,53 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction can be more difficult to diagnose and manage than HFrEF, but almost half of the patients with heart failure in the US have HFpEF.51,52,54 Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, there are no proven treatments for HFpEF that reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) In HFrEF,
