or identify patients in need of early intervention to prevent heart failure.52,56 They also provide prognostic information for patients with chronic heart failure.67 This section will describe NPs in more detail and explain how they fit into the care of patients with heart failure. The NPs are hormones that influence fluid and sodium balance in the body.74 Although only the B-type (BNP and NT-proBNP) are measured routinely in clinical medicine, three types have been identified in total: • A trial NP released from the atria • B -type NP released from the ventricles • C -type NP, which is found in the kidneys, blood vessels, and central nervous system74 Of note, BNP was originally called brain natriuretic peptide because it was first identified in the brains of pigs, but it was later determined to be a misnomer because it is released by the ventricles of the heart.65 This guide will focus on the B-type NPs (BNP and NT-proBNP), subsequently referred to as NPs, because they are most specific to the pathophysiology of heart failure.
