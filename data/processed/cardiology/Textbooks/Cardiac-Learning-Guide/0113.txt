DIAGNOSTICS

vessels.108 Adrenomedullin and MR-proADM concentrations increase in heart failure.108 Several studies have demonstrated that concentrations of MR-proADM are predictors of mortality as well as heart failure hospitalizations independent of NP measurements.99 Although this biomarker appears promising, further study is needed to determine its place in heart failure management. Copeptin A second marker that primarily measures neurohormonal activation, copeptin, was discussed in Section 3 for ACS. It is a small part of a precursor for the arginine vasopressin hormone released from neurons that originate in the hypothalamus, and it serves as a surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin concentrations.109 This biomarker has demonstrated prognostic usefulness in patients with acute heart failure, and it may identify patients at high risk of several endpoints: mortality within 90 days of presentation, heart failure hospitalizations, and emergency department visits.109 Similar to other emerging biomarkers, research is still needed to determine if copeptin adds clinical value over biomarkers already in use. MR-proANP Another natriuretic peptide called mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) serves as a surrogate marker for atrial NP. It may be useful for diagnosing acute heart failure in patients presenting to the emergency departments with dyspnea.110 Moreover, in preliminary studies, it has shown some effectiveness in
