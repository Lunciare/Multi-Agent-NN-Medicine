DIAGNOSTICS

blood pumped out during systole is called the ejection fraction. The actual number or percentage of ejection fraction can change as a result of physical activity or other demands on the cardiac muscle. Measuring ejection fraction is one of the ways clinicians can assess the health of a heart. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 9 SECTION 1: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.
