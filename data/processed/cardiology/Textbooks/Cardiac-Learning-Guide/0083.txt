of low oxygen levels, such as blue skin. Fluid in the peripheral tissues can be seen and felt as swelling or edema (as described above). Evaluation of the jugular vein in the neck can show distension. Changes in how the heart sounds through a stethoscope and differences in where the heartbeat can be felt in the chest can also be signs of heart failure; the heart rate may increase to the point where it seems to “gallop” as it attempts to compensate for poor output.50,52 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 38 THE ROLE OF ECG AND IMAGING Electrocardiogram (ECG) Although the electrocardiogram or ECG (Figure 4-3) is essential in the assessment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) symptoms, it is a less specific tool in heart failure. Patients with heart failure can have mild or dramatic abnormalities on an ECG, but it can be a useful tool in several circumstances. First, an ECG can be helpful to rule out heart failure—very rarely would a patient with heart failure have a completely normal ECG.52 Second, it may identify the etiology of the patient’s heart failure, such as a previous MI.52 And third, it may detect a coexisting problem such as atrial fibrillation
