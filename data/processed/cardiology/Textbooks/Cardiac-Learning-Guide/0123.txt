DIAGNOSTICS

guidelines, the European guidelines suggest that other factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk for CVD, particularly for individuals at a moderate 10-year risk for events. These factors include socioeconomic status, obesity, family history of premature CVD, coronary calcium scoring, and ankle-brachial index measurements.114 Notably, the European guidelines do not recommend the use of biomarkers for risk stratification purposes.114 The European guidelines stress that the highest risk individuals benefit the most from preventative intervention, and they classify anyone with a risk of five percent or more as high risk and anyone over 10 percent as very high risk.114 Specific targets are recommended for individuals in these risk groups, including avoidance of tobacco, eating a healthy diet, performing adequate amounts of physical activity, and achieving a healthy body mass index.114 Blood pressure, glycemic, and cholesterol control should also be addressed and can be managed with or without medication.114 RISK STRATIFICATION TOOLS Risk stratification tools are essential in the assessment of the many factors that contribute to CVD risk. As noted above, accurate CVD risk stratification allows for early intervention to prevent adverse events in the case of moderate and high-risk patients, and it avoids unnecessary investigation and treatment in
