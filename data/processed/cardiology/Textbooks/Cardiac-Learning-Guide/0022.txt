DIAGNOSTICS

but troponins I and T are very specific to cardiac myocytes and are therefore clinically useful for measuring damage to the myocardium. When extended ischemia occurs, the cells die and begin to break apart releasing the troponin into the bloodstream.6 If high levels of troponin T or I are measured in the blood, in the correct clinical setting, it is confirmation that there is necrosis in the cardiac tissue (Table 2-1).6 To be diagnostic for MI, cardiac troponin must not only exceed the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit but also must be rising or falling in a characteristic pattern over time. Serial measurements of troponin can determine if concentrations are changing; when troponin concentrations remain constant over an extended duration, it suggests that an alternative diagnosis should be considered, such as renal failure, heart failure, or sepsis.9 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 14 Table 2-1. FOURTH UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF MI Criteria for ACUTE myocardial infarction (Types 1, 2 and 3 MI) The term acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the
