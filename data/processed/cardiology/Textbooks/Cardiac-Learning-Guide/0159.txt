Fibrosis: In the heart, scar formation in tissue in response to an injury. Framingham general CVD risk score: A scoring tool for predicting risk of a cardiovascular event in individuals without known cardiovascular disease. G Galectin-3: A protein that mediates inflammation and fibrosis throughout the body; as a circulating biomarker, it is useful for providing prognostic information in patients with heart failure. Growth-differentiation factor-15 (GDF15): A cytokine that is upregulated in the setting of inflammation; it may be useful as an emerging, circulating biomarker for cardiac remodeling and a prognostic indicator for individuals with heart failure. GRACE score: A scoring tool used to risk stratify a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome. H Half-life: In the body, the time it takes for the concentration of a substance to decrease by half (e.g., a half-life of 20 hours would mean it takes 20 hours
