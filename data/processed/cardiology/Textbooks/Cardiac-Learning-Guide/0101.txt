DIAGNOSTICS

In a large-scale trial (STOP-HF), NP concentrations were used to screen and stratify individuals at risk for heart failure; participants with BNP concentrations over 50 pg/mL in the intervention group were evaluated with echocardiography and received collaborative care interventions from primary care and cardiology specialists. Compared with participants in the control group (those who received usual care), participants in the screening and intervention group had lower rates of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure several years later.81 Section 6 will discuss biomarkers for screening of asymptomatic individuals in more detail. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 45 Natriuretic Peptides in HFpEF versus HFrEF Another important aspect of BNP and NT-proBNP measurements is that the type of heart failure influences the concentrations of NPs in the blood. As discussed in Section 4, HFpEF and HFrEF have different mechanisms in terms of how the cardiac dysfunction occurs. This difference also translates into disparities in NP release. In chronic HFpEF, NP elevations appear to be slightly more modest than what is measured in HFrEF.75 They can even decrease to almost normal concentrations if the patient is free of symptoms.75 Although NPs don’t appear to be as elevated in patients with HFpEF compared to patients with HFrEF,
