DIAGNOSTICS

normal left ventricular EF was defined as 52 to 72 percent for men and 54 to 74 percent for women.57 Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF) A new term, heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, or HFmrEF, was recently described by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). In the explanation for this new classification, the ESC defines HFmrEF with the same criteria used for HFpEF diagnosis but with an ejection fraction of 40-49 percent.52 Their purpose in defining HFmrEF as a separate entity from HFpEF or HFrEF is to promote more study of interventions and outcomes in this very specific population of individuals with heart failure.52 Because HFmrEF is a new term and is not included in other guidelines and literature, it will not be a focus of this guide. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 35 DEFINING HEART FAILURE WITH CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS: NYHA AND ACC/AHA Several different classification schemes exist to quantify the severity of heart failure in a patient. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system is based primarily on the effects the heart failure has on the patient’s ability to perform physical activity. The categories progress from an NYHA class I, indicating the patient has no symptoms with
