shortness of breath), exercise intolerance, weakness, fatigue, and swelling of the ankles and feet.51,52 Again, these symptoms correlate with fluid accumulation in the lungs and body as a result of the “back up” of blood in the heart. Heart failure most often limits a persons’ ability to perform strenuous or even low-intensity exercise. This can eventually progress to the point that symptoms interfere with very basic functions such as walking, showering, dressing, and eating food as described in NYHA class III and IV.64 On a physical exam, clinicians evaluate for signs of heart failure. In severe cases, the signs can be obvious; however, if the patient’s heart failure has developed over a long time, the signs may be subtle. A patient may appear very congested (often referred to as “wet”) or may not have obvious congestion at rest (referred to as “dry”). If “wet,” fluid in the lungs can be heard with a stethoscope as crackles (“rales” or “crepitations”), and the patient may be visibly short of breath with evidence of low oxygen levels, such as blue skin. Fluid in the peripheral tissues can be seen and felt as swelling or edema (as described above). Evaluation of the jugular vein
