DIAGNOSTICS

of serial troponin values over time. A more specific definition is included in the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) guidelines; this document describes an increase or decrease of 20 percent from the initial elevated value when using conventional troponin assays.7 In addition, these guidelines also suggest if the initial value is near or below the 99th percentile of the reference range, a change of ≥3 standard deviations of the variation from the initial value is required to meet the definition for rising or falling.7 The ACC/AHA guidelines also stress that the clinical laboratory should clearly identify when a significant change has been identified in troponin concentrations during serial measurements.7 The reason for the rising or falling requirement for troponin is to aid in differentiating between a true MI and other potential causes for troponin elevation (Table 3-1). There are a variety of other cardiac conditions that can be associated with elevated troponin concentrations, sometimes chronically. These can include myocarditis, pericarditis, tachyarrhythmias, acute or chronic heart failure, and significant trauma to the heart.7 Likewise, a myriad of non-cardiac problems, such as renal dysfunction, sepsis, burns, respiratory failure, and drug toxicity, can also cause elevations
