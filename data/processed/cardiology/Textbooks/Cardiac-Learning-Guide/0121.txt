ASCVD event and also an estimate of lifetime risk for an ASCVD event.111 The ASCVD tool calculates risk using sex, race, cholesterol concentrations, smoking status, blood pressure, and several aspects of a patient’s medical history.111 In addition to the scoring tool, the guidelines suggest that other factors, including family history of CVD, the biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and coronary artery calcium scoring (a method of visualizing coronary atherosclerosis by computed tomography) can be considered if there is still uncertainty about a person’s risk for CVD disease.111 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 54 For anyone determined to be at high risk for ASCVD events in the next 10 years (typically a 10-year risk for an ASCVD event of 7.5 percent or more), the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend tailoring interventions to each patient.111 Clinicians are referred to the specific guidelines available for the management of cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and lifestyle modifications.111-13 Importantly, the prevention guidelines note that it is still appropriate for clinicians to counsel individuals with low or moderate estimated risk (a 10-year risk of less than 7.5 percent) on lifestyle interventions to reduce future risk of CVD.111 The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend repeating assessment for ASCVD risk every four to six years
