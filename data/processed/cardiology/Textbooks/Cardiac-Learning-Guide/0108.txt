DIAGNOSTICS

found that women and older individuals had higher galectin-3 levels than men and younger individuals.95 Hemolysis in the specimen, presence of rheumatoid factor, or anti-mouse antibodies can also contribute to inaccuracies in the galectin-3 results.97 MARKERS OF MYOCARDIAL STRESS OR INJURY/ISCHEMIA High-Sensitivity Troponin Although cardiac troponin assays such as high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) were discussed extensively in Section 3, their utility in heart failure should also be mentioned. In the setting of heart failure, similar to its role in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac troponins are considered a biomarker for cardiac stress or injury.98 Troponin elevations will occur in heart failure patients who are experiencing a myocardial infarction (MI), but they can also occur in acute or chronic heart failure as an indicator of myocardial stress.99 With the development of high-sensitivity troponin assays, it has been established that most patients with heart failure have detectable troponin levels and many of these may be above the upper reference limit used to identify ACS.98 Importantly, in this context, troponin elevations remain stable and do not demonstrate the rapid rise seen over several hours in ACS.98 As such, cardiac troponins have demonstrated promise in providing additional prognostic information when measured in patients with heart
