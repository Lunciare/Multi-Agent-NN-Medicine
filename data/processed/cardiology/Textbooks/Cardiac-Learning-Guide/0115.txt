AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION DIAGNOSIS: NPs can be an initial diagnostic test in patients with suspected heart failure; recommended for ruling out rather than establishing a diagnosis For patients with newly diagnosed HF, NPs should be considered to assess the appropriateness Moderate recommendation with a DIAGNOSIS: Chronic setting of specific therapies to identify weak level of evidence reversible/treatable causes of Should be considered HF and evaluate co-morbidities affecting HF For patients presenting with acute dyspnea and suspected heart failure, an NP measurement Strong recommendation with a DIAGNOSIS: Acute setting is recommended to aid in high level of evidence differentiating between AHF and Is recommended other non-cardiac causes of acute dyspnea NP – natriuretic peptides; HF – heart failure; AHF – acute heart failure In the 2017 focused update to the 2013 heart failure guidelines, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) make a variety of recommendations about biomarkers. These are summarized in Table 5-3 on the next page. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 50 Table 5-3.
