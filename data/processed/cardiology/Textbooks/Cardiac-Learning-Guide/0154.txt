which is a waste product of cell energy production. Cardiac catheterization: See “angiography.” Cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab): The department within a facility (often a hospital) where angiography procedures are performed. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): A magnetic resonance imaging (or MRI) test that examines the structure of the heart. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC): An emerging, circulating biomarker that may be useful in early identification of myocardial infarction. Cardiac resynchronization device/therapy: An implantable device that uses electrical impulses to aid both ventricles in contracting at the same time. It is used to treat certain electrical conduction abnormalities. Cardiomyopathy: Maladaptive changes in heart structure caused by myocardial infarction, neurohormonal activation, genetic, abnormal cell signaling, or unknown reasons. Cardioversion: A procedure used to treat an abnormal cardiac rhythm that involves either delivering a specific amount of electricity (a shock) to the heart or administering medication to promote return to a normal rhythm. Cell: The smallest unit (“building block”) within a living organism. Cerebrovascular event: A term used to describe a situation where the brain is not receiving enough oxygen to function normally. This can mean a stroke (which results in permanent damage to the brain) or a transient ischemic attack (where symptoms
