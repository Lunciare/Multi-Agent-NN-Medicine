Other less common causes include vasospasm of the coronary artery or an excessive accumulation of plaque inside the coronary artery that almost completely occludes blood flow. Regardless of the cause, an NSTEMI does cause ischemia in the cardiac myocytes because they are not receiving enough oxygen to function normally, and with time, this leads to the death of the myocytes and permanent damage to the myocardium. Elevated cardiac biomarkers are a confirmation of this damage and differentiate NSTEMI from unstable angina. Additionally, these elevated biomarkers, along with other clinical factors, help identify higher-risk patients with NSTEMI who require cardiac catheterization. Unstable Angina The third type of ACS is unstable angina (UA). Unlike STEMI and NSTEMI, traditional cardiac biomarkers are not elevated in UA, myocyte death does not appear to occur, and it is not classified an MI.6,7 However, this understanding of UA is changing with the advent of more sensitive biomarker measurements, such as high- sensitivity troponin. Many experts now believe that most patients diagnosed with UA are likely experiencing an NSTEMI, but the conventional biomarker measurements are not sensitive enough to detect it.8 As a result, the use of the term UA will likely be phased out over time.
