DIAGNOSTICS

finally, lipid fraction can be used to describe the ratios in the concentration of two circulating lipids, such as triglyceride/HDL and total cholesterol/HDL. Studies are ongoing to identify the ideal lipid fraction for predicting CVD risk and to determine which lipid fractions are the best targets for medication therapies to reduce the rates of future CVD events. High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Inflammation is an important mediator of cardiovascular disease and is linked to atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, and stroke.130 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or hsCRP, becomes elevated in the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors including abdominal adiposity (fat accumulation in the abdomen), diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and hyperlipidemia (high lipid concentrations).130 Hence, hsCRP is an integrated measure of CVD risk because of its complex associations with conventional risk factors. However, even when these other factors are considered, hsCRP has an independent risk relationship with CVD. As a biomarker for inflammation, hsCRP has demonstrated usefulness in identifying individuals at risk for CVD events.118-19,131 Elevated hsCRP is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality.132 This predictive ability appears to improve when hsCRP is measured over time; prolonged elevations of hsCRP are stronger predictors of these outcomes than one-time measurements.132 Importantly,
