2. Match the biomarker with the aspect of heart failure that it evaluates. a. Marker for myocardial stress or injury b. Marker for neurohormonal activation c. Marker for cardiac remodeling Copeptin _______ NP _______ Galectin-3 _______ hsTn _______ Soluble ST2 _______ GDF15 _______ 3. T he US and European guidelines recommend using a _____________________________________________ assay for screening individuals with shortness of breath to support or exclude a diagnosis of heart failure. The US guidelines suggest that NP measurements can be helpful for _____________________________________________ individuals who are at high risk of developing heart failure. They also recommend that _____________________________________________ assays can be helpful for determining prognosis in acute and chronic heart failure and that other biomarkers that assess for _____________________________________________ or _____________________________________________ may be useful for risk stratification in patients with acute or chronic heart failure.
