the concentration of some subunits of troponin appear to follow a linear decline after the event, whereas some appear to decline and then peak again shortly after the MI.22 4. M acrotroponins: Consist of troponin bound to immunoglobulins (autoantibodies). Some assays may detect these autoantibodies.150 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 24 5. B iotin interference: It was recently reported that some immunoassays, including troponin assays, are susceptible to interference from biotin (or vitamin B7) supplements.147 Laboratory personnel and clinicians should be mindful of this interaction when interpreting cardiac troponin results. 6. H emolysis: A hemolyzed blood specimen can also result in inaccurate measurements of troponin assays. Thus, hemolysis needs should be noted when troponin concentrations are reported, and attempts should be made to redraw the specimen whenever possible.38 CONVENTIONAL TROPONIN ASSAYS In the United States (US), conventional troponin I and T assays are still in widespread use. Although these assays are not sensitive enough to measure troponin in most healthy individuals, they are very reliable for detecting troponin levels that exceed the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population.17 The performance target for these conventional assays is to measure troponins with a 10 percent coefficient of variation at the 99th percentile of
