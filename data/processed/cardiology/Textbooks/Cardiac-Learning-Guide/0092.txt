is called _____________________________________________ activation. b. The organs most sensitive to changes in cardiac performance are the __________________________________________. c. S erious, long-term structural changes occur in the heart as a result of heart failure. Cardiac _____________________ occurs as a result of the accumulation of proteins between the myocyte cells that causes the cells to stiffen. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 41 SECTION 5 THE ROLE OF CARDIAC BIOMARKERS IN HEART FAILURE LEARNING OBJECTIVES When you complete this section, you will be able to: 1. Describe cardiac biomarkers used in heart failure 2. Explain the role of cardiac biomarkers in various aspects of heart failure care 3. Understand the guideline recommendations from several international organizations for the use of cardiac biomarkers in heart failure LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 42 As discussed in Section 4, the changes in cardiac function that occur in heart failure affect the entire body, so it is essential that clinicians monitor the status of heart failure patients with diligence. Circulating biomarkers can be especially helpful tools for gauging the presence, severity, and progression of heart failure. This section will build on the previous discussions of biomarkers used in heart failure and also introduce several emerging biomarkers for this disease process. AS
