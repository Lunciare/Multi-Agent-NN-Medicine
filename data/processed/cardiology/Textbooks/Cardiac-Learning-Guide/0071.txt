DIAGNOSTICS

of this writing, there are no proven treatments for HFpEF that reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) In HFrEF, the ejection fraction of the left ventricle is reduced. This means that with each pumping contraction of the heart, a smaller percentage of blood, usually less than 45 percent, is forced out into the aorta. The interior cavity of the left ventricle is typically dilated in HFrEF, and the heart muscle is less effective when it contracts.51 Unlike HFpEF, HFrEF is the more common cause of heart failure in men and younger individuals.52 Approximately two-thirds of HFrEF is attributed to a prior myocardial infarction and damage to the heart resulting in scar formation.55 Diagnosis is more straightforward in HFrEF than in HFpEF: patients with HFrEF are more likely than those with HFpEF to have common symptoms of heart failure. Also, because they are younger, patients with HFrEF are less likely than those with HFpEF to have other diseases that the symptoms could be attributed to, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.51,52,54 Patients with HFrEF also respond more favorably to treatment with medications than those with HFpEF.51,52 Indeed multiple classes of medications,
