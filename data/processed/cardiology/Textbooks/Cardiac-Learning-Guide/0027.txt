the coagulation cascade to produce fibrin, and ultimately the formation of a thrombus which causes complete or partial occlusion of the artery. Plaque can accumulate inside any artery in the body, and the presence of plaque in the arteries is called atherosclerosis. The presence of plaque in the coronary arteries is particularly problematic, and when this occurs, it is termed coronary artery disease. Plaque changes how blood moves through the arteries because it stiffens the walls of the artery and narrows the artery lumen. Plaque is also less stable than walls of the artery and more prone to breakage or rupture. As blood travels through the coronary arteries, occasionally the plaque will rupture. If the subsequent platelet aggregation and fibrin formation result in a significant obstruction in the artery, a type 1 MI occurs. Since a type 1 MI is caused by plaque (and coronary artery disease), much of the prevention and long-term treatments focus on stabilizing current plaque (reducing the risk of rupture) and decreasing further plaque buildup.
