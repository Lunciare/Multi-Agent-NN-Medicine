(or edema), first in the legs and feet (due to gravity), and then it may spread to the abdomen and even to organs such as the liver. This process whereby problems with the left ventricle lead to problems with the right ventricle, with congestion of the lungs as well as the peripheral tissues, underlies what most doctors regard as true “congestive heart failure.” SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF HEART FAILURE One of the most important characteristics to evaluate in patients with heart failure is symptoms. Notably, many of the symptoms of heart failure can be traced back to the changes in cardiac performance and can be collectively termed “effort intolerance.” Shortness of breath (sometimes called dyspnea) is the most common symptom of heart failure and is a sign that fluid is accumulating in the lungs as a result of poor left ventricular performance. Patients with heart failure often present with other symptoms as well, such as orthopnea (shortness of breath when lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (awakening from sleep with acute shortness of breath), exercise intolerance, weakness, fatigue, and swelling of the ankles and feet.51,52 Again, these symptoms correlate with fluid accumulation in the lungs and body as a result of
