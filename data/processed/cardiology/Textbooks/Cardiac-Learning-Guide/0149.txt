neurohormonal changes. Acute coronary syndrome: A spectrum of problems ranging from ST-elevation MI to unstable angina that indicates the heart tissue is not receiving adequate supplies of oxygen. Acute heart failure: Acute, rapid worsening of heart failure symptoms that can be life-threatening. Adrenal glands: Glands that sit directly above the kidneys that produce a variety of hormones, including norepinephrine. Aerobic exercise: Exercise that stimulates the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Aerobic respiration: The process used by the cells of the body to produce energy that relies on oxygen. Aggregation (of platelets): Platelets clumping together in the process of forming a plug to stop bleeding from a blood vessel. Aldosterone antagonists: Diuretic drugs used in heart failure that block the neurohormonal effects of heart failure. Anemia: A condition resulting from an insufficient amount of healthy red blood cells circulating in the bloodstream. Angina: The medical term for chest pain related to the heart. Antibodies: Proteins used by the immune system to neutralize foreign, potentially harmful substances found in the body. Anticoagulant: Medications that decrease the blood’s ability to clot (thin the blood) by interfering with the body’s normal clotting cascade. Antiplatelet: Medications that decrease the blood’s ability to clot
