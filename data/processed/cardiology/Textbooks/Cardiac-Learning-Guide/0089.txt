interventions such as eating a low-sodium diet, limiting fluid intake to a prescribed amount, weighing themselves daily, engaging in light aerobic exercise, understanding the need for follow-up appointments with their physician, and learning how best to manage the disease.58,62 Medications are typically prescribed to block the body’s maladaptive neurohormonal response to heart failure. These can include drugs such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics.62 It is essential that patients understand the importance of taking these medications because, when used appropriately, these drugs can prevent hospitalizations and decrease the risk of death from heart failure, especially in patients with HFrEF.58,62 Although these medications can also be beneficial to patients with HFpEF, researchers are still attempting to determine the optimal drug regimens for treatment of HFpEF.58,62 Some patients with heart failure will also require intervention with cardiac devices. Certain individuals with severe heart failure who have electrical conduction abnormalities (as outlined in the previous discussion of ECG in heart failure) may be candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (often called a biventricular pacemaker), which is an implantable device that uses electrical impulses to aid both ventricles in contracting at the same time. Other patients with very low ejection fractions may require
