DIAGNOSTICS

ventricles is significantly more powerful than systole of the atria because the ventricles are thicker and force the blood to travel much further. The left ventricle, the largest and thickest of the four heart chambers, creates the most powerful contraction during systole because it must pump blood to the entire body. Efficient pumping of the left ventricle is essential because it pushes the oxygenated blood to the tissues and organs and helps maintain the pressure required for the oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged in the capillaries. If the left ventricle does not pump well, the tissues and organs of the body may not receive an adequate supply of oxygen to function normally. Understanding the process of systole and diastole in the heart can also help explain a health parameter that is frequently measured in the clinical setting: blood pressure. More accurately termed arterial blood pressure, this is a measure of the pressure in the arteries during ventricular systole and the pressure at the end of ventricular diastole. For example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg indicates that the blood vessels have a pressure of 120 mmHg during ventricular systole and 80 mmHg at the end of ventricular
