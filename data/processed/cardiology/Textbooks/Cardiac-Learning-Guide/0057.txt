DIAGNOSTICS

exploring how these new high-sensitivity assays may modify the definition of change in troponin concentrations. A study by Keller et al. examining the use of high- sensitivity troponin assays for early rule-out of MI demonstrated the value of using a 50 percent change (or delta) between initial and three-hour troponin measurements, a strategy known as a scaled troponin approach.34 Other groups have advocated for the use of an absolute change, rather than a percent change, for meeting the criteria of rising or falling troponin with high-sensitivity assays.35 A position statement from the IFCC outlined the potential benefits of using this method although ultimately concluded that limitations exist for any method that defines troponin change in MI.36 Prior generation cardiac troponin assays >8-12 hours post event Current generation cardiac troponin assays Onset of myocardial infarction 2-6 hours High sensitivity cardiac post event troponin assays 99th Percentile Normal levels Ischemia or Necrosis Adapted from Hochholzer, Am Heart J, 2010 Micronecrosis F .
