Ranges of normal, gray zone, and elevated BNP and NT-proBNP USING NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Diagnosis of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure For patients who seek emergency medical attention for acute shortness of breath, NPs are an essential test for determining the cause. These patients may be experiencing an episode of acute heart failure (AHF), and an NP measurement can assist clinicians in differentiating AHF from other causes of acute shortness of breath such as an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a pulmonary embolism.56,75 NPs have very high negative predictive value (NPV) for AHF—if the NP value is not elevated, heart failure can usually be ruled out, and unnecessary heart failure treatment, such as diuretics (which could harm
