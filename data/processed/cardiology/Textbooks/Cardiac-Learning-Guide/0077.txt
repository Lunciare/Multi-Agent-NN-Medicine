failure in the setting of acute symptom worsening. Once a patient is hospitalized for heart failure, there is a much higher risk of repeat hospitalization within the next several months, and this often becomes a progressive cycle. CAUSES OF HEART FAILURE Anything that causes damage to the myocardium can lead to heart failure. Coronary artery disease is the most important predictor of heart failure, and it is estimated to be the primary cause of heart failure in over 60 percent of patients in the US.55 However, other frequent causes of heart failure include hypertension (the medical term for high blood pressure), problems with the valves in the heart, or cardiomyopathy (maladaptive changes in heart structure caused by inflammation, infection, or unknown reasons).50,52 Approximately 90 percent of all heart failure cases have antecedent hypertension (or hypertension before the diagnosis of heart failure). Thus it is believed that high blood pressure contributes to all forms of heart failure as an additional risk condition.60 Other less common causes of heart failure include myocarditis, pericarditis, drug toxicities (e.g., certain types of chemotherapy, other cancer treatments, and alcohol), endocrine disorders like thyroid disease, collagen vascular diseases like scleroderma, and arrhythmias with persistently elevated heart rates.50,52
