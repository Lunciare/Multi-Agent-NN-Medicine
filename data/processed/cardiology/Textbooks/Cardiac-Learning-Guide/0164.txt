A2 (Lp-PLA2): An enzyme linked to inflammation and instability in atherosclerotic plaques; it has been studied as a possible biomarker for screening asymptomatic populations for cardiovascular disease. Low-sodium diet: A diet low in salt. Lumen: An opening; in the case of blood vessels, this term describes the opening inside the vessel. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 69 M Maladaptive: Counterproductive; inadequate adjustment to a change or environment. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: See “Aldosterone antagonist.” Mortality: Death or dying. MR-proADM: An emerging, circulating biomarker for neurohormonal activation in heart failure. MR-proANP: An emerging, circulating biomarker for neurohormonal activation in heart failure. Myocardial: Relating to the heart. Myocardial infarction: Permanent damage to the heart as a result of inadequate blood flow to the cardiac tissue. Myocarditis: Inflammation of the heart muscle, often as a result of a viral infection. Myocardium: The heart’s muscle tissue. Myocyte: A cell in the heart tissue. Myoglobin: An oxygen-binding protein similar to hemoglobin; it was one of the earliest circulating biomarkers for myocardial infarction, but it is no longer used for this purpose. N Natriuretic peptide: Hormones that influence fluid and sodium balance in the body. Although there are several other known natriuretic peptides, this term is often used to
