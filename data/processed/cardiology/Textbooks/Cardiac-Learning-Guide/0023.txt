DIAGNOSTICS

there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and at least one of the following: • Symptoms of myocardial ischaemia • New ischaemic ECG changes • Development of pathological Q waves • Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology • Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for type 2 or 3 MIs) Post-mortem demonstration of acute athero-thrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI . Evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute athero-thrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI . Cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new ischaemic ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI . There are additional types of MI (Types 4 and 5) that are very uncommon and are not included in this table . Criteria for myocardial injury The term myocardial injury should be used when
