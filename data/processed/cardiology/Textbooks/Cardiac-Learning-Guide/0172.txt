DIAGNOSTICS

running on a treadmill or riding a bicycle. Troponin: A protein that is abundant in the cardiac myocytes; it works inside the cell as part of the contractile mechanism to facilitate myocyte contraction; troponins T and I are both useful as biomarkers in the evaluation of individuals with possible myocardial infarction. U Unstable angina: A type of acute coronary syndrome where cardiac biomarkers are not elevated and myocyte death does not appear to occur; it is not classified a myocardial infarction. V Valsartan/sacubitril: A medication used for heart failure that blocks the body’s maladaptive neurohormonal response. Vascular disease: A type of disease characterized by blood vessel abnormalities; it is a general classification that encompasses an array of different conditions, including coronary heart disease. Vasospasm: Spasm of the blood vessel wall. Vein: Blood vessels that carry oxygen-poor blood from the capillaries back to the heart. Vena cava: The largest vein in the body which delivers blood into the right ventricle. Ventricles: The larger, lower two chambers of the heart. Venules: Smaller veins that deliver blood to the capillaries.
