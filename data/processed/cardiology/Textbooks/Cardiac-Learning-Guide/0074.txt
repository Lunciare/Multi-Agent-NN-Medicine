The categories progress from an NYHA class I, indicating the patient has no symptoms with normal physical activity, all the way to an NYHA class IV, indicating the patient has symptoms of heart failure at rest or with the slightest physical activity.58 The NYHA classification system can predict mortality in heart failure and can be a useful way to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.50,58 Another classification scheme from the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) defines heart failure according to symptoms and structural changes to the heart (Figure 4-2). The ACC/AHA classification scheme for chronic heart failure begins with stage A, which indicates only that a patient is at high risk of developing heart failure as a result of comorbidities like coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension.58 Stage B in this classification scheme indicates that there is evidence of structural changes in the heart associated with heart failure, but the patient is not experiencing signs or symptoms.58 In Stage C, patients have evidence of structural changes in the heart and also signs and symptoms of heart failure.58 Finally, stage
