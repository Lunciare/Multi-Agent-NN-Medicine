assessment model alone.101 The hsTn assays have also shown usefulness as prognostic tools in patients hospitalized for AHF; elevated hsTnI on admission has been associated with worsening heart failure during hospitalization and increased the length of stay.102 Likewise, at discharge, elevations in hsTnI have been associated with increased risk for readmission and death in patients with AHF.103 In addition, hsTn may aid in identifying patients with a low mortality risk during an episode of acute heart failure and may provide long-term mortality risk information in elderly patients with chronic heart failure.104,105 As noted in Section 3, hsTn assays are very sensitive tests, but with this sensitivity, there is a loss of specificity if specific protocols, particularly those involving “deltas” or changes over time, are not used. The other non-cardiac clinical scenarios that can cause hsTn elevations in ACS, such as sepsis and respiratory failure, also cause elevations when evaluating heart failure. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 48 OTHER BIOMARKERS FOR HEART FAILURE A number of other biomarkers are being studied for assessing different facets of heart failure. This section will discuss five that have demonstrated promise in heart failure management. Although researchers have identified these biomarkers as potentially useful in this population,
