used.106 For patients with chronic heart failure, it appears to predict the risk of death or cardiac transplantation, but whether this test provides any additional information over prognostic information available from NPs remains to be determined.106 GDF15 Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a cytokine that is upregulated in the setting of inflammation.107 Although it is also found in other body tissues, in the myocardium, it appears to be a marker for remodeling and may be a good prognosticator for mortality in individuals with heart failure.107 It may also be useful in predicting the risk of heart failure and death after a myocardial infarction.107 Similar to ST2, although GDF15 shows promise, it has not demonstrated superiority over biomarkers in current use. MR-proADM Several markers of neurohormonal activation in heart failure apart from the natriuretic peptides have been identified. One such biomarker is mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) which is measured because it is a precursor of adrenomedullin which has an array of neurohormonal effects in the body including dilation of the blood vessels.108 Adrenomedullin and MR-proADM concentrations increase in heart failure.108 Several studies have demonstrated that concentrations of MR-proADM are predictors of mortality as well as heart failure hospitalizations independent of NP
