DIAGNOSTICS

in this protocol, further evaluation is recommended.39 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 30 OTHER CARDIAC BIOMARKERS Although troponin is central in the determination of myocardial necrosis, a variety of other markers have demonstrated some usefulness in the evaluation of patients with suspected ACS in the past, and more are under investigation. Myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein, was one of the earliest biomarkers used for MI.15 Although its concentrations rise in response to injury of the cardiac tissue, it is no longer recommended as a biomarker for ACS.15 Creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB) is a marker that is mostly specific to the cardiac tissue and was traditionally used in conjunction with older generation troponin assays. It remains elevated for a shorter time than troponin after MI, and it may provide additional clinical information regarding the timing of a myocardial injury and is sometimes useful for detecting an early reinfarction.23 In current practice, routine measurements of CK-MB in patients with suspected ACS are no longer recommended.23 Copeptin is a small portion of a precursor for the arginine vasopressin hormone.40 Although it is not specific to the cardiac tissue, copeptin does increase significantly in the early stages of MI.40 In some studies, it has shown promise when
