itself undergoes more changes. The structure of the ventricle undergoes further modification, causing it to be even less effective at pumping blood.62 This process is often termed remodeling, and it is the consequence of scar formation in the cardiac tissue (this scarring is called cardiac fibrosis). Scar formation and fibrosis can initially be the result of a heart attack or may develop more diffusely over time as a result of the heart failure process itself.63 The changes that lead to fibrosis occur on the cellular level within the cardiac myocytes. In response to the original damage that led to heart failure, the myocytes become enlarged and don’t function as efficiently.63 Poor myocyte function eventually leads to an excessive accumulation of proteins between the myocyte cells that prevent normal movement of the cells and cause stiffening of the myocytes. This stiffness of the myocytes produces the cardiac fibrosis.63 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 37 The consequences of these structural changes in the heart are profound for the rest of the body. Humans have a “closed circulatory system,” like a closed circuit; this means that blood can only go “back” when it cannot go “forward.” When the heart does not pump the blood forward
