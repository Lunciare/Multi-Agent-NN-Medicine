DIAGNOSTICS

an NSTEMI, but the conventional biomarker measurements are not sensitive enough to detect it.8 As a result, the use of the term UA will likely be phased out over time. As in NSTEMI, cardiac catheterization is commonly performed in patients with UA. Symptoms and Biomarkers in Diagnosing ACS Regardless of whether it is classified as a STEMI or NSTEMI, an MI is caused by an ischemic event that results in death of the myocytes and permanent damage to the myocardium. The term necrosis is often used to describe the death of the myocytes. It is important to understand the criteria for recognizing necrosis and, in turn, diagnosing an acute MI (Table 2-1). Although the assessment process for acute MI begins with an ECG, clinicians must also consider the symptoms the patient is experiencing and measure cardiac biomarkers. Cardiac troponins are the preferred biomarker in this clinical setting. The cells of the myocardium contain three types of troponin: troponin I, T, and C. Troponin C is also found in skeletal muscle, but troponins I and T are very specific to cardiac myocytes and are therefore clinically useful for measuring damage to the myocardium. When extended ischemia occurs, the cells die and
