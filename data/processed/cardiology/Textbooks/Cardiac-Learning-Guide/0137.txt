therapies to raise HDL do not appear to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials, and it is unlikely that low HDL itself is a cause of CVD.128-29 Although lifestyle factors such as exercise and smoking cessation are interventions that can raise HDL and decrease cardiovascular risk, the benefits of these interventions are not entirely due to their effect on HDL. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 59 TRIGLYCERIDES Triglycerides are another lipid measurement typically reported on a lipid panel. Although some clinical trials examining the risk associated with triglyceride elevation have found a strong association with CVD, other lipid biomarkers may have better predictive power.129 Moreover, at the time of this publication, studies of medications to lower triglycerides have not demonstrated improvement in cardiovascular outcomes, although there are ongoing clinical trials in this area.129 LIPID FRACTIONS The term lipid fraction is used to describe different lipid measurements, including LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. This term is also used to describe newer lipid biomarkers, such as triglyceride-related lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B. And finally, lipid fraction can be used to describe the ratios in the concentration of two circulating lipids, such as triglyceride/HDL and total cholesterol/HDL. Studies are ongoing to identify the ideal
