arginine vasopressin hormone.40 Although it is not specific to the cardiac tissue, copeptin does increase significantly in the early stages of MI.40 In some studies, it has shown promise when used in conjunction with troponin for facilitating earlier rule-out of myocardial infarction to differentiate between patients with NSTEMI and no NSTEMI.23,41 Copeptin concentrations may also provide prognostic information in ACS patients; higher copeptin levels have been correlated with greater mortality and risk for heart failure after an ACS event.42 Although the US guidelines do not make a specific recommendation on it, the ESC guidelines on NSTEMI do suggest that copeptin may be useful to facilitate early rule-out of MI, especially if high-sensitivity troponin assays are unavailable.23 Despite this recommendation, copeptin is infrequently used in clinical practice because it has not proved to be superior to troponin in identifying MI. The natriuretic peptides, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its inactive counterpart N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), are most often used in the setting of heart failure but also rise quickly after a myocardial ischemic event.42 The natriuretic peptides can provide information about the size of the infarct area in the heart and also the function of the left ventricle before and during the
