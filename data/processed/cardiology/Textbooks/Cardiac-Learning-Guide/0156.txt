within a data sample; coefficient of variation is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (a measure that describes the amount of variation in a group of numbers) by the mean (or average) of those numbers. It is usually expressed as a percentage. Congenital heart disease: A structural abnormality in the heart that is present at birth. Coning: A term used to describe selection of a population for a scientific measurement. Copeptin: An emerging, circulating biomarker that may be used for identifying myocardial infarction. Coronary artery: An artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): A type of surgery used to treat severe coronary heart disease. Surgeons use healthy blood vessels from another part of the body to create a new route for oxygen-rich blood to travel to the myocardium. Coronary CT angiography: A type of imaging test that allows clinicians to visualize the inside of the coronary arteries using a powerful, detailed X-ray. Coronary heart disease: A condition that results from atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries. Contraction: Tension that occurs in the muscle fibers in response to a stimulus. Creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB): An older circulating biomarker that was previously used to identify myocardial necrosis,
