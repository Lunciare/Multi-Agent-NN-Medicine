size of the ventricular walls and the interior chamber, the performance of the valves, and the pressures in various parts of the heart.52 The echocardiogram also measures ejection fraction and stiffness of the ventricle, necessary in the differentiation between HFrEF and HFpEF.52 Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart, is another useful tool for evaluating heart structure and characterizing changes in the cardiac tissue. It can be particularly helpful when echocardiography is not adequate to assess structural abnormalities in heart failure, especially the right side of the heart.52 The European heart failure guidelines recommend the use of CMR in patients with complex congenital heart disease (a cardiac structure problem that a patient is born with) or with inadequate imaging with echocardiography.52 Both the US and European heart failure guidelines also state that CMR can be helpful in establishing a cause of heart failure and characterizing the fibrotic changes in the cardiac tissue particularly in the setting of sarcoidosis.52,58 Although CMR is the only imaging tool that can truly characterize the actual cardiac tissue, it is not suitable for everyone, such as patients with certain metal implants; it is also not available
