Useful biomarkers will need to demonstrate two qualities: 1) accuracy in predicting future cardiac risk and 2) provision of additional information beyond what current methods offer.123 These qualities can be evaluated using three complementary statistical techniques. First, a biomarker must demonstrate discrimination capability, or the ability to differentiate between individuals who will and will not develop a disease, which is usually evaluated with something called a c-statistic test.123 Second, a biomarker must demonstrate through a statistical assessment that it is calibrated to what it measures, or that the biomarker’s prediction aligns with the observed results.123 And third, a
