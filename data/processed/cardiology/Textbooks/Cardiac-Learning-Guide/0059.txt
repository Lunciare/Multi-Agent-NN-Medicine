patients with ACS symptoms are managed, saving lives and money. IMPLEMENTING HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN TESTING When introducing hsTn testing to an institution, a variety of factors need to be considered. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and representatives from all key areas affected by the change need to be included in the implementation process. Education is of particular importance; physicians, mid-level providers, nurses, and other healthcare personnel must understand the differences in sensitivity and specificity of the high-sensitivity assay.38 Likewise, protocols and workflow, particularly in the ED, may need to be modified before implementing an assay with greater sensitivity.38 The hsTn assays are most useful when they are used as part of an ACS risk assessment algorithm.23 Importantly, it should be understood that simply replacing a conventional assay in an existing protocol with a hsTn assay does not allow the high-sensitivity assay to function to its full potential. Only when used in an algorithm that accounts for the increased sensitivity can it be effective for decreasing cost and ED admission time. Developing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm for managing ACS patients will be important to promote appropriate use of the new test.23 In addition, laboratory personnel will need to
