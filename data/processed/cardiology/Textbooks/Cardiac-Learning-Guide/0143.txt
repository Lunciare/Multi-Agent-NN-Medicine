study, the Dallas Heart Study, to evaluate sex-specific differences in an array of biomarkers, including hsTn.139 Similar to findings in the HUNT study, women were found to have lower concentrations of hsTn than men.139 Evidence indicates that measuring circulating sensitive cardiac biomarkers such as hsTnI improves cardiovascular risk stratification in the general population; however the majority of the prior evidence and biomarker thresholds were derived in Western populations. Whether these data are similarly applicable to Asia Pacific populations and may be effectively used to target high risk individuals for primary prevention strategies warrant further study.151 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 61 Natriuretic Peptides Although the natriuretic peptides (NPs) are used extensively in the management of patients with heart failure, they also have a role in screening the asymptomatic population for CVD. Even small elevations of NP levels, below the threshold for diagnosis of heart failure, have demonstrated usefulness as a prognostic marker for predicting the risk of cardiovascular events and death.136,140 In a meta-analysis examining data from 11 studies on NT-proBNP for identification of risk in the general population, NT-proBNP elevation correlated with an increased cardiovascular mortality and mortality from any cause.141 Moreover, there is also data to support that NPs are
