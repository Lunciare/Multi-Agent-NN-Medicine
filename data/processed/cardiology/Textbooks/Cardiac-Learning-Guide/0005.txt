dependent on aerobic metabolism, meaning they require oxygen to function normally and depend upon an oxygen-binding protein known as myoglobin. Blood Flow to the Myocardium To continuously supply the heart muscle with oxygen, three major coronary arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the aorta to the myocardium (Figure 1-2). Different coronary arteries supply blood to various parts of the myocardium. For example, the right coronary artery supplies blood to the right atrium, sections of both ventricles, and portions of the heart’s electrical conduction system. Other major coronary arteries include the left main coronary artery, which divides into the left circumflex artery, and the left anterior descending artery, all of which are responsible for delivering blood to a particular part of the heart. In a similar network, several large cardiac veins, including the aptly named great cardiac vein, collect the oxygen-poor blood from the tissue and return it to the right atrium via the coronary sinus. Maintaining a healthy circulation of blood into the coronary arteries is necessary to assure optimal cardiac function. If an obstruction develops in any of the coronary arteries blocking the flow of blood, the myocytes that are supplied by the obstructed artery will experience distress, and there
