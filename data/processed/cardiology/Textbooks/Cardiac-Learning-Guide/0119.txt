for preventing cardiovascular diseases 3. Explain risk stratification tools and biomarkers used for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the general population LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 53 THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES Each year, over 17 million people across the globe die of cardiovascular diseases (Figure 6-1).2 This number is projected to increase to over 23 million deaths per year by 2030.5 The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes that although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death worldwide, many of these deaths are preventable.2 Modifiable behaviors, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, poor dietary choices, and the resultant obesity are major contributors to CVD.2 In addition, initiating therapies for diseases associated with CVD, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension, can also reduce risk.2 Accurate risk stratification of patients at low, moderate, and high risk for developing CVD is a crucial component to reversing the advance of cardiovascular disease. For moderate and high-risk patients, accurate stratification allows for appropriate treatment to prevent the many complications that arise from cardiovascular disease, whereas in low-risk patients, it allows clinicians to avoid unnecessary investigation and treatment. If patients are not accurately risk stratified, patients who are truly high risk (but
