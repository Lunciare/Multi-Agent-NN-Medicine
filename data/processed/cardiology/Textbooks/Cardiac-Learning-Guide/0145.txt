DIAGNOSTICS

as a biomarker for prevention. Patients were screened using BNP and received intervention if they were high-risk according to the biomarker; this intervention, in turn, resulted in improved patient outcomes (i.e., lower rates of heart failure).81 Other Biomarkers A variety of other biomarkers have been evaluated to assess CVD risk in the general population, but their exact role in CVD risk assessment remains unclear. Lipoprotein (a) is a circulating lipoprotein similar to LDL, and its concentration in plasma has been consistently associated with CVD events.143 Specific treatments to lower the production of Lp(a) are in development. Similarly, the total triglyceride concentration and the non-HDL fraction (total cholesterol minus HDL) of the lipid panel may reflect the “total atherogenicity” of the lipid profile and hence have been treatment targets in prior guidelines. Further study of these two lipid fractions is ongoing. Another biomarker, homocysteine, is an amino acid synthesized by the body. Elevated homocysteine concentrations are associated with inflammation and an increased risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke in a generally healthy population.144 However, clinical trials evaluating folic acid and B-vitamins for decreasing homocysteine concentrations did not demonstrate any decrease in CVD risk. Finally, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an
