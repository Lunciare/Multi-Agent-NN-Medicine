Cardiac Learning guide series LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 1 SECTION 1 ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART LEARNING OBJECTIVES When you complete this section, you will be able to: 1. Recognize key features of the cardiac anatomy including the heart chambers and coronary arteries 2. Describe how blood flows through the heart, lungs, and body 3. Understand basic characteristics of the heart’s electrical conduction system 4. Explain systole and diastole and how this relates to blood flow LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 5 The heart, in the most simplistic of terms, is a pump. It continuously circulates blood through the body. The blood, in turn, delivers oxygen (bound to hemoglobin inside red blood cells) and nutrients to all of the organs and tissues. Blood also carries away the wastes and carbon dioxide produced by the organs and tissues so they can be removed from the body. This movement of blood throughout the body is almost entirely dependent on the heart’s pumping ability. BASIC HEART ANATOMY A short review of cardiac anatomy is required to understand in more detail how the heart works. The heart is divided into two sides, right and left (Figure 1-1). The right side of the heart is further divided
