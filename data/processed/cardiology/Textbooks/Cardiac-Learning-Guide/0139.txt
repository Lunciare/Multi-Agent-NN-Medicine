cardiovascular disease, and mortality.132 This predictive ability appears to improve when hsCRP is measured over time; prolonged elevations of hsCRP are stronger predictors of these outcomes than one-time measurements.132 Importantly, hsCRP as a predictor for CVD events has been evaluated in different ethnic cohorts in different areas of the world.130 Although studies indicate that there are race and geographic differences in normal hsCRP ranges (making the definition of normal ranges difficult to define for international populations), there is evidence that higher hsCRP concentrations correlate to a higher incidence of CVD events across all populations.130 One of the biggest shortcomings of hsCRP is its lack of specificity to the heart; any inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, can cause elevations in hsCRP. In addition, hsCRP has not performed consistently in predicting CVD risk in several large study populations. Researchers evaluating the use of hsCRP in the participants of two large, long-term study groups, NHANES and ARIC, found that measuring hsCRP did not add any significant predictive effectiveness over traditional scoring tools and traditional risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol).133-34 Despite this, hsCRP was cited in the ACC/ AHA guidelines as possibly helpful if the benefit
