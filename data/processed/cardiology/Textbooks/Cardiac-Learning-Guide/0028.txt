TYPE 1 MI TYPE 2 Plaque rupture Vasospasm or endothelial Fixed atherosclerosis and Supply-demand with thrombus dysfunction supply-demand imbalance imbalance alone Figure 2-2. Differentiation between myocardial infarction (MI) types 1 and 2 according to the condition of the coronary arteries LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 16 Type 2: The Ischemic Imbalance MI Unlike a type 1 MI, a type 2 MI is not triggered by a thrombus forming in a coronary artery. Instead, a type 2 MI is the result of supply and demand imbalance in the heart where the coronary arteries are not supplying adequate oxygen for the myocytes to function normally—the supply does not meet the demand. There are many reasons that this can occur (Figure 2-2). Some type 2 MIs are caused by a vasospasm, or spasm of the blood vessel wall, which can prevent blood from flowing appropriately to the myocardium, leading to ischemic damage. Others can be caused by coronary artery disease where plaque accumulation can limit the blood flow through a coronary artery. If the heart needs more oxygen because it is beating more rapidly than normal, as often occurs in a severe infection, and more oxygen is unable to flow to the tissue because of
