DIAGNOSTICS

heart tissue’s ability to generate its own electrical impulses to stimulate contraction. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 65 B B-natriuretic peptide (BNP): A protein released by the ventricles of the heart when they are under strain or stress; most often used as a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring heart failure. Beta blocker: A medication used to slow the heart rate and control blood pressure; beta blockers are often used in patients who have had a myocardial infarction; some beta blockers are useful for blocking the neurohormonal changes associated with heart failure. Biomarker: A measurable characteristic that can be used to evaluate normal body processes, disease, or response to treatment. This guide focuses on circulating biomarkers, which are markers that circulate in the bloodstream. Blood: The liquid that travels through the blood vessels of the body that is made up of specific types of cells (i.e., red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets). Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to body tissues and carries waste and carbon dioxide away from tissues. Blood pressure (or arterial blood pressure): The measure of pressure inside the arteries that is created by the force and rate of the heart beating and the elasticity of the arteries. Blood vessel:
