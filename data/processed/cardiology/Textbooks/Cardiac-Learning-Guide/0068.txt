prevent the ventricles from either properly filling with blood or properly ejecting blood. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, this results in poor cardiac performance. Section 1 of this guide described the basic consequences of poor cardiac performance: the tissues of the body may not receive enough oxygen if the heart is not providing enough pressure to allow for perfusion of oxygen and nutrients from the blood into the tissues. The body does attempt to compensate for this loss of perfusion. It begins to release hormones and neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the body) that increase the blood pressure and promote retention of water by the kidneys to increase blood volume; this is termed neurohormonal activation.50,51 In the short term, these compensation mechanisms are adaptive, but over the longer term, they clearly become maladaptive and are the targets for diagnostic tests and therapies. For example, neurohormonal activation facilitates the maintenance of perfusion to the organs if the body is experiencing acute blood loss, minimizing organ damage from this event. However, when neurohormonal activation occurs over a long period, as it does in heart failure, these compensations worsen the functional ability of the heart rather than improving it. 50,51 DEFINING HEART FAILURE BY
