DIAGNOSTICS

17 THE PROCESS OF CARE IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Because damage to the cardiac tissue happens quickly once an obstruction occurs, it is essential that medical providers understand how to manage patients experiencing ACS efficiently. Figure 2-3 is a flowchart explaining the process of care for patients with ACS. Any patient with ACS symptoms is classified as very high acuity in the emergency department and requires rapid assessment and close monitoring. Nurses, physicians, and other support staff must work together to ensure that this occurs in a timely and efficient manner.
