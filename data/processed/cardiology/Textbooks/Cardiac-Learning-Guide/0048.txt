a physical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and then biomarker measurement. Only when all of these features are considered together can an accurate diagnosis be made. The ACC/AHA guidelines for NSTEMI recommend measuring either troponin I or T when a patient with suspected ACS presents to the emergency department (ED).7 This measurement should be repeated three to six hours after the symptoms started (or three to six hours after presentation) in all patients with ACS symptoms.7 Additional measurements after six hours should be considered in patients who are stratified as moderate or high risk for ACS.7 LIMITATIONS TO CONVENTIONAL TROPONIN ASSAYS Due to the extended time required to detect troponin in the blood using conventional assays, there can be a delay in the diagnosis of MI, which could also result in the delay of appropriate treatment. Following clinical evaluation and assessment for STEMI via ECG, most patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with ACS symptoms will undergo a “rule-in” or “rule-out” protocol where serial cardiac markers are measured. Measuring the conventional troponin several times over a three- to six-hour period (or even longer period for higher risk patients) should yield a positive result if a patient is experiencing an NSTEMI.
