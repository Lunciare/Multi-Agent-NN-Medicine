correlate to heart failure (BNP > 500 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 2000 pg/mL), concentrations in the “gray-zone” indicating it could be heart failure or could be another problem (BNP 100–500 pg/mL or NT-proBNP 450–2000 pg/mL), or normal concentrations (BNP < 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mL) (Figure 5-1).66 Of note, compared with BNP, NT-proBNP has a much wider “gray zone” which may be attributed to advanced age (over 50 years) or renal dysfunction with NT-proBNP values in the range 125-450 pg/mL or higher.82 This results in more “indeterminate” results when using this assay in older patients; BNP does not have this limitation.82 Evaluating the entire patient presentation in addition to biomarker results, including symptoms, physical examination findings, and other diagnostic test results, is essential to establishing a correct diagnosis for every patient. Confounding Factors in the Measurement of Natriuretic Peptides Several disease processes and patient characteristics can confound the results of NP assays – clinicians must interpret the NP measurements with caution in these clinical scenarios. Because NT-proBNP is eliminated primarily by the kidneys and BNP is eliminated through multiple pathways, NT-proBNP is more susceptible to elevations in patients with kidney disease than BNP.66 In severe kidney disease, BNP
