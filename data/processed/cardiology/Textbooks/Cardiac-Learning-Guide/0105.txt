inhibited or impaired.86,87 This would limit the efficacy of drugs designed to inhibit the enzyme such as ARNI. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine if there are clinically significant differences in measured concentrations or adverse effects on patient outcomes and further research is ongoing.88 Other common causes for NP elevation are included in Table 5-1 on the next page.
