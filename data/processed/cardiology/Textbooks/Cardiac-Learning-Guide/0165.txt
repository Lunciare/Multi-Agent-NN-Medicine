DIAGNOSTICS

for this purpose. N Natriuretic peptide: Hormones that influence fluid and sodium balance in the body. Although there are several other known natriuretic peptides, this term is often used to describe BNP and its inactive counterpart, NT-proBNP. Necrosis: Death of all or most of the cells in an area of the body. Negative predictive value (NPV): The probability that an individual with a negative result on a screening test does not have a disease or problem. Neprilysin: An enzyme involved in an array of biochemical processes in the body; neprilysin is involved in the breakdown of BNP. Net reclassification improvement: In statistics, the ability of a new test or marker to demonstrate that it improves predictive ability over previously used methods (e.g., more individuals were provided with accurate predictions with the new method than with previous methods). Neurohormonal activation: The release of hormones and neurotransmitters that increase the blood pressure and promote retention of water by the kidneys to increase blood volume. This occurs in response to a loss of perfusion and can be helpful for short-term problems, like acute blood loss, or harmful in the case of heart failure. Neurotransmitter: Chemical messengers in the body that stimulate a nerve.
