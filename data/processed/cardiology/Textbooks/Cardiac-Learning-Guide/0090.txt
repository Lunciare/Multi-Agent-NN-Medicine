DIAGNOSTICS

biventricular pacemaker), which is an implantable device that uses electrical impulses to aid both ventricles in contracting at the same time. Other patients with very low ejection fractions may require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which can help the heart recover from life-threatening arrhythmias.62 For patients experiencing the most severe heart failure symptoms (NYHA class IV and ACC/AHA stage D), a left-ventricular assist device (or LVAD) may be used to support cardiac function. An LVAD increases the output of blood from the heart using a pump implanted into the wall of the left ventricle.62,72 Although the pump itself is implanted in the chest, a wire runs out of the device and through the skin to connect the LVAD to batteries and the control unit.58,62 Finally, in the most critical cases, patients who are otherwise in good health and can tolerate the major surgery may undergo a cardiac transplant.62 Only about 3,000 people receive heart transplants in the US each year.73 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 40 SECTION 4: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.
