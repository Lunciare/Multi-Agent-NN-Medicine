example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg indicates that the blood vessels have a pressure of 120 mmHg during ventricular systole and 80 mmHg at the end of ventricular diastole. It is important that blood pressure not be too high or too low. Hypertension, the medical term for blood pressure that is too high, can damage organs and tissues of the body over time because of the high pressures. Correspondingly, hypotension, or blood pressure that is too low, will not create enough pressure to allow oxygen to be exchanged into organs and tissues. This can deprive the cells of oxygen needed for basic function and can lead to organ and tissue damage. UNDERSTANDING EJECTION FRACTION The last concept that is important to understand about the heart is ejection fraction. When a person is resting, only about 60 percent (normal range approximately 50-70 percent) of the blood that was in the ventricle at the end of diastole is pumped out (so the ventricle is never completely emptied). The percentage of blood pumped out during systole is called the ejection fraction. The actual number or percentage of ejection fraction can change as a result of physical activity or other demands on
