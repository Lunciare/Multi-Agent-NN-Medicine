10-year risk of less than 7.5 percent) on lifestyle interventions to reduce future risk of CVD.111 The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend repeating assessment for ASCVD risk every four to six years in asymptomatic individuals.111 European Guidelines A joint guideline on the prevention of cardiovascular disease was issued in 2016 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in conjunction with 10 other groups. These guidelines do not recommend a risk stratification tool for asymptomatic individuals known to be at high or very high risk for CVD events, such as patients with diabetes who are over 40 years of age or individuals with specific high-risk characteristics such as familial hypercholesterolemia.114 Instead, these patients should automatically be offered treatment to prevent CVD and the associated complications.114 For other individuals over the age of 40, the European guidelines recommend the use of the SCORE tool, which estimates the 10-year risk of a fatal cardiovascular event.114 The SCORE tool uses age, gender, smoking status, cholesterol, and blood pressure to assess overall risk. However, like the US guidelines, the European guidelines suggest that other factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk for CVD, particularly for individuals at a moderate 10-year risk for events.
