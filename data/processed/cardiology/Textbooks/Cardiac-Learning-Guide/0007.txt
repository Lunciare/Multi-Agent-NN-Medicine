DIAGNOSTICS

SA node has begun, it travels through both atria, stimulating the muscle to contract (or beat). After stimulating the atria, the electrical impulse then travels to the atrioventricular node (AV node), down along a band of fibers (called the bundle of His) to the right and left bundles in the right and left ventricles, respectively. The electrical impulse then spreads to the walls of both ventricles through pathways called Purkinje fibers and triggers the ventricles to contract (or beat). These electrical impulses that stimulate contraction of the atrium and ventricles are what produce the rhythmic, coordinated pumping action of the heart. In turn, this pumping action generates the stroke volume which is felt as the pulse—the regular beat that can be monitored in the arteries throughout the body. Although the heart creates its own electrical impulses, outside activity from nerves and hormones can influence how often and strongly the heart muscle contracts. For example, when a person experiences a sudden fright, the heart may beat much faster and more powerfully than normal. In this situation, the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal glands release a hormone called norepinephrine. Norepinephrine changes how the heart responds to electrical stimulation resulting in an
