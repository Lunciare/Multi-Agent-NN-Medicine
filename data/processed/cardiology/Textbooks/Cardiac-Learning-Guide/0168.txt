DIAGNOSTICS

the lungs, caused by either a bacterium or a virus. Prognostic: Predicting the likelihood of something. Pulmonary embolism: A potentially life-threatening event caused by a substance (usually a blood clot) that travels through the veins, then gets wedged into a branch of the pulmonary artery and creates a blockage. Pulmonary hypertension: A life-threatening disease that causes high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs and the right side of the heart. Pulmonary veins: The veins that bring oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart. Purkinje fibers: Fibers in the heart that conduct electrical impulses to the left and right ventricle, to stimulate the heart to beat. Q Quantitative: Measuring the quantity of something; in the laboratory setting, quantitative measures provide an exact number describing the concentration of a substance (this is in contrast to a qualitative measure, which tells only if a substance is present or not). LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 71 R Remodeling: In the heart, the process of structural changes to the cardiac tissue as a result of heart failure, tissue injury, or other factors. Renal: See “kidney.” Renal Failure: See “kidney failure.” Reperfusion: Restoring blood flow to a tissue or organ. Retention: Holding on to
