DIAGNOSTICS

aspects of heart failure provides essential information on the status and prognosis of an individual patient. However, the usefulness of various biomarkers differs according to the clinical scenario. MARKERS OF MYOCARDIAL STRETCH/PRESSURE AND NEUROHORMONAL ACTIVATION Natriuretic Peptides As discussed in Section 4, the natriuretic peptides (NPs), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), play a central role in heart failure. BNP is a hormone released by the cardiac myocytes when they are under strain, and NT-proBNP is an inactive fragment cleaved from the BNP molecule.66 These NPs are released when the ventricles, particularly the left ventricle, experience volume and pressure overload and when neurohormonal activation occurs in response to heart failure.66 The NPs have shown benefit in almost every aspect of heart failure care. In the hospital setting, NPs can assist in distinguishing the cause of acute shortness of breath and determine prognostic information during the admission and after discharge.52,56,67 They can be used as a screening tool in the outpatient setting to rule out heart failure or identify patients in need of early intervention to prevent heart failure.52,56 They also provide prognostic information for patients with chronic heart failure.67 This section will describe NPs in more
