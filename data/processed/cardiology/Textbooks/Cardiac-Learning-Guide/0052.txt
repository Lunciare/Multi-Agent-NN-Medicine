DIAGNOSTICS

expanded on this point by requiring both men and women individually attain measurable concentrations, with at least 50% measurable concentrations above the assay’s LoD148 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 27 Multiple high-sensitivity assays exist for troponin I, and one fifth-generation assay for troponin T is available. When compared directly, both types of troponin assays provide similar sensitivity and specificity for the biomarker requirement for MI.27 The hsTnI assay may provide greater sensitivity for detecting acute MI in patients who present to the ED shortly after the onset of symptoms.27 Both assays also provide prognostic information and have demonstrated the ability to predict mortality risk in ACS patients. It should also be noted that there appear to be differences in troponin values based on age and sex, although this variation may depend on the assay used.28 A study comparing women and men presenting with suspected ACS evaluated diagnostic thresholds using a hsTnI assay; researchers found that when using hsTnI, a sex-specific threshold for MI diagnosis doubled the diagnosis of MI in female participants.26 Employing sex-specific thresholds also aided in identifying women at high risk for complications and death after MI.26 HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN ASSAYS IN PRACTICE: “RULE OUT” AND “RULE IN” The hsTn assays
