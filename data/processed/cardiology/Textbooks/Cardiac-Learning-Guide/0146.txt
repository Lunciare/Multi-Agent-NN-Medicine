generally healthy population.144 However, clinical trials evaluating folic acid and B-vitamins for decreasing homocysteine concentrations did not demonstrate any decrease in CVD risk. Finally, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an enzyme linked to inflammation and instability in atherosclerotic plaques. Multiple studies have found an association between increasing Lp-PLA2 concentrations and increased risk of cardiac events.145 But similar to homocysteine, clinical trials of specifics drugs for lowering Lp-PLA2 did not reduce the risk of CVD. Whether any of these markers provides an advantage over currently used prognostic tools has not been determined. Biomarkers in Clinical Practice Biomarkers for cardiovascular disease are continuously evolving, and although the roles for certain biomarkers, such as NPs and cardiac troponins, are well defined in specific aspects of cardiac care, the roles for many newer biomarkers are still being determined. One area that needs further clarification is how best to incorporate biomarker information into traditional risk stratification tools. Another area that requires more study is whether using a panel of biomarkers is better than measuring one or two individual markers. Theoretically, a panel may be a more useful approach because it includes markers for multiple pathways affected by CVD, but the value of this type of
