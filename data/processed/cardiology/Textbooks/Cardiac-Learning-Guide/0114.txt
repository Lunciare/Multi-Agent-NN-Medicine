atrial NP. It may be useful for diagnosing acute heart failure in patients presenting to the emergency departments with dyspnea.110 Moreover, in preliminary studies, it has shown some effectiveness in predicting long-term risk of death after an episode of acute heart failure.110 How MR-proANP may fit into the care of patients with acute heart failure remains to be determined. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 49 GUIDELINES FOR BIOMARKERS The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends using the NPs as a method for screening patients with symptoms of heart failure. The screening cutoff point for ruling out stable, chronic heart failure in symptomatic individuals is a BNP < 35 pg/mL or an NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mL.52 For any patient with concentrations measuring above these cutoff points, ESC recommends echocardiography for a definitive diagnosis.52 The ESC Guidelines do not make any specific recommendations about other biomarkers for heart failure due to lack of conclusive evidence of benefit.52 Table 5-2.
