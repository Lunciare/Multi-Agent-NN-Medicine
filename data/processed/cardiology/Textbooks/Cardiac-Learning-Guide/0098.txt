negative predictive value (NPV) for AHF—if the NP value is not elevated, heart failure can usually be ruled out, and unnecessary heart failure treatment, such as diuretics (which could harm the kidneys if given to a patient who is not experiencing AHF), can be avoided.56,75 This is also true for patients who present with shortness of breath in the outpatient setting; many of the signs and symptoms of heart failure are non-specific and can easily be attributable to other causes (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Hence, a BNP or NT-proBNP measurement is a simple method to either exclude heart failure or identify patients who require more diagnostic testing to determine if heart failure is present (Figure 5-2).52,56 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 44 Figure 5-2.
