distinguishing a STEMI from other types of MI. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 13 Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction The second type of ACS, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or NSTEMI, also has serious consequences for the heart. An NSTEMI is also a type of MI but is much more common than STEMI. Although estimates vary, approximately 75 percent of patients presenting with MI are diagnosed with NSTEMI, and this is associated with an 18 percent chance of death in the first 30 days after the event.3 As the name implies, in an NSTEMI, the ECG does not have the characteristic ST elevation seen with STEMI. However, an NSTEMI shares many other similarities with a STEMI. An NSTEMI occurs when an obstruction occurs in the coronary artery that prevents adequate amounts of blood and oxygen to flow to the tissues, and with time, this results in tissue necrosis (tissue death).6,7 Many things can cause this obstruction, but, similar to a STEMI, the most common cause is plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation in a coronary artery. Other less common causes include vasospasm of the coronary artery or an excessive accumulation of plaque inside the coronary artery that almost completely occludes blood flow. Regardless of the cause,
