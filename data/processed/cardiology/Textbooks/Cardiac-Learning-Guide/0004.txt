largest and strongest of the four chambers of the heart, pumps the oxygen-rich blood through the aortic valve and out into a very large vessel called the aorta. From the aorta, blood travels into smaller arteries, then into arterioles, and finally capillaries of the organs and tissues of the body. It is here that oxygen is removed from the blood and carbon dioxide, a waste product from cells, replaces it. Finally, the blood that is now oxygen poor moves from the capillaries into venules, then into veins, and back into the superior or inferior vena cava to repeat the process. THE CARDIAC TISSUE For the heart to maintain this continuous pumping process, it also requires a large amount of oxygen. The heart is made up of a unique type of muscle tissue that is not found anywhere else in the body. This specialized muscle tissue of the heart is referred to as the myocardium. The cells that make up the myocardium are called cardiac myocytes. These myocytes are almost entirely dependent on aerobic metabolism, meaning they require oxygen to function normally and depend upon an oxygen-binding protein known as myoglobin.
