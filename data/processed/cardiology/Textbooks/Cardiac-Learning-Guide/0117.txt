recommendation for use reasonable to use other clinically (may be reasonable to use) with available tests (e .g ., biomarkers of a moderate quality of evidence fibrosis or myocardial injury) for from non-randomized trials* additional risk stratification May be reasonable In individuals at risk of developing HF, screening with an NP biomarker followed by a Moderate recommendation for team-based intervention (which use (reasonable to use) with a PREVENTION includes cardiovascular specialist moderate quality of evidence care and optimization of GDMT) from non-randomized trials* is reasonable to prevent Is reasonable new-onset HF or the development of left ventricular dysfunction NP – natriuretic peptide; HF – heart failure; AHF – acute heart failure; GDMT – guideline-directed medical therapy *Randomized trials are preferred (and provide better evidence) over non-randomized trials LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 51 SECTION 5: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1. L ist one patient factor that can decrease measured levels of NP: _____________________________________________ . List five non-cardiac factors that can increase NP levels: _________________________________________ , _________________________________________ , __________________________________________ , __________________________________________ , and _____________________________________________ . 2. Match the biomarker with the aspect of heart failure that it evaluates. a. Marker for myocardial stress or injury b. Marker for neurohormonal activation c. Marker for cardiac remodeling
