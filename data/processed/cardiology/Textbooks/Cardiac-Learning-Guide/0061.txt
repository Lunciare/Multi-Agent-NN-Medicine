as part of a rule-out algorithm.23 The European guidelines also emphasize that hsTn is a quantitative measure, so the higher the number, the greater the likelihood of myocardial necrosis.23 For example, a hsTn more than five-fold over the upper reference limit has a positive predictive value for a type 1 MI of over 90 percent, whereas elevations less than three-fold over the upper reference limit have a positive predictive value of only 50-60 percent. Importantly, these guidelines also highlight the benefit of developing new algorithms for the management of patients with ACS around the hsTn test that allow for the rapid assessment of patients presenting to the ED with ACS symptoms and the appropriate use of the hsTn test.23 Similarly, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom also recommends the use of hsTn as part of an early rule-out protocol for NSTEMI. According to the NICE recommendations, hsTn should be measured at presentation and repeated three hours later; if NSTEMI is not ruled out in this protocol, further evaluation is recommended.39 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 30 OTHER CARDIAC BIOMARKERS Although troponin is central in the determination of myocardial necrosis, a variety of other markers have
