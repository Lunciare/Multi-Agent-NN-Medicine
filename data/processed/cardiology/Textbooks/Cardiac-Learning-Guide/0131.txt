DIAGNOSTICS

in men and women used data from a multi-ethnic US cohort of individuals without cardiovascular disease. Researchers found that after monitoring participants for approximately 10 years, all tools overestimated risk of CVD in men, but the Reynolds score was the most accurately calibrated tool in this group.121 Notably, most of the tools also overestimated risk in women, except the Reynolds score, which underestimated risk. The Framingham general CVD was the best-calibrated tool for women in this study.121 As discussed previously, over and underestimation of risk have potentially serious consequences, so refining currently available tools to improve predictive accuracy for CVD is critical for appropriate patient care. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 57 CONSIDERATIONS FOR BIOMARKERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK STRATIFICATION To overcome the limitations presented by traditional scoring tools, researchers have begun focusing on circulating biomarkers as useful alternatives for assessing CVD risk. They comprise an easy, non-invasive test that may identify CVD risk more accurately than traditional risk-stratification tools alone. A number of biomarkers have demonstrated value in predicting CVD risk, and several have shown particular promise when used in conjunction with these traditional scoring tools. This portion of the guide will focus on specific considerations for using biomarkers in CVD
