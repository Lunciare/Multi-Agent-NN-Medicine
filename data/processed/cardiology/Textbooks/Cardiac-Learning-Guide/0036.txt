DIAGNOSTICS

measurement three to six hours after the symptoms began.7 If high-sensitivity troponin is available, it is recommended that this test be repeated three hours after arrival in the emergency department for confirmation of a negative result.14 It is also necessary for the diagnosis of MI to document that the cardiac troponin is rising or falling, rather than maintaining the same concentration. Accordingly, the series of cardiac troponins is usually continued even if the first measure is already elevated. Cardiac biomarkers will be discussed in more detail in Section 3. 3 Physical Exam Findings On the initial physical exam, the clinician will determine if other, non-cardiac causes of chest pain need to be considered and will evaluate for signs of myocardial damage, such as heart failure symptoms.7 4 Risk Factors for ACS Many factors increase a patient’s risk for a cardiac event and need to be considered: older age, previous myocardial infarction, family history of heart disease, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, physical inactivity, and diabetes.7,10 5 Risk Assessment Tools Clinicians will often use a risk prediction score such as the TIMI risk score, the GRACE score, or the HEART risk score. These tools not only assist in predicting an MI but
