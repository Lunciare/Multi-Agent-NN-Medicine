DIAGNOSTICS

a test that assesses electrical changes in the heart. If a STEMI is identified on an ECG, it indicates that an obstruction has occurred in one of the coronary arteries preventing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the cardiac tissue.6,7 This obstruction is usually caused by the rupture of plaque in the coronary artery. Plaque is a substance that can accumulate inside the coronary artery and is made up primarily of cholesterol, fat, and calcium. If plaque in a coronary artery ruptures, it triggers platelet activation and adhesion as well as the initiation of the clotting cascade that results in the production of fibrin. These events can lead to the formation of a clot or thrombus inside the coronary artery that completely blocks the flow of blood. As a result of this thrombus, the tissues and myocytes that the artery normally supplies blood to are deprived of oxygen. With time, the oxygen deprivation leads to the death of the myocytes and permanent damage to the myocardium resulting in a scar. When a STEMI is identified on an ECG, immediate intervention is required to reopen the blocked coronary artery (the term reperfusion is often used to describe reopening the artery). Reperfusion
