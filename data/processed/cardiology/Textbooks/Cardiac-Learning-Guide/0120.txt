from cardiovascular disease, whereas in low-risk patients, it allows clinicians to avoid unnecessary investigation and treatment. If patients are not accurately risk stratified, patients who are truly high risk (but classified incorrectly as low or moderate risk) may not receive the needed preventative treatment. Likewise, patients who are low risk (but mistakenly classified as higher risk) will be exposed to treatments and tests that may be costly and may have serious adverse effects without experiencing a significant benefit. CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH 27% 73% ALL OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH Figure 6-1. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death worldwide in 2015146 GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES American Guidelines The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published guidelines in 2013 on the prevention of CVD. These guidelines focus on stratifying asymptomatic individuals based on their risk of experiencing a CVD event related to atherosclerosis in the next 10 years.111 An atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) scoring tool is recommended to provide an estimated 10-year risk for an ASCVD event and also an estimate of lifetime risk for an ASCVD event.111 The ASCVD tool calculates risk using sex, race, cholesterol concentrations, smoking status, blood pressure, and several aspects
