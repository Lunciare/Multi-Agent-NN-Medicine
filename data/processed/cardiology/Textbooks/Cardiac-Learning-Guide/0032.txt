Process of care for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS)7,11,23 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 18 ACS Symptoms Any person experiencing symptoms of ACS should be evaluated immediately by a healthcare provider. Chest pain, sometimes radiating down the left arm, is probably the most widely recognized symptom. But many patients, especially women and the elderly, may experience other symptoms like chest pressure, nausea, sweating, jaw or back pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or light-headedness.10 STEMI The first step in the assessment of a patient with ACS symptoms is to perform an ECG (Figure 2-4). An ECG will be used to determine if the patient is experiencing a STEMI. The characteristic ST elevation on ECG, in conjunction with ACS symptoms and elevated cardiac biomarkers, are diagnostic for STEMI, but treatment should never be delayed waiting for biomarker results once STEMI has been identified on ECG.6,11 A STEMI is most often a type 1 MI, and patients need immediate reperfusion therapy to open
