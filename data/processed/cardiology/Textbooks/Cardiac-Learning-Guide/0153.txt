DIAGNOSTICS

arterial blood pressure): The measure of pressure inside the arteries that is created by the force and rate of the heart beating and the elasticity of the arteries. Blood vessel: A general term used to describe the tubes that carry blood through the body: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Bundle of His: Part of the cardiac electrical conduction system, it transmits electrical signals from the atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles. C C-statistic test: A statistical test used to evaluate the discrimination capability of a particular test (e.g., the ability to differentiate between individuals who will and will not develop a disease). Calcium: A chemical element that is very abundant in the body. Calcium is used to build bones and contract skeletal and cardiac muscle; it is needed for blood to clot normally. Calibration (or calibrated): In statistics, how well a prediction aligns with the observed results. Capillaries: The smallest blood vessels; they allow nutrients, oxygen, and carbon dioxide to be exchanged between cells and the blood. Carbon dioxide: A gas which is a waste product of cell energy production. Cardiac catheterization: See “angiography.” Cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab): The department within a facility (often a hospital) where angiography procedures are
