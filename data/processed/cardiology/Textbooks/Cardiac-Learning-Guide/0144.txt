identification of risk in the general population, NT-proBNP elevation correlated with an increased cardiovascular mortality and mortality from any cause.141 Moreover, there is also data to support that NPs are useful predictors of outcomes over long periods; BNP concentrations were strongly correlated with risk of CVD-related death in a cohort of middle-aged men followed for an average of 15 years.142 Importantly, the STOP-HF trial (as discussed in Section 5) evaluated interventions to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in individuals with risk factors for heart failure. In the intervention group (the group that experienced the experimental care) of this trial, a BNP concentration over 50 pg/mL was used as a screening cutoff; patients with measurements above this received preventative interventions designed to reduce the risk for heart failure.81 The participants that received the preventative interventions had lower rates of heart failure than the patients in the control group (the group that received normal care) at the end of the trial.81 This trial highlights the real-world value of BNP as a biomarker for prevention. Patients were screened using BNP and received intervention if they were high-risk according to the biomarker; this intervention, in turn, resulted in improved patient outcomes
