or two individual markers. Theoretically, a panel may be a more useful approach because it includes markers for multiple pathways affected by CVD, but the value of this type of assessment is unclear in the clinical setting. Likewise, a third area that requires study is how incorporating biomarkers into risk assessment for CVD influences clinical outcomes in patients. Even with these unresolved questions, biomarker use in cardiovascular diseases will likely continue to evolve, ideally providing clinicians with better tools for caring for their patients. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 62 SECTION 6: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1. Which of the following may be useful for determining an asymptomatic patient’s risk for future CVD events? a. SCORE risk assessment tool b. A biomarker measurement, such as hsCRP or hsTnI c. Assessing other risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of CVD events d. All of the above are useful considerations 2. T he ACC/AHA guidelines recommend against the use of biomarkers to assess an asymptomatic patient’s risk for future CVD events. n n True False 3. To demonstrate clinical usefulness, a biomarker needs to show all of the following EXCEPT... a. Net reclassification improvement b. Adherence to ACC/AHA guidelines c. Discrimination capability
