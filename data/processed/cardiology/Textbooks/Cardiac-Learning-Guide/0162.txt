DIAGNOSTICS

increased risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke in a generally healthy population, but its usefulness as a screening tool is uncertain. Hormone: A “messenger” substance produced by the body that is released into body fluids to stimulate the activity of a different tissue or organ. Hydralazine: A medication used for blood pressure that has also shown benefit in certain heart failure patients, particularly those of African descent, when used in combination with another medication (a long-acting nitrate). Hyperlipidemia: The medical term for higher-than-normal cholesterol concentrations in the blood. Hypertension: The medical term for high blood pressure that indicates that the pressure inside the arteries is higher than normal. Hypotension: The medical term for low blood pressure that indicates that the pressure inside the arteries is too low and may not be adequate for perfusion of oxygen into the tissues. I Ischemia: A scenario where tissues are not receiving enough oxygen. Immunoassay: A test that measures the presence or concentrations of proteins (often antibodies) in a fluid (usually blood). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: An implantable device that can detect abnormal, dangerous cardiac rhythms and can send a small, electrical shock to the heart to return it to a normal rhythm.
