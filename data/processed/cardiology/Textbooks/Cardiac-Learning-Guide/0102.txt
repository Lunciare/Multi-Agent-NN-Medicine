DIAGNOSTICS

even decrease to almost normal concentrations if the patient is free of symptoms.75 Although NPs don’t appear to be as elevated in patients with HFpEF compared to patients with HFrEF, they are still recommended as general screening tools for heart failure and are an essential component in establishing a diagnosis of HFpEF.52,56 The ESC guidelines use the cutoff of BNP concentration over 35 pg/mL or an NT-proBNP concentration over 125 pg/mL for meeting the biomarker criteria for HFpEF.52 Both of these cutpoints are well within the normal range of NPs for both tests and hence this recommendation should be viewed circumspectly. It should be noted that NP levels will be elevated in acute heart failure (AHF) regardless of whether the underlying mechanism is HFpEF or HFrEF.75 Interpretation of Natriuretic Peptide Results As with other diagnostic tests, natriuretic peptide measurements should always be one of many considerations for clinicians during the evaluation of a patient with possible heart failure. The test itself may result in very elevated NP concentrations that strongly correlate to heart failure (BNP > 500 pg/mL or NT-proBNP > 2000 pg/mL), concentrations in the “gray-zone” indicating it could be heart failure or could be another problem (BNP 100–500
