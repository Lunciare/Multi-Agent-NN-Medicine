DIAGNOSTICS

Half-life: In the body, the time it takes for the concentration of a substance to decrease by half (e.g., a half-life of 20 hours would mean it takes 20 hours for a drug’s concentration in the body to drop from 10 ng/mL to 5 ng/mL). Heart: The organ in the body responsible for pumping blood to other body organs and tissues. Heart failure: A condition in which a problem with the ventricles is preventing the heart from pumping correctly; it is the result of a complex mechanical and neurohumoral syndrome resulting in stasis (or slow movement) of blood in the lungs and peripheral tissues. HEART score: A scoring tool used to risk stratify a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Hemoglobin: The protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hemolysis: Rupture or breaking apart of red blood cells; this rupture of red blood cells can occur in a specimen collection tube (during or after removing the blood from the body) and can affect the accuracy of certain laboratory tests. Heparin: A medication that interferes with the clotting cascade used to thin the blood; it is used in many clinical scenarios, including myocardial infarction.
