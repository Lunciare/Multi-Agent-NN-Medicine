the time after myocardial infarction. Older and current generation troponin assays cannot detect troponin increases as quickly as the high-sensitivity troponin assays LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 29 NINOPORT CAIDRAC FO LEVEL HnTn Assays: Effects on Patient Care The high-sensitivity tests overcome the problem of prolonged diagnostic time for MI that can delay treatment. They can also dramatically shorten patient evaluation time in the ED and have demonstrated that they can reduce overall healthcare costs.37 Furthermore, they avoid the predicament of potentially missing an MI with a lesser degree of troponin elevation. However, with this increase in sensitivity, there is a loss of specificity. Clinicians need to be aware that there may be more troponin elevations reported with the new assays that are not related to ACS, and as indicated above, these cases will be in the majority. More than ever, troponins are only one piece to consider in the comprehensive evaluation of the patient. Despite these concerns, when used appropriately, these high- sensitivity tests have the potential to dramatically change how patients with ACS symptoms are managed, saving lives and money. IMPLEMENTING HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN TESTING When introducing hsTn testing to an institution, a variety of factors need to be considered. A
