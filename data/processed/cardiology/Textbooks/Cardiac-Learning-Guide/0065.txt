ST2. The GDF15 protein is one of the transforming growth factor-ß cytokines. In studies, it has shown some usefulness in predicting future cardiovascular disease events and mortality.42,46 Likewise, ST2, an FDA approved biomarker for ventricular strain in patients with heart failure, appears to provide additional prognostic information regarding mortality and complications after an ACS event.42,46 Whether either GDF15 or ST2 provide additional prognostic information over currently used biomarkers remains to be determined. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 31 SECTION 3: REVIEW QUESTIONS 1. C K-MB and troponin should always be used together to detect the presence of myocardial necrosis. n n True False 2. W hich of the following statements accurately reflects the definition for rising or falling troponin concentrations using hsTn assays in an MI? a. A rise or fall indicative of cardiac necrosis is a 25 percent or more change from the initial elevated value b. T here is no consensus on the exact amount or percentage of rise or fall required for troponin changes using hsTn assays to meet criteria for MI c. The IFCC states that a rise or fall in cardiac troponin over six hours of 50 percent of more is diagnostic for MI d. All of
