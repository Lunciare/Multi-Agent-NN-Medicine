are activated in the cardiac tissue.63,68 These cells are involved in the remodeling of cardiac muscle that occurs in heart failure. Consequently, galectin-3 appears to be a good marker for the presence of cardiac remodeling and the development of cardiac fibrosis. In clinical studies, galectin-3 has demonstrated usefulness as a prognostic indicator and as a screening tool for assessing readmission risk after a heart failure hospitalization.69,70 Section 5 will discuss galectin-3 in more detail. Troponin High-sensitivity troponin assays have an emerging role in heart failure and may provide useful prognostic information about the heart failure risk for patients experiencing an MI. Elevations in high-sensitivity troponin I concentrations in patients with suspected ACS strongly correlate with risk of future hospitalization for heart failure.71 High-sensitivity troponin assays will be discussed in more detail in Section 5. HEART FAILURE TREATMENT Early identification, treatment of underlying causes, and control of risk factors are all essential first steps in the management of heart failure. Once those areas are addressed, patients should be counseled on lifestyle interventions such as eating a low-sodium diet, limiting fluid intake to a prescribed amount, weighing themselves daily, engaging in light aerobic exercise, understanding the need for follow-up appointments with their
