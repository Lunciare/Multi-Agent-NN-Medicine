DIAGNOSTICS

noted above, accurate CVD risk stratification allows for early intervention to prevent adverse events in the case of moderate and high-risk patients, and it avoids unnecessary investigation and treatment in individuals with low risk.114 The ASCVD scoring tool from ACC/AHA and the SCORE tool have already been mentioned briefly, but a variety of other tools have been used to quantify the risk of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals. This guide will discuss four commonly employed CVD risk assessment tools. • ASCVD from ACC/AHA • SCORE • Framingham General CVD Risk Tool • Reynolds Risk Score The ASCVD Tool The ASCVD scoring tool was developed by the ACC/AHA workgroup during the development of the risk assessment guidelines published in 2013. The workgroup’s goal was to create a tool that was representative of the population in the US, including data on African American, white, female, and male cohorts, which also provided relevant information about the risk for a first ASCVD event.111 The group defined an ASCVD event as the first nonfatal stroke, first nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac heart disease-related death.111 The ASCVD tool is designed to be used in patients 40 to 79 years of age who do not have cardiovascular
