that it will still be the most common cause of death worldwide in 2030.5 DEFINING ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a general name for a group of conditions that indicate that the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen. This situation is termed myocardial ischemia. There are three subcategories of ACS: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA). Diagnosis of ACS SYMPTOMS AT LEAST 2/3 OF THESE MUST BE ABNORMAL FOR ACS BIOMARKERS ECG/EKG (Always done first, if STEMI changes on ECG/EKG, STEMI management protocol initiated) ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction An ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is often the most severe form of ACS, and it is a type of myocardial infarction (MI). It is estimated that STEMI accounts for about 25 percent of all MI, but it carries a high risk of mortality with 10 percent of patients dying in the first 30 days after the event.3 In a STEMI, characteristic changes occur on an electrocardiogram (ECG or sometimes referred to as EKG), a test that assesses electrical changes in the heart. If a STEMI is identified on an ECG, it indicates that an obstruction has occurred in one of the coronary arteries
