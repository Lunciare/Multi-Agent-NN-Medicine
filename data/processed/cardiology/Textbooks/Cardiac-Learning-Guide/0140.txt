DIAGNOSTICS

over traditional scoring tools and traditional risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol).133-34 Despite this, hsCRP was cited in the ACC/ AHA guidelines as possibly helpful if the benefit of treatment is uncertain after traditional risk assessment with the ASCVD scoring tool.111 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 60 High-Sensitivity Troponin Unlike hsCRP, high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) T and I are biomarker assays that are very specific to the cardiac muscle.149 Although they have demonstrated usefulness in acute coronary syndromes and heart failure, they also have recently established their value as prognostic indicators in the general, apparently-healthy population. In this context, the concentration of hsTn may be a reflection of the health of the myocardium. A long-term study of over 3,000 men with elevated cholesterol but no history of myocardial infarction, WOSCOPS, monitored participants for over five years and also assigned some participants to treatment with a statin.135 Researchers measured hsTn at study entry and one year later; the change (rise or fall) in hsTn over that one-year period was strongly correlated with future risk of coronary disease, regardless of a change in cholesterol concentrations.135 It was noted that treatment with the statin appeared to lower hsTn concentrations at the one-year measurement, which
