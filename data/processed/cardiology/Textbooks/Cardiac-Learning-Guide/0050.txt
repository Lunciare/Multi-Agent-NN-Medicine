troponin tests in clinical practice. The need to overcome these limitations led to the development of more sensitive and precise troponin assays. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 26 HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN ASSAYS Due to the shortcomings of conventional troponin measurements, high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) assays have been developed. The hsTn assays have been used for several years outside the US. These assays are 10 to 100-fold more sensitive than the conventional troponin assays and can detect the very low levels of troponin that circulate in healthy individuals (Figure 3-2).28 Though troponin was once thought only to enter the circulation when myocytes had been damaged, we now know that it can be found in normal individuals. The reasons for this have yet to be fully elucidated, but myocyte turnover and increased cell permeability have been suggested as mechanisms.29,30 99th Percentile PATIENTS WITH NORMAL LEVELS CARDIAC DAMAGE DUE TO NON-AMI CAUSES PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS HIGH-SENSITIVITY TROPONIN ASSAY 4th gen troponin assay 1st-3rd gen troponin LEVEL OF CARDIAC TROPONIN Figure 3-2. The sensitivity of high-sensitivity troponin assays allows for measurement of troponin in normal healthy individuals, whereas earlier generation assays were only sensitive enough to detect troponin elevation resulting from significant necrosis in MI, or occasionally,
