DIAGNOSTICS

often use a risk prediction score such as the TIMI risk score, the GRACE score, or the HEART risk score. These tools not only assist in predicting an MI but they also help identify patients in need of urgent intervention with PCI and can estimate risk for death.7 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 20 NSTEMI An NSTEMI is diagnosed when rising or falling cardiac biomarkers exceed the upper reference limit and the antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin, and anticoagulant medications, such as heparin or enoxaparin, to prevent further extension of the thrombus.7 However, thrombolytics are not used in NSTEMI. In addition to treatment with medication, patients with NSTEMI usually undergo a coronary angiography (cardiac catheterization) procedure to examine the coronary arteries.7 An angiography procedure, similar to what is done for STEMI, involves inserting a catheter into a large artery (in the groin or wrist) and threading it up to the heart. Once in the heart, a dye is released that will flow into the coronary arteries, and the physician will use an x-ray device to evaluate the flow of blood through the coronary arteries.12 As the dye flows through, it will opacify the coronary arteries and display their branches like the branches
