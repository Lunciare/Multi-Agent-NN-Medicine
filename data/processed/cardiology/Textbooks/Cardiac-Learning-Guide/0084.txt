DIAGNOSTICS

normal ECG.52 Second, it may identify the etiology of the patient’s heart failure, such as a previous MI.52 And third, it may detect a coexisting problem such as atrial fibrillation (inappropriate, rapid beating of the atria) that requires treatment.52 Importantly, in the setting of heart failure, there are electrical conduction disturbances that can lead to heart block (which is a lack of coordination of contraction of the ventricles). For example, in HFrEF, patients can experience several types of electrical conduction disturbances, such as right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, or interventricular conduction delay; patients with these abnormalities may benefit from an implanted cardiac Figure 4-3. The electrocardiogram can be resynchronization device (discussed later in this section).52 a useful tool in several circumstances Echocardiogram Echocardiography, or ultrasound of the heart, is an essential tool in the diagnosis of heart failure (the test itself is called an echocardiogram, often referred to as an echo). An echocardiogram provides information on the function of the heart muscle during relaxation and contraction, the size of the ventricular walls and the interior chamber, the performance of the valves, and the pressures in various parts of the heart.52 The echocardiogram also measures ejection fraction and
