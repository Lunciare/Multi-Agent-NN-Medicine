DIAGNOSTICS

of MI (Types 4 and 5) that are very uncommon and are not included in this table . Criteria for myocardial injury The term myocardial injury should be used when there is evidence of elevated cardiac troponin values (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit URL) . The myocardial injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values . Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are components of the contractile apparatus of myocardial cells and are expressed almost exclusively in the heart . Increases in cTnI values have not been reported to occur following injury to non-cardiac tissues . The situation is more complex for cTnT . Biochemical data indicate that injured skeletal muscle expresses proteins that are detected by the cTnT assay, leading to some situations where elevations of cTnT could emanate from skeletal muscle . cent data suggest that the frequency of such elevations in the absence of ischaemic heart disease may be higher than originally thought . cTnI and cTnT are the preferred biomarkers for the evaluation of myocardial injury, and high-sensitivity (hs)-cTn assays are recommended for routine clinical use . Other biomarkers, e .g
