ventricle. Artery: Blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the organs and tissues. ASCVD scoring tool: A scoring tool used to assess risk for future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in the general population of individuals without known cardiovascular disease. Aspirin: An antiplatelet medication used to prevent blood from clotting; it is often used in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarction. Atherosclerosis: The buildup of plaque inside the arteries. Atrial fibrillation: An abnormal heart rhythm where the atria beat inappropriately fast; this sometimes also results in the ventricles beating too fast. Atrioventricular node (AV node): Part of the cardiac electrical conduction system, it receives impulses from the sinoatrial (SA) node and transmits them to the ventricles, stimulating the ventricles to beat. Atrium (plural: Atria): The two upper chambers of the heart; they receive blood from the vena cava and the pulmonary vein and move it into the ventricles. Autoimmune disease: A disease characterized by the body’s immune system producing antibodies that attack its own tissue. Automaticity: The heart tissue’s ability to generate its own electrical impulses to stimulate contraction. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 65 B B-natriuretic peptide (BNP): A protein released by the ventricles of the heart when
