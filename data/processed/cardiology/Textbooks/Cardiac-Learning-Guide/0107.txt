DIAGNOSTICS

also a useful marker to measure at discharge after a heart failure hospitalization, as it provides prognostic data on the likelihood of readmission within 60 days.70 Importantly, galectin-3 has also shown particular promise in providing prognostic information in patients with HFpEF, which is an area where other biomarkers are less helpful.70,93 LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 47 A key characteristic of galectin-3 is that concentrations appear to increase before heart failure manifests. As a result, it may be a useful screening tool for patients who are at risk for heart failure but have not developed it yet.94 And it has demonstrated effectiveness for screening in a general population. In the PREVEND study, galectin-3 concentrations were strongly correlated with cardiovascular risk in the general population and also predicted all-cause mortality (death from any cause) in this same group.95 Furthermore, in another study, serial measurements of galectin-3 in the general population also demonstrated the ability to identify individuals at high risk for a new onset of heart failure.96 Notably, in the PREVEND study, researchers found that women and older individuals had higher galectin-3 levels than men and younger individuals.95 Hemolysis in the specimen, presence of rheumatoid factor, or anti-mouse antibodies can also contribute to
