diagnosis) Prognosis in Acute and Chronic Heart Failure Another critical role for NPs in clinical practice is in providing prognostic information. For patients with AHF admitted to the hospital, high concentrations of NP upon admission are associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality (for both cardiac causes and all causes).56 In addition, measurement of BNP at discharge is useful for prediction of readmission within 30 and 60 days.70 Readmission for heart failure shortly after discharge is often considered a preventable hospitalization, and it is a target of hospital and government quality improvement initiatives.76 Consequently, identifying patients at high risk for this outcome is essential to improving quality of heart failure patient care.76 It is also well established that NP measurements can provide prognostic information in the outpatient setting. Increasing NP concentrations are associated with an increased mortality risk in ambulatory patients with heart failure.58 NPs may also offer information about the changing status of heart failure within a patient and have been used to guide changes and adjustments to medication therapy; however, this is controversial, and due to conflicting evidence without a proven benefit in heart failure patient outcomes, guidelines do not recommend monitoring NP levels to guide therapy.56,58,77 Identifying
