function. If an obstruction develops in any of the coronary arteries blocking the flow of blood, the myocytes that are supplied by the obstructed artery will experience distress, and there will be insufficient oxygen and nutrients flowing to that region of heart tissue. Electrical Activity in the Heart Cardiac muscle tissue has another distinctive quality. Unlike other types of muscle that require stimulation by a nerve or hormone to contract, the myocytes of the myocardium stimulate their own contraction. This self-stimulation is referred to as automaticity, and it means that the heart can stimulate its own muscle contraction without any input from the body. LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 7 Figure 1-2. Major arteries that supply blood to the myocardium LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY The electrical impulses that cause the heart muscle to contract, or beat, in a regular fashion originate in the sinoatrial node (SA node) which is located in the wall of the right atrium. Once the electrical activity in the SA node has begun, it travels through both atria, stimulating the muscle to contract (or beat). After stimulating the atria, the electrical impulse then travels to the atrioventricular node (AV
