LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 15 CLASSIFICATION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS For initial treatment stratification by emergency medicine providers and cardiologists, an MI is classified as a STEMI or NSTEMI. However, there are additional classifications for MI that further explain the mechanism leading to the ischemia. It is essential for providers to understand the cause of an MI to treat it appropriately. Type 1: The Spontaneous MI The most common type of MI is a spontaneous, or type 1, MI (Figure 2-2).6 It is caused by rupture of plaque in a coronary artery. This rupture triggers the activation and aggregation of platelets, the initiation of the coagulation cascade to produce fibrin, and ultimately the formation of a thrombus which causes complete or partial occlusion of the artery. Plaque can accumulate inside any artery in the
