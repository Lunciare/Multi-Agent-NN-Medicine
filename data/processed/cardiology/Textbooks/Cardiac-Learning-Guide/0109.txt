do not demonstrate the rapid rise seen over several hours in ACS.98 As such, cardiac troponins have demonstrated promise in providing additional prognostic information when measured in patients with heart failure and those at risk. In patients presenting with ACS symptoms, hsTnI measurements over the upper reference limit may be useful predictors of heart failure hospitalizations during the 12 months after presentation.71 Moreover, a recent study evaluated the combination of NT-proBNP and hsTnI for predicting heart failure in a population of individuals with risk factors. All study participants had at least one risk factor for heart failure, but normal left ventricular ejection fraction (approximately 50 percent or more); research found that the combination of the two biomarkers were better predictors of a heart failure hospitalization than either marker alone over a long period.100 Another trial found that using a panel of biomarkers (that included hsTnI) in combination with a risk assessment model was more effective in predicting future heart failure risk in patients with coronary artery disease than the risk assessment model alone.101 The hsTn assays have also shown usefulness as prognostic tools in patients hospitalized for AHF; elevated hsTnI on admission has been associated with worsening heart failure during
