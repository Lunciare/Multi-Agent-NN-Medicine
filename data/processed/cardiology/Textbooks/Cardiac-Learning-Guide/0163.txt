cardioverter-defibrillator: An implantable device that can detect abnormal, dangerous cardiac rhythms and can send a small, electrical shock to the heart to return it to a normal rhythm. Ischemia modified albumin: An FDA-approved, circulating biomarker for identifying myocardial infarction. J K Kidneys: The organs of the body that create urine, remove waste from the blood, and regulate fluid balance. Kidney failure (or renal failure): Impairment of normal kidney function; there is a spectrum of impairment that occurs, ranging from mild to chronic, irreversible impairment (known as end-stage renal disease). L Left-ventricular assist device (LVAD): An implantable device, using a pump implanted into the wall of the left ventricle, which is used in patients with end-stage heart failure to support cardiac function. The pump itself is implanted in the chest, but a wire runs out of the device and through the skin to connect the LVAD to the external batteries and control unit. Lesion: In the coronary arteries, another name for an area inside the artery with plaque buildup. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2): An enzyme linked to inflammation and instability in atherosclerotic plaques; it has been studied as a possible biomarker for screening asymptomatic populations for cardiovascular disease. Low-sodium diet: A
