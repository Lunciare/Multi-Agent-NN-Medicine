to understand in more detail how the heart works. The heart is divided into two sides, right and left (Figure 1-1). The right side of the heart is further divided into a smaller, upper chamber called the right atrium and a lower, larger chamber called the right ventricle. Similarly, the left side is also divided into a smaller left atrium above and a larger left ventricle below.

The four chambers of the heart and the major blood vessels that distribute and collect blood from other parts of the body LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 6 BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE HEART AND BODY Next, we must understand how blood circulates through the heart and body (Figure 1-1). Blood returning from the body arrives in the heart through two large veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. This blood is oxygen-poor, meaning it contains a lower concentration of oxygen and carries a large amount of carbon dioxide produced by body tissues. From the vena cava, the oxygen-poor blood flows into the right atrium, then
