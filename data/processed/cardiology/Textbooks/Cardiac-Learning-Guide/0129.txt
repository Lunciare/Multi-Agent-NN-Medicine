not incorporated into the score, such as lifestyle factors and family history of CVD (Table 6-1).117 Reynolds Risk Score The Reynolds risk score is another tool designed to predict the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in healthy individuals without diabetes.118 Unlike the previously discussed tools, the Reynolds score incorporates a family history of CVD and the biomarker hsCRP into the risk calculation.118-19 Smoking status, age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol measurements are also included in the score.118-19 The Reynolds score was created with information from two US-based cohorts, the Women’s Health Study and the Physicians Health Study-II.118-19 An online calculator is available at One of the significant limitations of the Reynolds score is that the cohorts it is modeled from are mostly comprised of white participants within a relatively specific socioeconomic range.118-19 And although the Reynolds tool includes biomarker information and family history, other lifestyle factors are not incorporated into the risk score (Table 6-1).118-19 Limitations of Scoring Tools Although an array of risk assessment tools are available for predicting CVD, there are significant limitations to using these tools alone for determining an individual’s risk of developing CVD. First, many of the risk factors evaluated in these scoring tools are
