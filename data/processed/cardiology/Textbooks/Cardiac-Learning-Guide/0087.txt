hormone released by the cardiac myocytes when they are under strain, and NT-proBNP is an inactive fragment cleaved from the BNP molecule.66 These NPs are released when the ventricles, particularly the left ventricle, experience volume and pressure overload and when neurohormonal activation occurs in response to heart failure.66 Measuring NPs have shown benefit in almost every aspect of heart failure care. In the hospital setting, NPs can assist in distinguishing the cause of acute shortness of breath, determine prognostic information about mortality risk in AHF, and, when measured at discharge, can identify long-term prognosis after an AHF admission.52,56,67 They can also be used as a screening tool in the outpatient setting to rule out heart failure or identify patients in need of early intervention to prevent heart failure.52,56 Finally, they can provide long-term prognostic information for patients with chronic heart failure.67 Section 5 will discuss the NPs in more detail. Galectin-3 Galectin-3 is another biomarker that increases with worsening heart failure. Galectin-3 concentrations appear to increase when fibroblasts and macrophages are activated in the cardiac tissue.63,68 These cells are involved in the remodeling of cardiac muscle that occurs in heart failure. Consequently, galectin-3 appears to be a good marker for
