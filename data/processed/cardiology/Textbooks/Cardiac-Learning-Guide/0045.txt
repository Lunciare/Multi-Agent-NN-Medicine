99th percentile of a healthy reference population.17 The performance target for these conventional assays is to measure troponins with a 10 percent coefficient of variation at the 99th percentile of their reference population, but not all currently available assays achieve this.17 With conventional assays, troponin I or T can be measured in the blood six to 12 hours after the onset of ACS symptoms.7,15 After an MI, troponins will typically remain elevated for four to ten days.7,15 The normal half-life for troponin in the plasma is about two hours, and it is at least partially removed by the kidneys.15 To meet the biomarker criteria for MI, not only must at least one troponin measurement be over the 99th percentile of the reference range but the troponin measurement must also be rising or falling in what is considered a characteristic pattern for MI.7 The amount of rise or fall is not defined in the global consensus document, Third Universal Definition of MI, which requires the individual clinician to interpret the pattern of serial troponin values over time. A more specific definition is included in the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) guidelines; this document describes
