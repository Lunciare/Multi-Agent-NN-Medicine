ECG testing) are most likely better than those relying on self-reported information for identifying a biomarker’s true normal range.122 However, because there is no standard in how manufacturers or researchers determine the normal range for a biomarker, there is significant variation between studies in how this process occurs and how the normal range is defined.122 This variation is of particular importance for high-sensitivity tests like troponin, where the accuracy of the 99th percentile measure may be impacting therapy decisions. Although there have been calls to make more specific determinations about defining a normal population, there remains significant variation in these practices, so it is up to the individual clinician to evaluate how normal values were obtained in various studies.122 Table 6-2 outlines one expert opinion on the best method for “coning,” or selecting, participants for a normal reference population to define the 99th percentile value for cardiac troponin.122 Table 6-2.
