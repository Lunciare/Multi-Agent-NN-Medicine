DIAGNOSTICS

three hours after presentation, this number rises to over 99 percent, and accordingly, a repeat measurement of hsTn is recommended in all patients three to six hours after presentation.32 The ability to rule out an MI more quickly shortens the ED admission time for many patients, overcoming one of the primary limitations of conventional troponin assays (Figure 3-3). Rule In The other key advantage of hsTn assays is the ability to detect an acute MI very early before conventional tests would be positive.23,27 Using conventional assays, there is a “troponin-blind” period during the first hours after the onset of MI when troponin concentrations are still reported as negative.23 The hsTn assays significantly shorten this “troponin-blind” period, so patients experiencing an MI are more likely to have measurable troponin elevations when they first present to the ED.23 Studies where hsTn have been measured at presentation and then repeated one-hour later have shown promise in improving early “rule-in” as well as “rule-out”.33 Moreover, this increase in sensitivity reduces the risk of missing an MI with less troponin elevation completely.23 This can be a significant problem in women, and, predictably, the use of hsTn assays have demonstrated the ability to increase the diagnosis
