and several have shown particular promise when used in conjunction with these traditional scoring tools. This portion of the guide will focus on specific considerations for using biomarkers in CVD risk assessment, discuss a number of biomarkers with data to support their use for CVD risk stratification, and briefly review several emerging biomarkers for CVD risk prediction. Considerations for Biomarkers: Defining Normal One difficulty in the assessment of CVD risk in an asymptomatic population is determining what the normal range for a biomarker should be. There is a great deal of variability in the way normal subjects are selected for determining normal ranges of clinical laboratory measures; some are screened using a simple method like a health questionnaire whereas others are subjected to more detailed assessments such as a physical examination by a clinician, electrocardiogram testing, or measurement of other surrogate biomarkers.122 Resulting normal values can be quite variable given the variation in the selection process for normal subjects. Methods that determine if subjects are truly healthy (with biomarkers or ECG testing) are most likely better than those relying on self-reported information for identifying a biomarker’s true normal range.122 However, because there is no standard in how manufacturers or researchers
