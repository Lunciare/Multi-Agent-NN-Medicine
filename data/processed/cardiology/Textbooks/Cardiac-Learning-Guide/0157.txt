arteries. Contraction: Tension that occurs in the muscle fibers in response to a stimulus. Creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB): An older circulating biomarker that was previously used to identify myocardial necrosis, related to myocardial infarction. D Degradation: Breaking down into parts. Delta: A change or difference between two numbers measuring the same thing. Diabetes: A disease characterized by either the inability to make insulin or resistance to insulin that results in elevated concentrations of glucose (a basic form of sugar) in the body. Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart disease. Diastole: The relaxation phase of the heart pumping cycle that results in relaxation of the heart muscle, allowing the heart chambers to fill with blood. Digoxin: A medication used to treat symptoms of heart failure or control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation.
