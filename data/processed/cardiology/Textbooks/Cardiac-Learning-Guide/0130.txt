DIAGNOSTICS

CVD, there are significant limitations to using these tools alone for determining an individual’s risk of developing CVD. First, many of the risk factors evaluated in these scoring tools are not specific to cardiac disease; elevations in blood pressure, for example, increase the risk of other problems, such as stroke. A second limitation is that many of these tools have not been externally validated (which means tested to determine if they are still accurate in other patient sample groups), and most have also not been compared head-to-head to provide clinicians with information about which tool has the best risk prediction capability.120 Third, all scoring tools are based on a limited number of factors influencing CVD risk; because of this, an individual tool will not completely and accurately assess risk for all patients.120 Finally, when these scoring tools have been compared and studied for external validation, their accuracy appears to be mixed. A study comparing the ASCVD tool, several Framingham risk scores (including the general CVD tool), and the Reynolds score in men and women used data from a multi-ethnic US cohort of individuals without cardiovascular disease. Researchers found that after monitoring participants for approximately 10 years, all tools overestimated risk
