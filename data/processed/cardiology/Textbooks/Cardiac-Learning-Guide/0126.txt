DIAGNOSTICS

other cohort risk calculators, such as the Framingham risk assessment tool, used data from cohorts living in the US rather than Europe; it was unclear if this appropriately predicted risk in non-American populations due to cultural and ethnic differences.114 The SCORE tool was developed using data from 12 cohort studies in Europe that included 250,000 patients.114 The SCORE tool is designed to predict the 10-year risk of a fatal CVD event in individuals 40 to 65 years of age.114 Although the tool itself does not incorporate this, the European guidelines suggest that overall risk for fatal plus non-fatal CVD events is approximately three times the risk calculated for fatal events.114 It is important to note that the SCORE tool separates Europe into high- and low-risk countries, reflecting different CVD risk profiles in different regions. These charts can be accessed at EACPR/Documents/score-charts.pdf. The SCORE tool has limitations similar to those found with ASCVD. Although it is specific to European populations, it may have less predictive capability for individuals in minority ethnic groups.114 Like the ASCVD tool, it does not incorporate other known risk factors for CVD, as outlined in Table 6-1.114 Table 6-1.
