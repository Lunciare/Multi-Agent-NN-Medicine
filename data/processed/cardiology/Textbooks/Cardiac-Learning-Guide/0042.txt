DIAGNOSTICS

prognostic evaluation of patients with ACS. TROPONIN Troponin is an abundant protein contained in the cardiac myocytes. It works inside the cell as part of the contractile mechanism to facilitate myocyte contraction. The troponin complex in a cardiac myocyte has three subunits, troponins C, T, and I (Figure 3-1).15 Both skeletal and cardiac muscle synthesize troponin C, but troponin T and I are highly specific to cardiac muscle. Together, troponin T and I are considered the cardiac troponins. In the appropriate clinical setting, if significant elevations of these troponins are detected in the blood, and they are determined to be rising or falling, they are a useful tool for confirming cardiac necrosis.15 Notably, most healthy individuals have small but measurable concentrations of troponin in the bloodstream in a normal physiologic state possibly as a result of cell turnover (the normal life and death cycle of a cell).15 However, at these low concentrations, only high-sensitivity assays can detect it.15 TnI TnC TnT ACTIN TROPOMYOSIN Figure 3-1. The troponin complex Although the troponin protein was initially identified in 1965, the first assay for measuring troponin I in the serum was not developed until 1987.16 An assay for troponin T followed in 1989.16
