DIAGNOSTICS

open.12 The PCI procedure rapidly restores blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. If PCI is unavailable, a physician will usually prescribe a thrombolytic drug for a patient experiencing a STEMI. A thrombolytic promotes degradation of the fibrin in the thrombus, to quickly lyse the clot in the coronary artery.13 I a V R V 1 V 4 II a V L V 2 V 5 III a V F V 3 V 6 II Figure 2-4. Example of a 12-lead ECG LEARNING GUIDE: CARDIAC 19 Next Steps Although STEMI is the first type of ACS to be screened for and diagnosed, the majority of MIs are not STEMI. It is estimated that approximately 75 percent of MIs are NSTEMI, and further testing is needed to establish this diagnosis (Figure 2-3).3,11 After the ECG is performed within 10 minutes of presentation and determined not to be a STEMI, cardiologists and emergency medicine providers will consider five different aspects of the patient’s clinical status to further stratify the risk for MI and guide the next steps in treatment. 1 ECG Changes After an initial ECG that is normal or non-diagnostic, current guidelines recommend that the ECG should be repeated several times during
