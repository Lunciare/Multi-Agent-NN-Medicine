different facets of heart failure. This section will discuss five that have demonstrated promise in heart failure management. Although researchers have identified these biomarkers as potentially useful in this population, none of these markers are currently used in routine clinical practice. Whether these emerging biomarkers provide additional clinical information beyond what can be gained from NPs and other established biomarkers remains to be determined. Soluble ST2 Soluble ST2, or suppression of tumorigenicity 2, is a biomarker in the interleukin-1 receptor family that denotes biomechanical strain, myocardial stress, and fibrosis.106 As such, it has been investigated as a marker for remodeling in heart failure. Unlike the NPs, ST2 concentrations do not appear to be influenced by age, gender, kidney function, or obesity.106 In preliminary studies, measuring ST2 has shown usefulness in predicting the risk of death after an episode of acute heart failure.106 In addition, because it changes quickly, ST2 may eventually prove useful in providing clinical information for guiding heart failure therapies in the hospital setting when serial measurements are used.106 For patients with chronic heart failure, it appears to predict the risk of death or cardiac transplantation, but whether this test provides any additional information over prognostic information available
