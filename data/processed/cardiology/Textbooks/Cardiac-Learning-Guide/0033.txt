be delayed waiting for biomarker results once STEMI has been identified on ECG.6,11 A STEMI is most often a type 1 MI, and patients need immediate reperfusion therapy to open the occluded coronary artery and prevent further myocardial damage from occurring. The preferred treatment for a STEMI is a primary PCI performed as soon as possible after hospital arrival. For the PCI procedure, the patient is promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory (or cath lab). First, a specialized catheter is threaded through a large artery (either the femoral artery in the groin or the radial artery in the wrist) up into the heart. Next, the physician will use a dye to evaluate the blood flow through the coronary arteries (this is called an angiogram) and identify the exact area of occlusion. Finally, the blocked coronary artery is opened by inflating a tiny balloon-like device in the blocked region, and then a stent (or mesh wire tube) may be placed in the area of the blockage to prop the artery open.12 The PCI procedure rapidly restores blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. If PCI is unavailable, a physician will usually prescribe a thrombolytic drug for a patient experiencing a STEMI.
