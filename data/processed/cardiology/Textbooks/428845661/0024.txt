the position paper of the ESC Working Group on Adult Congenital Heart Disease and the Section of Sports Cardiology promote at least minimal physical activity for all ACHD patients, including those with stable HF.35 If the type and intensity of exercise are aligned with the haemodynamic and electrophysiological status of the patient, it is assumed that exercising can be done in a safe manner. A group from Rotterdam followed up a cohort of ACHD patients for 10 years and concluded that a required minimum of exercise is not related to impaired outcome.36 Moreover, the risk of sudden death during exercise is low for the overall ACHD population. Sudden cardiac events are very rare, occurring in only 10% of patients, during exercise.37 Obviously, when new symptoms occur, patients need to be re-evaluated, and the individualized exercise prescription adapted accordingly.35 Management of acute heart failure Approximately 7% of all hospital admissions of patients with ACHD are related to HF.38 With an ageing population, it is expected that this number will increase further over time. Van De Bruaene et al. have proposed treatment algorithms for acute subaortic and acute subpulmonary ventricular failure.34 Both algorithms distinguish between the presence and absence of shunt lesions.
