to treat HF might have adverse effects, with progressive deterioration of the clinical status of the patient. The reason for this phenomenon is that ACHD patients are a highly heterogenous population, with failure of not only a systemic left ventricle (LV), but also of a systemic subpulmonary right ventricle (RV) or a single ventricle, with or without persistent left-to-right or right-to-left shunting. It is obvious that standard drug therapy could cause adverse effects. Today all therapeutic suggestions are based on expert opinion (level of evidence C).5 Even use of resynchronization therapy, the criteria for, and timing of, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation, and timing of (combined) transplantation are unexplored in larger ACHD series. The relatively low number of ACHD patients per expert centre and the high heterogeneity of the ACHD HF population make it almost impossible to set up randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a view to ameliorate the level of evidence from C to A. This chapter provides an overview of the complexity of ACHD HF patients and proposes some treatment recommendations. These recommendations must be appreciated on top of existing guidelines. In addition, emphasis is put on the clear need for further studies, preferably RCTs. Figure 3.6.1 Congenital
