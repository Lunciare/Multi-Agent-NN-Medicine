The more complex the CHD, the more the treating physician has to be aware of adverse effects of the interventions used. In-depth knowledge of the underlying disease is of utmost importance, and if lacking, a referral to, or at least advice from, an expert centre is required. In addition to drugs, device therapy and transplantation can both still offer alternative, albeit temporary, treatment solutions. Unfortunately, for some patients who end up on a palliative trajectory, end-of- life care management should be offered. Many aspects discussed in this chapter are based on small studies and expert opinion. Large multicentre trials are warranted to answer the remaining questions. Key messages ◆ The number of ACHD patients is increasing. ◆ HF is one of the most common complications and has a direct impact on life expectancy and quality of life. ◆ Medical treatment of HF in ACHD patients is not supported by clinical evidence. ◆ Early recognition of HF and a personalized approach are crucial. ◆ Heart transplantation and assist device treatment should be considered in a timely manner. ◆ Increased focus on advanced
