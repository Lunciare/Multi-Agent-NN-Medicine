Heart failure - Cardiology Explained

the cause of acute shortness of breath can often be difficult to diagnose, and the chest may reveal nothing but coarse breath sounds throughout. In this situation, two factors are helpful: the JVP and overt sympathetic overactivation (cold peripheries and profuse sweating). Investigations Electrocardiography The electrocardiogram of a patient with heart failure often shows LV hypertrophy (LVH). This may show a "strain" pattern (LVH plus ST depression), most commonly in the lateral chest leads. Arrhythmias are also common in heart failure. Chest x-ray Classic signs on CXRs are common only for acute heart failure. Typically, some of the following signs are seen (see Figure 3): Figure 3 (a) Classic signs of acute heart failure that can be seen on a chest x-ray of left ventricular failure.

Echocardiography This is the investigation of choice and can identify and quantify LVH and dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) as well as examine causes of heart failure, such as valve abnormalities. 2/9 Blood
