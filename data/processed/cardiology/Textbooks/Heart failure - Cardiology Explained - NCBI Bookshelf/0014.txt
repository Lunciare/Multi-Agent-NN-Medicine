Heart failure - Cardiology Explained

the efficacy of digoxin in reducing mortality (although it has been shown to reduce hospital admissions). Figure 7 + + Mechanism of action of digoxin. Digoxin inhibits Na /K + ATPase. As a consequence of an increased intercellular Na concentration, Ca2+ extrusion (via Na+/Ca2+ exchange) is reduced. The result is an increase in cellular Ca2+. Hydralazine and nitrates The vasodilator combination of hydralazine (up to 300 mg) and nitrates (160 mg isosorbide dinitrate) has been tested with digoxin and diuretics in several large trials and has been associated with mortality reductions in heart failure. However, the advent of ARBs is likely to offer a better alternative to ACEIs than this drug combination. Future directions Areas of controversy still exist in the management of CHF. For example, aspirin is known to be effective as an aid to secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. However, it can reduce the efficacy of ACEIs. Also, despite the high rate of heart failure deaths due to arrhythmia (50%), amiodarone is the only antiarrhythmic (so far) that has been shown to reduce mortality. New agents currently being investigated in trials include: 6/9 2+ calcium sensitizers (increase contractile response to intracellular Ca ) endothelin antagonists (there are
