In a situation where cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnea coexist, exercise testing with gas analysis can be particularly useful in discerning which is the greater problem. Treatment The first step in the management of CHF is patient education. It is easy for physicians to forget (since they use the term every day) that, to most patients, heart "failure" sounds significantly worse than "myocardial infarction", "heart attack", or even "cardiac arrest". Educating patients about their condition – by giving them information about avoiding excessive salt intake and teaching them how to use their daily weight to monitor fluid balance – will pay dividends in long-term management. Historical Hearts Hippocrates believed that the left side of the heart and its associated arteries were conduits for air rather than blood. Galen (AD 138–201) thought that blood passed through invisible pores in the ventricular septum. Such was his influence on Roman medical thinking that this idea remained in place until the 15th century when an embargo on the dissection of human 4/9 cadavers was lifted
