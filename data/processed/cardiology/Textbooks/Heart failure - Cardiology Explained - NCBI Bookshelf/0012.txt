Heart failure - Cardiology Explained

in the community only as a last resort, for short periods, and be accompanied by daily electrolyte checks. Defining Hearts Pulmonary edema was first explained by Henry Welch, who showed that it could be reproduced by obstructing the outflow of the left ventricle. However, the first definition of heart failure was provided by Theophile Bonet (1620–1689), who published clinico- pathological studies linking the effects of valvular disease and cardiac chamber size to the clinical features of dyspnea and edema. 5/9 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs were the first agents shown to reduce mortality in heart failure. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are currently reserved for those patients with an ACE cough. Guidelines for starting ACEIs are outlined in Table 6. Table 6 The recommended procedure for starting an angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Beta-blockers Much of the early work on β-blockers used carvedilol – a nonselective β-blocker, α-antagonist, and antioxidant. However, although its significant effect appeared to result from β-blockade resulting in many different β-blocking agents being used, recent trials have suggested there may be effects over and above that of β-blockade. Beneficial effects of β-blockade include a reduction in heart rate (which increases myocardial perfusion), regression of LVH (probably related to
