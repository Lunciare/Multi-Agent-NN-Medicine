Heart failure - Cardiology Explained

ascending aorta during diastole it encourages systemic perfusion by reducing impedance to ventricular ejection at the point of balloon deflation (it creates a negative pressure which helps to "suck" the blood out) Contraindications to IABP include severe aortic regurgitation and aortic dissection. Management: chronic heart failure The chronic form of heart failure is a condition that most generalists treat every day. When referring these patients, it is useful to classify the severity of heart failure. This is facilitated by a very simple scale: the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (see Table 3). It is straightforward and provides a common language that is understood by cardiologists worldwide. Table 3 The New York Heart Association functional classification of chronic heart failure. Diagnosis and assessment The initial diagnosis and assessment of the severity and progression of CHF can be made using echo and exercise testing with gas analysis. The most commonly used echo measure is the EF. This is rated as: 45%–70%, normal 35%–45%, mildly impaired 25%–35%, moderately impaired <25%, severely impaired <15%, end-stage/transplant candidates 5% is compatible with life, but not long life The single best exercise-testing measurement is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO 2 max).
