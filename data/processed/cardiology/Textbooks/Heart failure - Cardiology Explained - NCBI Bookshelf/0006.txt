managed by: sitting the patient up giving high-flow oxygen giving diamorphine (2.5–5 mg intravenous [IV]) giving nitrates (sublingual at first, then isosorbide mononitrate 2–10 mg/hour IV) giving loop diuretics (eg, furosemide [frusemide] 40–80 mg slow IV) Blood pressure is a key measurement and should be considered when deciding the rate of a nitrate infusion or whether to use β-agonists. If the systolic blood pressure drops below 100 mm Hg, consideration should be given to replacing the nitrate infusion with one containing dobutamine (2–10 μg/kg/min). Although the effect of an IV diuretic can often be dramatic (probably due to an early effect on pulmonary venous dilatation), nitrates are preferred because, in addition to decreasing preload, they also decrease peripheral resistance and do not reduce cardiac output. It is also important to take the precipitating factor into account. If, for example, a patient is in atrial fibrillation, slowing the ventricular rate may be more effective than a combination of more general measures. Similarly, if a patient has suffered an MI then thrombolysis or intervention may be the key to their recovery. Management: cardiogenic shock Cardiogenic shock, which has a 90% mortality rate, is the most severe form of acute heart failure. It
