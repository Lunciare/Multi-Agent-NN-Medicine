Heart failure - Cardiology Explained

the investigation of choice and can identify and quantify LVH and dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) as well as examine causes of heart failure, such as valve abnormalities. 2/9 Blood tests The measurement of natriuretic peptides for the diagnosis of heart failure is not yet routine. However, other blood tests can contribute to the clinical picture. The sodium concentration is often low (<130 mmol/L, despite high total body sodium) as a result of dilution and is a strong prognostic indicator. The potassium level is altered by many of the therapeutic agents and should be kept in the mid to high normal range (4.25–5 mmol/L) to minimize the risk of arrhythmia. If the pulse is of full volume, investigative blood tests for anemia and thyroid function should be carried out. If echo suggests restrictive cardiomyopathy, further tests can be carried out for iron storage disease, amyloidosis, or sarcoidosis. Management: acute heart failure The approach to the management of acute decompensation is different from that to CHF. Acute pulmonary edema should be managed by: sitting the patient up giving high-flow oxygen giving diamorphine (2.5–5 mg intravenous [IV]) giving nitrates (sublingual at first, then isosorbide mononitrate 2–10 mg/hour IV) giving loop diuretics (eg,
