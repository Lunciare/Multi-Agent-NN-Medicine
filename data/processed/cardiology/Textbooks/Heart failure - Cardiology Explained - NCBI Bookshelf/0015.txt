that has been shown to reduce mortality. New agents currently being investigated in trials include: 6/9 2+ calcium sensitizers (increase contractile response to intracellular Ca ) endothelin antagonists (there are increased levels of endothelin – a potent vasoconstrictor – in heart failure); results of all recent trials have been negative or neutral at best TNF-α antibodies; recent trials all produced negative results neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (neutral endopeptidase breaks down atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide – peptides with diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilator properties) Heart failure treatments, according to NYHA classification, are outlined in Table 7. Table 7 Treatment of heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of congestive heart failure. Nonpharmacotherapies Recent evidence suggests that individualized exercise training programs can be beneficial in stable, mild to moderate heart failure. Like most other aspects of the treatment of heart failure, today's advice (exercise) is the opposite of that from 30 years ago (bed rest). Early Treatments The first breakthrough in the treatment of heart failure was by William Withering (1741– 1799), who published observations of the therapeutic use of digitalis (foxglove). Ironically, he believed its main mechanism of action was diuretic. Until the discovery of
