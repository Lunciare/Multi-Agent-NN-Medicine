Specialist nurses who visit patients in the community can significantly reduce the rate of hospitalization by helping with exercise, symptom control, and fluid balance, and by alerting the medical team early to any potential deterioration. Palliative care The very poor prognosis associated with heart failure begs the question of the availability of hospice care and end-of-life support for this population.
