Cardiology

volume after ejection = end-systolic volume • Isovolumetric means that the ventricles contract or relax with no corresponding change in ventricular volume. There are periods during these phases when all valves are closed. Conversely, there is never a point in the cardiac cycle when all valves are open. Figure 1.7 – The Wiggers diagram, named after Dr Carl Wiggers who in 1915 described the events occurring during each cardiac cycle. 10 1.7 // heArt SoundS Table 1.2 – The cardiac cycle Ventricular diastole (relaxation) Isovolumetric Ventricular filling ventricular relaxation • Initiated by repolarisation (T wave of ECG) • AV valves open as ventricular pressure drops below • Ventricles relax, reducing ventricular pressure atrial pressure • AV valves remain closed as ventricular pressure • Aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed remains greater than atrial pressure • Most of the blood flows passively from atria to • Ventricular pressure drops below aortic and ventricles pulmonary pressure • Atria contract, actively pumping more blood into • Aortic and pulmonary valves close → 2nd heart the ventricles sound, S – “dub” • Maximally filled volume = end-diastolic volume 2 Ventricular systole (contraction) Isovolumetric Ventricular ejection ventricular contraction • Initiated by ventricular depolarisation (QRS •
