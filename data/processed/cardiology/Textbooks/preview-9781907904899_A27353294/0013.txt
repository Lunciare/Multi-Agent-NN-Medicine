to the neck and jaw. This is because radiation occurs to areas that send sensory impulses to the same level of the spinal cord that receives cardiac sensation. The sensory fibres from the heart travel up to T1-4, hence radiating to the medial left arm via dermatomes T1-4. Cardiac vagal afferent fibres synapse in the medulla and descend to the upper cervical spinothalamic tract cell, contributing to the pain felt in the neck and jaw. 1.6 The cardiac cycle The cardiac cycle In A Heartbeat Four phases: Ventricular diastole (relaxation) Isovolumetric Ventricular filling ventricular relaxation • Ventricles relax • AV valves open • Aortic & pulmonary valves close – • Atria contract, filling ventricles S “dub” • Maximally filled volume = end-diastolic volume 2 9 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM Ventricular systole (contraction) Isovolumetric Ventricular ejection ventricular contraction • Ventricles contract • Aortic & pulmonary valves open • AV valves close – S “lub” • Blood flows into aorta & pulmonary trunk 1 • Residual volume after ejection = end-systolic volume • Isovolumetric means that the ventricles contract or relax with no corresponding change in ventricular volume. There are periods during these phases when all
