KEYWORDS: heart, cardiac, right, left, coronary, volume, ventricular, blood, pressure, aortic, contraction, anterior, posterior, artery, pulmonary

cusps: anterior, right and left posterior anterior and left posterior aortic sinuses above the valve give rise to the right and left coronary arteries respectively. // PRO-TIP // • ‘Pectinate’ means ‘like a comb’ in Latin • The mitral valve gains its name from its resemblance to a bishop’s mitre • A patent foramen ovale is found in 20% of adults and is usually asymptomatic • Rupture of any papillary muscle, such as following a myocardial infarction, will cause the valve cusp to prolapse, resulting in severe regurgitation. 1.3 Coronary circulation Coronary circulation In A Heartbeat Right • Originates from anterior aortic sinus, runs along atrioventricular (AV) groove coronary • Major branches: sinoatrial nodal, posterior descending, AV nodal, artery marginal Left • Originates from left posterior aortic sinus coronary • Major branches: left anterior descending, left circumflex artery Coronary • Great, middle, small and oblique cardiac veins drain into the coronary veins sinus then into the right atrium 1.3.1 Coronary arteries The heart has a high oxygen demand from continuous pumping of blood. This demand is met by the left and right coronary arteries. 4 1.3 // CoronAry Cir CuLAtion Figure 1.4 – The coronary vessels. Right coronary artery •
