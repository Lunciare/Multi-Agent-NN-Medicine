interact with troponin C to initiate cross-bridge formation • When Ca2+ binds to troponin C, the actin binding site is exposed, allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament • Just as in skeletal muscle contraction, using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament towards the centre of the sarcomere. Relaxation • When the concentration of Ca2+ exceeds resting levels, ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps (Ca2+-ATPase) in the tubular part of the SR are activated and pump Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the SR • As the action potential (AP) repolarises and Ca2+ channels inactivate, this mechanism reduces Ca2+ towards resting levels, Ca2+ disassociates from troponin C and the muscle relaxes.
