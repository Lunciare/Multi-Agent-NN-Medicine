system of the heart. The sinoatrial (SA) node (the ‘pacemaker of the heart’) is situated at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. This is where the electrical cycle begins. 1. The SA node initiates contraction by depolarising both atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. 2. The atrial action potential activates the AV node which lies in the interatrial septum immediately above the opening of the coronary sinus. 3. The AV node introduces a delay of 0.1 seconds before relaying the impulse to the bundle of His. This delay allows the ventricles to fill. 4. Depolarisation then spreads through the bundle of His (which then divides into the left and right bundle branches) and Purkinje fibres to reach the ventricular muscle. 5. This activates the ventricles and causes them to contract. In a normal heart, the total time taken for the action potential to travel from the SA node to the end of the Purkinje fibres is about 0.22 seconds. A normal sinus rhythm is approximately 72 beats per min, which equates to 0.83 seconds for each cardiac cycle. 8 1.6 // the CArdiAC Cy CLe 1.5 Nerve supply of the
