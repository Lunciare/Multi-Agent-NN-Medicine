Cardiology

• Smaller but thicker wall than right atrium Left • 3× thicker wall than right ventricle (normal thickness 6–10 mm) ventricle • Lined by trabeculae carneae • Mitral valve: anterior and posterior cusps • Aortic valve: anterior, right and left posterior cusps The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles that function to return deoxygenated blood to the lungs and oxygenated blood to the rest of the circulation. Figure 1.2 – The internal anatomy of the heart. 1.2.1 Right atrium • Forms the entire right border • Receives venous blood from the: superior vena cava superiorly, draining the azygos, subclavian and jugular veins inferior vena cava inferiorly, draining the lower body coronary sinus inferiorly, draining the heart anterior cardiac veins anteriorly, draining the anterior heart 2 1.2 // ChAMberS of the heArt • Anterior part of wall is smooth • Posterior part of wall is rough with trabeculations known as musculi pectinati (pectinate muscles) derived from the true fetal atrium • Crista terminalis is a muscular ridge that runs vertically downwards, separating the smooth and rough parts • Right auricle/atrial appendage is a cone-shaped muscular pouch-like extension of the right atrium • Fossa ovalis is a shallow oval
