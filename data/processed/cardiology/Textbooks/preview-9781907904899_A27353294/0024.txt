vasoconstriction + water retention → ↑ BP 1.10.1 Definitions • Blood pressure is the pressure exerted by circulating blood against the vessel walls • It can be calculated using the formula: Blood pressure (BP) = Cardiac output (CO) × systemic vascular resistance (SVR) • The systolic pressure is the maximum pressure recorded during systole • The diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure recorded during diastole • The pulse pressure is the systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure can be examined when feeling a patient’s pulse at a normal blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, the pulse pressure is 40 mmHg a narrow or wide pulse pressure is pathological (refer to Chapter 2). 1.10.2 Regulation of blood pressure Blood pressure regulation is an important part of homeostasis to ensure adequate perfusion to all parts of the body and preserving organ function. Blood pressure is regulated by regulating cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. 16
