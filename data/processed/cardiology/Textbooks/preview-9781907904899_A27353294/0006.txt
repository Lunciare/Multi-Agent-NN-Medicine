pumping of blood. This demand is met by the left and right coronary arteries. 4 1.3 // CoronAry Cir CuLAtion Figure 1.4 – The coronary vessels. Right coronary artery • Originates from the anterior aortic sinus • Passes forwards between pulmonary trunk and right auricle • Runs along the atrioventricular (AV) groove • Continues to the inferior border of heart to anastamose with the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery • Major branches: sinoatrial (SA) nodal artery runs posteriorly between the right auricle and aorta, supplying the SA node marginal artery along the inferior border of the heart posterior descending/posterior interventricular artery descends in the posterior interventricular groove to anastamose with the left anterior descending artery at the apex AV nodal artery arises from the characteristic loop where the posterior descending artery originates to supply the AV node. 5 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM Left coronary artery • Originates from the left posterior aortic sinus • Larger than the right coronary artery • Left main stem varies in length (4–20 mm) known as the ‘widowmaker’ as occlusion leads to rapid death • Initially passes behind then to the left of the pulmonary trunk •
