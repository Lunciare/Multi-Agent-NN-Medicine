heart the ventricles sound, S – “dub” • Maximally filled volume = end-diastolic volume 2 Ventricular systole (contraction) Isovolumetric Ventricular ejection ventricular contraction • Initiated by ventricular depolarisation (QRS • AV valves remain closed preventing reflux of blood wave of ECG) into atria • Ventricles contract • As ventricular pressure exceeds pressures in arteries, • Ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure the aortic and pulmonary valves open • AV valves close → 1st heart sound, S – “lub” • Blood flows into aorta and pulmonary trunk 1 • Aortic & pulmonary valves remain closed • Residual volume after ejection = end-systolic volume 1.7 Heart sounds Heart sounds In A Heartbeat S “lub” S “dub” 1 2 • Closure of mitral & tricuspid valve • Closure of aortic & pulmonary valve • Loud: thin, hyperdynamic • Split sound (aortic before pulmonary) circulation • Loud: hypertension, hyperdynamic circulation • Soft: obesity, mitral regurgitation, • Soft: aortic stenosis mitral stenosis S S 3 4 • Reflects rapid ventricular filling • Reflects ventricular wall stiffness • Physiological in young and fit • Always pathological patients • In older patients: heart failure, volume overload 11 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM 1.7.1
