• Volume pumped by each ventricle per beat • End diastolic volume (EDV) – end systolic volume (ESV) Heart rate (HR) • 60–100 bpm normal, <60 bpm bradycardia, >100 bpm tachycardia • Sympathetic ↑ HR, parasympathetic ↓ HR Preload • Degree of wall stress at end-diastole • Frank–Starling mechanism: ↑ preload → ↑ cardiac output Afterload • Degree of wall stress during systole • Forces that oppose ejection of blood out of ventricles • ↑ afterload → ↓ cardiac output Contractility • Force of myocardial contraction 1.9.1 Definitions • The cardiac output is the volume of blood ejected by each ventricle per minute Cardiac output (CO) = Stroke volume (SV) × heart rate (HR) = Mean arterial pressure ÷ systemic vascular resistance • At rest, the average cardiac output is about 5 L/min • During exercise, this can exceed 25 L/min as the heart rate increases two to three times and stroke volume doubles. • The stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle per beat • It is about 75 ml in a normal heart and may double during exercise Stroke volume (SV) = End diastolic volume (EDV) – end systolic volume (ESV) • End
