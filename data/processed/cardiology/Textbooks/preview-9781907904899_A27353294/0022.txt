Cardiology

preload, afterload and contractility. Preload • The preload is the degree of heart muscle stretching (wall stress) at end-diastole (when the ventricle is completely relaxed) • The Frank–Starling law (Figure 1.9) dictates that the contraction of a cardiac muscle fibre is proportional to the initial length of the muscle fibre • Thus, the greater the stretch on the ventricle during diastole, the greater its force of contraction during systole Figure 1.9 – The Frank–Starling law of the heart. • This allows the heart to alter its force of contraction in response to changes in venous return (see Figure 1.10) • Impairment of this mechanism is involved in the development of heart failure (for further discussion, see Chapter 10). Figure 1.10 – An increase in venous return leads to a rise in cardiac output. Afterload • Afterload is the degree of heart muscle stretching (wall stress) during systole • It is inversely related to stroke volume • It is affected by the forces that oppose ejection of blood out of the ventricles • Factors increasing afterload include: raised aortic pressure aortic stenosis increased systemic vascular resistance such as during hypovolaemic shock ventricular dilatation • Factors decreasing afterload include: vasodilator drugs e.g.
