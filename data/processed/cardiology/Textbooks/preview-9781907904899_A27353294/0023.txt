Cardiology

ventricles • Factors increasing afterload include: raised aortic pressure aortic stenosis increased systemic vascular resistance such as during hypovolaemic shock ventricular dilatation • Factors decreasing afterload include: vasodilator drugs e.g. nitrates, calcium channel blockers (non-rate limiting) vasodilator metabolites in septic shock. 15 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM Contractility • The contractility of the heart is the force of myocardial contraction • The ejection fraction on echocardiography can be used as a measure of contractility • Factors increasing contractility include: increased preload (Frank–Starling mechanism) sympathetic stimulation raised extracellular calcium drugs e.g. inotropes, digoxin hormones e.g. catecholamines, thyroxine, growth hormone, glucagon • Factors decreasing contractility include: reduced preload (Frank-Starling mechanism) parasympathetic stimulation decreased extracellular calcium cardiac ischaemia hypoxia hypercapnia acidosis drugs e.g. beta-blockers, anaesthetics, antiarrhythmics. 1.10 Blood pressure Blood pressure In A Heartbeat • Blood pressure sensed by baroreceptors (carotid sinus, aortic arch) • Low BP → baroreceptor reflex → ↑ vasoconstriction, ↑ HR, ↑ contractility Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system: • renin → angiotensin I → angiotensin II → vasoconstriction + water retention → ↑ BP 1.10.1 Definitions • Blood pressure is the pressure exerted by circulating blood against the vessel walls • It can be calculated using the
