• Physiological in young and fit • Always pathological patients • In older patients: heart failure, volume overload 11 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM 1.7.1 S “lub” 1 • Reflects closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves • Loud in: thin patients, hyperdynamic circulation (e.g. pregnancy), mitral stenosis • Soft in: obesity, emphysema, pericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation or severe mitral stenosis • Best heard at the apex. 1.7.2 S “dub” 2 • Reflects closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves • Physiological splitting of the sound may occur during inspiration • Split into: Aortic before Pulmonary (A–P intervals) 2 2 • Because inspiration increases venous return → increases stroke volume → prolongs the right ventricular ejection period • Loud in: systemic hypertension, hyperdynamic circulation • Soft in aortic stenosis. 1.7.3 S “KENTUCKY: KEN = S , TUCK = S , Y = S ” 3 1 2 3 • Reflects rapid ventricular filling, when blood strikes a compliant left ventricle • Occurs in early diastole, just after S when the mitral valve opens 2 • May be physiological in young, fit patients or children • In older patients, may be due to heart failure or
