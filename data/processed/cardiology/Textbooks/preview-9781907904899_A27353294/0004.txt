base of the heart • Smaller, but thicker walled than right atrium 3 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM • Receives oxygenated blood from the four pulmonary veins which open into the cavity on its posterior wall (two from each lung: superior and inferior) • Left auricle/atrial appendage is an ear-shaped muscular pouch extending forwards and to the right this is a common site for thrombus formation • Mainly smooth-walled except for ridges in the auricle due to underlying pectinate muscles. 1.2.4 Left ventricle • Forms most of the left border and the apex of the heart • Longer, more conical and thicker walled than the right atrium (three times thicker, between 6 and 10 mm in a normal heart) • Wall is lined by thick trabeculae carneae • Joined to left atrium by mitral valve • Mitral valve has two cusps: anterior and posterior • Chordae tendinae connects each cusp to its corresponding papillary muscle • Communicates with aorta via the aortic valve: 3 semilunar cusps: anterior, right and left posterior anterior and left posterior aortic sinuses above the valve give rise to the right and left coronary arteries respectively. // PRO-TIP // • ‘Pectinate’
