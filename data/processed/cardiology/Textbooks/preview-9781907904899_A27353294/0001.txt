in a Heartbeat Chapter 1 Anatomy and Physiology of the Cardiovascular System by Luke Chan, with Mr Vipin Zamvar 1.1 Introduction The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the circulatory system. At a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, a human heart will contract approximately 100 800 times a day, more than 36 million times a year and nearly 3 billion times during an 80-year lifespan.
