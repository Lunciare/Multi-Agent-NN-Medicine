Cardiology

• It is about 75 ml in a normal heart and may double during exercise Stroke volume (SV) = End diastolic volume (EDV) – end systolic volume (ESV) • End diastolic volume (EDV) = maximum ventricular volume immediately before systole (~120 ml) • End systolic volume (ESV) = minimum ventricular volume (~40 ml) immediately before diastole. • The ejection fraction (EF) is the percentage (%) of blood ejected by the ventricle relative to its filled volume 1.9.2 Regulation of cardiac output Adequate cardiac output is important for ensuring that each organ receives its minimum required blood flow. The body regulates cardiac output by regulating heart rate and stroke volume. 14 1.9 // CArdiAC outPut Heart rate • A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm <60 bpm is bradycardia >100 bpm is tachycardia • This is affected by the heart’s intrinsic rhythmicity and extrinsic stimulation by the autonomic nervous system Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate Parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart rate. Stroke volume The stroke volume is affected by preload, afterload and contractility. Preload • The preload is the degree of heart muscle stretching (wall stress) at end-diastole (when the ventricle is completely relaxed) • The Frank–Starling law (Figure
