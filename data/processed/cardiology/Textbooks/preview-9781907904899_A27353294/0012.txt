Cardiology

normal sinus rhythm is approximately 72 beats per min, which equates to 0.83 seconds for each cardiac cycle. 8 1.6 // the CArdiAC Cy CLe 1.5 Nerve supply of the heart • While the conductive system of the heart has its proprietary intrinsic pacemaker, the autonomic nervous system is important in the rate of impulse formation, conduction and contraction strength • The heart’s nerve supply is derived from the vagus nerve (parasympathethic cardio- inhibitor) and the C1-T5 sympathetic ganglia (cardio-accelerator) via the superficial and deep cardiac plexuses • Many drugs used in cardiology target the receptors shown in Table 1.1 (e.g. beta-blockers). Table 1.1 – Actions of the autonomic nervous system on the heart Sympathetic stimulation via β-adrenoceptors Parasympathetic stimulation via M receptors 1 2 ↑ Heart rate ↓ Heart rate ↑ AV conduction ↓ AV conduction ↑ Contractility ↓ Contractility ↑ Excitability ↓ Excitability // Why? // Cardiac pain is not found exclusively in the chest but often radiates down the medial side of the left arm and up to the neck and jaw. This is because radiation occurs to areas that send sensory impulses to the same level of the spinal cord that receives cardiac sensation. The sensory
