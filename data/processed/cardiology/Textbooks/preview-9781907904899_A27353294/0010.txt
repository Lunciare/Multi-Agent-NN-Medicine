vena cava. Its orifice is guarded by the Thebesian valve. Its tributaries are: • the great cardiac vein in the anterior interventricular groove • the middle cardiac vein in the inferior interventricular groove • the small cardiac vein that accompanies the marginal artery along the inferior border of the heart • the oblique vein which descends obliquely on the posterior side of the left atrium. The remaining venous drainage is fulfilled by: • the anterior cardiac veins (3 or 4 of them) draining a large proportion of the anterior surface of the heart directly into the right atrium • small veins (venae cordis minimae) within each chamber wall draining directly into their respective chambers. 7 ChAPter 1 // AnAtoMy And PhySioLogy of the CArdioVASCuLAr SySteM 1.4 Conducting system of the heart Conducting system In A Heartbeat SA node depolarisation → atrial contraction → AV node activation (0.1 s delay) → bundle of His → left and right bundle branches → Purkinje fibres → ventricular contraction Figure 1.6 – The conducting system of the heart. The sinoatrial (SA) node (the ‘pacemaker of the heart’) is situated at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. This is where
