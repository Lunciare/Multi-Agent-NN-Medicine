In the ‘left dominant’ 10%, the left coronary and circumflex arteries may be larger and branch off the posterior descending artery before anastomosing with an unusually smaller right coronary artery. • The SA node is supplied by the right coronary in 60% and the left circumflex artery in nearly 40% of the population. Dual supply is present in 3%. • The AV node is supplied by the right coronary artery in 90% of the population, with the remaining 10% by the left circumflex. // PRO-TIP // • The coronary arteries originate from the aortic sinuses – small openings superior to the cusps of the aortic valve. This makes coronary arteries the first branches of the aorta • Coronary blood flow is about 250 ml/min at rest (5% of cardiac output) and rises to 1
