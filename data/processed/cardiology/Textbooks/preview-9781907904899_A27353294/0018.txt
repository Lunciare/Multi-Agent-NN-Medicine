Relaxation: Ca2+ is pumped from cytosol back into SR → Ca2+ levels drop → Ca2+ dissociate from troponin → relaxation 12 1.8 // CArdiAC MuSCL e ContrACtion Cardiac muscle cells are known as cardiac myocytes. Following depolarisation, calcium (Ca2+) enters the cell through L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the sarcolemma. This supplies only 20% of the Ca2+ required, insufficient for muscle contraction. The rest is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where Ca2+ is stored in high concentration in a calcium-induced calcium release process (see Figure 1.8) unique to cardiac muscle. The sequence of events is as follows: Initiation of contraction • Depolarisation causes Ca2+ to enter the myocyte via L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels • This causes a rise in Ca2+ concentration in the gap between sarcolemma and SR • This activates Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors) in the SR • Ca2+ floods into the cytoplasm down its concentration gradient. This releases a large amount of Ca2+, sufficient to initiate contraction. Contraction • Calcium ions in the sarcoplasm then interact with troponin C to initiate cross-bridge formation • When Ca2+ binds to troponin C, the actin binding site is exposed, allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin
