main stem varies in length (4–20 mm) known as the ‘widowmaker’ as occlusion leads to rapid death • Initially passes behind then to the left of the pulmonary trunk • Reaches the left part of the AV groove • Runs laterally around the left border as the left circumflex artery to reach the posterior interventricular groove • Major branches: left anterior descending (LAD)/anterior interventricular: – descends in the anterior interventricular groove to anastamose with the posterior descending artery at the apex left circumflex (LCX): – continues round the left side of the heart in the atrioventricular groove, giving off various ventricular and atrial branches – anastamoses with the terminal branches of the right coronary artery. // PRO-TIP // Knowledge of the major and minor branches of the coronary arteries is essential for coronary angiogram interpretation. Figure 1.5 is a schematic of the arteries as visualised in a typical coronary angiogram. RCA = right coronary LAD = left anterior descending RDP = posterior descending D1 = first diagonal branch of LAD RPL = right posterolateral branch M1 = first marginal branch of LCX LCX = left circumflex MO1 = first marginal obtuse branch of LCX Figure 1.5 – Schematic of coronary
