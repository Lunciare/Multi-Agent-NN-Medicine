just after S when the mitral valve opens 2 • May be physiological in young, fit patients or children • In older patients, may be due to heart failure or volume overload • Best heard at the apex. 1.7.4 S “TENNESSEE: TEN = S , NES = S , SEE = S ” 4 4 1 2 • Reflects surge of ventricular filling with atrial systole • Occurs in late diastole, immediately before S, when the atria contract to force blood into 1 a non-compliant left ventricle • Always pathological • Never present in atrial fibrillation (there is no atrial contraction) • Indicates increased ventricular stiffness or hypertrophy • E.g. hypertension, aortic stenosis, acute myocardial infarction (MI) • Like S, best heard at the apex. 3 1.8 Cardiac muscle contraction Cardiac muscle contraction In A Heartbeat Contraction: Calcium-induced calcium release Depolarisation → Little Ca2+ enters cytosol → Ca2+ enters sarcoplasmic reticulum → SR releases more Ca2+ into cytosol → Ca2+ binds to troponin → cross-bridge formation between actin-myosin → contraction Relaxation: Ca2+ is pumped from cytosol back into SR → Ca2+ levels drop → Ca2+ dissociate from troponin → relaxation 12 1.8 // CArdiAC MuSCL e ContrACtion Cardiac muscle cells
