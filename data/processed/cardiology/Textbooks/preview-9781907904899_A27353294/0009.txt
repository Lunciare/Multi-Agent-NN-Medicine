aortic valve. This makes coronary arteries the first branches of the aorta • Coronary blood flow is about 250 ml/min at rest (5% of cardiac output) and rises to 1 L/min during exercise • During systole (contraction), the aortic valves open and blood is ejected into the aorta. When the aortic valves close during diastole (when the heart is at rest), blood in the aorta flows into the aortic sinuses then into the coronary arteries to supply the heart • Coronary flow takes place mainly during diastole. It is reduced during systole when the intramyocardial arteries are compressed by the contracting muscle • Therefore, diastolic perfusion time is important for the coronary circulation. This is shortened by a rapid heart rate which may result in inadequate perfusion. 1.3.2 Coronary veins Most of the heart’s venous drainage is fulfilled by the tributaries of the coronary sinus. The coronary sinus runs in the posterior atrioventricular groove. It opens into the right atrium just to the left of the opening of the inferior vena cava. Its orifice is guarded by the Thebesian valve. Its tributaries are: • the great cardiac vein in the anterior interventricular groove • the middle cardiac vein in the
