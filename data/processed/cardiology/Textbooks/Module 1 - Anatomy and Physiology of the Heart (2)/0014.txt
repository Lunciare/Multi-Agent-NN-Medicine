or more right marginal veins. One the posterior side of the heart, the great and small cardiac veins merge with the coronary sinus, which empties into the right atrium. The coronary sinuses also receives blood from the middle cardiac vein that ascends along the posterior interventricular groove and the posterior vein of the left ventricle. Cardiac Muscle Tissue Cardiac muscle cells make up the myocardium portion of the heart wall. They are relatively short, branched fibers that measure approximately 10-20 micrometers in diameter and 50 to 100 micrometers in length. Typically each cardiac myocyte contains a single nucleus, which is centrally positioned. Thick and thin myofilaments are present and prganized into myofibrils. Their overlapping arrangement creates alternating dark (A) and light (I) bands or striations, similar to those seen in skeletal muscle tissue. Sarcoplasmic reticulum tubules surround the myofibrils. However, there are not well organised and do not have termial cisternae. T-tubules are also present, but run along the Z-discs (instead of the myofilament overlap zones). The mitichondria in cardiac myocytes are large and numerous. They supply the ATP needed for repeated contraction of the heart. Unlike other types of muscle tissues, cardiac myocytes are joined end to end by
