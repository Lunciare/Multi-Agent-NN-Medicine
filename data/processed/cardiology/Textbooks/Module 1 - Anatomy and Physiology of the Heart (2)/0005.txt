Cardiology

reflects back over the surface of the heart to form the inner wall of the pericardium, the visceral pericardium. Because it is the outer layer of the heart wall, the visceral pericardium is referred to as the epicardium. Together, the parietal and visceral paricardial layers are also called the serous pericardium. Between the walls of the serous pericardium is the pericardial cavity. This narrow space is normally filled with a few (10-15) millilitres of pericardial fluid, which is secreted by the serous membranes. The fluid reduces friction between membranes as they glide past one another during heartbeats. The heart wall is composed of three tissue layers. Covering the outer surface of the heart is the epicardium. It is also referred to as the visceral pericardium, which is the inner layer of the pericardium. The epicardium is a serous membrane that consists of an external layer of simple squamous and an inner layer of areolar tissue (loose connective tissue). The squamous cells secrete lubricating fluids into the pericardial cavity. The thick middle layer of the heart wall is called the myocardium. It consists of numerous layers of cardiac muscle fibres that wrap around the heart wall. Contraction of the myocardium pumps
