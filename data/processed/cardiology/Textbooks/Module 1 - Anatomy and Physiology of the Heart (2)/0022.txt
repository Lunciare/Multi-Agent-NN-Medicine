Cardiology

Prior to systole, the electrical signal passes from the AV node down the AV bundl, also known as the bundle of His to the Punkinje fibers. The fibers allow the fast spread of the electrical signal to all parts of the ventricles and the electrical signal causes the ventricles to contract. Systole begins with the closure if the atrioventricular valves. During systole, the ventricles contract, the semi- lumar vwalves open and bloos is pumped from the ventricles to the aorta. Blood pressure is highest during systole and lowest during diastole. It has two components, the systole and diastole pressure. Normal systole pressure for an adult is estimates at 120 mmhg and normal diastole pressure is estimated at 80 mmhg.
