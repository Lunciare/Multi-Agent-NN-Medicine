KEYWORDS: heart, blood, right, cardiac, left, ventricles, ventricle, artery, valves, atrium, coronary, pulmonary, posterior, node, veins

The four heart valves open and close in response to pressure changes that occur in the ventricles during each cardiac cycle. When the ventricles relax their pressures drop below those of the atria, pulmonary trunk artery and aorta. This allows the AV valves to open as their cusps passively drop downwards. The pressure change additionally permits blood to flow into the ventricles from the atria without restriction. The semilunar valves close during this same period as blood flowing toward the ventricles collects in the pockets of the cusps. Closure of the semilunar valves prevents blood from re-entering the ventricles while they are relaxing. After filling with blood, the ventricles contract and their rising pressures forces blood up towards the atria and into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. Blood pushing up under the cusps causes the atrioventricular valves to close. As a result, blood enters the atria from the pulmonary veins but not from the ventricles. At the same time, rising pressure in pulmonary trunk artery and aorta forces the semilunar valves to open and blood flow into systemic and pulmonary circulatory systems. When the ventricles begin to relax, pressure in the chambers drop again and a new cardiac cycle begins.
