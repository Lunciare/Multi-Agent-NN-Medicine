Cardiology

apex of the right ventricle and base of the anterior papillary muscle. The anatomy of the left bundle branch system may be variable and may not conform to a constant bifascicluar division. Punkinje fibers Punkinje fibers connect with the ends of the bundle branches to form interwearving network on the endocardial surface of both ventricles. These fibers transmit the cardiac impulse almost simultaneously to the entrie right and left ventricle endocardium. Punkinje fibers tend to be less concentrated at the base of the ventricles and the papillary muscle tips and only penetrate the inner third of the endocardium. They appear to be more resistant to ischemia than ordinary myocardial fibers. Cardiac Cycle The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur when the heart beats. The cycle has two main phases: diastole – when the heart ventricles are relaxed and systole – when the ventricles contract. In a cardiac cycle, blood enters the right atrium of the heart from the superior and inferior vena cavae, and flows across the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. From the right ventricle the blood flows into the pulmonary artery, which is separated from the ventricle by the pulmonary valve. After oxygenation in
