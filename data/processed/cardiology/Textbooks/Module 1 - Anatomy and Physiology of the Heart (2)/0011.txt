valves to open and blood flow into systemic and pulmonary circulatory systems. When the ventricles begin to relax, pressure in the chambers drop again and a new cardiac cycle begins. Coronary Arteries The heart receives nutrients and gases from its own set of arteries, veins and capillaries called the coronary circulatory system. Blood enters the coronary circulatory system through the left coronary artery and the right coronary artery, which exit the aorta just above the cusps of the semilunar valves. After running a short distance between the pulmonary trunk artery and left auricle, the left coronary artery emerges onto the anterior surface of the heart. Near this point, it branches into the anterior interventricular artery (left anterior descending artery) and the left circumflex artery. The anterior interventricular artery lies in the anterior interventricular sulcus and gives off branches that supply blood to the anterior ventricles and anterior interventricular septum. The left circumflex artery runs along the coronary sulcus (between the left atrium and ventricle) to the posterior side of the heart, where it usually ends in an anastomosis with the right coronary artery. One or more left marginal arteries typically branch from the left circuflex artery as it travels around
