Cardiology

tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. From the right ventricle the blood flows into the pulmonary artery, which is separated from the ventricle by the pulmonary valve. After oxygenation in the lungs, blood returns to the heart via four pulmonary veins that enter the left atrium. From the left atrium, blood flows across the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle blood is ejected across the aortic valve into the aorta. Together, the mitral and tricuspid valves are known as the atrioventricular valves and the aortic and pulmonary valves as the semilunar valves. From a mechanical point of view, the cardiac cycle is due to blood movement as result of pressure differences within the chambers of the heart. In order for blood to flow through a blood vessel or through a heart valve, there must be force acting on the blood. This force is provided by the difference in blood pressure (a pressure gradient) across these structures by the contractions of the heart. Each heart beat, or cardiac cycle, is divided into two phases of contraction and relaxation, stimulated by elctricla impulses from the sinoatrial node (SA node). The time during which ventricular contraction occurs is
