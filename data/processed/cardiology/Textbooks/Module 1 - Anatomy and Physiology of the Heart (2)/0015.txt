Cardiology

myocytes are large and numerous. They supply the ATP needed for repeated contraction of the heart. Unlike other types of muscle tissues, cardiac myocytes are joined end to end by intercalated discs. These complex, highly convoluted couplings contain both anchoring junctions and electrical junctions. Forming the anchoring junctions are fascia adherens and desmosomes, which arrach the adjacent myocyte. The electrical junctions are composed of connexon protein channels, which usually occur in clusters referred to as gap junctions. Connexon proteins span the distance between adjacent plasma membranes and ions can travel through the channel pores. Th ion movement allows action potentials to pass directly from cell to cell. This property makes the entrie myocardium act like a single cell. The Conduction System The conducting system of the heart consists of cardiac muscle cells and conducting fibers (not nervous tissue) that are specialized for initiating impulses and conducting them rapidly through the heart. They initiate the normal cardiac cycle and coordinate the contractions of cardiac chambers. The conducting system provides the heart its automatic rhythmic beat. For the heart to pump efficiently and the systemic and pulmonary circulations to operate in synchrony, the events in the cardiac cycle must be coordinated. The
