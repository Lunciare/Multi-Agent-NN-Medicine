atria from the pulmonary and systemic circulatory system. Composing the lower chambers are the right ventricle and left ventricle, which are much larger than the atria. The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary circulatory system and the thicker walled left ventricle pumps blood through the longer systemic circulatory system. Internally, the two ventricles are separated by a thick myocardial wall called the interventricular septum. On the anterior surface of the heart, the interventricular septum is marked by a shallow diagonal groove known as the anterior interventricular sulcus (or groove), which is occupied the anterior interventricular artery, great cardiac vein and adipose tissue. On the posterior surface of the heart, the ventricles are separated by the posterior interventricular sulcus, which contains the posterior interior artery, middle cardiac vein and adipose tissue. The Circulation System The major vessels of the heart are the large arteries and veins that attach to the atria, ventricles and transport blood to and from the systemic circulatory system and pulmonary circulation system. Blood is delivered to the right atrium from the systemic circulatory system by two veins. The superior vena cava transport oxygen-depleted blood from the upper extremities, heard and neck. The inferior vena cava transport
