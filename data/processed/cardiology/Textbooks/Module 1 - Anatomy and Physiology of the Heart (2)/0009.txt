heart walls. The external surfaces of the valves are covered by endocardium. The Tricuspid valve (right atroventricular) is composed of three caps or flaps and controls blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. The bicuspid valve is made up of two cusps or flaps and controls blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The term mitral valve is also commonly applied because the left AV valve is shaped somewhat like a bishop’s miter. Thin tendon like cord called chordae tendineae connect the AV valves to cone shaped papillary muscles that extend upward from the myocardium. The chordea tendineae and papillary muscles tether the AV valves to the ventricular walls. This allows the valves to close properly and not bulge (or prolapse) into the atria. Semilunar valves direct blood flow from the ventricles into the aorta and pulmonary trunk artery. The valves are located in the vessels just above the opening to ventricles. Each consists of three cusps that curve upwards to from small pockets. The four heart valves open and close in response to pressure changes that occur in the ventricles during each cardiac cycle. When the ventricles relax their pressures drop below those
