of the diaphragm at the approximate level of the fifth or sixth rib.The broad end of the heart is called the base and gives rise to the major blood vessels, which is directed upwards and to the right and lies at the approximate level of the second rib. Surrounding the hearts is a fibrous sac called the pericardium, which performs several functions. Fluid within the sac lubricates the outer wall of the heart so it can beat without causing friction. It also holds the heart in place forms a barrier against infections and helps keep the heart from over expanding. The pericardium is made up of a coronal section which comprises of two walls and a thin intervening space. The outer wall is thickest and consists of two tissue layers. The external layer is formed by a dense irregular connective tissue and is often called the fibrous pericardium. This layer protects the heart and anchors it to nearby organs. At the roots of the major blood vessels, the parietal pericardium reflects back over the surface of the heart to form the inner wall of the pericardium, the visceral pericardium. Because it is the outer layer of the heart wall, the
