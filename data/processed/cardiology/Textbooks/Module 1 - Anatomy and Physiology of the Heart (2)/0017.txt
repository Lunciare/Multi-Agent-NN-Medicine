eustachian ridge and then into the interatrial septum above the coronary sinus, where it joins the posterior portion of the AV node. These groups of internodal tissue are best referred to as internodal atrial myocardium, not tracts, as they do not appear to be histologically discrete specialized tracts. In 85-90% of human heart, the arterial supply to the AV node is a branch from the right coronary artery which originates at the posterior intersection of the AV and interventricular groove. In the remaining 10-15% of the heart, a branch of the left circumflex coronary artery provides the AV nodal artery. Fibres in the lower part of the AV node may exhibit automatic impulse formation. The main function of the AV node is modulation of the atrial impulse transmission to the ventricles to coordinate atrial and ventricle contractions. Bundle of His The bundle of His is a structure that connects with the distal part if the compact AV node, perforates the central fibrous body and continues through the annulus fibrous, where it is called the non branching portion as it penetrates the membranous septum. Connective tissue of the central fibrous body and membranous septum encloses the penetrating portion of the AV
