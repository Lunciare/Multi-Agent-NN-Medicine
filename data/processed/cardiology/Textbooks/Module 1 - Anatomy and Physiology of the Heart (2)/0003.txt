Cardiology

The heart is vital to your health and nearly everything that goes on in the body. Without the heart's pumping action, blood can't circulate within the body. Blood carries the oxygen and nutrients that your organs need to work normally. Blood also carries carbon dioxide, a waste product, to your lungs to be passed out of the body and into the air. A healthy heart supplies the areas of the body with the right amount of blood at the rate needed to work normally. If disease or injury weakens the heart, the body's organs won't receive enough blood to work normally.
