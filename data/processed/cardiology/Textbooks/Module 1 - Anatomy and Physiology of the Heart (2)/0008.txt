Cardiology

the right atrium from the systemic circulatory system by two veins. The superior vena cava transport oxygen-depleted blood from the upper extremities, heard and neck. The inferior vena cava transport oxygen-depleted blood from the thorax, abdomen and lower extremities. Blood exits the right ventricles through the pulmonary trunk artery. Approximately two inches superior to the base of the heart, this vessel branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries, which transport blood into the lungs. The left pulmonary veins and right pulmonary veins return oxygen-ated blood from the lungs to the left atrium. Blood passes from the left atrium into the left ventricle and then is pumped into the systemic circulatory system through a large elastic artery called the aorta. The Heart Valve Anatomy Four valves maintain the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart. The valves are located between each atrium and ventricle and in the two arteries that empty blood from the ventricle. These valves are primarily composed of fibrous connective tissues that originate and extend from the heart walls. The external surfaces of the valves are covered by endocardium. The Tricuspid valve (right atroventricular) is composed of three caps or flaps and controls blood flow from the
