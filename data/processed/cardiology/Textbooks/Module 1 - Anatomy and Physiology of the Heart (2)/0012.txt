heart, where it usually ends in an anastomosis with the right coronary artery. One or more left marginal arteries typically branch from the left circuflex artery as it travels around the heart. The left circumflex artery and its branches supply blood to the left atrium and the lateral and posterior portions of the left ventricles. The right coronary artery travels along the coronary sulcus (between the right atrium and ventricle) where it typically gives off smaller branches to the right atrium. AV nodes (80% of people) and SA nodes (55% of people). Larger right marginal arteries also diverge from the right coronary artery as it continues around the heart. The right marginal arteries supply blood to the lateral wall of the right ventricle. On the posterior surface of the heart, the right coronary artery typically (80%-85% of people) give rise to the posrterior interventricular artery (PIV) or posterior descending artery (PDA), which runs along the posterior interventricular sulcus and the posterior interventricular septum. Coronary Veins After flowing through the myocardium, most (80%) of the oxygen-depleted blood is returned to the right atrium by several prominent veins that run along the surface of the heart.
