• Do urgent plasma U&E, and serum and urine osmolalities. Monitor urine output carefully and check U&E twice a day initially. • IVI to keep up with urine output. If severe hypernatraemia, do not lower Na+ rapidly as this may cause cerebral oedema and brain injury. If Na+ is ≥170, use 0.9% saline initially—this contains 150mmol/L of sodium. Aim to reduce Na+ at a rate of less than 12mmol/L per day. Use of 0.45% saline can be dangerous. • Desmopressin 2mcg IM (lasts 12–24h) may be used as a therapeutic trial. 16 DIDMOAD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder: Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy and Deafness (also known as Wolfram’s syndrome). 17 Suspect neurosarcoidosis if CSF protein (seen in 34%), facial nerve palsy (25%), CSF pleocytosis (23%), diabetes insipidus (21%), hemiparesis (17%), psychosis (17%), papilloedema (15%), ataxia (13%), seizures (12%), optic atrophy (12%), hearing loss (12%), or nystagmus (9%). 18 Sheehan’s syndrome is pituitary infarction from shock, eg postpartum haemorrhage. It is rare. 19 Most of us could drink 20L/d and not be hyponatraemic; some get hyponatraemic drinking 5L/d; they may have Psychosis, Intermittent hyponatraemia, and Polydipsia (PIP syndrome), ?from intravascular volume leading to atrial natriuretic peptide, p137, hence
