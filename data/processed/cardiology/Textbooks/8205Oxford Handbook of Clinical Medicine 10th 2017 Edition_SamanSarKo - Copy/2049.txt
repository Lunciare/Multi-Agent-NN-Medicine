shock (there is no R wave to trigger defi brillation, p770): see p894, fi g A3. If SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine (see p806). Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics): These are the commonest post-MI arrhyth- mia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhyth- mic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality. Torsade de pointes: A form of VT, with a constantly varying axis, often in the setting of long QT syndromes (ECG p129, fi g 3.31). Causes (p711): congenital or from drugs (eg some antidysrhythmics, tricyclics, antimalarials, antipsychotics). Torsade in the set- ting of congenital long-QT syndromes can be treated with high doses of -blockers. In acquired long-QT syndromes (p711), stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypo- kalaemia, and give magnesium sulfate (2g IV over 10min). Alternatives include: over- drive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or isoprenaline IVI to increase heart rate. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880044 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of broad complex tachycardia 805 No Use arrest protocol Pulse?
