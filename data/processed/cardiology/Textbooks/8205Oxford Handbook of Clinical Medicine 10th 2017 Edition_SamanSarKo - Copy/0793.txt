The use of binders which do not contain calcium may be benefi cial in preventing vascular calcifi cation. • Give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if defi cient. If PTH per- sists or is increasing, treat with an activated vit D analogue eg 1-calcidol or calci- triol. Paricalcitol suppresses PTH with less eff ect on gut absorption of calcium and phosphate and is less likely to cause calcium/phosphate. Restless legs/cramps: Exclude iron defi ciency as a possible exacerbating factor. Give sleep hygiene advice. Treatment for severe cases with gabapentin/pregabalin/ dopamine agonists is off licence and may be complicated by side-eff ects (falls, cogni- tive impairment, impulse-control disorder). Diet: Expert dietary advice should be available regarding protein intake, K+ if hyper- kalaemic, and phosphate restriction (eg dairy products). Treatment of other complications of CKD Cardiovascular disease: CKD confers risk of cardiovascular disease due to BP, vas- cular stiff ness, infl ammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal endothelial function (CV risk often higher than the risk of kidney failure). • Antiplatelets (low-dose aspirin) for CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events unless bleeding risk outweighs benefi t (mortality benefi t unclear in CKD). • Atorvastatin 20mg (and higher if GFR >30) for primary and
