fast. Suppressive tests Give IV insulin and measure C-peptide. Normally exogenous insu- lin suppresses C-peptide production, but this does not occur in insulinoma. Imaging CT/MRI ± endoscopic pancreatic US ± IACS (see BOX; all fallible, so don’t waste too much time before proceeding to intra-operative visualization ± intra-operative ul- trasound). 18F-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET-CT can help guide laparoscopic surgery. Treatment Excision. Nesidioblastosis See BOX. If this doesn’t work, options are: diet, diazoxide, dextrose IVI, enteral feeding, everolimus.  Diabetic ketoacidosis Results from insulin defi ciency (eg unknown diagnosis, intercurrent illness, interuption of insulin therapy). See p832. Pursuing a voyage to the islets of Langerhans to the bitter end A 50-year-old had episodic early-morning sweats and tremors and was found to have hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (= Nesidioblastosis). Selective intra- arterial calcium infusions (IACS) showed a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion after infusion of the splenic and superior mesenteric arteries, so setting the stage for ‘hunt the insulinoma’. But cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic ultrasound were normal. At lapa- rotomy, no lesion was found despite mobilization of the pancreas, or during intra- operative ultrasound. ‘Time to sew up and go home?’ ‘No!’ said the surgeon, ‘I’m going to do a distal pancreatectomy’. Histology showed no discrete
