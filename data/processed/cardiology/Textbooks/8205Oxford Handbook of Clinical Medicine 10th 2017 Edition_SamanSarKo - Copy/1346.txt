capable of dividing millions of times. These cells need to be able to adapt and change so that diff erent tissues and organs can be formed. They need to command their own blood supply. Without extensive mechanisms to control cell growth and prevent the replication of abnormal cells, these requirements for life become the basis for the development of a cancer. Failure of control mechanisms causes cancer. Cancer is a genetic disease. Genetic changes occur in pathways associated with cell growth, cell diff erentiation, and cell death. Mutations can be inherited or ac- quired. Acquired or somatic errors occur due to age, exposure to carcinogens, and in unchecked rapid cell turnover. Mutations result in: • ‘gain of function’ oncogenes that have pathological activity in the absence of a relevant signal. For example, ras is a protein involved in signal transduction. It is mutated in ~30% of human cancers. Oncogenes behave in a dominant manner: mutation to one allele results in unchecked activation. • ‘loss of function’ tumour suppressor genes no longer act as inhibitors of pro- malignant processes. In most cases, mutations to both alleles must occur for a cancer phenotype. This can occur either as two separate somatic events,
