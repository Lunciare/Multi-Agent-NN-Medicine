failure, syncope, and even sudden death. Investigations: ECG shows RV hypertrophy with a right bundle-branch block. CXR may be normal, or show the hallmark of TOF, which is the classic boot- shaped heart (fi g 3.53). Echocardiography can show the anatomy as well as the degree of stenosis. Cardiac CT and cardiac MRI can give valuable information for planning the surgery. 73 Management: Surgery is usually done be- fore 1yr of age, with closure of the VSD and correction of pulmonary stenosis. Prognosis: Without surgery, mortality rate is ~95% by age 20. After repair, 85% of pa- tients survive to 35yrs. Common problems in adulthood include pulmonary regurgitation, causing RV dilatation and failure; RV outfl ow Fig 3.53 Boot-shaped heart. tract obstruction; AR; LV dysfunction; and ar- Courtesy of Dr Edward Singleton. rhythmias. Patients with one ventricle Many patients born with single-ventricle hearts (eg hypoplastic left heart syn- drome) will undergo a Fontan procedure. This results in systemic venous blood fl owing directly into the pulmonary arteries and the single ventricle being used to pump oxygenated blood into the aorta. The lack of a right heart results in many of the signs and symptoms of right heart failure and puts
