FDG de- cays rapidly to produce a positron that, after travelling a few millimetres through tissue, annihilates with an electron to produce a pair of high-energy photons (gamma rays), which PET detects. Normal high uptake of FDG occurs in brain, liver, kidney, blad- der, larynx, and lymphoid tissue of pharynx and must be considered when assess- ing images. Neoplasms have high uptake of FDG with hotspots suggesting primary disease or metastases. Since infl ammatory lesions will also show high uptake, there is a risk of false-positive results (eg sarcoid, TB); diagnosis must be confi rmed with histology of suspicious lesions. PET allows staging of many solid organ malignancies (lung, melanoma, oesophageal) as well as lymphomas, and is particularly useful for planning of radiotherapy and surgery for both primary disease and metastases. PET can also be used to image occult sources of infection. PET can be combined with CT or MRI to provide high-quality images combining anatomy with physiology. A range of alternative tracers are now entering clinical use with
