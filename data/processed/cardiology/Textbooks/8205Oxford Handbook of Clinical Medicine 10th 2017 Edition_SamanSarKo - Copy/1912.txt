attenuation, so a subacute subdural haematoma at 2wks may be of the same attenuation as adjacent brain. • A chronic subdural haematoma will be of relatively low attenuation. CT is often used in acute stroke to exclude haemorrhage (eg pre-antiplatelets) and with perfusion scanning (fi g 16.14) to aid management decisions regarding throm- bolysis. The actual area of infarction/ischaemia may not show up for a day or so, and will be low-attenuation cytotoxic oedema (aff ecting both white and grey matter— look for loss of grey matter defi nition). Tumours and abscesses appear similar, eg a ring-enhancing mass, surrounding vasogenic oedema, and mass eff ect. Vasogenic oedema (from leaky capillaries) is extracellular and spreads through the white matter (grey matter spared). Mass ef- fect causes compression of the sulci and ipsilateral ventricles, and may also cause herniation (subfalcine, transtentorial, or tonsillar). See p483 (and also fi g 16.40). Another indication for CT is acute, severe headache, eg suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478). An unenhanced CT may show fresh blood, hydrocephalus or ICP, any of which could make LP unsafe. CT angiography gives excellent mapping of the cerebral circulation (fi g 16.41), and can be done directly after unenhanced CT, looking
