Buffl er, North American Congress of Epidemiology, 2011. Who, what, when, where, why, and how? Epidemiology is the study of the distribution of clinical phenomena in populations. It analyses disease in terms of host, agent, and environment (the ‘epidemiologist’s triad’). It elucidates risks and mechanisms for the development of disease, and re- veals potential targets for disease prevention and treatment. Epidemiology does not look at the individual patient, but examines a defi ned population. How applicable its fi ndings are depend upon how well the sample population mirrors the study popula- tion, which must, in turn, mirror the target population. Does your patient fi t in this ‘target’? If ‘yes’, then the epidemiological fi ndings may be applicable. Measures of disease frequency Incidence proportion is the number of new cases of disease as a proportion of the population. Synonyms include probability of disease, cumulative incidence, risk. Incidence rate is the number of new cases per unit of person-time, ie one person observed for 5 years contributes 5 person-years of follow-up. Prevalence is the number of cases that exist at a given time (point prevalence) or time-frame (period prevalence), divided by the total population being studied. For example, the lifetime prevalence
