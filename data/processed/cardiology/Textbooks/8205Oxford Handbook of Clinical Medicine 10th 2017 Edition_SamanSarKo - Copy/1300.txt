fi bres of taste for the anterior ⅔ of the tongue and a few somatic sensory fi bres from the middle ear region. Ramsay Hunt syndrome Latent varicella zoster virus reactivating in the geniculate ganglion of the VIIth cranial nerve. Symptoms: Painful vesicular rash on the auditory canal ± on drum, pinna, tongue palate, or iris (hyphaema, ie blood under the cornea) with ipsilat- eral facial palsy, loss of taste, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, dry mouth and eyes. The rash may be subtle or even absent (‘herpes sine herpete’=herpes without herpes). Incidence: ~5/100 000 (higher if >60yrs). Diagnosis: Clinical, as antiviral treatment is thought to be most eff ective within the 1st 72h, while the virus is replicating. : Antivirals (eg aciclovir 800mg PO 5 ≈ daily for 7d) + prednisolone, as for Bell’s palsy. Prognosis: If treated within 72h, ~75% recover well; if not, ~ ⅓ make a good recovery, ⅓ a reasonable recovery, and ⅓ a poor recovery. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 550011 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 502 Mononeuropathies Lesions of individual peripheral or cranial nerves.
