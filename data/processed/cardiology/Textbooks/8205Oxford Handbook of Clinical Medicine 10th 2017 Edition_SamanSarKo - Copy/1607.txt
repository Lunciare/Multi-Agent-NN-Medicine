test positive for faecal occult blood (FOB) using a home testing kit performed every 2 years. This FOB- stratifi cation targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting detection of more advanced adenomas and early stage cancers. The relative risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients undergoing screening is reduced by 16%. A 11% increase in incidence rates since 2006 for people aged 60–69 is almost certainly due to earlier detection through the screening programme. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 661177 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 618 Carcinoma of the oesophagus Incidence Australia <5/100 000/yr; UK <9; Iran >100.
