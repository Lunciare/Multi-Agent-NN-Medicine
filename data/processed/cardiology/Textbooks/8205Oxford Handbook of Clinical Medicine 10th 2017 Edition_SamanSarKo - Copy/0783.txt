of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate should not be used. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in AKI RRT options in AKI include haemodialysis and haemofi ltration (p306). Peritoneal dialysis is rare for AKI in adults and in high-income countries but can be used. Possible indications for renal replacement therapy: • Fluid overload unresponsive to medical treatment. • Severe/prolonged acidosis. • Recurrent/persistent hyperkalaemia despite medical treatment. • Uraemia eg pericarditis, encephalopathy (more common in CKD). The decision to start RRT should be individualized, aiming to provide organ support and prevent complications, rather than waiting for them to occur. The complexity of AKI and variation in thresholds for starting RRT prevent robust meta-analysis. Fluid overload is likely to be an important predictor of worse outcome. Possible complications of RRT: Risks of dialysis catheter insertion and mainte- nance, procedural hypotension, bleeding due to the requirement for anticoagula- tion, altered nutrition and drug clearance. 2 Calcium chloride contains 3x calcium than the same volume of gluconate. Concern exists about the bioavailability of calcium gluconate.
