(p428). Transmission is faecal–oral from contaminated water/food. Incubation 6–30d (most 10–20d). ~10 000 organisms are required to cause illness. Can be asymptomatic (but shed organism). Symptoms: Fatigue, headache, anorexia. Marked fever, ‘stepwise’ (rising through each day with progressive peaks) in <20%. Abdominal pain, relative bradycardia (Faget’s sign), cough, constipation. Rose spots in ~25% (salmon-coloured, 1–4cm, blanching, due to bacterial emboli to dermis). Diarrhoea (‘pea-soup’) and hepato- splenomegaly in 2nd week. Progressive toxicity and complicated disease in up to 10%: intestinal haemorrhage/perforation, myocarditis, hepatitis, pneumonia, DIC, CNS involvement (delirium, meningism, encephalitis, cerebellar signs, fi ts, coma), eye complications (corneal ulcer, uveitis, neuritis, thrombosis). Diagnosis: Isolation of S. typhi from: blood (take multiple cultures of 10–15mL in fi rst 10d to  sensitivity), bone marrow, intestinal secretions, or stool (sensitivity after 1st week). Serology has  sensitivity and specifi city, not suffi cient as sole diagnostic tool (Widal test is Ωve in ~30% of culture-proven cases). LFT. PCR (not routine). Treatment: Azithromycin ± IV ceftriaxone. >70% imported from Asia are resistant to fl uoroquinolones. Fever takes median 5–7d to respond due to intracellular niche of organism. Antipyretics, fl uid management, nutrition. CNS disease: dexametha- sone 3mg/kg IV then 1mg/kg/6h for 8 doses
