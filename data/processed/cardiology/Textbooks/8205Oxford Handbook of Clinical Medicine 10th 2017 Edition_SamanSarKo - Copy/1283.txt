structural pathology. Functional neuroimaging (DaTscan™, PET) is playing an emerging role. Treatment: Focuses on symptom control and does not slow disease progression (see BOX). Non-pharmacological options include deep brain stimulation (DBS, may help those who are partly dopamine-responsive) and surgical ablation of overactive basal ganglia circuits (eg subthalamic nuclei). Parkinson’s plus syndromes Pro gressive supranuclear palsy: (PSP, Steele–Rich- ardson–Olszewski syndrome.) Early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy ± falls; rigidity of trunk >limbs; symmetrical onset; speech and swallowing problems; little tremor. Multiple system atrophy: (MSA; Shy–Drager.) Early autonomic features, eg impotence/incontinence, postural BP; cerebellar + pyr amidal signs; rigidity > tremor. Cortico-basal degeneration: (CBD.) Akinetic rigidity involving one limb; cortical sensory loss (eg astereognosis); apraxia (even autonomous interfering activity by aff ected limb—the ‘alien limb’ phenomenon). Lewy body dementia: See p486. Secondary causes Vascular parkinsonism: (2.5–5% of parkinsonism, also called ‘lower limb’ parkinsonism). Eg diabetic/hypertensive patient with postural instabil- ity and falls (rather than tremor, bradykinesia, and festination). Other secondary causes: Drugs (neuroleptics, metoclopramide, prochlorp era zine), toxins (manganese), Wilson’s disease (p285), trauma (dementia pugilistica), encephalitis, neurosyphilis. Management Requires input of a a multidisc iplinary team (GP, neurologist, nurse specialist, social worker, carers, physio- and occupational therapist) to boost quality of
