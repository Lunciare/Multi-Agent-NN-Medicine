Tests Endoscopy if dysphagia, or if ≥55yrs old with alarm symptoms (p252) or with treatment-refractory dyspepsia. 24h oesophageal pH monitoring ± manom- etry help diagnose GORD when endoscopy is normal. Treatment Lifestyle: Weight loss; smoking cessation; small, regular meals; reduce hot drinks, alcohol, citrus fruits, tomatoes, onions, fi zzy drinks, spicy foods, caff eine, chocolate; avoid eating < 3h before bed. Raise the bed head. Drugs: Antacids, eg magnesium trisilicate mixture (10mL/8h), or alginates, eg Gav- iscon® (10–20mL/8h PO) relieve symptoms. Add a PPI, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO. For refractory symptoms, add an H2 blocker and/or try twice-daily PPI. Avoid drugs aff ecting oesophageal motility (nitrates, anticholinergics, Ca2+ channel blockers—re- lax the lower oesophageal sphincter) or that damage mucosa (NSAIDS, K+ salts, bis- phosphonates). Surgery: (Eg laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, or novel options including laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band or radiofrequency-induced hypertrophy.) These all aim to  resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Consider in severe
