impairment (or both). Echo helps by measuring end-diastolic volume. If this is large, systolic dysfunction is the likely cause. If small, diastolic. Pure forms of diastolic dysfunction are rare. Diff erentiation is important because vasodilators are less useful in diastolic dysfunction as a high ventricular fi lling pressure is required. Echo is also useful for detecting focal and global hypokinesia, LV aneurysm, mural thrombus, and LVH (echo is 5–10 times more sensitive than ECG in detecting this). Estimating right heart haemodynamics: Doppler studies of pulmonary artery fl ow and tricuspid regurgitation allow evaluation of RV function and pressures. Valve disease: The technique of choice for measuring pressure gradients and valve orifi ce areas in stenotic lesions. Detecting valvular regurgitation and estimating its signifi cance is less accurate. Evaluating function of prosthetic valves is another role. Congenital heart disease: Establishing the presence of lesions, and signifi cance. Endocarditis: Vegetations may not be seen if <2mm in size. TTE with colour Doppler is best for aortic regurgitation (AR). TOE is useful for visualizing mitral valve vegeta- tions, leafl et perforation, or looking for an aortic root abscess. Pericardial effusion: Best diagnosed by echo. Fluid may fi rst accumulate between the posterior pericardium
