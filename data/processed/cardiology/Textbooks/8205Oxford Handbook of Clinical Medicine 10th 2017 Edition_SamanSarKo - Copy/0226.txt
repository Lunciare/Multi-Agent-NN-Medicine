atro- phy and loss of skin elasticity (lipodermatosclerosis) in venous disease. 2 Palpation: Warm varicose veins may indicate infection. Are they tender? Firm, tender varicosities suggests thrombosis. Palpate the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) for a saphena varix which displays a cough impulse. Similarly, incompetence at the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) may be felt as a cough impulse. If ulcera- tion is present, it is prudent to palpate the arterial pulses to rule out arterial disease. 3 Tap test: A transmitted percussion impulse from the lower limit of the varicose vein to the saphenofemoral junction demonstrates incompetence of superfi cial valves. 4 Auscultation: Bruits over the varicosities means there is an arteriovenous mal- formation. 5 Doppler: Test for the level of refl ux. On squeezing the leg distal to placement of the probe you should only hear one ‘whoosh’ if the valves are competent at the level of probe placement. 6 Trendelenburg’s test assesses if the SFJ valve is competent. Doppler USS has largely consigned this and other examination methods (eg Tourniquet and Perthes’ test) to the history books. 7 Complete examination: examine the abdomen, pelvis in females, and external genitalia in males (for masses). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 7788 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH Arterial
