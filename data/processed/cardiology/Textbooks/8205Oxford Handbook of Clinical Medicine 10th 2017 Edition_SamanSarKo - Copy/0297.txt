and colour-fl ow echocardiography: Diff erent coloured jets illustrate fl ow and gradients across valves and septal defects (p156) (Doppler eff ect, p736). Tissue Doppler imaging: This employs Doppler ultrasound to measure the velocity of myocardial segments over the cardiac cycle. It is particularly useful for assessing longitudinal motion—and hence long-axis ventricular function, which is a sensitive marker of systolic and diastolic heart failure. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE): More sensitive than transthoracic echo- cardiography (TTE) as the transducer is nearer to the heart. Indications: diagnosing aortic dissections; assessing prosthetic valves; fi nding cardiac source of emboli, and IE/SBE. Contraindicated in oesophageal disease and cervical spine instability. Stress echocardiography: Used to evaluate ventricular function, ejection fraction, myocardial thickening, regional wall motion pre- and post-exercise, and to charac- terize valvular lesions. Dobutamine or dipyridamole may be used if the patient can- not exercise. Inexpensive and as sensitive/specifi c as a thallium scan (p741). Uses of echocardiography Quantifi cation of global LV function: Heart failure may be due to systolic or diastol- ic ventricular impairment (or both). Echo helps by measuring end-diastolic volume. If this is large, systolic dysfunction is the likely cause. If small, diastolic. Pure forms of diastolic dysfunction are rare. Diff
