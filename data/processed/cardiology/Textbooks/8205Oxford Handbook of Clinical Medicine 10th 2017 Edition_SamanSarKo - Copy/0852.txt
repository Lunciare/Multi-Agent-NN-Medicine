If the MCV is high and the RDW is normal, the cause is likely to be alcohol, liver disease, or a marrow problem (chemotherapy or aplastic anaemia). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332255 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 326 Iron-defi ciency anaemia (IDA) This is common (seen in up to 14% of menstruating women). Causes •Blood loss, eg menorrhagia or GI bleeding2 (upper p256; lower p629). • Poor diet or poverty may cause IDA in babies or children (but rarely in adults). • Malabsorption (eg coeliac disease) is a cause of refractory IDA. • In the tropics, hookworm (GI blood loss) is the most common cause. Signs Chronic IDA (signs now rare): koilonychia (fi g 8.4 and p76), atrophic glossitis, angular cheilosis (fi g 8.5), and, rarely, post-cricoid webs (Plummer–Vinson syndrome). Tests Blood fi lm: microcytic, hypochromic anaemia with anisocytosis and poikilo- cytosis (fi gs 8.6, 8.7). MCV, MCH, and MCHC. Confi rmed by ferritin (also serum iron with TIBC, but these are less reliable, see table 8.1). NB: ferritin is an acute phase protein and  with infl ammation, eg infection, malignancy.
