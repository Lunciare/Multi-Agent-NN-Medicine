A1AT is a glycoprotein and one of a family of serine protease inhibitors made in the liver that control infl ammatory cascades. Defi ciency is called a serpinopathy. It makes up 90% of serum 1-glob ulin on electrophoresis (p687). A1AT defi ciency is the chief genetic cause of liver disease in children. In adults, its lack is more likely to cause emphy sema. Lung A1AT protects against tissue damage from neutrophil elastase—a process that is also induced by cigarette smoking (p184). Prevalence ~1:4000 (higher in Caucasians). Genetics Genetic variants of A1AT are typed by electro phor etic mobility as medium (M), slow
