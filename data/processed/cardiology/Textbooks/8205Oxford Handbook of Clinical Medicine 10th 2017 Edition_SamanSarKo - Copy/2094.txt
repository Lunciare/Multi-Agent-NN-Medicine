defi cit •paraesthesia in the upper or lower limbs. If above-listed criteria are NOT met AND IF ANY OF the following low-risk features are present, then assess neck movement: •simple rear-end motor vehicle collision •comfortable in a sitting position •ambulatory since injury •no midline cervical spine tenderness •delayed onset of neck pain. If patient unable actively to rotate neck 45° to left and right or if a low-risk feature not present, then obtain plain X-rays of cer- vical spine <1h. If X-rays technically inadequate, suspicious, or defi nitely abnormal, proceed to CT. Admit if: •new, clinically signifi cant abnormalities on CT •GCS<15 after CT, regardless of result or continuing worrying signs (eg vomiting) •when CT indications met but CT unavailable •other concerns (eg drugs or alcohol, other injuries, CSF leak, shock, suspected non-accidental injury, meningism). Do not attribute GCS to alcohol until a signifi cant head injury has been excluded. Alcohol is an unlikely cause of coma if plasma alcohol <44mmol/L. If unavailable, es- timate blood alcohol level from the osmolar gap (p668). If blood alcohol ≈ 40mmol/L, osmolar gap ≈ 40mmol/L. Discuss with neurosurgical unit all with signifi cant abnormalities on CT or with eg persistent GCS ≤8 or
