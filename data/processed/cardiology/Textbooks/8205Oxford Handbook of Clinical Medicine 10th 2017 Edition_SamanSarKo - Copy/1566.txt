Rare in men (~1% of all breast cancers). Risk factors Risk is related to family history, age, and uninterr upted oestrogen ex- posure, hence: nulliparity; 1st pregnancy >30yrs old, early menarche; late menopause; HRT; obesity; BRCA genes (p521); not breastfeeding; past breast cancer (metachronous rate ≈2%, synchronous rate ≈1%). Pathology Non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is premalignant and seen as microcalcifi cation on mammography (unifocal or widespread). Non-invasive lobular CIS is rarer and tends to be multifocal. Invasive ductal carcinoma is most common (~70%) whereas invasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10–15% of breast cancers. Medullary cancers (~5%) tend to aff ect younger patients while colloid/mucoid (~2%) tend to aff ect the elderly. Others: papillary, tubular, adenoid-cystic and Pa- get’s (p708). 60–70% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor +ve, conveying better prognosis. ~30% over-express HER2 (growth factor receptor gene) associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.
