Sergeievich Korsakoff, 1853–1900 (Russian neuropsychiatrist) Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Histiocytosis X.) A group of single- (73%, eg bone) or multisystem (27%) disorders, with infi ltrating granulomas containing dendritic (Langer- hans) cells. : ≈1.5:1; at-risk organs are liver, lung, spleen, marrow. Pulmonary disease presents with pneumothorax or pulmonary hypertension. CXR/CT: nodules and cysts + honeycombing in upper and middle zones. : Biopsy (skin, lung). : Local excision, ster- oids, vinblastine ± etoposide if severe.49 OHCS p644. Paul Langerhans, 1847–1888 (German pathologist) Leriche’s syndrome Absent femoral pulse, claudication/wasting of the buttock, a pale cold leg, and erectile dysfunction from aorto-iliac occlusive dise ase, eg a saddle embolus at the aortic bifurcation. Surgery may help. René Leriche, 1879–1955 (French surgeon) Löffl er’s eosinophilic endocarditis Restrictive cardiomyopathy + eosinophilia (eg 120 ≈ 109/L). It may be an early stage of tropical endomyocardial fi brosis (and overlaps with hypereosinophilic syndrome, p330) but is distinct from eosinophilic leuk aemia. Signs: Heart failure (75%) ± mitral regurgitation (49%) ± heart block. : Suppress the eosin ophilia (prednisolone ± hydroxycarbamide), and then treat with anti-heart failure medication. Wilhelm Löffl er, 1887–1972 (Swiss physician) Löffl er’s syndrome (Pulmonary eosinophilia.) An allergic infi ltration of the lungs by eosinophils. Allergens include:
