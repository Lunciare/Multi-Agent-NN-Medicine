general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during elec- trophysiological studies; drug overdose (eg digoxin, -blockers, verapamil). See p776 for further details and insertion technique. Indications for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) include • Complete AV block (Stokes–Adams attacks, asymptomatic, congenital). • Mobitz type II AV block (p99). • Persistent AV block after anterior MI. • Symptomatic bradycardias (eg sick sinus syndrome, p125). • Heart failure (cardiac resynchronization therapy). • Drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias. Pre-operative assessment Bloods (FBC, clotting screen, renal function), IV cannula, consent, antibiotics as per local protocol. Post-operative management Prior to discharge, check wound for bleeding or hae- matoma; check lead positions and for pneumothorax on CXR; check pacemaker func- tion. During 1st week, inspect for wound haematoma or dehiscence. Other problems: lead fracture or dislodgement; pacemaker interference (eg from patient’s muscles); infected device. The battery needs changing every 5–10 years. For driving rules see p158. Pacemaker letter codes These enable pacemaker identifi cation (min is 3 letters): • 1st letter the chamber paced (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber). • 2nd letter the chamber sensed (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber, O=none). • 3rd letter the pacemaker response (T=triggered, I=inhibited, D=dual). • 4th letter (R=rate modulation, P=programmable, M=multiprogrammable). • 5th letter (P means that in
