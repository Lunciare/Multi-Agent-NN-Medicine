Untreated, death occurs in 20%, and Korsakoff ’s psychosis occurs in 85%—a quarter of whom will require long-term institutional care.

It is fatal if untreated and is caused by Tropheryma whippelii, which, combined with defective cell-mediated im- munity, produces a systemic disease. Features: Often starts insidiously with arthral- gia (chronic, migratory, seronegative arthropathy aff ecting mainly peripheral joints). GI symptoms commonly include colicky abdominal pain, weight loss, steatorrhea/ diarrhoea, which leads to malabsorption (p266). Systemic symptoms such as chronic cough, fever, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and skin hyperpigmentation also occur. Car- diac involvement may lead to endocarditis, which is typically blood culture negative. CNS features include a reversible dementia, ophthalmoplegia, and facial myoclonus (if all together, they are highly suggestive)—also hypothalamic syndrome (hyperphagia, polydipsia, insomnia). NB: CNS involvement may occur without
