but distal run-off is good (ie distal arteries fi lled by collateral vessels), consider arterial reconstruction with a bypass graft (fi g 13.54). Procedures include femoral–popliteal bypass, femo- ral–femoral crossover, and aorto–bifemoral bypass grafts. Autologous vein grafts are superior to prosthetic grafts (eg Dacron® or PTFE) when the knee joint is crossed. • Amputation <3% of patients with intermittent claudication require major am- putation within 5 years ( in diabetes, p212). Amputation may relieve intractable pain and death from sepsis and gangrene. A decision to amputate must be made by the patient, usually against a background of failed alternative strategies. The knee should be preserved where possible as it improves mobility and rehabilitation potential (this must be balanced with the need to ensure wound healing). Rehabili- tation should be started early with a view to limb fi tting. Gabapentin (regimen on p504) can be used to treat the gruelling complication of phantom limb pain. • Future therapies: Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and benefi t of gene therapy (eg hepatocyte growth factor) in critical limb ischaemia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 665566 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS (a) (b) 657 Fig 13.53 Leg arteries.
