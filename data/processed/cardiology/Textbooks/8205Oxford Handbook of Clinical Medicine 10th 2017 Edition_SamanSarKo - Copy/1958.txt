Drains are removed after 4–6h to prevent infection. • Check U&ES after the procedure and re-examine the patient. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 776644 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 serudecorp lacitcarP Diagnostic taps 765 If you are unsure whether a drain is needed, a diagnostic tap can be helpful. Whatever fl uid you are sampling, a green needle carries far less risk than a formal drain. It also allows you to decide whether a drain is required. Ascites may be sampled to give a cytological or bacterial diagnosis, eg to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; p276). Before starting, know the patient’s platelets + clotting times. If they are abnormal, seek help before proceeding. • Place the patient fl at and tap out the ascites, marking a point where fl uid has been identifi ed, avoiding vessels, stomas, and scars (adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall). The left side may be safer—less chance of nicking
