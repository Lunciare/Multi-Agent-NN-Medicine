leads to the formation of dis- crete foci (~2mm) of granulomatous tissue throughout the lung (‘millet’ seed appearance). CXR: fi g 9.9. Dis- semination is throughout the body with meningeal involvement in ~25%. Sputum may be negative for AFB as spread is haematogenous. Have a low threshold for LP. Untreated mortality is assumed to be close to 100%. Do not delay treatment while test results are pending. • CNS TB: Haematogenous spread lead- ing to foci of infection in brain and Fig 9.9 Miliary TB (nodular opacities). spinal cord.

Headache, meningism, confusion, seizures, focal neurological defi cit, and systemic symptoms. Needs LP and examination of CSF (leucocytosis, raised protein, CSF: plasma glucose <50%, AFB stain, PCR and culture). Look for TB elsewhere (CXR, etc), test for HIV. CT/ MRI may show hydrocephalus, basal exudates. Tuberculomas are ring-enhancing. All rapid diagnostic tests (p394) have sensitivity, so treat on suspicion. • Genitourinary TB: Symptoms may be chronic, intermittent, or silent. Include dysuria, freque ncy, loin pain, haematuria, sterile pyuria (see p296). Granuloma may cause
