staggered, or presentation is >15h from inges- tion, treatment may still help. Get advice. Acetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/ kg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. Rash is a common SE: treat with chlorphenamine + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid reaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). An alternative (if acetyl- cysteine unavailable) is methionine 2.5g/4h PO for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is unreliable if vomiting. Ongoing management • Next day do INR, U&E, LFT. If INR rising, continue acetylcysteine until <1.4. • If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don’t hesitate to get help. • Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by eg King’s College criteria (BOX, p275). Salicylate poisoning Aspirin is a weak acid with poor water solubility. It is present in many over-the- counter preparations. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic metabolism and the production of lactate and heat. Eff ects are dose related and potentially fatal: •150mg/kg: mild toxicity. •250mg/kg: moderate •>500mg/kg: severe toxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal. Signs and symptoms Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features: • Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation,
