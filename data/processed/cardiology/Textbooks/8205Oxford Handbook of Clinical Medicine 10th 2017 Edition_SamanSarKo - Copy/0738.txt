cirrhosis or if there is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is ef- fective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%). Prognosis Appears not to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at presentation (10yr survival ~80% for both). The presence of cirrhosis at presenta- tion reduces 10yr survival from 94% to 62%. Overlap syndromes: AIH-PBC (primary biliary cholangitis) overlap is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis). Associations of autoimmune hepatitis •Pernicious anaemia •Autoimmune haemolysis •Ulcerative colitis •Diabetes mellitus •Glomerulonephritis •PSC (p282) •Autoimmune thyroiditis •HLA A1, B8, and DR3 haplotype. 33 Hepatotropic viruses (eg measles, herpes viruses) and some drugs appear to trigger AIH in geneti- cally predisposed individuals exposed to a hepatotoxic milieu intérieur. Viral interferon can inactivate cytochrome P450 enzymes (  metabolism of ex- or endogenous hepatotoxins). Resulting modifi cations to proteins may generate autoantigens driving CD4 T-helper cell activation. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 228844 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 285 The commonest liver disorder in Western industrialized countries (prevalence≈20%), NAFLD12 represents fat in hepatocytes (steatosis) visualized, eg on ultrasound that cannot be attributed to other causes (most commonly alcohol so consider NAFLD if drink <18U/wk, <9U).
