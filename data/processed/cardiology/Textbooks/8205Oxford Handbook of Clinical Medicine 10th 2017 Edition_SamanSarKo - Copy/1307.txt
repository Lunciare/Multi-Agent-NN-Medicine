They can be classifi ed by: chronicity, function (sensory, motor, autonomic, mixed), or pathology (demyelination, axonal degeneration, or both). For example, Guillain– Barré syndrome (p702) is an acute, predominantly motor, demyelinating neurop athy, whereas chronic alcohol abuse leads to a chronic, initially sensory then mixed, axonal neuropathy. Diagnosis The history is vital: be clear about the time course, the precise nature of the symptoms, and any preceding or associated events (eg D&V before Guillain–Barré syndrome; weight in cancer; arthralgia from a connective tissue disease). Ask about travel, alcohol and drug use, sexual infections, and family history. If there is palpable nerve thickening think of leprosy or Charcot–Marie–Tooth. Examine other systems for clues to the cause, eg alcoholic liver disease. Tests FBC, ESR, glucose, U&E, LFT, TSH, B12, electrophoresis, ANA, ANCA, CXR, urinalysis, consider LP ± specifi c genetic tests for inherited neuropathies, lead level, antigan- glioside antibodies. Nerve conduction studies distinguish demyelinating from ax- onal causes. Sensory neuropathy: (Eg DM, CKD, leprosy.) Numbness; pins and
