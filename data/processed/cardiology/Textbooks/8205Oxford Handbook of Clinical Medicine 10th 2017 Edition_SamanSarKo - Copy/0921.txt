symptoms (fi g 8.49) Due to: • Marrow failure: anaemia (Hb), infection (WCC), and bleeding (platelets). • Infi ltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy—superfi cial or medi- astinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement—eg cranial nerve palsies, meningism. Common infections: Especially chest, mouth, perianal, and skin. Bacterial septi- caemia, zoster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (p400). Tests • Characteristic blast cells on blood fi lm and bone marrow. WCC usually high. • CXR and CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy. • Lumbar puncture should be performed to look for CNS involvement. Treatment Educate and motivate patient to promote engagement with therapy. • Support: Blood/platelet transfusion, IV fl uids, allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis syndrome). Insert a subcutaneous port system/Hickman line for IV access. • Infections: These are dangerous, due to neutropenia caused by the disease and treatment: give immediate IV antibiotics. Start the neutropenic regimen (p352) and give prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics. • Chemotherapy: Complex multi-drug, multi-phase regimens that may take years: • Remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + daunorubicin. • Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in ‘blocks’ over several weeks. • CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate ± CNS irradiation. • Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrex- ate (weekly),
