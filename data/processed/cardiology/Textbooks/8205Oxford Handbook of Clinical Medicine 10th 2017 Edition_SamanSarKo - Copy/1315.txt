Probable with lab support Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region, or upper motor neuron signs in ≥1 region + EMG shows acute denervation in ≥2 limbs. Possible Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region. Suspected Upper or lower motor neuron signs only—in 1 or more regions. Dignity and Dignitas ALS is closely linked with frontotemporal dementia (FTD, p486) by increasing clinical, genetic, and molecular evidence (nucleotide repeat expansions in gene C9orf72 have been described in familial and sporadic ALS and in FTD). However, pa- tients with MND often have no cognitive impairment in the early stages of the dis- ease, and witness their inorexable physical decline with terrifi ed awareness. For this reason it is imperative to plan for the future early: discuss their wishes for end-of-life care and in the eventuality of respiratory decline before it is too late for wishes to be communicated. These discussions are crucial but not binding: the patient can change their mind at any point, and also refuse any life-prolonging treatment, knowing the consequence is death. However, in most countries, in- cluding the UK, we cannot traverse that
