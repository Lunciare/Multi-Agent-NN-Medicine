(palpable S1); RV heave. On auscultation: loud S1; opening snap (pliable valve); rumbling mid-diastolic murmur (heard best in expiration, with patient on left side). Graham Steell murmur (p46) may occur. Severity: the more severe the stenosis, the longer the diastolic murmur, and the closer the opening snap is to S2. Tests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale; RVH; progressive RAD. CXR: left atrial enlargement (double shadow in right cardiac silhouette); pulmonary oedema; mitral valve calcifi cation. Echo is diagnostic. Signifi cant stenosis exists if the valve orifi ce is <1cm2/m2 body surface area. Indications for cardiac catheterization: previous valvotomy; signs of other valve disease; angina; severe pulmonary hypertension; calcifi ed mitral valve. Management: If in AF, rate control (p130) is crucial; anticoagulate with warfarin (p350). Diuretics  preload and pulmonary venous congestion. If this fails to control symptoms, balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calcifi ed valve), open mitral valvot- omy, or valve replacement. 4 In patients with severe symptoms for whom open surgery is too dangerous, consider transcatheter valve repair, eg with MitraClip®. This is only available in specialist centres. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 114444 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? 145 ‘For who loveth extreamely, and feeleth not that passion to dissolve
