life-threatening hypokalaemia. Faster rates risk cardiac dysrhythmias and asystole, and higher concentrations thrombophlebitis, depending on the size of the vein, so give con- centrated solutions >40mmol/L via a central venous catheter, and use ECG moni- toring for rates >10mmol/h. For symptoms and signs of hyper- and hypokalaemia see p674. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 666677 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 668 Electrolyte physiology and the kidney The kidney Controls the homeostasis of a number of serum electrolytes (includ- ing Na+, K+, Ca2+, and PO43Ω), helps to maintain acid–base balance, and is responsible for the excretion of many substances. It also makes erythropoietin and renin, and hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D (see p676 for Ca2+ and PO43Ω physiology). All of these functions can be aff ected in chronic kidney disease (p302), but it is the biochemical eff ects of kidney failure that are used to monitor disease progression. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system Plasma is fi ltered by the glomeruli, and Na+, K+, H+, and water are reabsorbed from this fi ltrate under the control of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus (fi g 7.13, p316) in response to low renal fl ow and raised sympathetic tone, and catalyses the conversion
