alternative. •Adrenal carcinoma: surgery ± post-operative adrenolytic therapy with mitotane—prognosis is poor. Secondary hyperaldosteronism Due to a high renin from renal perfusion, eg in renal artery stenosis, accelerated hypertension, diuretics, CCF, or hepatic failure. Bartter’s syndrome This is a major cause of congenital (autosomal recessive) salt wasting—via a sodium and chloride leak in the loop of Henle via mutations in channels and transporters. Presents in childhood with failure to thrive, polyuria, and polydipsia. BP is normal. Sodium loss leads to volume depletion, causing renin and aldosterone production, leading to hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, urinary K+ and ClΩ. Treatment: K+ replacement, NSAIDS (to inhibit prostaglandins), and ACE-i. Phaeochromocytoma Rare catecholamine-producing tumours. They arise from sympathetic paragan- glia cells (=phaeo chrome bodies), which are collections of chromaffi n cells. They are usually found within the adrenal medulla. Extra-adrenal tumours (para- gangliomas) are rarer, and often found by the aortic bifurcation (the organs of Zuckerkandl). Phaeochromocytomas roughly follow the 10% rule: 10% are malignant, 10% are extra-adrenal, 10% are bilateral, and 10% are familial. Re- cent data suggest higher preponderance in patients with genetic mutations aff ecting several genes including SDH (succinyl dehydrogenase). Thus, family his- tory is crucial and referral for genetic
