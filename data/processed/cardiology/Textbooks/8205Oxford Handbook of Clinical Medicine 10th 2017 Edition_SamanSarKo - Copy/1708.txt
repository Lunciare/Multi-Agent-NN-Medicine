Handbook of Clinical medicine

Skin and ulcer biopsy may be necessary—eg to assess for vasculitis (will need immunohistopathology) or malignant change in an established ulcer (Mar- jolin’s ulcer = SCC presenting in chronic wound). If ulceration is the fi rst sign of a suspected systemic disorder then further screening tests will be required. Management Managing ulcers is often diffi cult and expensive. Treat the cause(s) and focus on prevention. Optimize nutrition. Are there adverse risk factors (drug addiction, or risk factors for arteriopathy, eg smoking)? Get expert nursing care. Consider referral to specialist community nurse or leg ulcer/tissue viability clinic: • ‘Charing-Cross’ 4-layer compression bandaging is better than standard bandages (use only if arterial pulses OK: ABPI (p656) should be >0.8). Honey dressings can improve healing in mild–moderate burns, but as an adjuvant to compression bandaging for leg ulcers they do not signifi cantly improve healing rate. Negative pressure wound therapy (eg VAC®) helps heal diabetic ulcers. • Surgery, larval therapy, and hydrogels are used to debride sloughy necrotic tis- sue (avoid hydrogels in diabetic ulcers due to risk of wet gangrene). Routine use of antibiotics does not improve healing. Only use if there is infection (not colonization). 14 ’The fi rst sign of
