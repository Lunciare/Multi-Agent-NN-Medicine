Symptoms: Epigastric pain, vomiting; Tests: Upper GI endoscopy only if suspicious features (fi g 6.14). Treatment Lifestyle: Alcohol and tobacco. H. pylori eradication: Triple therapy is 80–85% eff ective at eradication.7 Drugs to reduce acid: PPIS are eff ective, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO for 4 (DU) or 8 (GU) wks. H2 blockers have a place (ranitidine 300mg each night PO for 8wks). Drug-induced ulcers: Stop drug if possible. PPIS may be best for treating and pre- venting GI ulcers and bleeding in patients on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Misopros- tol is an alternative with diff erent SE. If symptoms persist, re-endoscope, retest for H. pylori, and reconsider diff erential diagnoses (eg gallstones). Surgery: See p622. Complications Bleeding (p256), perforation (p606), malignancy, gastric outfl ow. Functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia Common. H. pylori eradication (only after a +ve result) may help. Some evidence favours PPIS and psychotherapy. Low-dose ami- triptyline (10–20mg each night PO) may help. Ant acids, antispasmodics, H2 blockers, misoprostol, prokinetic agents, bismuth, or sucralfate all have less evidence. 6 H. pylori is the commonest bacterial pathogen found worldwide (>50% of the world population over 40yrs has it). It’s a class I carcinogen causing gastritis (p252), duodenal/gastric ulcers & gastric cancer/
