used since the advent of MRA and CT angiography and perfusion techniques, though it has the advantage of allowing immediate therapy—eg coil embolization of saccular aneurysms. Radionuclide imaging (p738) PET is mostly used as a research tool in dementia, but perfusion scintigraphy scan be used in the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, and localizing epileptogenic foci. SPECT to visualize uptake of 123I- FP-CIT (DaTSCAN™) can be used to assess reduced striatal dopaminergic transport in Parkinson’s disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 774466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 747 Fig 16.39 Unenhanced axial CT head: note the old infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory.
