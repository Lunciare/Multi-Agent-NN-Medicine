(or problems with the ECG machine or stickers). Principles of management If the patient is unstable or you are uncertain of what to do, get help fast—the patient may be periarrest (p804). • Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly. • If in doubt, treat as ventricular tachycardia (VT)—the commonest cause. • Giving AVN blocking agents to treat SVT with aberrancy when the patient is in VT can cause dangerous haemodynamic instability. Treating for VT when the patient is actually in SVT has less potential for deterioration. • If WPW is suspected, avoid drugs that slow AV conduction—see p114. Diff erential diagnosis • Ventricular fi brillation—chaotic, no pattern, fi g 3.29. • Ventricular tachycardia (VT), fi gs 3.12, 3.30. • Torsade de pointes (polymorphic VT)—VT with varying axis (see fi g 3.31), may look like VF. QT interval is a predisposing factor. • Any cause of narrow complex tachycardias (p126) when in combination with bun- dle branch block or metabolic causes of broad QRS. • Antidromic AVRT (eg WPW), p127. Diff erentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy This may be diffi cult; seek expert help. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular arrhythmia), a
