and type 3 anti-arrhythmics (sotalol; amiodarone)—as well as nitrates as above-mentioned. Male hypogonadism Hypogonadism is failure of testes to produce testosterone, sperm, or both. Fea- tures: small testes, libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of pubic hair, muscle bulk, fat, gynaecomastia, osteoporosis, mood. If prepubertal: virilization; incomplete puberty; eunuchoid body; reduced secondary sex characteristics. Causes include: Primary hypogonadism is due to testicular failure, eg from •local trauma, tor- sion, chemotherapy/irradiation •post-orchitis, eg mumps, HIV, brucellosis, leprosy •renal failure, liver cirrhosis, or alcohol excess (toxic to Leydig cells) •chromosom- al abnormalities, eg Klinefelter’s syndrome (47XXY)—delayed sexual development, small testes, and gynaecomastia. Anorchia is rare. Secondary hypogonadism Gonadotropins (LH & FSH), eg from •hypo pituitarism •prolactinoma •Kallman’s syndrome—isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone defi ciency, often with anosmia and colour blindness •systemic illness (eg COPD; HIV; DM) •Laurence–Moon–Biedl and Prader–Willi syndromes (OHCS p648 & p652) •Age. : (p232) If total testosterone 8nmol/L, on 2 mornings (or <15 if LH too) and muscle bulk, testosterone may help, eg 1% dermal gel (Testogel®). Heart, bladder, and sex- ual fun ction may perk up in age-related hypogonadism. Beware medicalizing ageing! CI Ca2+; nephrosis; polycythaemia; prostate, breast or liver ca.
