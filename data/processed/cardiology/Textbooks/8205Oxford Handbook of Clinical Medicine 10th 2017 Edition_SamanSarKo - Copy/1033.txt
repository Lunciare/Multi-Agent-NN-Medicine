p24 antigen. This reduces the ‘window period’ (time of false-negative testing between infection and the production of measurable antigen/antibody) to average ~10 days. Diagnosis in UK is confi rmed by a confi rmatory assay. • Rapid point-of-care testing: Immunoassay kit which gives a rapid result from a fi nger-prick or mouth swab. Only CE-marked kits should be used. Needs serological confi rmation. • Viral load: Quantifi cation of HIV RNA. Used to monitor response to ART. Not diag- nostic due to possibility of a false-positive result  care if used to test for sympto- matic primary HIV in the ‘window period’—confi rmation of seroconversion is still required. • Nucleic acid testing/viral PCR: Qualitative test for the presence of viral RNA. Used to test for vertical transmission in neonates as placental transfer of maternal anti- bodies can aff ect ELISA antibody testing up to 18 months of age. • CD4 count: Cannot diagnose HIV. Used to monitor immune system function and disease progression in patients with HIV. <200 cells/microlitre is one of the defi ning criteria for AIDS. See www.aidsmap.com for available HIV testing and country-specifi c resources.
