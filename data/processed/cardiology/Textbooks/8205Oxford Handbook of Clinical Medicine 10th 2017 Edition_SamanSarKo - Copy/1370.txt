or venous thrombosis (consider if current or past central ve- nous access). SVC syndrome with airway compromise requires urgent treatment. Causes: >90% of SVC syndrome results from malignancy. Most common cancers: lung (~75%), lymphoma, metastatic (eg breast), thymoma, germ cell. Signs and symptoms: Diagnosis is made clinically. SOB, orthop noea, stridor, pleth- ora/cyanosis, oedema of face and arm, cough, headache, engorged neck veins (non- pulsatile JVP), engorged chest wall veins. Pemberton’s test:1 elevation of the arms to the side of the head causes facial plethora/cyanosis. Management: Prop up. Assess for hypoxia (pulse oximetry, blood gas) and give oxygen if needed. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h. CT is used to defi ne the anatomy of the obstruction. Balloon venoplasty and SVC stenting provide the most rapid relief of symptoms (see BOX ‘Interventional oncology’, p527). Treat with radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on the sensitivity of the underlying cancer. Malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia Most common metabolic abnormality in cancer patients: ~10–20% of patients with cancer, ~40% of myeloma. It is a poor prognostic sign: 75% mortality within 3 months. Calcium is highly protein-bound and needs correcting to the serum albumin concentration. PTH levels should be suppressed (see pp676–7). Causes: PTH-related protein produced by the tumour (see p529), local
