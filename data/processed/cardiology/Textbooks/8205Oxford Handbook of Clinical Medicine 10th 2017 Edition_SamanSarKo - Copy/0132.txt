pericardial constriction, or cardiac tamponade. Peripheral pulses (See p36.) See p771 for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. Waterhammer pulse The waterhammer was a popular toy that consisted of a vacuum tube half-fi lled with water. On inversion, the whoosh of water produced an intriguing hammer- blow as it rushed from end to end. This is the alternative name for Corrigan’s collapsing pulse—ie one in which the upstroke is abrupt and steep, whose peak is reached early and with abnormal force—before a rapid downstroke (as blood whooshes back into the left ventricle through an incompetent aortic valve).
