Includes individuals where risk traditionally lower: younger age, normotensive, no DM, non-obese. Contrib- uting factors: dyslipidaemia caused by ART, acceleration of pro-atherosclerotic infl ammatory processes by HIV. Management of CV risk factors although no out- come data to guide specifi c lipid and BP targets in HIV. • Bone disease: Increased risk of low bone-mineral density and fragility fractures in HIV. Contributing factors: side eff ect of ART, increased prevalence of risk fac- tors, eg poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol, low vitamin D levels. Risk assess and consider bisphosphonate. • TB: All patients with TB and HIV need ART (as soon as TB treatment tolerated and within 2 weeks if CD4 <100 cells/microlitre). Seek expert advice and refer to local guidelines. Consider Truvada® plus efavirenz as 1st line in UK (serum levels of integrase inhibitors are decreased by rifampicin). See ART, pp402–3, TB, pp394–5. • Hepatitis B (HBV): Co-infection requires an ART regimen including antivirals with anti-HBV activity, eg tenofovir
