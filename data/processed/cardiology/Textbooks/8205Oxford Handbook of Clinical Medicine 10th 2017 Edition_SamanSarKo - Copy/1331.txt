spots: fl at, coff ee-coloured patches of skin seen in 1st year of life (clearest in UV light), increasing in size and number with age. Adults have ≥6, >15mm across. They do not predispose to skin cancer. Freckling: typically in skin- folds (axillae, groin, neck base, and submammary area), and usually present by age 10. Dermal neurofi bromas: small, violaceous nodules, gelatinous in texture, which appear at puberty, and may become papillomatous. They are not painful but may itch. Numbers increase with age. Nodular neuro- fi bromas arise from nerve trunks. Firm and clearly demarcated, they can give rise to paraesthesiae if pressed.

Local effects of neurofi bromas: nerve root compression (weakness, pain, paraesthesiae); GI—bleeds, obstruction; bone—cystic lesions, scoliosis, pseudarth rosis. BP from renal artery ste- nosis or phaeochromo cytoma.
