U&E: K+ ≈ severe D&V. TSH: thyrotoxicosis. Coeliac serology: p266. • Stool: MC&S: bacterial pathogens, ova cysts, parasites, C. diff toxin (CDT, see BOX ‘Causes of diarrhoea’), viral PCR. Faecal elastase: if suspect chronic pancreatitis (ma- labsorption, steatorrhoea). • Lower GI endoscopy: (Malignancy? colitis?) If acutely unwell, limited fl exible sim- goidoscopy with biopsies.
