protocol), FBC (Hb>9, plt>100), clotting (PT and APTT <1.2), G&S. Written informed consent including possible com- plications: mild back/loin pain, visible haematuria (~5%, usually clears), bleeding, need for transfusion (~1%), angiographic intervention (~ ≤ 0.5%). Stop anticoagu- lants (aspirin 1 week, warfarin to PT <1.2, low-molecular-weight heparin 24h). Post-procedure: Bed rest for a minimum of 4h. Monitor pulse, BP, symptoms, and urine colour. Do not discharge home until macroscopic haematuria settled. Aspirin or warfarin can be restarted the next day if procedure uncomplicated. Result: Examination of glomerular lesions provides GN diagnosis. Includes: pro- portion of glomeruli involved (focal vs diff use), how much of each glomerulus is involved (segmental vs global), hypercellularity, sclerosis. Immunohistology for deposits (Ig, light chains, complement). Electron microscopy for ultrastructure: precise location of deposits, podocyte appearance. Also examines tubulointer- stitium (atrophy, fi brosis, infl ammation) and any vessels. Management General management as for CKD (pp304–5) including BP control and in- hibition of renin-angiotensin axis. Specifi c treatment including immunosuppression de- pends on histological diagnosis, disease severity, disease progression, and comorbidity. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331100 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Nephritic glomerulonephritis 311 Nephritic glomerulonephritides9 include: IgA nephropathy Commonest primary GN in high-income countries Presentation: Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria, or episodic
