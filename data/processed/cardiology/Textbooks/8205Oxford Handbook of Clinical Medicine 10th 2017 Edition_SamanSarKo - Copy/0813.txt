for gut involvement. Post-streptococcal GN Occurs after a throat (~ 2 weeks) or skin (~3–6 weeks) infection. Streptococcal antigen deposits in the glomerulus leading to immune complex formation and infl ammation. Presentation: Varies from haematuria to acute nephritis: haematuria, oedema, BP and oliguria. Diagnosis: Evidence of streptococcal infection: ASOT, anti-DNAse B. Also C3. Treatment: Supportive, antibiotics to clear the nephritogenic bacteria. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease Previously known as Goodpasture’s disease. Rare. Auto-antibodies to type IV colla- gen which is present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Presenta- tion: Renal disease (oliguria/anuria, haematuria, AKI, renal failure) and lung disease (pulmonary haemorrhage in 50–90%  SOB, haemoptysis). Dialysis-dependence at presentation and crescents on biopsy predict poor prognosis. Diagnosis: Anti-GBM in circulation/kidney (fi g 7.11). Treatment: Plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide. Rapidly progressive GN Any aggressive GN, rapidly progressing to renal failure over days or weeks. Causes include small vessel/ANCA vasculitis (p314), lupus nephritis (p314), anti-GBM disease. Other GNs may ‘transform’ to become rapidly progressive including IgA, membranous. Diagnosis: Breaks in the GBM allow an infl ux of infl ammatory cells so that crescents are seen on renal biopsy (may be referred to as crescentic GN) (fi g 7.12). Treatment: Corticosteroids and
