Breathing Assessment: determine respiratory rate, check bilateral chest move- ment, percuss, and auscultate. Management: if no respiratory eff ort, treat as arrest (see p894, fi g A3), intubate and ventilate. If breathing compromised, give high- concentration O2, manage according to fi ndings, eg relieve tension pneumothorax. Circulation Assessment: check pulse and BP; check if peripherally shut down; check capillary refi ll; look for evidence of haemorrhage. Management: if shocked, treat as on p790. If no cardiac output, treat as arrest (see p894, fi g A3).
