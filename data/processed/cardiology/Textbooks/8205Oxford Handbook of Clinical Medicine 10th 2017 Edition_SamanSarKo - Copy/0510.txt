May be needed for diagnosis. The histological changes observed on biopsy are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Management Supportive care: oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, opiates, palliative care input. All patients should be considered for current clinical trials or lung trans- plantation. 60 It is strongly recommended that high-dose steroids are not used except where the diagnosis of IPF is in doubt. Prognosis 50% 5yr survival rate (range 1–20yrs). A new treatment emerges for suff erers of IPF Nintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to slow disease progression and off er some hope to suff erers of IPF. Pirfenidone, an immunosuppressant and antifi brotic agent, showed a reduction in the rate of lung scarring and has been shown to improve life expectancy compared to best supportive care.61 Nintedanib targets three growth factor receptors involved in pulmonary fi brosis.
