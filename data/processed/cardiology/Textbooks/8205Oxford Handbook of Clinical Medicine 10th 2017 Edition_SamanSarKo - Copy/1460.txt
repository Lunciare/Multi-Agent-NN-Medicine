away from dwelling on fi nding a physical answer to their symptoms. Pathogenesis of fi bromyalgia The current hypothesis is that fi bromyalgia is caused by aberrant peripheral and central pain processing. Two key features of the condition are allodynia (pain in re- sponse to a non-painful stimulus) and hyperaesthesia (exaggerated perception of pain in response to a mildly painful stimulus), examined for by palpation of tender points. Research is beginning to suggest that certain antidepressants can relieve pain and other symptoms, and especially those that have both serotonergic and noradrenergic activity (tricyclics and venlafaxine). Those acting on serotonergic receptors only are less eff ective. There is also some evidence to support the use of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and spa therapies, which have been postulated to act through similar spinal pain-modulatory pathways.60 Thus far, trials have involved relatively small numbers of patients or short time periods, and lack the power to draw strong conclusions. However, it is interesting to note that the CSF of patients with fi bromyalgia appears to have increased levels of sub- stance P, while levels of noradrenaline and serotonin metabolites are decreased. All three are neurotransmitters involved in descending pain-modulatory pathways in the spinal
