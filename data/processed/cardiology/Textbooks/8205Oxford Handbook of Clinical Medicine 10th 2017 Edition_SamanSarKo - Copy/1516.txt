ischaemic events from distal emboli from dislodged thrombus; aorto-enteric fi stula. Colonic surgery Early: Sepsis;ileus;fi stulae;anastomotic leak (11% for radical rectal surgery); haemorrhage; trauma to ureters or spleen. Late: Adhesional obstruction (BOX). Small bowel surgery Short gut syndrome (best defi ned functionally, as ma- labsorption due to insuffi cient residual small bowel; adults with 150cm at risk). Diarrhoea and malabsorption (particularly of fats) lead to a number of metabolic abnormalities including defi ciency in vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, hyper oxaluria (causing renal stones), and bile salt depletion (causing gallstones). The management of short bowel syndrome is complex, aiming to correct metabolic abnormalities, optimize residual bowel function, and support nutrition (using parenteral route if necessary). Tracheostomy Mediastinitis; surgical emphysema. Later: stenosis. Splenectomy (p373.) Acute gastric dilatation (a serious consequence of not using a NGT, or to check that the one in place is working); thrombocytosis; sepsis. Lifetime sepsis risk is partly preventable with pre-op vaccines—ie Haemophilus type B, meningococcal, and pneumococcal(p407 & p167)and prophylactic penicillin. Genitourinary surgery Septicaemia (from instrumentation in the presence of in- fected urine)—consider a stat dose of gentamicin; urinoma—rupture of a ureter or renal pelvis leading to a mass of extravasated urine.
