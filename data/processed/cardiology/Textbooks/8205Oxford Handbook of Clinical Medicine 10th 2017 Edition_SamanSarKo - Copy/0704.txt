The pathway of bilirubin metabolism In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by hepatocytes, making it water-soluble. Conjugated bilirubin is secreted in bile and passes into the gut. Some is taken up again by the liver (via the enterohepatic circulation) and the rest is converted to urobilinogen by gut bacteria. Urobilinogen is either reabsorbed and excreted by the kidneys, or converted to stercobilin, which colours faeces brown. Fig 6.25 Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of haemoglobin in a 3-step process: hepatic uptake, con- jugation, and excretion. Causes of jaundice in a previously stable patient with cirrhosis • Sepsis (esp. UTI, pneumonia, or peritonitis) • Alcohol; drugs (table 6.10) • Malignancy: eg hepatocellular carcinoma • GI bleeding. Signs of decompensation: Jaundice; ascites; UGI bleed; encephalopathy. Table 6.10 Examples of drug-induced jaundice Haemolysis • Antimalarials (eg dapsone) Hepatitis • Paracetamol overdose (p844) • Sodium valproate • Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide • Halothane • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors • Statins • Flucloxacillin (may be weeks after )
