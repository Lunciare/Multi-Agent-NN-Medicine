These are guidelines and must be interpreted within the clinical context. Further investigations: If the patient has typical angina but few risk factors for IHD, be sure to look for possible precipitating or exacerbating factors, for example severe anaemia or cardiomyopathy.

Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal angina) Angina due to coronary artery spasm, which can occur even in normal coronary arteries. The pain usually occurs during rest and resolves rapidly with short-acting nitrates (eg GTN spray). ECG during pain shows ST segment elevation. Risks and triggers: Smoking increases risk but hypertension and hypercholester- olaemia do not. Probable triggers include cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, low magnesium, and artery instrumentation (eg during angiography). Treatment: Avoid triggers. Correct low magnesium. Stop smoking. PRN GTN.
