or carcinoma: Adrenalectomy: ‘cures’ adenomas but rarely cures cancer. Radiotherapy & adrenolytic drugs (mitotane) follow if carcinoma. • Ectopic ACTH: Surgery if tumour is located and hasn’t spread. Metyrapone, ketocon- azole, and fl uconazole cortisol secretion pre-op or if awaiting eff ects of radia- tion. Intubat ion + mifepristone (competes with cortisol at receptors) + etomidate (blo cks cortisol synthesis) may be needed, eg in severe ACTH-associated psychosis. Prognosis Untreated Cushing’s has vascular mortality.22 Treated, prognosis is good (but myopathy, obesity, menstrual irregularity, BP, osteoporosis, subtle mood chang- es and DM often remain—so follow up carefully, and manage individually). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Investigating suspected Cushing’s syndrome 225 First, confi rm the diagnosis (a raised plasma cortisol), then localize the source on the basis of laboratory testing. Use imaging studies to confi rm the likely source. 1st-line tests Overnight dexamethasone suppression test is a good outpatient test. Dexamethasone 1mg PO at midnight; do serum cortisol at 8AM. Normally, cortisol suppresses to <50nmol/L; no suppression in Cushing’s syndrome. False Ωve rate: <2%; false +ves: 2% normal, 13% obese, and 23% of inpatients. NB: false +ves (pseudo- Cushing’s) are seen in depression, obesity, alcohol excess, and inducers of liver enzymes (rate
