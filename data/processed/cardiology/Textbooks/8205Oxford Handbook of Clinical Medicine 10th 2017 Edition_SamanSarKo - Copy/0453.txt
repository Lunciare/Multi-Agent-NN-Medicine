Physiotherapy (postural drainage, airway clearance techniques). Antibiotics are given for acute infective exacerbations and prophylacti- cally. Chronic Pseudomonas infection is an important predictor of survival. Muco- lytics may be useful (eg DNase, ie Dornase alfa, 2.5mg daily nebulized, or nebulized hypertonic saline). Bronchodilators. Annual CXR surveillance is recommended. Gas- trointestinal: Malabsorption, GORD, distal obstruction syndrome. Pancreatic enzyme replacement; fat-soluble vitamin suppl ements (A, D, E, K); ursodeoxycholic acid for impaired liver function; cirrhosis may require liver transplantation. Other: Treatment of CF-related diabetes (screen annually with OGTT from 12yrs); screening/treatment of osteoporosis (DEXA bone scanning); arthritis, sinusitis, and vasculitis; fertility and genetic counselling. Advanced lung disease: Oxygen, diuretics (cor pulmonale); non- invasive ventilation; lung or heart/lung transplantation (post-transplant survival 5 years). Prognosis: Median survival is now ~ 41yrs in the UK, although a baby born today would expect to live longer. Mutation-specifi c therapies for cystic fi brosis Ivacaftor and lumacaftor target the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, targets gating defects in disease causing CFTR mutations including G551D. Ivacaftor increases the open probability of CFTR channels and has been shown to improve clinical outcomes (lung function, weight, lung disease stability) in CF patients >6 years old.19 Lumacaftor is a CFTR
