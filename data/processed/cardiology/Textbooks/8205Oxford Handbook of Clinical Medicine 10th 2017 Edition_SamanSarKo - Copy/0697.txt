Prognosis Often dismal. Mean survival <6 months. 5yr survival: 3%. Overall 5yr sur- vival after Whipple’s procedure 5–14%. Prognosis is better if: tumour <3cm; no nodes involved; Ωve resection margins at surgery; ampullary or islet cell tumours. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227700 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Carcinoid tumours 271 This is a specialized area! A diverse group of tumours of enterochromaffi n cell (neu- ral crest) origin, by defi nition capable of producing 5HT. Common sites: appendix (45%), ileum (30%), or rectum (20%).22 They also occur elsewhere in the GI tract, ovary, testis, and bronchi. 80% of tumours >2cm across will metastasize (ie consider all as malignant). Symptoms and signs Initially few. GI tumours can cause ap- pendicitis, intussusception, or obstruction. Hepatic metastases may cause RUQ pain. Tumours may secrete bradykinin, tachykinin, substance P, VIP, gastrin, insulin, gluca- gon, ACTH ( Cushing’s syndrome), parathyroid, and thyroid hormones. 10% are part of MEN-1 syndrome (p223); 10% occur with other neuroendocrine tumours. Carcinoid syndrome Occurs in ~5% and implies hepatic involvement. Symptoms and signs: Bronchoconstriction; paroxysmal
