progress to type I respiratory failure (p188). Blue bloaters: Have alveolar ventilation, with a low PaO2 and a high PaCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on to develop cor pulmonale. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO2 and they rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory eff ort (p188)—supplemental oxygen should be given with care. Symptoms Cough; sputum; dyspnoea; wheeze. Signs Tachypnoea; use of accessory muscles of respiration; hyperinfl ation; cricosternal distance (<3cm); expansion; resonant or hyperresonant percussion note; quiet breath sounds (eg over bullae); wheeze; cyanosis; cor pulmonale. Complications Acute exacerbations ± infection; polycythaemia; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale (oedema; JVP); pneumothorax (ruptured bullae); lung carcinoma. Tests FBC: PCV. CXR: Hyperinfl ation; fl at hemidiaphragms; large central pulmonary arteries; peripheral vascular markings; bullae. CT: Bronchial wall thickening; scar- ring; air space enlargement. ECG: Right atrial and ventricular hypert rophy (cor pulmonale). ABG: PaO2 ± hypercapnia. Spirometry (p162, p165): obstructive + air trapping (FEV1 <80% of predicted, FEV1 : FVC ratio <70%, TLC, RV, DLCO in emphy- sema—see p160). Learn how to do spirometry from an experienced person: ensure maximal expiration of the full breath (it takes >4s; it’s not a quick puff out). Treatment Chronic
