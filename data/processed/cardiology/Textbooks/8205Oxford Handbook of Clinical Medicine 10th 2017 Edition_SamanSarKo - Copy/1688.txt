The testis may lie high and transversely. Torsion may occur at any age but is most common at 11–30yrs. With intermittent torsion the pain may have passed on presentation, but if it was severe, and the lie is horizontal, prophylactic fi xing may be wise.  : The main one is epididymo-orchitis (p650) but with this the patient tends to be older, there may be symptoms of urinary infection, and more gradual onset of pain. Also consider tumour, trauma, and an acute hydrocele.

Its tiny blue nodule may be discernible under the scrotum. It is thought to be due to the surge in gonado- trophins which signal the onset of puberty.
