Causes: Bullet, stab, tumour, disc hernia, my- elitis,12 septic emboli. Imaging: MRI. Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, 1817–1894 (Mauritian neurologist) Budd–Chiari syndrome Hepatic vein obstruction by thrombosis or tumour causes congestive ischaemia and hepatocyte damage. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, as- cites, and ALT occur. Portal hyperte nsion occurs in chronic forms. Causes: Include hypercoag ulable states (combined OCP, pregnancy, malignancy, paroxysmal noc- turnal haemoglobin uria, polycythaemia, thrombophilia), TB, liver, renal, or adrenal tumour. Tests: USS + Dopplers, CT, or MRI. Angioplasty or a transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt (TIPSS) may be needed. Anticoagulate (lifelong) unless there are varices. Consider liver transplant in fulminant hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis.13 George Budd, 1808–1882 (British physician); Hans Chiari,
