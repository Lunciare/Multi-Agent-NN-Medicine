Lange-Nielsen syndrome Congenital, bilateral, autosomal recessive, sensorineural deafness, and long QT interval (p96, hence syncope, VT, torsades, ± sud- den death—50% by age 15 if untreated). KCNQ1 or KCNE1 gene mutation causes K+ chan- nelopathy. : -blocker, pacemaker, ICD, cochlear implants.47 Anton Jervell, 1901–1987; Fred Lange-Nielsen, 1919–1989 (Norwegian physicians) Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) A spindle-cell tumour derived from capillary endotheli al cells, caused by human herpes virus 8 (=Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus KSHV). It presents as purple papules (½–1cm) or plaques on skin (fi g 15.7) and mucosa (look in mouth, but any organ). It metastasizes to nodes. There are four types: 1 Clas- sic, a rare disease of the elderly. 2 Endemic, a disease of children documented prior to HIV. 3 Iatrogenic KS due to immunosuppression, eg organ transplant recipients. 4 AIDS-associated KS. Usually presents with low CD4 count and can indicate failure of HAART (p402). However ⅓ presents in HIV with near normal CD4 counts and an undetectable viral load. Initiation of HAART with rapid immune system constitution can precipitate KS. Lung KS may present in HI V +ve men and women as dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Bowel KS may cause nausea, abdominal pain. Rare sites: CNS, larynx, eye, glands,
