name (bioavailability variable). Also useful as an adjunct if inhaled therapy is inadequate. In acute severe asthma, it may be given IVI. It has a narrow therapeutic ratio, causing arrhythmias, GI upset, and fi ts in the toxic range. Check theophylline levels (p756), and do ECG monitoring and check plasma levels after 24h if IV therapy is used. Anticholinergics: (Eg ipratropium, tiotropium.) May muscle spasm synergistically with 2-agonists but are not recommended in current guidelines for chronic asthma. They may be of more benefi t in COPD. Cromoglicate (Mast cell stabilizer.) May be used as prophylaxis in mild and exercise- induced asthma (always inhaled), especially in children. It may precipitate asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists: (Eg oral montelukast, zafi rlukast.) Block the ef- fects of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the airways by antagonizing the CystLT1 receptor. Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody: Omalizumab 36 may be of use in highly selected patients with persistent allergic asthma. Given as a subcutaneous injection every 2–4 wks depending on dose. Specialists prescribe only. 3 Integrated breathing and relaxation training (Papworth method) is psychological and physical: patients learn to drop their shoulders, relax their abdomen, and breathe calmly and appropriately. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 118822 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC Table 4.6 Adult
