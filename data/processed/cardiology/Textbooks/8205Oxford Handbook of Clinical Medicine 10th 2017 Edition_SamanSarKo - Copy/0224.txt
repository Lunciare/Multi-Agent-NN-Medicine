is pale, pulseless, painful, paralysed, paraesthetic, and ‘perishingly cold’ this is acute ischaemia and is a surgical emergency (see p595 and p657). 1 Inspection: Look for scars of previous surgery and signs of peripheral arterial disease; loss of hair, pallor, shiny skin, cyanosis, dry skin, scaling, deformed toe- nails, ulcers, gangrene. Be sure to inspect the pressure points, ie between the toes and under the heel. 2 Palpation: Skin temperature will be cool in peripheral arterial disease. Is there a level above which it is warm? Delayed capillary refi ll (>2s) also indicates arte- rial disease. Are peripheral pulses palpable or not? ‘If you cannot count it, you are not feeling it.’ Note down on a quick stick-man diagram where they become palpable. Check for atrial fi brillation or other arrhythmias, as these can be the cause of embolic disease. Palpate for an enlarged abdominal aorta and attempt to assess size. (Though don’t press too fi rmly!) An expansile pulsatile mass in the presence of abdominal symptoms is a ruptured aneurysm until proven otherwise. 3 Auscultation: The presence of bruits suggests arterial disease. Listen over the major arteries—carotids, abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac femorals. 4 Special tests: Buerger’s angle is
