hormone replacement may be required. Hypothyroidism in ~50% after neck treatment: check TFTs annually. • Secondary cancers: Risk (2–4 per 10 000 person-years) is usually insignifi cant compared to recurrence/death from primary lesion. More important for younger patients after curative treatment. Women <35yrs receiving radiotherapy for Hodg- kin’s lymphoma should be off ered breast screening from 8yrs after treatment.  Cancer survival means  numbers living with poor health or disability after treat- ment (~625 000 in UK). Remember the emotional and physical impact of cancer ex- tends beyond the prescribed course of radiotherapy/chemotherapy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 552266 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 erac evitaillap dna ygolocnO Methods of delivering radiotherapy 527 Conventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT): Is the most common form of treatment. Delivers beams of ionizing radiation to the patient from an external linear accelerator. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate form of EBRT used to target small lesions with great precision—most frequently in treating intracranial tumours. It is often referred to by the manufacturer’s name, eg Gamma Knife®, Truebeam®. Brachytherapy involves a radiation source being placed within or close to a tumour, allowing a high local radiation dose. Implants may be placed within a cavity (eg uterus, post-surgical space) or within tissue
