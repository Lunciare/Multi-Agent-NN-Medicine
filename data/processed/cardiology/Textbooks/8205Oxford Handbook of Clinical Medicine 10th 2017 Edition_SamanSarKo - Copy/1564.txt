External beam radiot herapy may prevent regional recurrence. 4 Lymphoma: (5%.) :≈3:1. May present with stridor or dysphagia. Do full stag- ing pre-treatment (chemoradiotherapy). Assess histology for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) origin (associated with a good prognosis). 5 Anaplastic: Rare. :≈3:1. Elderly, poor response to any treatment. In the absence of unresectable disease, excision + radiotherapy may be tried. Thyroid surgery Plays a signifi cant role in the management of thyroid disease. Operations include partial lobectomy or lobectomy (for isolated nodules); and thy- roidectomy (for cancers, MNG, or Graves’). Indications: Pressure symptoms, relapse hyperthyroidism after >1 failed course of drug treatment, carcinoma, cosmetic reasons, symptomatic patients planning pregnancy. Pre-operative management: Render euthyroid pre-op with antithyroid drugs (eg carbimazole up to 20mg/12h PO or p ropylthiouracil 200mg/12h PO but stop 10d prior to surgery as these increase vas- cularity). Propranolol up to 80mg/8h PO can be used to control tachycardia or tremor associated with hyperthyroidism (continue for 5d post-op). Check vocal cords by in- direct laryngoscopy pre- and post-op (risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). Check serum Ca2+ (and PTH if abnormal). Complications: see p580. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 660000 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 601 Fig 13.21 The anatomy of the region of the thyroid
