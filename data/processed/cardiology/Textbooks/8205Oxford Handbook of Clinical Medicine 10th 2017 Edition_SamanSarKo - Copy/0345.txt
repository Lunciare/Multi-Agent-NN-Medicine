would not be expected if the QRS breadth were down to bundle branch block or metabolic causes. Fig 3.34 Bigeminy—a normal QRS is followed by a ventricular ectopic beat * then a compensatory pause, this pattern then repeats. The ectopic beats have the same morphology as each other so probably all share an origin. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112299 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 130 Atrial fi brillation (AF) and fl utter AF25 is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm at 300–600bpm (fi g 3.35); the AV node re- sponds inter mittently, hence an irregular ventricular rhythm. Cardiac output drops by 10–20% as the ventricles aren’t primed reliably by the atria. AF is common in the el- derly (≤9%). The main risk is embolic stroke. Warfarin reduces this to 1%/yr from 4%. So, do an ECG on everyone with an irregular pulse (±24h ECG if dizzy, faints, palpita- tions, etc.). If AF started more than 48h ago, intracardiac clots may have formed, ne- cessitating anticoagulation prior to cardioversion. see BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’.
