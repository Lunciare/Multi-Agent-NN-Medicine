Ettore Marchiafava, 1847–1935; Amico Bignami, 1862–1929 (Italian pathologists) Marchiafava–Micheli syndrome (Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, PNH.) An acquired clonal expansion of a multipotent stem cell manifesting with haemolytic anaemia (from complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis), large vessel throm- boses and defi cient haematopoiesis (ranging from mild to pancytopenia). See BOX, ‘Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobulinuria’ fi g 15.8, and p338.

Cells lack the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that binds the surface proteins to cell membranes. This causes uncontrolled amplifi cation of the complement system and leads to destruction of the RBC membrane and release of haemoglobin into the circulation (fi g 15.8). NB: the phenomenom of haemoglobinuria3 is not all that reliable. A much better test even than a marrow biopsy (right-hand panel, show- ing a clone of PNH cells) is fl ow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored proteins on peripheral blood cells. This can determine the size of the PNH clone and type of GPI defi ciency (complete or partial). :
