(IPF, p200). • Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. • Non-specifi c interstitial pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) In sensitized individuals, repetitive inhalation of allergens (fungal spores or avian proteins) provokes a hypersensitivity reaction which varies in intensity and clini- cal course depending on the antigen. In the acute phase, the alveoli are infi ltrated with acute infl ammatory cells. Early diagnosis and prompt allergen removal can halt and reverse disease progression, so prognosis can be good. With chronic exposure, granuloma formation and obliterative bronchiolitis occur. Causes • Bird-fancier’s and pigeon-fancier’s lung (proteins in bird droppings). • Farmer’s and mushroom worker’s lung (Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactino- myces vulgaris). • Malt worker’s lung (Aspergillus clavatus). • Bagassosis or sugar worker’s lung (Thermoactinomyces sacchari ). Clinical features 4–6h post-exposure: Fever, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, dyspnoea, fi ne bibasal crackles. Chronic: Finger clubbing (50%), increasing dyspnoea, weight, exertional dyspnoea, type I respiratory failure, cor pulmonale. Tests Acute: Blood: FBC (neutrophilia); ESR; ABGS; serum antibodies (may indicate exposure/previous sensitization rather than disease). CXR: upper-zone mottling/con- solidation; hilar lymph adenopathy (rare). Lung function tests: Reversible restrictive defect; reduced gas transfer during acute attacks. Chronic: Blood tests: serum anti- bodies. CXR: upper-zone fi brosis; honeycomb lung. CT chest: nodules, ground
