other signs, see pp484, 490–3. An EEG can be very helpful. Could the patient be pregnant (any pelvic mass)? If so, eclampsia (OHCS p48) is the likely diagnosis, check the urine and BP: call a senior obstetrician—immediate delivery may be needed. Investigations • Bedside glucose, the following tests can be done once  has started: lab glucose, ABG, U&E, Ca2+, FBC, ECG. • Consider anticonvulsant levels, toxicology screen, LP, culture blood and urine, EEG, CT, carbon monoxide level. • Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor. Management See fi g 19.20. Basic life support—and these agents:14 1 Lorazepam: 0.1mg/kg (usually 4mg) as a slow bolus into a large vein. If no re- sponse after 10–20min give a second dose. Beware respiratory arrest during the last part of the injection. Have full resuscitation facilities to hand for all IV benzodi- azepine use. The rectal route is an alternative for diazepam if IV access is diffi cult. Buccal midazolam is an easier to use oral alternative where no IV access (eg in a community setting); dose for those 10yrs old and older 10mg; if 1–5yrs 5mg, if 5–10yrs 7 . 5mg; squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on each side.
