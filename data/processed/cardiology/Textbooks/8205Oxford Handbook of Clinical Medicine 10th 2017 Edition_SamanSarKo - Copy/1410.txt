It suggests irritation to the sciatic nerve. The main cause is lumbar disc prolapse. Also femoral stretch test (L2–L4): pain in front of thigh on lifting the hip into extension with the patient lying face downwards and the knee fl exed. 5 Signs of generalized disease—eg malignancy. Examine other systems (eg abdo- men) as pain may be referred. Causes Age determines the most likely causes: 15–30yrs: Prolapsed disc, trauma, fractures, ankylosing spondylitis (AS; p550), spondylolisthesis (a forward shift of one vertebra over another, which is congenital or due to trauma), pregnancy. 30–50yrs: Degenerative spinal disease, prolapsed disc, malignancy (primary or secondary from lung, breast, prostate, thyroid, or kidney ca). >50yrs: Degenerative, osteoporotic vertebral collapse, Paget’s (see p685), malig- nancy, myeloma (see p368), spinal stenosis. Rarer: Cauda equina tumours, psoas abscess, spinal infection (eg discitis, usually staphy- lococcal but also Proteus, E. coli, S. typhi, and TB—there are often no systemic signs).
