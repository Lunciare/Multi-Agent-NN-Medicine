removal/exchange of the device whenever possible. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): VAP aff ects up to 20% of patients admitted to intensive care units. Occurs as the endotracheal tube interferes with protective upper airway refl exes and fa- cilitates microaspiration. Risks  with non-invasive ventilation. In critical illness, the oropharynx becomes contaminated with GramΩve bacteria due to antibiotic exposure, altered host defences, and changes in mucosal adherence. Access to the airway occurs via folds in the endotracheal cuff and the bacterial biofi lm is then propelled to the distal airways. Organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p391), Enterobacteriaceae (p391), and Staphylococcus aureus (p388). Clinical diagnosis has sensitivity and specifi city. Suspect if new/persistent in- fi ltrates on CXR plus two or more of: purulent sputum, leucocytosis (>12≈109/L), leucopenia (<4≈109/L), temperature >38.3°C. Prevent by reducing colonization (mouthwash, silver-coated endotracheal tubes), nurse at 45° to  aspiration risk, wean off ventilator as soon as possible.. Surgical site infection: Aff ects 5% of patients undergoing surgical procedures, contributes to >⅓ of post- operative deaths. Common organisms include Staphylococcus aureus (p388), Streptococcus pyogenes (p388), and Enterobacteriaceae when surgery involves entry to hollow viscera (p391). Prevention methods include hand hygiene, strict asepsis, MRSA screening and decolonization, hair removal, peri-operative
