you are aspirating is pure blood (eg on entering a ventricle), see if it clots (heavily bloodstained pericardial fl uid does not clot), or measure its PCV (though this may be diffi cult in the acute setting but some blood gas analysers may give this). • You can leave the cannula in situ temporarily, for repeated aspiration. If there is reaccumulation, insert a drain but perica rdiectomy may be needed. • Send fl uid for microscopy and culture, as needed, including tests for TB. Complications: Laceration of ventricle or coronary artery (± subsequent haemo- pericardium); aspiration of ventricular blood; arrhythmias (ventricular fi brillation); pneumothorax; puncture of aorta, oesophagus (± mediastinitis), or peritoneum (± peritonitis).

In an emergency, the procedure can be done using the landmark method (see p775), though NICE recommends that all routine internal jugular catheters should be placed with US guidance. Even if the line is not placed under direct US visualization, a look
