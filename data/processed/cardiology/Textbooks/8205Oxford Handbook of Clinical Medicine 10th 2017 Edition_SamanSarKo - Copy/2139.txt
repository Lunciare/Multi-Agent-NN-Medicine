Parkinson’s. • Excess heat loss: psoriasis and any other widespread dermatological diseases (ie TEN/ erythrodermic eczema). • Cold awareness: dementia, confusion. • Increased exposure to cold: falls, especially at night when cold. • Drugs: major tranquillizers, antidepressants, diuretics, alcohol. The patient • If the patient is shivering then the hypothermia is mild, if they are not shivering despite temp <35°C then the hypothermia is severe. • Symptoms and signs include confusion, agitation, GCS, coma, bradycardia, hypo- tension and arrhythmias (AF, VT, VF), especially if temp <30°C. There are many stories of people ‘returning to life’ when warmed despite absence of vital signs, see BOX. It is essential to rewarm (see ‘Treatment’ later in topic) and re-examine. Diagnosis Check oral or axillary T°. If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5°C, use a low-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35°C? Infra-red ear thermometers can accurately refl ect core temperature. Tests Urgent U&E, plasma glucose, and amylase. Thyroid function tests; FBC; blood cultures. Consider blood gases. The ECG may show J-waves (fi g 19.28). Treatment Use ABCDE approach (p779)—but don’t expose to cold. • All patients should receive warm, humidifi ed O2; ventilate if comatose or respira- tory insuffi ciency. • Remove wet clothing,
