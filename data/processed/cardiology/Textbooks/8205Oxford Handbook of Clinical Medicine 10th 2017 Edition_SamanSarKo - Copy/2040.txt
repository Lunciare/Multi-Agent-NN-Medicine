Also valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and malignant hypertension. • ARDS (p186) from any cause, eg trauma, malaria, drugs. Look for predisposing fac- tors, eg trauma, post-op, sepsis. Is aspirin overdose or glue-sniffi ng/drug abuse likely? Ask friends/relatives. • Fluid overload. • Neurogenic, eg head injury. Diff erential diagnosis Asthma/COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema are often hard to distinguish, especially in the elderly, where they may coexist. If the patient is extremely unwell and you are not sure, consider treating all three (eg with salbuta- mol nebulizer, furosemide IV, diamorphine, amoxicillin—p386). Symptoms Dyspnoea, orthopnoea (eg paroxysmal), pink frothy sputum. NB: note drugs recently given and other illnesses (recent MI/COPD or pneumonia). Signs Distressed, pale, sweaty, pulse, tachypnoea, pink frothy sputum, pulsus alter- nans, JVP, fi ne lung crackles, triple/gallop rhythm (p44), wheeze (cardiac asthma). Usually sitting up and leaning forward. Quickly examine for possible causes. Investigations • CXR (p135, pp722–4): cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary oedema: look for shadowing (usually bilateral), small eff usions at costophrenic angles, fl uid in the lung fi ssures, and Kerley B lines (septal linear opacities). • ECG: signs of
