(radon gas). Histology: Clinically the most important division is between small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC). NSCLC: Squamous (35%); adenocarcinoma (27%), large cell (10%); adenocarcinoma in situ (rare, <1%). Small cell (oat cell) (20%): Arise from endocrine cells (Kulchitsky cells), often secreting polypeptide hormones resulting in paraneoplastic syndromes (eg production of ACTH, Cushing’s syndrome). Most (70%) SCLC are disseminated at presentation. Symptoms: Cough (80%); haemoptysis (70%); dyspnoea (60%); chest pain (40%); recurrent or slowly resolving pneumonia; lethargy, anorexia; weight loss. Signs: Cachexia; anaemia; clubbing; HPOA (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropa- thy, causing wrist pain); supraclavicular or axillary nodes. Chest signs: none, or con- solidation; coll apse; pleural eff usion. Metastases: bone tenderness; hepatomegaly; confusion; fi ts; focal CNS signs; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy; peripheral neuropathy. Complications: Local: recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; phrenic nerve palsy; SVC obstruction; Horner’s syndrome (Pancoast’s tumour); rib erosion; pericarditis; AF. Metastatic: brain; bone (bone pain, anaemia, Ca2+); liver; adrenals (Addison’s). Non- metastatic neurological: confusion; fi ts; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy; neuropathy; polymyositis; Lambert–Eaton syndrome (p512). See table 4.3. Tests: CXR: peripheral nodule (fi g 4.8); hilar enlargement; consolidation; lung col- lapse; pleur al eff usion; bony secondaries. Cytology: sputum and pleural fl uid (send at least 20mL).
