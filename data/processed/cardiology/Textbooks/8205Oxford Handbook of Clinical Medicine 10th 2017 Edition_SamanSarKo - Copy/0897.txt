Fibrinolysis The fi brinolytic system works by generating plasmin, which causes fi brin dissolution. The process starts with the release of tissue plasminogen activa- tor (t-PA) from endothelial cells, a process stimulated by fi brin formation. t-PA converts inactive plasminogen to plasmin which can then cleave fi brin, as well as several other factors. t-PA and plasminogen both bind fi brin thus localizing fi brinolysis to the area of the clot. Fibrinolytic agents activate this system and can be utilized in order to break down pathological thrombi, eg in: acute MI, acute ischaemic stroke, DVT, PE, and central retinal venous or arterial thrombosis. In all cases the risk of adverse eff ects of thrombolysis (eg haemorrhage) must be outweighed by the poten- tial benefi ts. Streptokinase, a streptococcal exotoxin that binds and activates plasminogen, was the fi rst licensed agent but risks anaphylaxis on repeat dosing. Alteplase is recombinant t-PA. Newer agents include tenecteplase and reteplase. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) ITP is caused by antiplatelet auto anti bodies. It is acute (usually
