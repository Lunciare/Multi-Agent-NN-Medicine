incontinence. Troublesome incontinence needs specialist assessment. Incontinence in women Often under-reported with delays before seeking help. • Functional incontinence: Ie when physiological factors are relatively unimportant. The patient is ‘caught short’ and too slow in fi nding the toilet because of (for exam- ple) immobility, or unfamiliar surroundings. • Stress incontinence: Leakage from an incompetent sphincter, eg when intra- abdominal pressure rises (eg coughing, laughing). Increasing age and obesity are risk factors. The key to diagnosis is the loss of small (but often frequent) amounts of urine when coughing etc. Examine for pelvic fl oor weakness/prolapse/pelvic masses. Look for cough leak on standing and with full bladder. Stress incontinence is common in pregnancy and following birth. It occurs to some degree in ~50% of post-menopausal women. In elderly women, pelvic fl oor weakness, eg with uterine prolapse or urethrocele (OHCS p290), is a very common association. • Urge incontinence/overactive bladder syndrome:The urge to urinate is quickly followed by uncon t rollable and sometimes complete emptying of the bladder as the detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home (latchkey incontinence, a conditioned refl ex); cold; the sound of running water; caf- feine; and obesity.  : urodynamic studies. Cause:
