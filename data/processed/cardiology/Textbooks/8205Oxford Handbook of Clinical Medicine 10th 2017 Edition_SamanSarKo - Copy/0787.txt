review: look out for more than is immediately obvious, consider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive of systemic disorder (‘When did you last feel well?’) and malignancy. • Current state: Patients may have symptomatic CKD if GFR <30. Includes symp- toms of fl uid overload (SOB, peripheral oedema), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, rest- less legs, fatigue, weakness, pruritus, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence. Examination • Periphery: Peripheral oedema. Signs of peripheral vascular disease or neuropa- thy. A vasculitic rash. Gouty tophi. Joint disease. Arteriovenous fi stula (thrill, bruit, recently needling?). Signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids, skin malignancy. Uraemic fl ap/encephalopathy if GFR <15. • Face: Anaemia, xanthelasma, yellow tinge (uraemia), jaundice (hepatorenal), gum hypertrophy (ciclosporin), Cushingoid (steroids), periorbital oedema (ne- phrotic syndrome), taut skin/telangiectasia (scleroderma), facial lipodystrophy (glomerulonephritis). • Neck: JVP for fl uid state, tunnelled line (if removed, look for small scar over in- ternal jugular, and a larger scar in ‘breast pocket’ area), scar from parathyroid- ectomy, lymphadenopathy. • Cardiovascular: BP, sternotomy, cardiomegaly, stigmata of endocarditis. If right-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not refl ect fl uid state. • Respiratory: Pulmonary oedema or eff usion. • Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous
