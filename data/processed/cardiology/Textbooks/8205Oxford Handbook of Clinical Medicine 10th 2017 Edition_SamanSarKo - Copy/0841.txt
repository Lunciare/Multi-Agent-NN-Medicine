cell cancers). Manage by screening for tumours. Possibility of future therapies which inhibit growth factor signalling. Alport syndrome 1 in 5000. ~80–85% X-linked. Due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene, which encodes the 5 chain of type IV collagen. Haematuria, proteinuria, and progressive renal insuffi - ciency. Average age of renal failure in men 30–40yrs. Female ‘carriers’ can exhibit the phenotype, renal failure in ~30% by 60yrs. High-tone sensorineural hearing loss. An- terior lenticonus: bulging of lens seen on slit-lamp examination (see OHCS p638). Type IV collagen is the antigen in anti-GBM disease (p311) so there is a risk of anti-GBM dis- ease following transplantation as the graft type IV collagen is recognized as ‘foreign’. Fabry disease 1 in 40 000–120 000. X-linked. Lysosomal storage disorder due to a defi ciency of the enzyme -galactosidase-A. Causes proteinuria and progressive renal failure in most men and some female ‘carriers’. Lipid deposits are seen in urine and on renal biopsy (‘zebra body’). Treatment with IV enzyme replacement can stabilize kidney function if proteinuria controlled to <1g/24h. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332200 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Cystinuria 321 1 in 17 000. Autosomal recessive defect prevents reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids in proximal tubule.
