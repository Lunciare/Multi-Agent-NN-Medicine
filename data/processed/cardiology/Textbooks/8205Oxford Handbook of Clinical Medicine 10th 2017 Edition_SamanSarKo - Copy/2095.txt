Discuss with neurosurgical unit all with signifi cant abnormalities on CT or with eg persistent GCS ≤8 or deteriorating GCS (especially motor component), persistent confusion, progressive focal neurology, seizure without full recovery, penetrating injuries, or CSF leak. If transfer is required, ensure skilled medical escort and consider need for intubation prior to transfer. Complications Early: Extradural/subdural haemorrhage, seizures. Late: Subdural (p482), seizures, diabetes insipidus, parkinsonism, dementia. Indicators of a bad prognosis Old age, decerebrate rigidity, extensor spasms, prolonged coma, BP, PaO2 (on blood gases), T° >39°C. 60% of those with loss of consciousness of >1 month will survive 3–25yrs, but may need daily nursing care. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Immediate management plan for head injury 829 ABC Oxygen if saturations <92% or hypoxic on ABG Intubate and hyperventilate if necessary Immobilize neck until injury to cervical spine excluded Stop blood loss and support circulation Treat for shock if required (p790) Treat seizures with lorazepam ± phenytoin (p826) Assess level of consciousness (GCS): If GCS ≤8 ICU involvement to manage airway Assess for anterograde and retrograde amnesia Rapid examination survey Investigations: U&ES, glucose, FBC, blood alcohol, toxicology
