Pouches mean stoma reversal and the possibility of long-term continence but pouch opening frequency may still be around 6≈/day and recurrent pouchitis can be troublesome (give antib iotics, eg metronidazole + ciprofl oxacin for 2wks). Diagnosing IBD-unclassifi ed (IBD-U) After full investigation, IBD may not obviously be Crohn’s or UC. IBD-U refers to isolated colonic IBD where the diagnosis remains unknown (small bowel involvement=Crohn’s). This situation is rare in adults but commoner in children. Over time the phenotype tends to become clearer (generally UC>Crohn’s). Colecto- my ± pouch formation may be needed, though pouch failure rate is higher than in UC. 18 Day 3 stool frequency >8≈/day or frequency 3–8≈/day & CRP >45 =85% chance of colectomy this admission. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 226633 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 264 Crohn’s disease A chronic infl ammatory disease characterized by transmural granulomatous infl am- mation aff ecting any part of the gut from mouth to anus (esp. terminal ileum in ~70%).
