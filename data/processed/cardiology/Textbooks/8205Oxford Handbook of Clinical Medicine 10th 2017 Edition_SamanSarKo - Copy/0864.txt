Löffl er’s syndrome (p704), Churg–Strauss sym- drome (p696) and during the convalescent phase of any infection. The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) occurs when eosinophila >1 . 5 ≈ 109/L is sustained for >6 weeks leading to end-organ damage (endomyocardial fi brosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, skin lesions, thromboe mbolic disease, lung disease, neuropathy, and hepatosplenom egaly). The cause is often unknown, though if FIP1L1-PDFRA genotype, dia- gn ose myeloprolife rative HES or eosinophilic leukaemia. : PO steroids ± mepoliz umab (anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody). Imatinib is 1st choice for myoproliferative HES. Monocytes (fi g 8.23) 0 . 2–0 . 8 ≈ 109/L (2–10%). Increased in (ie monocytosis): the aftermath of chemo- or radiotherapy, chronic infections (eg malaria, TB, brucellosis, protozoa), malignant disease (including M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukaemia (p356), and Hodgkin’s disease), myelodysplasia. Basophils (fi g 8.24) 0–0 . 1 ≈ 109/L (0–1%). Increased in (ie basophilia): myeloprolif- erative disease, viral infections, IGE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (eg urticaria, hypo thyroid ism), and infl ammatory disorders (eg UC, rheumatoid arthritis). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333300 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 331 (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig 8.19 Neutrophil.
