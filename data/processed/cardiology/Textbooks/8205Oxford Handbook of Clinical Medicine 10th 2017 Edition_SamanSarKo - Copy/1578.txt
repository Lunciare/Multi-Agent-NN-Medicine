shock, lying still, +ve cough test (p62), tenderness (± rebound/percussion pain, p62), board-like abdominal rigidity, guard- ing, and no bowel sounds. Erect CXR may show gas under the diaphragm (fi g 13.26). NB: acute pancreatitis (p636) causes these signs, but does not require a laparotomy so don’t be caught out and always check serum amylase. Syndromes that may not require a laparotomy Local peritonitis:Eg diverticulitis,cholecystitis,salpingitis,and appendicitis(the lat- ter will need surgery). If abscess formation is suspected (swelling, swinging fever, and WCC) do US or CT. Drainage can be percutaneous (US or CT-guided), or by lapa- rotomy. Peritoneal infl ammation can cause localized ileus with a ‘sentinel loop’ of intraluminal gas visible on plain AXR (p729). Colic is a regularly waxing and waning pain, caused by muscular spasm in a hollow viscus, eg gut, ureter, salpinx, uterus, bile duct, or gallbladder (in the latter, pain is often dull and constant). Colic, unlike peritonitis, causes restlessness and the patient may well be pacing around when you go to review! Obstruction of the bowel See p610. Tests U&E; FBC; amylase; LFT; CRP; lactate (is there mesenteric ischaemia?); urinalysis. Urine and serum hCG is vital to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Erect CXR (fi g 13.26),
