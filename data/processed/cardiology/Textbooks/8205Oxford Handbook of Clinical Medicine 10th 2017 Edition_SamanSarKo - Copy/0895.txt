Immune: im- mune thrombocytopenia (ITP, see BOX ‘Immune thrombocytopenia’), other auto- immune causes, eg SLE, CLL, drugs, eg heparin, viruses; Non-immune: DIC (p352), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or HUS (p315), sequestration (in hy- persplenism). Poorly functioning platelets: Seen in myeloproliferative disease, NSAIDS, and urea. 3 Coagulation disorders Congenital: Haemophilia, von Willebrand’s disease (p712). Acquired: Anticoagulants, liver disease, DIC (p352), vitamin K defi ciency. Haemophilia A Factor VIII defi ciency; inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern in 1 : 10 000 male births—usually due to a ‘fl ip tip’ inversion in the factor VIII gene in the X chromosome. There is a high rate of new mutations (30% have no family his- tory). Presentation depends on severity and is often early in life or after surgery/ trauma—with bleeds into joints leading to crippling arthropathy, and into mus- cles causing haematomas (pressure can lead to nerve palsies and compartment syndrome). Diagnose by APTT and factor VIII assay. Management: Seek expert advice. Avoid NSAIDS and IM injections (fi g 8.43). Minor bleeding: pressure and el- evation of the part. Desmopressin (0 . 3mcg/kg/12h IVI over 20min) raises factor VIII levels, and may be suffi cient. Major bleeds (eg haemarthrosis): factor VIII levels to
