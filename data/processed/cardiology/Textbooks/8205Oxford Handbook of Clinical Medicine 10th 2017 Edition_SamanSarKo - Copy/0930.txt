Treating CML CML is the fi rst example of a cancer where knowledge of the genotype has led to a specifi cally targeted drug—imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This has transformed therapy over the last 10yrs. Side eff ects are usually mild: nausea, cramps, oedema, rash, headache, arthralgia. May cause myelosuppression. More potent 2nd-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors: dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. Dasatinib and nilotinib allow more patients to achieve
