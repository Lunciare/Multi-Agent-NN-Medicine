4.10. Clinical features In 20–40%, the disease is discovered incidentally, after a routine CXR, and is thus asymptomatic. Acute sarcoidosis often presents with fever, erythe- ma nodosum (fi g 12.21, p563),6 polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar lymphodenopathy (BHL), also called Löfgren syndrome, which usually resolves spontaneously. Pulmonary disease: 90% have abnormal CXRs with BHL (fi g 4.18) ± pulmonary infi l- trates or fi brosis; see later in topic for staging. Symptoms: Dry cough, progressive dyspnoea, exercise tolerance, and chest pain. In 10–20%, symptoms progress, with concurrent deterioration in lung function. Non-pulmonary signs: These are legion: lymphadenopathy; hepatomegaly; sple- nomegaly; uveitis; conjunctivitis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; glaucoma; terminal phalangeal bone cysts; enlargement of lacrimal & parotid glands (fi g 8.49, p355); Bell’s palsy; neuropathy; meningitis; brainstem and spinal syndromes; space-occupy- ing lesion; erythema nodosum (fi g 12.21, p563); lupus pernio; subcutaneous nodules; cardio myopathy; arrhythmias; hypercalcaemia; hypercalciuria; renal stones; pitui- tary dysfunction. Tests Blood: ESR, lymphopenia, LFT, serum ACE in ~60% (non-specifi c), Ca2+, immun oglobulins. 24h urine: Ca2+. CXR is abnormal in 90%: Stage 0: normal. Stage 1: BHL. Stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary infi ltrates. Stage 3: peripheral pulmonary infi ltrates alone. Stage 4: progressive pulmonary fi brosis; bulla formation
