evaluates myocardial and valvular anatomy and function (p110). The use of exercise or pharma- cological agents for ‘stress echocardiography’ can permit more detailed functional assessment. Vascular US Doppler ultrasonography is widely used for detection of thrombotic disease (eg DVT p578, portal vein thrombosis p276) and carotid athero- sclerosis (p472). Multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning is a non-invasive way to measure left ventricle ejection fraction. After injection of 99mTc-labelled RBCS, a dynamic image of the left ventricle is obtained for a few hundred heartbeats by gamma camera. Since estimates of LVEF show less inter-operator variation than with echocardiograpy, uses include the detailed serial assessment of LVEF in patients undergoing cardiotoxic chem- otherapy (eg anthracyclines, trastuzumab). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 774400 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR Myocardial perfusion imaging A non-invasive method of assessing regional myo- 741 cardial blood fl ow and the cellular integrity of myocytes. The technique uses radio- nuclide tracers which cross the myocyte membrane and are trapped intracellularly. Thallium-201 (201Tl), a K+ analogue, is distributed via regional myocardial blood fl ow and requires cellular integrity for uptake. Newer technetium-99 (99Tc)-based agents are similar to 201Tl but have improved imaging characteristics, and can be used to assess myocardial perfusion and LV performance in the
