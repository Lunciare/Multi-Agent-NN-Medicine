Pneumonia An infection of the lung parenchyma. Incidence of community-acquired pneumonia is 5–11 per 1000 adults. Of these, 1–3 per 1000 will require hospitalization, and mortal- ity in those hospitalized is up to 14%. Common organisms • Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause (60–75%). • Haemophilus infl uenzae. • Mycoplasma pneumoniae. • Staphylococcus aureus found more commonly in ICU patients. • Legionella species and Chlamydia psittaci. • Gram-negative bacilli, often hospital-acquired or immunocompromised, eg Pseudo- monas, especially in those with COPD. • Viruses including infl uenza account for up to 15%. Symptoms Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, purulent sputum (classically ‘rusty’ with pneumococcus), haemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Signs Fever, cyanosis, herpes labialis (pneumococcus), confusion, tachypnoea, tachy cardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (diminished expansion, dull percus- sion note,  tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), pleural rub. Management Ensure oxygenation then identify and treat reversible pathology,10 see fi g 19.15. Investigations: Assess severity—this will guide both investigation and treatment. • CXR (X-ray images, fi g 16.4 on p725). • Oxygen saturation and ABG if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia. • FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP. • Blood cultures (if CURB-65 ≥2). • Sputum cultures (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if CURB-65
