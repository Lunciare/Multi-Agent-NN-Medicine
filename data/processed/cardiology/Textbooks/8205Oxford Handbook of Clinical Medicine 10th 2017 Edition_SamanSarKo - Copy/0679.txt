Severe: Admit for IV hydration/electrolyte replacement; IV steroids, eg hydrocorti- sone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h; thromboembolism prophylaxis (p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection. • Monitor T°, pulse, BP, and record stool frequency/character on a stool chart. • Physical examination daily. Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, and plain AXR. • Consider need for blood transfusion (if Hb <80g/L) and nutritional support. • If improving switch to oral prednisolone (40mg/d).

Treatment includes oral antibiotics, im- munosuppressant therapy ± anti-TNF, and local surgery ± seton insertion. 19 Much of the genetic risk is shared with UC—small diff erences in genetics combined with environmental modifi ers may explain the very diff erent phenotypes. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 226644 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Therapies in Crohn’s disease 265 Azathioprine (AZA) (2–2.5mg/kg/d PO) used if refractory to steroids, relapsing on steroid taper, or requiring ≥2 steroid courses/yr.
