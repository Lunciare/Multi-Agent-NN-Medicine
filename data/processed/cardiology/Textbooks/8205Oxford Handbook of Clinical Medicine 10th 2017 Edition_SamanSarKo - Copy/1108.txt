Treatment: Reduces mortality from 60% to <15%: streptomycin, tetracycline.12 Toxoplasmosis Fig 9.34 Oocysts in cat faeces can stay in the soil for months, where rats eat them. The rats get infected, and, under the direction of Toxoplas- ma in the amygdala, the rats lose their fear of cats, and so get eaten in turn. So the parasite ensure success by facilitating a jump from interme- diate to defi nitive host. How does the parasite overwhelm the innate fear of cats? By causing a sexual attraction to normally aversive cat odour through limbic activity. From Fernando Monroy: www2.nau.edu/~fpm/research/res.html Caused by protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. Found worldwide. Life cycle (fi g 9.34). Infection is lifelong (~⅓ of population). HIV may cause reactivation (p400). Presentation: Asymptomatic in ~90%. Self-limiting cervical lymphadenopathy, low- grade fever if normal immune system. Disseminated disease if immunosuppressed: cerebral abscess, encephalitis, choroidoretinitis, myocarditis, myositis, pneumoni- tis, hepatitis. Congenital infection: pregnancy loss, neurocognitive defi cit, retinal damage. Diagnosis: In UK via Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory (0179 228 5058). Serology: IgG=previous exposure (high avidity IgG suggests infection >3–5 months ago, used in pregnancy); IgM=acute infection, false +ve or chronic infection with per- sistent IgM; IgA in cord serum=congenital infection. PCR: blood/CSF/urine/amniotic fl uid/aqueous/vitreous
