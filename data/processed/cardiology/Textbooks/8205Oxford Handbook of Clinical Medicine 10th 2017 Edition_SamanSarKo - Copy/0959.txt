5 Paraproteinaemia in lymphoma or leukaemia Eg seen in5 % of CLL. 6 Heavy chain disease Neoplastic cells produce free Ig heavy chains.  chain dis- ease is most important, causing malabsorption from infi ltration of bowel wall (im- munoproliferative small intestine disease—IPSID). It may progress to lymphoma. Amyloidosis This is a group of disorders characterized by extracellular deposits of a protein in abnormal fi brillar form, resistant to degradation. The following are the systemic forms of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition is also a feature of Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and haemodialysis-related amyloidosis. AL amyloid (primary amyloidosis) Proliferation of plasma cell clone  Amyloi- dogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins  Fibrillar light chain protein deposition  Organ failure  Death. Associations: myeloma (15%); Waldenström’s, lymphoma. Organs involved: • Kidneys: glomerular lesions—proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. • Heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy (looks ‘sparkling’ on echo), arrhythmias, angina. • Nerves: peripheral and autonomic neuropathy; carpal tunnel syndrome. • Gut: macroglossia (big tongue), malabsorption/weight, perforation, haemor- rhage, obstruction, and hepatomegaly. • Vascular: purpura, especially periorbital—a characteristic feature (fi g 8.74). : optimize nutrition; PO melphalan + prednisolone extends survival. High-dose IV melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation may be better. AA amyloid (secondary amyloidosis) Here amyloid
