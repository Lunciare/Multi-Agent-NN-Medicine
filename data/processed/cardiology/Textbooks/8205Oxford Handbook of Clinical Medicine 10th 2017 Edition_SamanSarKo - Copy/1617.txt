is achieved by a longitud inal incision into the proximal jejunum. Roux-en-Y: (fi g 13.38) Following total or subtotal gastrectomy, the proximal duodenal stump is oversewn, the proximal jejunum is divided from the distal duodenum and con- nects with the oesophagus (or proximal stomach after subtotal gastrectomy), while the distal duodenum is connected to the distal jejunum. Lymph node clearance is a controversial area. RCTS and meta-analyses suggest there may be limited benefi t and increased morbidity associated with extended lymph node resections (D2 or D3) over resection limited to the perigastric nodes (D1). Physical complications of gastrectomy • Abdominal fullness: Feeling of early satiety (± discomfort and distension) im- proving with time. Advise to take small, frequent meals. • Afferent loop syndrome: Post-gastrectomy (eg Billroth II), the aff erent loop may fi ll with bile after a meal, causing upper abdominal pain and bilious vomit- ing. This is diffi cult to treat—but often improves with time. • Diarrhoea: May be disabling after vagotomy. Codeine phosphate may help. • Gastric tumour: A rare complication of any surgery which  acid production. • Amylase: If with abdominal pain, this may indicate aff erent loop obstruction after Billroth II surgery and requires
