clear relationship between the activity of arthritis and severity of underlying infl ammation (as for all the spondyloarth- ritides). Prognosis is worse if ESR >30; onset <16yrs; early hip involvement or poor response to NSAIDS.39 2 Enteric arthropathy Associations: Infl ammatory bowel disease, GI bypass, coeliac and Whipple’s disease (p716). Arthropathy often improves with the treat- ment of bowel symptoms (beware NSAIDS). Use DMARDS for resistant cases. 4 Sacroiliitis on imaging plus ≥1 SpA feature or HLA B27 positive plus ≥2 SpA features. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 555500 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR 3 Psoriatic arthritis (OHCS p594.) Occurs in 10–40% with psoriasis and can present 551 before skin changes. Patterns are: •symmetrical polyarthritis (like RA) •DIP joints •asymmetrical oligoarthritis •spinal (similar to AS) •psoriatic arthritis mutilans (rare, ~3%, severe deformity). Radiology: Erosive changes, with ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformity in severe cases. Associated with nail changes in 80%, synovitis (dac- tylitis), acneiform rashes and palmo-plantar pustulosis. Management: NSAIDS, sulfasalazine, methotrexate. Anti-TNF agents are also eff ective. 4 Reactive arthritis A condition in which arthritis and other clinical manifesta- tions occur as an autoimmune response to infection elsewhere in the body— typically GI or GU, although the preceding infection may have resolved or be asymptomatic by the time
