is trickier and best taught by an expert. Use US guidance if at all possible, ideally to insert the line under direct vision, but at least to defi ne the anatomy. If possible, have the pa- tient attached to a cardiac monitor in case of arrhythmias. • Position the patient slightly head down to avoid air embolism and fi ll the veins to improve your chances of success. This can compromise cardiac function and pre- cipitate acute LVF so check if your patient has a cardiac history. Minimize the time the patient is head down; if they are unable to lie fl at, consider a femoral approach. Turn their head slightly to the left. • This should be a sterile procedure so use full aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves, gown) and clean with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol before draping. Ensure your equipment is prepared, fl ush the catheter lumens with saline. • If US is unavailable, the landmark procedure can be used to identify insertion point—approximately at the junction of the two heads of sternocleidomastoid at about the level of the thyroid cartilage (fi g 18.17). Feel gently for the carotid pulse, then infi ltrate with 1% lidocaine
