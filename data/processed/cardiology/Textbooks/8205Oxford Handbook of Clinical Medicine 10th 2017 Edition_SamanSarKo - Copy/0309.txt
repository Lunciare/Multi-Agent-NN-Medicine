Heart failure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block. Amiodarone A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action potential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventric- ular and ventricular tachycardias, including during cardiac arrest. Broad range of side eff ects incl. thyroid disease, liver disease, pulmonary fi brosis and peripheral neuropathy. Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months. Ivabradine Blocks the pacemaker ‘funny current’, slowing pulse rate without sig- nifi cantly dropping blood pressure. Used in angina, heart failure, and (off -licence) in autonomic tachycardia syndromes. CIS: Acute MI, bradycardia, long QT syndrome, shock. Many drug interactions, including with calcium antagonists. Statins Statins (eg simvastatin, p690) inhibit the enzyme HMG-COA reductase, which causes de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor ex- pression by hepatocytes leading to circulating LDL cholesterol. More eff ective if given at night, but optimum dose and target plasma cholesterol are unknown. SES: Muscle aches, abdominal discomfort, transaminases (eg ALT), CK, myositis, rarely rhabdo myolysis (more common if used with fi brates). Statins are generally well tol- erated. There are currently ~3 million people taking statins in England, which saves ~10 000 lives a year. See also hyperlipidaemia, pp690–1, fi
