best evidence exists for vitamin E (2000IU OD) which may confer a modest benefi t in delaying functional progression in mild to moderate AD, but with no eff ect on cognitive performance. Genetics and the future Possession of the APOE4 allele on chromosome 19 is the leading genetic cause of AD; homozygosity increases risk of developing the disease 12x. Yet while identifying this risk could enable a person to make lifestyle changes, there is little else to be done but anticipate one’s impending cognitive decline (just one of the dilemmas raised by genetic testing). While the proteins that make up the plaques and neurofi - brillary tangles seen in AD were identifi ed in the early 1980s, progress has since been slow. So much so that in 2013, world leaders pledged to have a drug that would halt dementia within the next 10 years. Now a second-generation tau aggregation in- hibitor called LMTX just might do the job, having shown success in phase III clinical trials in patients with mild/moderate AD, with clinical improvement and a slowing of atrophy on MRI. Perhaps in the imminent future, identifying those at greater risk of developing AD through genetic testing will have a
