Metabolic acidosis may benefi t from treatment with bicarbonate. • Anxiety: lorazepam 1-2mg IV as a slow bolus into a large vein. Repeat doses may be administered until agitation is controlled (see p826). • Narrow complex tachycardias (p806) in adults: consider metoprolol 5mg IV. • Hypertension can be treated with nifedipine 5–10mg PO or phentolamine 2–5mg IV.
