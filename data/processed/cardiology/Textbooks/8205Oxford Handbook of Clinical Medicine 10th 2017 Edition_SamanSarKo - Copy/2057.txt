This may be normal and asympto- matic in very fi t, young individuals whose high stroke volumes will maintain ad- equate cardiac output at low heart rates. Symptoms Often asymptomatic. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness. The presence of synco- pe, chest pain, or breathlessness is concerning and suggests the presence of adverse signs; sudden cardiac death can occur. Rhythm The immediate management tends to relate more to cause and adverse signs than to the underlying rhythm, which may be •sinus bradycardia •heart block (see p98) •AF with a slow ventricular response •atrial fl utter with a high-degree block •junctional bradycardia. Causes • Physiological: Heart rates as low as 40bpm at rest and 30bpm in sleep can be ac- cepted in asymptomatic trained athletes. • Cardiac: • Degenerative changes causing fi brosis of conduction pathways (risk in elderly patients; may have previous ECGs showing bundle branch block or 1st- or 2nd- degree heart block). • Post-MI—particularly after an inferior MI (the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node in most people). • Sick sinus syndrome (p125). • Iatrogenic—ablation, surgery.
