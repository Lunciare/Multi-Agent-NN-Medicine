SE = nausea. • Urge incontinence: The patient (or carer) should complete an ‘incontinence’ chart for 3d to defi ne the pattern of incontinence. Examine for spinal cord and CNS signs (including cognitive test, p64); and for vaginitis (if postmenopausal). Vaginitis can be treated with topical oestrogen therapy for a limited period. Bladder training (may include pelvic fl oor exercises) and weight loss are important. Drugs may help reduce night-time incontinence (see BOX) but can be disappointing. Consider aids, eg absorbent pad. If  consider a condom catheter. Do urodynamic assessment (cystometry & urine fl ow rate measurement) before any surgical intervention to exclude detrusor overactivity or sphincter dyssynergia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 664488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Table 13.20 Managing detrusor overactivity in urge incontinence 649 Agents for detrusor overactivity Notes Antimuscarinics: eg tolterodine SR Improves frequency & urgency.
