And if you’re really lucky you can publish your rejections as part of your Nobel presentation.’ On being normal in the society of numbers Laboratory medicine reduces our patients to a few easy-to-handle numbers: this is the discipline’s great attraction—and its greatest danger. The normal range (refer- ence interval) is usually that which includes 95% of a given population (given a nor- mal distribution, see p750). If variation is randomly distributed, 2.5% of our results will be ‘too high’, and 2.5% ‘too low’ on an average day, when dealing with apparently normal people. This statistical defi nition of normality is the simplest. Other defi ni- tions may be normative—ie stating what an upper or lower limit should be. The upper end of the reference interval for plasma cholesterol may be given as 6mmol/L because this is what biochemists state to be the desired maximum. 40% of people in some populations will have a plasma cholesterol greater than 6mmol/L and thus may be at increased risk. The WHO defi nition of anaemia in pregnancy is an Hb of <110g/L, which makes 20% of mothers anaemic. This ‘lax’ criterion has the presumed benefi t of triggering actions that
