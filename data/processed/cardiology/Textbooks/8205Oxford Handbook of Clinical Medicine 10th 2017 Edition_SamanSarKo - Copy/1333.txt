The rate of tumour growth is unpredictable and variable. The tumours are benign but cause problems by pressing on local structures and by ICP. They may be absent in mosaic NF2. Juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity (a form of cata- ract) occurs before other manifest ations and can be useful in screening those at risk. Complications: Tender Schwannomas of cranial and peripheral nerves, and spinal nerve roots. Meningiomas (45% in NF2, often multiple). Glial tumours are less common. Consider NF2 in any young person presenting with one of these tumours in isolation. Management: Hearing tests yearly from puberty in aff ected families, with MRI brain if abnormality is detected. A normal MRI in the late teens is helpful in assessing risk to any off spring. A clear scan at 30yrs (unless a family history of late onset) indi- cates that the gene has not been inherited. Treatment of vestibular Schwannomas is neurosurgical and complicated by hearing loss/deterioration and facial palsy. Mean survival from diagnosis is ~ 15yrs. Schwannomatosis Multiple tender cutaneous Schwannomas without the bilat- eral vestibular Schwannomas that are characteristic of NF2. Indistinguishable from mosaic NF2, where vestibular Schwannomas are also absent, except by genetic analysis of tumour biopsies.
