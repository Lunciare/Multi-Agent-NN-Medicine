aged women (bimodal, ie 10–30yrs—or >40yrs old). Up to 40% present with acute hepatitis and signs of autoimmune disease, eg fever, malaise, urticarial rash, polyar- thritis, pleurisy, pulmonary infi ltration, or glomerulon ephritis. The remainder present with gradual jaundice or are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with signs of chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common and disease tends to attenuate during pregnancy. Complications Those associated with cirrhosis (p276) and drug therapy. Tests Serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP all usually , hypergammaglobulinaemia (esp. IgG), +ve autoantibodies (see table 6.12). Anaemia, WCC, and platelets indicate hy- persplenism. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Mononuclear infi ltrate of portal and peripor- tal areas and piecemeal necrosis ± fi brosis; cirrhosis ≈ worse prognosis. MRCP: (See p742.) Helps exclude PSC if ALP  disproportionately. Diagnosis Depends on excluding other diseases (no lab test is pathognomonic). Di- agnostic criteria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in the absence of viral disease are helpful. Sometimes diagnosis is a challenge—there is overlap with other chronic liver disease: eg PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis. Table 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I–II I Seen in 80%. Typical patient:  <40yrs. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve in 80%
