Handbook of Clinical medicine

bradycardia (eg glucagon if -blocker overdose). • If the patient has adverse signs or risk of asystole, give atropine (not to be given if patient has a transplanted heart). • If atropine is insuffi cient and adverse signs persist, transcutaneous pacing should be considered (p777). If this cannot be initiated immediately (eg waiting for an anaesthetist), consider other medications such as isoprenaline infusion. • Remember electrical ‘capture’ with transcutaneous pacing does not guarantee me- chanical ‘capture’. Once pacing is established, check the patient’s pulse. It is possible to have two patients sat next to each other with identical bradycardic ECG tracings, one of whom is peri-arrest, the other is sat comfortably and cannot understand your concern. The clinical state is more important than the numbers on the screen. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880088 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 sseeiiccnneeggrreemmEE  Management of bradycardia 880099 Give O2 if hypoxic; manual BP; ECG; IV access Identify reversible causes (eg electrolyte abnormalities) Adverse signs? • Shock • Syncope Yes • Heart failure No • Myocardial ischaemia Give atropine 500mcg IV Risk of asystole? • Recent asystole Yes • Mobitz II AV block (p98) Satisfactory • Complete heart block with response? broad QRS Yes • Ventricular pause >3s No No
