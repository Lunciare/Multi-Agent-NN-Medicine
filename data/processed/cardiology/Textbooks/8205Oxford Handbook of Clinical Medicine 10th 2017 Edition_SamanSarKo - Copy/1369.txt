pre- serve neurological function and relieve pain. Causes: Collapse or compression of a vertebral body due to metastases (common), direct extension of a tumour into vertebral column (rare). Signs and symptoms: Back pain in ~95%. Ask about nocturnal pain and pain with straining. Worry if there is cervical/thoracic pain. Also limb weakness, diffi culty walking, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction. Maintain a high index of suspicion. Management: Admit for bed rest and arrange urgent (within 24h) MRI of the whole spine. Give dexamethasone 16mg/24h PO with prophylatic gastroprotection, eg PPI, and blood glucose monitoring. If reduced mobility consider thromboprophylaxis (compression stockings, LMWH). Refer urgently to clinical oncology/cancer MDT. Ra- diotherapy is the commonest treatment and should be given within 24 hours of MRI diagnosis. Decompressive surgery ± radiotherapy may be appropriate depending on prognosis. Patients with loss of motor function after >48h are unlikely to recover function. (See also p466.) Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome Reduced venous return from head, neck, and upper limbs. Due to extrinsic compres- sion (most common), or venous thrombosis (consider if current or past central ve- nous access). SVC syndrome with airway compromise requires urgent treatment. Causes: >90% of SVC syndrome results from malignancy. Most common
