occur. Consider psychological support, clonazepam or clonidine if tics are severe (haloperidol may help but risks tardive dyskinesia). Myoclonus Sudden involuntary focal or general jerks arising from cord, brainstem, or cerebral cortex, seen in metabolic problems, neurodegenerative disease (eg lysoso- mal storage enzyme defects), CJD (p696), and myoclonic epilepsies (infantile spasms). Benign essential myoclonus: Childhood onset with frequent generalized myoclonus, without progression. Often autosomal dominant. It may respond to valproate, clonazepam, or piracetam. Asterixis (‘metabolic fl ap’): Jerking (~1–2 jerks/sec) of outstretched hands, worse with wrists extended, from loss of extensor tone—ie inco- ordination between fl exors and extensors (=‘negative myoclonus’). Causes: Liver or kidney failure, Na+, CO2, gabapentin, thalamic stroke (consider if unilateral). Tardive syndromes Delayed onset yet potentially irreversible symptoms oc- curing after chronic exposure to dopamine antagonists (eg antipsychotics, an- tiemetics). Classifi cation: •Tardive dyskinesia: orobuccolingual, truncal, or choreiform movements, eg vacuous chewing and grimacing movements. •Tardive dystonia: sustained, stereotyped muscle spasms of a twisting or turning charac- ter, eg retrocollis and back arching/opisthotonic posturing. •Tardive akathisia: sense of restlessness or unease ± repetitive, purposeless movements (stereotyp- ies, eg pacing). •Tardive myoclonus. •Tardive tourettism (p700). •Tardive tremor. Treating tardive dyskinesia: Gradually withdraw neuroleptics and wait 3–6 months.
