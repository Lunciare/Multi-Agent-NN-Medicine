used in a paediatric setting. Hartmann’s solution: Contains Na+ 131mmol, ClΩ 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K+ 5mmol, HCO3Ω 29mmol, and Ca2+ 2mmol per litre of fl uid. It is an alternative to 0.9% saline, and some consider it more physiological. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 666666 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Assessing fl uid balance 667 Underfi lled: Overfi lled: • Tachycardia • JVP (p43) • Postural drop in BP (low BP is a late • Pitting oedema of the sacrum, ankles, or sign of hypovolaemia) even legs and abdomen • capillary refi ll time • Tachypnoea • urine output • Bibasal crepitations • Cool peripheries • Pulmonary oedema on CXR (fi g 16.3, p723). • Dry mucous membranes See also p134 for signs of heart failure. • skin turgor • Sunken eyes. The JVP is a substitute marker of central venous pressure, and when assessing fl uid balance is diffi cult, a CVP line may help to guide fl uid management. Special cases Acute blood loss: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae until blood is available. Children: Use glucose with sodium chloride for fl uid maintenance: 100mL/kg for the fi rst 10kg, 50mL/kg for the next 10kg, and 20mL/kg thereafter—all per 24h.
