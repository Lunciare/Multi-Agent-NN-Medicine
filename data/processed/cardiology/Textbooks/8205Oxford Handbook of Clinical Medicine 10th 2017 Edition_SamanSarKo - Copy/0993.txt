monobactam Contain a -lactam ring which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. Resistance occurs when the bacteria (eg staphylococci) produce a -lactamase enzyme. Penicillins: See table 9.3. Include natural penicillins (penicillin G and V) and synthetic penicillins which are chemically modifi ed to extend their spectrum of activity, eg amoxicillin, piperacillin. In an attempt to overcome -lactamase resistance, penicillins have been combined with -lactamase inhibitors to create -lactam--lactamase inhibitor combinations eg co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid), Tazocin® (piperacillin+tazobactam). Staphylococcal resistance is conventionally defi ned by stability to meticillin, an acid-labile and IV-only equivalent of fl ucloxacillin (see MRSA p388). Cephalosporins: See table 9.4. Contain a -lactam ring attached to a six-membered nuclear structure (fi ve in penicillin), which allows synthetic modifi cation at two sites (one in penicil- lin). This means that cephalosporins are the largest groups of available antibiotics. Classifi cation into ‘generations’ is not standardized: as a rough rule, the higher the generation, the wider the spectrum. Carbapenems: See table 9.5. Broadest spectrum of all -lactam antibiotics. Seek expert microbiol- ogy advice before use. Monobactam: Aztreonam is only active against Gram-negative species including Neisseria men- ingitidis, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Pseudomonas. Given IV/IM.
