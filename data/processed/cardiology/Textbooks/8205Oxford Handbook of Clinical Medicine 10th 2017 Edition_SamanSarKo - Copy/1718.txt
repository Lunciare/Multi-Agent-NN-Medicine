patterns Dehydration Urea (disproportionate relative to smaller  in creatinine),1 albumin (also useful to plot change in a patient’s con dition), haematocrit (PCV); also urine volume and skin turgor. Abnormal kidney function There are two major biochemical pictures (table 14.1): Low GFR: Usually oliguric. Causes: early acute oliguric renal failure (p298), chronic kidney disease (p302). In chronic kidney disease also Hb, PTH, and renal bone disease. Tubular dysfunction: Results from damage to tubules. Diagnosis is made by test- ing renal concentrating ability (p241). May be polyuric with urinary glucose, amino acids, proteins (lysozyme, 2-microglobulin), or phosphate. Causes: recovery from acute kidney injury, hypercalcaemia, hyperurica emia, myeloma, pyelonephritis, hy- pokalaemia, Wilson’s disease, galactosaemia, and heavy metal poisoning.
