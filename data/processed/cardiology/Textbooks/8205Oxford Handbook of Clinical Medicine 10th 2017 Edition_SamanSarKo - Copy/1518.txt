Handling of the serosal surface of the bowel causes infl ammation, which over weeks to years can lead to the formation of fi brous bands that tether the bowel to itself or adjacent structures—though adhesions can also form secondary to infection, radiation injury, and infl ammatory processes such as Crohn’s disease. Their main sequelae are intestinal obstruction (the cause in ~60% of cases—see p610) and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. Stud- ies have shown that adhesiolysis may help relieve chronic pain, though for a small proportion of patients the pain never improves or even worsens after directed intervention. As far as prevention is concerned, the best approach is to avoid operating; lapa- roscopy compared with laparotomy reduces the rate of local adhesions. Insertion of synthetic fi lms (eg hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl membrane) to prevent adhe- sions to the anterior abdominal wall reduces incidence, extent, and severity of adhesions, but not incidence of obstruction or operative re-intervention. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 558811 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 582 Stoma care A stoma (Greek=mouth) is an artifi cial union between a conduit and the outside world—eg a colostomy, in which faeces are made to pass through an opening in the abdominal wall when a loop of colon is
