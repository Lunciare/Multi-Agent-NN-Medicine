symptoms (eg unequal pupils, hemiparesis) occur late, often >1 month after the injury. Diff erentials Stroke, dementia, CNS masses (eg tumours, abscesses). Imaging (fi g 10.22) CT/MRI shows clot ± midline shift (but beware bilateral isodense clots). Look for crescent-shaped collection of blood over 1 hemisphere. The sickle- shape diff erent iates subdural blood from extradural haemorrhage. Management Reverse clotting abnormalities urgently. Surgical management de- pends on the size of the clot, its chronicity, and the clinical picture: generally those >10mm or with midline shift >5mm need evacuating (via craniotomy or burr hole washout). Address the cause of the trauma (eg falls, abuse). Extradural (epidural) haematoma  Beware deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced no loss of consciousness or after initial drowsiness post injury seems to have re- solved. This lucid interval pattern is typical of extradural bleeds. Cause Suspect after any traumatic skull fracure. Often due to a fractured temporal or parietal bone causing laceration of the middle meningeal artery and vein, typically after trauma to a temple just lateral to the eye. Any tear in a dural venous sinus will also result in an extradural bleed. Blood accumulates between bone and dura. Clinical features The
