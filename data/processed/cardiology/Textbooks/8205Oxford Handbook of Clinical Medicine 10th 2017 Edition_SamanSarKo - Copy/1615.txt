diagnose. Tests: CT angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography are replac- ing traditional angiography. Treatment: Once diagnosis is confi rmed, surgery should be considered due to the ongoing risk of acute infarction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent insertion has replaced open revascularization. It is associated with less post-operative morbidity and mortality, but has higher restenosis rates. 3 Chronic colonic ischaemia (AKA ischaemic colitis) usually follows low fl ow in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) territory and ranges from mild ischaemia to gan- grenous colitis. Presentation: Lower left-sided abdominal pain ± bloody diarrhoea. Tests: CT may be helpful but lower GI endoscopy is ‘gold-standard’. Treatment: Usu- ally conservative with fl uid replacement and antibiotics. Most recover but subse- quent development of ischaemic strictures is common. Gangrenous ischaemic colitis (presenting with peritonitis and hypovolaemic shock) requires prompt resuscitation followed by resection of the aff ected bowel and stoma formation. Mortality is high. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 662200 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 621 Fig 13.36 The arterial supply to the colon. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 662211 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 622 Gastric surgery and its aftermath Indications for gastric surgery include gastric cancer (p619) and perforated/ haemorrhaging peptic ulcers. Medical therapy (p252) for peptic ulcers has made elective surgery exceedingly rare/redundant. Emergency
