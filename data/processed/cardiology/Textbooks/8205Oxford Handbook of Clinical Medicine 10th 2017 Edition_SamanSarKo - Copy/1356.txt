metastatic disease. Some cancers may have alternative staging systems such as Duke’s classifi ca- tion for colorectal cancer (p616). See also lung cancer (p176); breast cancer (p602); oesophageal cancer (p618); bladder cancer (p647). Cancer imaging Imaging is essential in oncology for diagnosis, prognosis, and to inform and guide treatment. As well as plain radiographs, ultrasound scans, CT, and MRI; there is a wealth of more specialist imaging including: PET-CT: PET uses a non-specifi c radioactive tracer (FDG) which highlights areas of increased metabolism, cell proliferation, or hypoxia. It therefore accumulates in cancer cells >non-cancer cells. PET-CT is a powerful combination of anatomical (CT) and functional (PET) information allowing diagnosis, increased accuracy of staging, and assessment of treatment response. Monoclonal antibodies: Radio-labelled tumour antibodies specifi c to the tumour under investigation, eg prostate specifi c membrane antigen, somatostatin (neu- roendocrine tumours), oestrogen receptor (breast). They can off er better specifi c- ity than standard PET images. (For monoclonal antibodies in treatment see p524.) Bone scintigraphy (bone scan): Detects abnormal metabolic activity in bones including bone metastases. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 552233 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 erac evitaillap dna ygolocnO 524 Cancer treatment: medicine and surgery Chemotherapy Chemotherapy7 is the use of any chemical substance to treat
