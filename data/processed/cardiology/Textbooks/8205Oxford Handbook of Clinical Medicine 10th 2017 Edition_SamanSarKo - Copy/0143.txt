heard in pericarditis. It is a superfi cial scratching sound, not confi ned to systole or diastole. Continuous murmurs are present throughout the cardiac cycle and may occur with a patent ductus arteriosus, arteriovenous fi stula, or ruptured sinus of Valsalva. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 4466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 47 Fig 2.14 Typical waveforms of common heart murmurs. Grading intensity of heart murmurs The following grading is commonly used for murmurs—systolic murmurs from 1 to 6 and diastolic murmurs from 1 to 4, never being clinically >4/6. Table 2.4 Grading of heart murmurs. Grade Description 1/6 Very soft, only heard after listening for a while 2/6 Soft, but detectable immediately 3/6 Clearly audible, but no thrill palpable 4/6 Clearly audible, palpable thrill 5/6 Audible with stethoscope only partially touching chest 6/6 Can be heard without placing stethoscope on chest Prosthetic valve murmurs Prosthetic valves: Created either from synthetic material (mechanical prosthesis) or from biological tissue (bioprosthesis). The choice of prosthesis is determined by the anticipated longevity of the patient and the patient’s ability to tolerate antico- agulation. Three mechanical valve designs exist: the caged ball valve, the tilting disc (single leafl et) valve, and the bileafl et valve. Tissue valves are
