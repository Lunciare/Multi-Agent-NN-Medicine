most resolve by the age of 3. Indirect inguinal hernias (~ 4% of all  infants due to patent processus vaginalis—prematurity is a risk factor; uncommon in  infants—consider testicular feminization.) Surgical repair is required. Gastroschisis: Protrusion of the abdominal contents through a defect in the anterior abdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus. Prompt surgical repair required. Exomphalos: Abdominal contents are found outside the abdomen, covered in a three-layer membrane consisting of peritoneum, Wharton’s jelly, and amnion.

Fig 13.32 The boundaries of the femoral canal are anteriorly the ingui- nal ligament; medially the lacunar ligament (and pubic bone); laterally the femoral vein (and iliopsoas); and posteriorly the pectineal ligament and pectineus. The canal contains fat and Cloquet’s node. The neck of the hernia is felt inferior and lateral to the pubic tubercle (inguinal her- nias are superior and medial to this point). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 661133 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 614 Inguinal hernias Indirect hernias pass through the internal inguinal ring and, if large, out through the external ring (fi g. 13.33).
