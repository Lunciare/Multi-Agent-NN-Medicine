cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy: clus- ter of CKD/renal failure in Balkan areas where aristolochic acid is detected in wheat. Treatment: Avoid exposure. Treat as CKD (pp304–5). Screen for malignancy. Consider therapeutic trial of steroids (limited data). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331199 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 320 Inherited kidney disease Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 1 in 400–1000 (~7 million worldwide). De novo mutation in ~10%. 2/3 will require renal replacement. 85% have mutations in PKD1 (chromosome 16) and reach ESRF by 50s. Mutation in PKD2 (chromosome 4) has a slower course, reaching ESRF by 70s. Presentation: May be clinically silent unless cysts become symptomatic due to size/ haemorrhage (fi g 7.14). Loin pain, visible haematuria, cyst infection, renal calculi, BP, progressive renal failure. Extrarenal: liver cysts, intracranial aneurysmSAH (p478), mitral valve prolapse, ovarian cyst, diverticular disease. Diagnosis: USS is modality of choice. Renal cysts are common and prevalence with age so diagnostic criteria are age-specifi c: 15–39yrs ≥ 3 cysts, 40–59yrs >2 cysts in each kidney give a positive pre- dictive value of 100% for both PKD1 and PKD2 mutations. Sensitivity is >93% for PKD1 but only 69% for diagnosis of PKD2 <30 years. Liver (90% by age 50) and pancreatic
