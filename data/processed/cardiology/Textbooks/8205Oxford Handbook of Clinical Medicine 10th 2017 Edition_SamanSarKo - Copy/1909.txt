in practice it is only useful for monitoring known renal calculi. Contrast studies Retrograde pyelography/ureterograms are good at showing pelvi-calyceal, ureteric anatomy, and transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS). Contrast medium is injected via a ureteric catheter. With the advent of cystoscopy, allowing immediate intervention, these are rarely done in isolation. However, contrast me- dium is routinely used in cystoscopic placement of retrograde stents for obstruction. Percutaneous nephrostomy. Used in obstruction to decompress the renal pelvis, which is punctured under local anaesthetic with imaging guidance. Images are ob- tained following contrast injection (antegrade pyelogram). A nephrostomy tube is then placed to allow decompression, sometimes followed by an antegrade stent if there is no easily treatable cause of obstruction. Renal arteriography (fi g 16.37) Therapeutic indications: angioplasty; stenting; em- bolization (bleeding tumour, trauma, AV malformation). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Soft tissue resolution can help clarify equivo- cal CT fi ndings. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) helps image renal artery anatomy/stenosis (fi g 16.38) and is also used in the assessment of potential live do- nors for kidney transplant, as well as to monitor patients following embolization of tumours, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms.
