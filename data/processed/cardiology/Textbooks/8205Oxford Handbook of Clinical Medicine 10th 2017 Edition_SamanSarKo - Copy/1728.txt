catheter is not blocked! Post-operative: Check the operation notes for intraoperative losses, and ensure you chart and replace added losses from drains, etc. Shock: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae. Identify the type of shock (p790). Transpiration losses: (Fever, burns.) Beware the large amounts of fl uid that can be lost unseen through transpiration. Severe burns in particular may require ag- gressive fl uid resuscitation (p846). Potassium in IV fl uids • Potassium ions can be given with 5% glucose or 0.9% saline, usually 20mmol/L or 40mmol/L. • K+ may be retained in renal failure, so beware giving too much IV. • Gastrointestinal fl uids are rich in K+, so increased fl uid loss from the gut (eg diarrhoea, vomiting, high-output stoma, intestinal fi stula) will need increased K+ replacement. The maximum concentration of K+ that is safe to infuse via a peripheral line is 40mmol/L, at a maximum rate of 20mmol/h in a cardiac monitored patient. Fluid- restricted patients may require higher concentrations or rates in life-threatening hypokalaemia. Faster rates risk cardiac dysrhythmias and asystole, and higher concentrations thrombophlebitis, depending on the size of the vein, so give con- centrated solutions >40mmol/L via a central venous
