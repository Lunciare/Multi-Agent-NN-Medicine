Sickle cell nephropathy HbSS is associated with hyperfi ltration (lower than expected creatinine) and albumi- nuria. Although up to 75% of young patients will have some degree of CKD, progres- sion to renal failure is usually associated with another trigger, eg papillary necrosis, infection. Diagnosis: Clinical. Biopsy only if looking for another diagnosis, eg AKI without clinical cause, nephrotic syndrome. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB. Inconsistent data re hydroxycarbamide and hyperfi ltration. Mortality on dialysis: aim to transplant. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331155 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 316 The renal tubule: disorders and diuretics Tubular disorders and the action of diuretics can be considered according to the aff ected segment of the nephron (fi g 7.13 and table 7.8).
