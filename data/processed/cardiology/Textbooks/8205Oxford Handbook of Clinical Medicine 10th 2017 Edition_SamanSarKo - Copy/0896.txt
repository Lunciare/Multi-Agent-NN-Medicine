and el- evation of the part. Desmopressin (0 . 3mcg/kg/12h IVI over 20min) raises factor VIII levels, and may be suffi cient. Major bleeds (eg haemarthrosis): factor VIII levels to 50% of normal, eg with recombinant factor VIII. Life-threatening bleeds (eg obstructing airway) need levels of 100%. Genetic counselling: OHCS p154. Haemophilia B (Christmas disease) Factor IX defi ciency (inherited, X-linked re- cessive); behaves clinically like haemophilia A. Treat with recombinant factor IX. Acquired haemophilia is a bleeding diathesis causing big mucosal bleeds in males and females caused by suddenly appearing autoantibodies that interfere with factor VIII. Tests: APPT; VIII autoantibody; factor VIII activity <50%. : Steroids. Liver disease Produces a complicated bleeding disorder with synthesis of clot- ting factors, absorption of vitamin K, and abnormalities of platelet function. Malabsorption Leads to less uptake of vitamin K (needed for synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and X). Treat with IV vitamin K (10mg). In acute haemorrhage, use hu- man prothrombin complex or FFP. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334444 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 345 Fig 8.43 Mild haemo- ph ilia after an IM inj- ect ion. Give vacc ines etc SC!
