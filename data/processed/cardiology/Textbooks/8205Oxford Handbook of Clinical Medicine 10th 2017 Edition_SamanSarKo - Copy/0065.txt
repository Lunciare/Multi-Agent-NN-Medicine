an equal chance of being in either arm of the study. The aim is to minimize bias and attempt to get at the truth as to whether the intervention is any good or not. Both groups are followed up and analysed against predefi ned end-points. Randomizing Done with the aim of eliminating the eff ects of non-studied factors. With randomization (and suffi cient study size) the two arms of the study will be identical (on average), with the exception of the intervention of interest. Blinding There is a risk that factors during the trial may aff ect the outcome, eg participant or clinician optimism if they know the patient is on active treatment, or an unwillingness to expose more severe disease to placebo. If the subject does not know which intervention they are having, the trial is single-blind. Ideally, the experi- menter should not know either, and the study should be double-blind. In a good trial, the blind lead the blind. Journal club: how good is this RCT? • Does the study answer a useful question? Does it add to current literature: big- ger, better, diff erent target population? • Does the target population in the study include your patient(s)?
