Gait analysis (p467) gives you more information than any other test. If they aren’t able to walk, start with them lying down, legs fully exposed. Then, Inspection, Tone, Refl exes, Power, Coordination, Sensation (fi g 2.32). 1 General inspection and gait Gait: Ask patient to walk a few metres, turn, and walk back to you. Note use of walking aids, symmetry, size of paces, arm swing. Ask patient to ‘walk heel-to-toe as if on a tightrope’ to exaggerate any instability. Ask patient to walk on tiptoes, then on heels. Inability to walk on tiptoes indicates S1 or gastrocn emius lesion. Inability to walk on heels indicates L4,5 lesion or foot drop. Romberg’s test: Ask patient to stand unaided with arms by their sides and close their eyes (be ready to support them). If they sway/lose balance the test is positive and indicates posterior column disease/sensory ataxia. Inspect: Abnormal posturing, muscle wasting, fasciculation (LMN lesion?),
