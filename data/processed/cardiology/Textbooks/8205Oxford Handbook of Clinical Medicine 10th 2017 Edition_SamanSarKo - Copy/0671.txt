mucosa ± pseudop olyps formed by in- fl ammation. Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria—infl ammation is norm ally not transmural. Continuous infl ammation limited to the mucosa diff erenti- ates it from Crohn’s disease. Prevalence 100–200/100 000. Incid ence 10–20/100 000/ yr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. UC is 3-fold as common in non-smokers (the opposite is true for Crohn’s disease)—symptoms may relapse on stopping smoking. Symptoms Episodic or chronic diarrhoea (± blood & mucus); crampy abdomi nal dis comfort; bowel frequency relates to severity (see table 6.8); urgency/tenes- mus ≈ proctitis. Systemic symptoms in attacks: fever, malaise, anorexia, weight. Signs May be none. In acute, severe UC there may be fever, tachycardia, and a ten- der, distended abdomen. Extraintestinal signs: Clubbing; aphthous oral ulcers; ery- thema nodosum (p265); pyoderma gangrenosum; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; iritis; large joint arthritis; sacroiliitis; ankylosing spondylitis; PSC (p282); nutritional defi cits. Tests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, blood culture. Stool MC&S/CDT: (See p258.) To exclude Campylobacter, C. diffi cile, Sal monella, Shigella, E. coli, amoebae. Faecal calprotectin: A simple, non-invasive test for GI infl ammation with high sensitivity. AXR: No faecal shadows; mucosal thickening/islands (fi g 16.9, p729); colonic dilata- tion (see ‘Complications’).
