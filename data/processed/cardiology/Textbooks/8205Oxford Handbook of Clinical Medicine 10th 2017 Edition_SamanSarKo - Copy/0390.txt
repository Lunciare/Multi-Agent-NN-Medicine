diastolic murmur (heard best in expiration, with patient sat forward). Eponyms: Corrigan’s sign: carotid pulsation; de Musset’s sign: head nodding with each heart beat; Quincke’s sign: capillary pulsa- tions in nail beds; Duroziez’s sign: in the groin, a fi nger compressing the femoral ar- tery 2cm proximal to the stethoscope gives a systolic murmur; if 2cm distal, it gives a diastolic murmur as blood fl ows backwards; Traube’s sign: ‘pistol shot’ sound over femoral arteries; an Austin Flint murmur (p46) denotes severe AR. Tests: ECG: LVH. CXR: cardiomegaly; dilated ascending aorta; pulmonary oedema. Echo is diagnostic. Cardiac catheterization to assess: severity of lesion; anatomy of aortic root; LV function; coronary artery disease; other valve disease. Management: The main goal of medical therapy is to reduce systolic hypertension; ACE-i are helpful. Echo every 6–12 months to monitor. Indications for surgery: severe AR with enlarged ascending aorta, increasing symptoms, enlarging LV or deterio- rating LV function on echo; or infective endocarditis refractory to medical therapy. Aim to replace the valve before signifi cant LV dysfunction occurs. Predictors of poor post-operative survival: ejection fraction <50%, NYHA class III or IV (p135), duration of CCF >12 months. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 114466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 147
