Handbook of Clinical medicine

• Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in ‘blocks’ over several weeks. • CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate ± CNS irradiation. • Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrex- ate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs. Relapse is common in blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up). More details: OHCS p194. • Matched related allogeneic marrow transplantations: Once in 1st remission is the best option in standard-risk younger adults. Haematological remission: Means no evidence of leukaemia in the blood, a normal or recovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow. Prognosis Cure rates for children are 70–90%; for adults only 40% (higher when imatinib/rituximab, p358, are used). Poor prognosis if: adult, male, Philadelphia chro- mosome (p358: BCR–ABL gene fusion due to translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22), presentation with CNS signs, Hb , WCC >100≈109/L , or B-cell ALL. PCR is used to detect minimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means. Prognosis in relapsed Ph-negative ALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant). Personalized treatment One size does not fi t all! Aim to tailor therapy to the exact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism.
