severe anaemia and failure to thrive. Extra- medullary haematopoiesis (RBCS made outside the marrow) occurs in response to anaemia, causing characteristic head shape, eg skull bossing (fi gs 8.39, 8.40) and hepato spleno megaly (also due to haem olysis). There is osteopenia (may respond to zoledronic acid). Skull X-ray shows a ‘hair on end’ sign due to marrow activity. Life-long blood transfusions are needed, with resulting iron overload/deposition seen after ~10yrs as endocrine failure (pituitary, thyroid, pancreasdiabetes mel- litus), liver disease, and cardiac toxicity. The fi lm shows very hypochromic, micro- cytic cells + target cells + nucleated RBCs. HbF, HbA2 variable, HbA absent. Treatment: Promote fi tness; healthy diet. Folate supplements help. • Regular (~2–4 weekly) life-long transfusions to keep Hb >90g/L, to suppress the ineff ective extramedullary haematopoiesis and to allow normal growth. Iron overload is a big problem causing hypothyroidism, hypocalcaemia, and hypo- gonadism. Can be mitigated by iron-chelators (deferiprone PO + desferrioxamine sc twice weekly. SE: pain, deafness, cataracts, retinal damage, risk of Yersinia). Large doses of ascorbic acid can also help by urinary excretion of iron. • Splenectomy if hypersplenism persists with increasing transfusion requirements (p373)—this is best avoided until >5yrs old due to risk
