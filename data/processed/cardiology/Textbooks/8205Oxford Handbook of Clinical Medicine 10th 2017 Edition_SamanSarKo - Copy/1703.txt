not for cosmetic reasons alone). • Treat any underlying cause. • Education—avoid prolonged standing and elevate leg(s) whenever possible; sup- port stockings (compliance is a problem); lose weight; regular walks (calf muscle action aids venous return). • Endovascular treatment (less pain and earlier return to activity than surgery.) • Radiofrequency ablation (VNUS Closure®)—a catheter is inserted into the vein and heated to 120°C destroying the endothelium and ‘closing’ the vein. Results are as good as conventional surgery at 3 months. • Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is similar but uses a laser. Outcomes are similar to surgical repair after 2yrs (in terms of quality of life and recurrence). • Injection sclerotherapy—either liquid or foam can be used. Liquid sclerosant is indicated for varicosities below the knee if there is no gross saphenofemoral incompetence. It is injected at multiple sites and the vein compressed for a few weeks to avoid thrombosis (intravascular granulation tissue obliterates the lumen). Alternatively foam sclerosant is injected under ultrasound guid- ance at a single site and spreads rapidly throughout the veins, damaging the endothelium. Ultrasound monitoring prevents inadvertent spread of foam into the femoral vein. It achieves ~80% complete occlusion but is not more eff ective than
