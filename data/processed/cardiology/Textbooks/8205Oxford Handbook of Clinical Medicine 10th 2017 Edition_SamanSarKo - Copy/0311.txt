= typical angina; 2 features = atypical angina; 0–1 features = non- anginal chest pain. Other precipitants: emotion, cold weather, and heavy meals. Associated symptoms: dyspnoea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness. Features that make angina less likely: pain that is continuous, pleuritic or worse with swallowing; pain associated with palpita- tions, dizziness or tingling. Causes Atheroma. Rarely: anaemia; coronary artery spasm; AS; tachyarrhythmias; HCM; arteritis/small vessel disease (microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome X). Types of angina Stable angina: Induced by eff ort, relieved by rest. Good prognosis. Unstable angina: (Crescendo angina.) Angina of increasing frequency or severity; occurs on minimal exertion or at rest; associated with risk of MI. Decubitus angina: Precipitated by lying fl at. Variant (Prinzmetal) angina: (BOX ‘Vasospastic angina’) Caused by coronary artery spasm (rare; may coexist with fi xed stenoses). Tests ECG usually normal, but may show ST depression; fl at or inverted T waves; signs of past MI. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, TFTs, lipids, HbA1c. Consider echo and chest X-ray. Further investigations are usually necessary to confi rm an IHD diagnosis—see BOX. Management Address exacerbating factors: Anaemia, tachycardia (eg fast AF), thyrotoxicosis. Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: • Stop smoking; exercise; dietary advice; optimize hypertension and diabetes control. •
