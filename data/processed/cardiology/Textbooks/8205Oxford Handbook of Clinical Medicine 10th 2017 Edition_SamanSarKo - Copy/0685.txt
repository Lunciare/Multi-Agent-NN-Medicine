Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) IBS denotes a mixed group of abdominal symptoms for which no organic cause can be found. Most are probably due to disorders of intestinal motility, enhanced visceral perception (the ‘brain–gut’ axis: see BOX ‘Managing IBS’), or microbial dysbiosis. Sev- eral diagnostic criteria exist (see BOX ‘Defi ning gastrointestinal dysfunction’ p261). Prevalence 10–20%; age at onset: 40yrs; : ≥2:1. Diagnosis Only diagnose IBS if recurrent abdominal pain (or discomfort) associated with at least 2 of: • relief by defecation • altered stool form • altered bowel frequen- cy (constipation and diarrhoea may alternate). Other features: urgency; incomplete evacuation; abdominal bloating/distension; mucus PR; worsening of symptoms after food. Symptoms are chronic (>6 months), and often exacerbated by stress, men- struation, or gastroenteritis (post-infectious IBS). Signs: Examination may be nor- mal, but general abdominal tenderness is common. Insuffl ation of air during lower GI endoscopy (not usually needed) may reproduce the pain. Think of other diagnoses if: Age >60yrs; history <6 months; anorexia; weight; waking at night with pain/diar- rhoea; mouth ulcers; abnormal CRP, ESR. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 226666 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Causes of gastrointestinal malabsorption 267
