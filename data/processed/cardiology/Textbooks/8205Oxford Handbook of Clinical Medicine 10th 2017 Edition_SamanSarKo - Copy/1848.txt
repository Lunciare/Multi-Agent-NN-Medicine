culture negative. CNS features include a reversible dementia, ophthalmoplegia, and facial myoclonus (if all together, they are highly suggestive)—also hypothalamic syndrome (hyperphagia, polydipsia, insomnia). NB: CNS involvement may occur without GI involvement. Tests: Diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion. Jejunal biopsy shows stunted villi. There is deposition of macrophages in the lamina propria-containing granules which stain positive for periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). Similar cells may be found in af- fected samples, eg CSF, cardiac valve tissue, lymph nodes, synovial fl uid. The bacteria may be seen within macrophages on electron microscopy. PCR of bacterial RNA can be performed on serum or tissue. MRI may demonstrate CNS involvement. : Should include antibiotics which cross the blood–brain barrier. Current recommendations: IV ceftriaxone (or penicillin+streptomycin) for 2wks then oral co-trimoxazole for 1 year. Shorter courses risk relapse. A rapid improvement in symptoms usually occurs. George Hoyt Whipple, 1878–1976 (US pathologist) Zellweger syndrome (Cerebrohepatorenal syndrome.) A rare recessive disorder characterized by absent peroxisomes (intracellular organelles required for many cel- lular activities including lipid metabolism). The syndrome has a similar molecular ba- sis to infantile Refsum’s syndrome, and although more severe, exhibits comparable biochemical abnormalities (p710). Clinical features include craniofacial abnormali- ties, severe hypotonia
