48h usually indicates pump failure or cardiogenic shock. : DC shock (see p894, fi g A3), consider ICD. Right ventricular failure (RVF)/infarction Presents with low cardiac output and JVP. Fluid is key; avoid vasodilators (eg nitrates) and diuretics.20 Inotropes are re- quired in some cases. Pericarditis Central chest pain, relieved by sitting forwards. ECG: saddle-shaped ST elevation, see fi g 3.51, p155. Treatment: NSAIDS. Echo to check for eff usion. Systemic embolism May arise from LV mural thrombus. After large anterior MI, consider anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 months. Cardiac tamponade (p802) Presents with low cardiac output, pulsus paradoxus, Kussmaul’s sign,3 muffl ed heart sounds. Diagnosis: echo. Treatment: pericardial aspi- ration (provides temporary relief, see p773 for technique), surgery. Mitral regurgitation May be mild (minor papillary muscle dysfunction) or severe (chordal or papillary muscle rupture secondary to ischaemia). Presentation: pulmo- nary oedema. Treat LVF (p800) and consider valve replacement. Ventricular septal defect Presents with pansystolic murmur, JVP, cardiac failure. Diagnosis: echo. Treatment: surgery. 50% mortality in fi rst week. Late malignant ventricular arrhythmias Occur 1–3wks post-MI and are the cardi- ologist’s nightmare. Avoid hypokalaemia, the most easily avoidable cause. Consider 24h ECG monitoring prior to discharge if large MI. Dressler’s
