the system is idling. When we bleed, throughput can rise by an order of magnitude—if Sod is turning a blind eye are there suffi cient haematinics (eg iron, B12 , and folate) to allow maximum haemopoiesis?

These cells retain the ability to diff erentiate into RBCS, WBCS, or platelets, causing an excess of one or more of these cell types (table 8.10). Table 8.10 Classifi cation of myeloproliferative disorders By proliferating cell type RBC  Polycythaemia vera (PRV) WBC  Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, p358) Platelets  Essential thrombocythaemia Fibroblasts  Myelofi brosis Polycythaemia Relative polycythaemia (plasma volume, normal RBC mass) may be acute (due to dehydration) or chronic (associated with obesity, HTN, and a high alcohol and tobacco intake). Absolute polycythaemia (RBC mass) is classi- cally measured by dilution of infused autologous radioactive chromium (51Cr) lab- elled RBCs. Causes are primary (polycythaemia vera) or secondary due to hypoxia (eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy smoking) or inappropriately erythropoietin secretion (eg in renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma).
