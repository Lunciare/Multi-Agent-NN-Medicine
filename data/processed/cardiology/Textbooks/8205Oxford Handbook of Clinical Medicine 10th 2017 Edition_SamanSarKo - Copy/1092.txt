N&V, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, +ve tourniquet test (infl ate BP cuff to midway between sys- tolic and diastolic for 5 min≥10 petechiae/inch2). Warning signs/critical phase may occur 3–7d into illness and needs hospital admission: abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, fl uid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, haematocrit + plt. Severe disease: shock (includes postural BP drop >20mmHg), respiratory distress, severe bleeding, organ involvement (transaminases >1000, GCS, other organ failure). Diagnosis: PCR for virus/ELISA antigen3 during viraemia (~1st 5d of fever). Serology (IgM, IgG) after 5d. Also plt, WCC, transaminitis. (: Chikungunya, Zika.) Treatment: Supportive: prompt but careful fl uid balance due to potential for plasma leak. IV crystalloid, to maintain eff ective circulation, only in severe disease. 20mL/kg over 15–30min if hypotensive shock. Monitor clinically and via haematocrit. Reduce IV fl uid as soon as stable. Beware: plasma leak maintains haemocrit unless bleeding. Consider transfusion if haematocrit without clinical improvement. Avoid NSAIDs. Chikungunya Arbovirus (Alphavirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Widespread: Asia, Africa, Europe, and Americas. Name derives from Kimakonde language meaning ‘to become contorted’ due to arthralgia. Blood-borne and vertical transmission possible, but rare. Presentation: Incubation 1–12d. Fever. Polyarthralgia: bilateral, symmetrical, can be severe, persistent. Headache, myalgia, N&V, maculopapular rash.
