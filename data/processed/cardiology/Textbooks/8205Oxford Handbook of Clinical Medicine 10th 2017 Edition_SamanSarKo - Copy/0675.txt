PO (40mg/24h). Schedule maintenance infl ixi- mab if used for rescue, or azathioprine if ciclosporin rescue. • If fails to improve then urgent colectomy by d7–10—the challenge is not to delay surgery so long as to accumulate signifi cant steroid exposure and debilitation that will delay post-surgical recovery. It’s time for immunomodulation if... Patients fl are on steroid tapering or require ≥2 courses of steroids/year eg azathioprine (2–2.5mg/kg/d PO). 30% of patients will develop SES requiring treatment cessation including abdominal pain, nausea, pan- creatitis, leucopenia, abnormal LFTS. Monitor FBC, U+E, LFT weekly for 4 wks, then every 4 wks for 3 months, then at least 3-monthly. Biologic therapy For patients intolerant of immunomodulation, or developing symp- toms despite an immunomodulator, monoclonal antibodies to TNF (infl iximab, adali- mumab, golimumab) or to adhesion molecules involved in gut lymphocyte traffi cking (vedolizumab) play an important role (see BOX ‘Therapies in Crohn’s disease’ p265). Surgery This is needed at some stage in ~20%, eg subtotal colectomy + terminal ileostomy for failure of medical therapy or fulminant colitis with toxic dilatation/ perforation. Subsequently completion proctectomy (permanent stoma) vs ileo–anal pouch. Pouches mean stoma reversal and the possibility of long-term continence but pouch opening frequency
