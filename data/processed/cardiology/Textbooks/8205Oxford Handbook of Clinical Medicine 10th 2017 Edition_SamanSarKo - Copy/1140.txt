million volunteers have vaccinated 3 billion children, preventing 1.5 million deaths in the last 20y. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 443366 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 sesaesid suoitcefnI Rabies 437 Rhabdovirus transmitted through saliva or CNS tissue, usually from the bite of an infected mammal, eg bat (in UK), dog (95% of transmissions to humans), cat, fox. Disease is fatal once symptoms appear. Worldwide distribution. ~50 000 deaths/yr, most in Africa/Asia. Presentation: Incubation ~9–90d. Prodrome: headache, ma- laise, odd behaviour, agitation, fever, paraesthesia at bite/wound site. Progresses to one of two disease forms: • ‘Furious rabies’: hyperactivity and terror (hydrophobia, aerophobia) • ‘Paralytic rabies’: fl accid paralysis in the bitten limbcomadeath. Diagnosis: Clinical: potential exposure + signs of myelitis/encephalitis (non-pro- gressive disease and disease >3wk are negative indicators). Viral PCR (saliva, brain, nerve tissue) or CSF antibodies may off er later (post-mortem) confi rmation. Treat- ment: If bitten, or lick to broken skin, wash (>15min) with soap and seek urgent help. Post-exposure prophylaxis: vaccination ± rabies immunoglobulin. Experimental treatments: ribavirin, interferon alfa, ketamine. Preventable and elimination feasible with pre-exposure vaccination of all at risk. Vaccination of dogs can  human cases. Japanese encephalitis virus Flavivirus spread by mosquitoes.
