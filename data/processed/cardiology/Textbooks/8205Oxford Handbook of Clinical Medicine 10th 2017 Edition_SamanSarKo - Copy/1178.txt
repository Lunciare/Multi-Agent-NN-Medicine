Bilateral infarction is a rare cause of paraplegia and an even rarer cause of akinetic mutism. Middle cerebral artery: (fi g 10.2) Supplies the lateral part of each hemisphere. Oc- clusion may cause contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss (esp. face and arm), contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to involvement of the optic radiation, cognitive change including dysphasia with dominant hemisphere lesions, and visuo- spatial disturbance (eg cannot dress; gets lost) with non-dominant lesions. Posterior cerebral artery: (fi gs 10.2, 10.4) Supplies the occipital lobe. Occlusion gives contralateral homon ymous hemianopia (often with macula sparing). Vertebrobasilar circulation Supplies the cerebellum, brainstem, occipital lobes; occlusion causes signs relating to any or all three: hemianopia; cortical blindness; diplopia; vertigo; nystagmus; ataxia; dysarthria; dysphasia; hemi- or quadriplegia; unilat eral or bilateral sensory symptoms; hiccups; coma. Infarctions of the brain stem can produce various syndromes, eg lateral medullary syndrome, in which occlusion of one vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebe llar artery causes infarction of the lateral medulla and the inferior cerebellar surface ( vertigo, vomiting, dysphagia, nystagmus, ipsilateral ataxia, soft palate paralysis, ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome, and a crossed pattern sensory loss—analgesia to pin-prick on ipsilateral face and contra- lateral trunk and limbs). Locked-in syndrome is
