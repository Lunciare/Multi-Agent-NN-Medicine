chamber sensed (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber, O=none). • 3rd letter the pacemaker response (T=triggered, I=inhibited, D=dual). • 4th letter (R=rate modulation, P=programmable, M=multiprogrammable). • 5th letter (P means that in tachyc ardia the pacemaker will pace the patient. S means that in tachycardia the pacem aker shocks the patient. D=dual ability to pace and shock. O=neither of these). Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Improves the synchronization of cardi- ac contraction and reduces mortality31 in people with symptomatic heart failure who have an ejection fraction <35% and a QRS duration >120ms.32 It involves biventricular pacing (both septal and lateral walls of the LV) and, if required, also an atrial lead. It may be combined with a defi brillator (CRT-D). ECG of paced rhythms (fi g 3.13 and fi g 3.36). Pacemaker input appears as a vertical ‘spike’ on the ECG. This spike can be very small with modern bipolar pacing systems. Ventricular pacing usually has a broad QRS morphology (similar to LBBB). Systems are usually programmed ‘on demand’ so will only pace when necessary. Modern systems are generally very reliable but pacing spikes with no capture afterwards suggests a problem. Programming of devices is complicated so seek help early if concerned. Many
