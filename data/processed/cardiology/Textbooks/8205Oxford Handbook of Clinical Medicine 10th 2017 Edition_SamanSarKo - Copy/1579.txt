bowel See p610. Tests U&E; FBC; amylase; LFT; CRP; lactate (is there mesenteric ischaemia?); urinalysis. Urine and serum hCG is vital to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Erect CXR (fi g 13.26), AXR may show Rigler’s sign (p728). Laparoscopy may avert open surgery. CT can be helpful provided it is readily available and causes no delay (pp732–3); US may identify perforati on or free fl uid (appropriate performer training is important). Pre-op Don’t rush to theatre. Anaesthesia compounds shock, so resuscitate prop- erly fi rst (p790) unless blood being lost faster than can be replaced, eg ruptured ectopic pregnancy, (OHCS p262), aneurysm leak (p654), trauma. Plan Bed rest, keep NBM; assess volume status (BOX) and treat shock (p790); cross- match/group and save; analgesia (p574); arrange imaging; consider need for IVI, blood cultures, and antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV); ECG. The medical acute abdomen Irritable bowel syndrome (p266) is the chief cause, so always ask about episodes of pain associated with loose stools, relieved by defeca- tion, bloating, and urgency (but not blood—this may be UC). Other causes: Myocardial infarction Pneumonia (p166) Sickle-cell crisis (p341) Gastroenteritis or UTI Thyroid storm (p834) Phaeochromocytoma (p837) Diabetes mellitus/DKA (p206) Zoster (p404) Malaria (p416) Bornholm disease Tuberculosis
