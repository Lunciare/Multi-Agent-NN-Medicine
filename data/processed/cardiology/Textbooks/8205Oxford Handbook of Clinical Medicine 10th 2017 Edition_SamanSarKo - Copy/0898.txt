risks anaphylaxis on repeat dosing. Alteplase is recombinant t-PA. Newer agents include tenecteplase and reteplase. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) ITP is caused by antiplatelet auto anti bodies. It is acute (usually in children, 2wks after infection with sudden self-limiting purpura: OHCS p197) or chronic (seen mainly in women). Chronic ITP runs a fl uctuating course of bleeding, purpura (esp. dependent pressure areas), epistaxis, and menorrhagia. There is no spleno- megaly. Tests: Megakaryocytes in marrow, antiplatelet autoantibodies often present. : None if mild. If symptomatic or platelets <20 ≈ 109/L, prednisolone 1mg/kg/d, and reduce after remission; aim to keep platelets >30 ≈ 109/L—takes a few days to work. Platelet transfusions are not used (except during splenecto- my or life-threatening haemorrhage) as these are quickly destroyed by the au- toantibodies. IV immunoglobulin may temporarily raise the platelet count, eg for surgery, pregnancy. If relapse, choices include splenectomy or B-cell depletion with rituximab. Eltrombopag (an oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist) and romiplostim (an injectable thrombopoietin analogue) are alternative options for those with refractory disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334455 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 346 An approach to bleeding There are three sets of questions to be answered: 1 Is there an emergency needing immediate resuscitation or senior help? • Is
