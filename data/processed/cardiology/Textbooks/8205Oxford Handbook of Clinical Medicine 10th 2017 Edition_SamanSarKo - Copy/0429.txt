culture/sensitivity. If indicated, ask for ZN stain, and PCR. Peak expiratory fl ow (PEF) Measured by a maximal forced expiration through a peak fl ow meter. It correlates well with the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) & is used as an estimate of airway calibre in asthma, but is eff ort-dependent. Pulse oximetry Allows non-invasive assessment of peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2). Useful for monitoring those who are acutely ill or at risk of deterioration. Target oxy- gen saturations are usually 94–98% in a well patient or 88–92% in those with certain pre-exisiting lung pathology (eg COPD). Oxygen saturation of <92% in a normally well person is a serious sign and arterial blood gases (ABGS) should be checked. Causes of erroneous readings: poor perfusion, movement, skin pigmentation, nail varnish, dys haemoglobina emias, and carbon monoxide poisoning. As with any bedside test, be sceptical, and check ABGS, whenever indicated (p188). Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis Heparinized blood is usually taken from the radial or femoral artery (see p771). The brachial artery is used less because of median nerve proximity and it is an end artery. pH, PaO2, PaCO2, HCO 3 are measured using an auto- mated analyser. ABG interpretation See
