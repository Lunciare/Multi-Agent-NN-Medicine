despite metabolic acidosis. Treat with bicarbonate replacement and management of underlying dis- ease. Type 4 RTA: Hyperkalaemia and acidosis due to (real or apparent) hypoaldo- steronism, eg adrenal insuffi ciency, DM, ACE-i/ARB, K+-sparing diuretics. Diuretics K+-sparing: aldosterone antagonists, eg spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride. Used in aldosteronism, heart failure, cirrhosis, K+-wasting states. Decrease Na+ and K+ excretion. Can cause K+, acidosis. Oestrogenic eff ects with spironolactone. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331177 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 318 Tubulointerstitial nephropathy and nephrotoxins The renal tubules and the interstitium make up ~80% of the kidney. Damage to one is usually associated with damage to the other = tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Can be acute or chronic. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) Presents with AKI. Eosinophilia in ~30%. An ‘allergic triad’ of fever, rash, and arthral- gia occurs in ~10%. Should be considered in all cases of AKI for which there is no obvious pre-renal or post-renal precipitant (p298). Biopsy shows an infl ammatory cell infi ltrate in the interstitium ± tubule (‘tubulitis’). Prognosis improves with early recognition although residual CKD in up to 40%. Aetiology: • Drugs: antibiotics, NSAIDS, PPIS, diuretics, ranitidine, anticonvulsants, warfarin. Take a full drug history including over-the-counter and herbal preparations. • Infection: Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, E.
