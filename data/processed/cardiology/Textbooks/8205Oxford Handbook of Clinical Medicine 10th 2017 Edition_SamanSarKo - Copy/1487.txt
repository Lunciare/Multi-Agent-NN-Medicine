family mem- bers or a nominated advocate. The right to refuse treatment Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die. Alfred, Lord Tennyson from The Charge of the Light Brigade, 1854. The rights of a patient are something of an antithesis to this military macabre of Tennyson, and it is our responsibility to respect the legal and ethical rights of those we treat. We do this not only for the sake of the individual, but also for the sake of an enduring trust between the patient and doctor, remembering that it is the patient’s right to refuse treatment (if a fully competent adult) even when this may result in the death of the patient, or even the death of an unborn child, whatever the stage of pregnancy. The only exceptions apply to treatment of mental health disorders (see eg in England and Wales the Mental Health Act 2007). 2 If in any doubt, turn to: your senior/consultant; your employing organization; your legal defence organiza- tion; your national medical association; your local research ethics committee. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 556699 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 570 Prophylactic antibiotics in surgery Prophylactic antibiotics are given to counter the risk
