570 = disease frequency in exposed minus the disease frequency in unexposed. Example Total 190 470 (table 1.5): (70/90) Ω (120/570) = 0.57  exposure increases risk by 57%. • Relative risk = ratio of outcome in exposed population compared to unexposed. Relative risk of 1 means risk is same in both populations. Relative risk >1 means ex- posure increases risk. Relative risk <1 means exposure lessens risk, eg vaccination. Example (table 1.5): (70/90)÷(120/570) = 3.69  risk is 3.69 ≈ higher with exposure. • Odds ratio = ratio of the probability of an outcome occurring compared to the probability of an outcome not occurring. Example (table 1.5): (70/20)÷(120/450) = 13.13  odds of outcome are 13.13 ≈ higher with exposure. Relative risk is easier to interpret than odds ratio but relies on a meaningful preva- lence/incidence. For the individual, absolute risk diff erence may be most relevant. P-values and confi dence intervals In a study of two groups (eg new treatment versus placebo), it is possible that there is no diff erence (ie new treatment has no benefi t). This is the null hypothesis. A p-value measures the strength of evidence in relation to the null hypothesis: • Low
