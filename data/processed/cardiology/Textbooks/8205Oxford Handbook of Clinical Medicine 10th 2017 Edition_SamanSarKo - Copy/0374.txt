clear or end organ damage  end-organ damage or high risk. Fig 3.40 Managing suspected hypertension. Target pressure is <140/90mmHg (150/90 if aged >80), but in diabetes mellitus aim for <130/80mmHg, and <125/75 if proteinuria. To quantify CV risk, see www.bhsoc.org. NB: CV threshold of 20% ≈ 15% for CHD alone. Examples of target (end-organ) damage: • LVH • PMH of MI or angina • PMH of stroke/TIA • Peripheral vascular disease • Renal failure.

Drug therapy reduces the risk of CVD and death. Almost any adult over 50 would benefi t from antihypertensives, whatever their starting BP. 48 Treatment is especially impor- tant if: BP is persistently ≥160/100mmHg or cardio vascular risk  (10yr risk of vascular disease ≥20%), or existing vascular disease or target organ damage (eg brain, kidney, heart, retina) with BP >140/90mmHg. Essential hypertension is not ‘curable’ and long- term treatment is needed. Treatment goal <140/90mmHg (<130/80 in diabetes, 150/90 if aged >80). Reduce blood pressure slowly; rapid reduction can be fatal, especially in the context of an acute stroke. These
