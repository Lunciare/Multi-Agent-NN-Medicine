6 level teaspoons of sugar + half level teaspoon salt in 1L clean, drinking water. • Antimotility agents, eg loperamide, bismuth subsalicylates. Avoid if severe pain or bloody diarrhoea as may indicate invasive colitis. • Antibiotics: usually not indicated. Considered if rapid cessation of diarrhoea needed and/or limited access to sanitation/healthcare. Reduce diarrhoea from ~3 to ~1.5 days. Choice depends on allergy, comorbidity, concomitant medica- tion, and destination of travel: ciprofl oxacin 500mg BD for 3d (care quinolone resistance, eg SE Asia), rifaximin 200mg TDS for 3d, azithromycin 1g single dose or 500mg OD for 3d. Prophylaxis: Not recommended as severe disease and long-term sequelae rare, risk of C. diffi cile. Consider in immunosuppressed (transplant, HIV, chemotherapy), GI pathology (IBD, ileostomy, short-bowel), risk with dehydration (sickle cell, CKD). Care with interactions with usual medications. • Ciprofl oxacin 500mg OD (80–100% protection). • Norfl oxacin 400mg OD (75–95% protection). • Rifaximin 200mg every 12–24h (72–77% protection). • Bismuth subsalicylate 2 tablets QDS (62–65% protection, 1st line in US). Persistent diarrhoea: Investigate if >14d or dysentery: FBC, U&E, LFT, infl amma- tory markers, stool microscopy for ova/cysts/parasites (historically 3 samples but may not actually improve diagnostic yield, time intensive), molecular testing for
