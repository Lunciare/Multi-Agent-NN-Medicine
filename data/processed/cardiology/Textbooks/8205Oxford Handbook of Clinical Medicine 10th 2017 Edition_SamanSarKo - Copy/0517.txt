factors produced by the hypothalamus reach the pituitary via the portal system (pituitary stalk), see fi g 5.3. The releasing factors stimulate or inhibit the production of hormones from the anterior pituitary, fi g 5.4. Vasopressin and oxytocin are produced in the hypothalamus and stored and released from the posterior pituitary.

Fig 5.4 Neuroregulation and integration of endocrine axes makes us who we are—and who we are and what we do feeds back into our hormonal milieu. Multifactorial dis ruptions within the growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH)–testosterone, adreno cortico tropin (ACTH)–cortisol and insu- lin axes play a major role in healthy maturation and ageing. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 220044 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 205 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 220055 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 206 Diabetes mellitus (DM): classifi cation and diagnosis DM results from lack, or reduced eff ectiveness, of endogenous insulin. Hyperglycae- mia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems: stroke, MI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia.
