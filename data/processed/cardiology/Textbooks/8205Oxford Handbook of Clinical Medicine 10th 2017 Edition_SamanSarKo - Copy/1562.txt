the UK. 50% who present with a single nodule actually have MNG. Patients are usually eu- thyroid, but may become hyperthyroid (‘toxic’). MNG may be retro- or substernal. Hypothyroidism and malignancy within MNG are rare. Plummer’s disease is hyper- thyroidism with a single toxic nodule (uncommon). •Fibrotic goitre: Eg Reidel’s thy- roiditis. •Solitary thyroid nodule: typically cyst, adenoma, discrete nodule in MNG or malignant (~10%). Investigations Check TSH and USS (solid, cystic, complex or part of a group of lumps). If abnormal consider: •T4, autoantibodies (p216, eg if Hashimoto’s /Graves’, suspected). •CXR with thoracic inlet view (tracheal goitres and metastases?). •Ra- dionuclide scans (fi g 13.22) may show malignant lesions as hypofunctioning or ‘cold’, whereas a hyperfuncti oning ‘hot’ lesion suggests adenoma. •FNA (fi ne-needle aspira- tion) and cytologyΩwill characterize lesion. A FNA fi nding of a follicular neoplasm can be challenging (15–30% malignant)Ωdiscuss with cytopathologist and perform molecular diagnostics where available; if any doubt, refer for surgery. What should you do if high-resolution ultrasound shows impalpable nodules? Such thyroid nodules can usually be observed provided they are: • <1cm across (which accounts for most; ultrasound can detect lumps <2mm; such ‘incidentalomas’ occur in 46% of routine autopsies) and are
