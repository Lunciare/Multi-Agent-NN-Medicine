The 2nd heart sound (S2) Represents aortic (A2) and pulmonary valve (P2) closure. The most important abnormality of A2 is softening in aortic stenosis. • A is said to be loud in tachycardia, hypertension, and transposition, but this is 2 probably not a useful clinical entity. • P is loud in pulmonary hypertension and soft in pulmonary stenosis. 2 • Splitting of S in inspiration is normal and is mainly due to the variation of right 2 heart venous return with respiration, delaying the pulmonary component. • Wide splitting occurs in right bundle branch block (BBB), pulmonary stenosis, deep inspiration, mitral regurgitation, and VSD. • Wide fi xed splitting occurs in atrial septal defect (ASD). • Reversed splitting (ie A2 following P2, with splitting increasing on expiration) occurs in left bundle branch block, aortic stenosis, PDA (patent ductus arterio- sus), and right ventricular pacing. • A single S2 occurs in Fallot’s tetralogy, severe aortic or pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary atresia, Eisenmenger’s syndrome (p156), large VSD, or hypertension. NB: splitting and P2 are heard best in the pulmonary area. Additional sounds 3rd heart sound (S3) may occur just after S2. It is low pitched and best heard with the bell of the
