headaches (migraine and tension), poor concentration, low mood, and sleep distur- bance (~70%). Widespread and severe tender points. Investigations: All normal. Diagnosis is clinical. Over-investigation can consolidate illness behaviour; but exclude other causes of pain and/or fatigue (eg RA, PMR see p557, vasculitis see p556, hypothyroidism see p220, myeloma see p368). Management: Multidisciplinary with optimal results coming from full engagement of the patient who should be encouraged to remain as active as they feel able, and ideally to continue to participate in the workforce. New symptoms should be fully reviewed to exclude an alternative diagnosis. Patients should be advised that there is no one specifi c treatment that is guaranteed to work, but any of the following may help: graded exercise programmes, including both aerobic and strength-based train- ing. Pacing of activity is vital to avoid over-exertion and consequent pain and fatigue. Long-term graded exercise programmes improve functional capacity.55, 56 Relaxa- tion, rehabilitation and physiotherapy may also help. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help patients develop coping strategies and set achievable goals.57 Pharmacotherapy: Low-dose amitriptyline (eg 10–20mg at night) has been shown to help relieve pain and improve sleep. Pregabalin (150–300mg/12h PO) can be used if amitriptyline is ineff ective.
