thrive; meconium ileus; rectal prolapse. Children and young adults: Respiratory: cough; wheeze; recurrent infections; bronchiectasis; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale. Gastrointestinal: pancreatic insuffi ciency (diabetes mellitus, steatorrhoea); distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (meconium ileus equivalent); gallstones; cirrhosis. Other: male infertility; osteoporosis; arthritis; vasculitis (p556); nasal polyps; sinusi- tis; and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA). Signs: cyanosis; fi nger clubbing; bilateral coarse crackles. Diagnosis Sweat test: Sweat sodium and chloride >60mmol/L; chloride usu- ally > sodium. Genetics: Screening for known common CF mutations should be con- sidered. Faecal elastase is a simple and useful screening test for exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Tests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT; clotting; vitamin A, D, E levels; annual glucose tolerance test (p206). Bacteriology: Cough swab, sputum culture. Radiology: CXR; hyperi nfl ation; bronchiectasis. Abdominal ultrasound: Fatty liver; cirrhosis; chronic pancreatitis; Spirometry: Obstructive defect. Aspergillus serology/skin test (20% develop ABPA, p177). Biochemistry: Faecal fat analysis. Management Management should be multidisciplinary, eg physician, GP, physi- otherapist, specialist nurse, and dietician, with attention to psychosocial as well as physical wellbeing. Chest: Physiotherapy (postural drainage, airway clearance techniques). Antibiotics are given for acute infective exacerbations and prophylacti- cally. Chronic Pseudomonas infection is an important predictor of survival. Muco- lytics may be useful
