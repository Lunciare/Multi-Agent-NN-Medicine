disease recurrence by 30% and mortality by 25%. Benefi ts for stage 2 disease are more marginal and warrant an individualized approach. The FOLFOX regimen has become standard (fl uorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin). Chemotherapy is also used in palliation of metastatic disease. Biological therapies: Bevacizumab (anti- VEGF antibody) improves survival when added to combination therapy in advanced disease. Cetuximab and panitumumab (anti-EGFR agents) improve response rate and survival in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Prognosis Survival is dependent on age and stage; for stage 1 disease, 5yr survival is ~75% but this drops to just 5% with diagnosis at stage 4, hence the imperative for eff ective screening (BOX). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 661166 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Right side Left side 617 Splenic flexure 2% Hepatic flexure 3% Ascending colon 7% Transverse colon 5% Descending colon 3% Caecum 14% Sigmoid colon 20% Appendix 1% Rectum 27% Anus 2% Other and unspecified 9% Fig 13.34 Distribution of colorectal carcinomas.
