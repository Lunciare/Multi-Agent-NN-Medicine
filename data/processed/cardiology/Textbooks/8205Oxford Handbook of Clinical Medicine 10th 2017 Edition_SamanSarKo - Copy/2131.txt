potentially fatal: •150mg/kg: mild toxicity. •250mg/kg: moderate •>500mg/kg: severe toxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal. Signs and symptoms Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features: • Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation, tinnitus, vertigo, sweating. • Rarely GCS, seizures, BP and heart block, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia. Patients present initially with respiratory alkalosis due to a direct stimulation of the central respiratory centres and then develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyper- or hypoglycaemia may occur. Management General: (pp838–9.) Correct dehydration. Keep patient on ECG monitor. Give activated charcoal to all presenting 1h—consider even if delayed presentation, slow-release formations, or bezoar formation (can delay absorption): at least one dose of 1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart). 1 Bloods. Paracetamol and salicylate level, glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, HCO3Ω, FBC. Salicylate level may need to be repeated after 2h, due to continuing absorption if a potentially toxic dose has been taken. Monitor blood glucose 1–2hrly, beware hypoglycaemia, if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and U&E. 2 Urine. Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH. 3 Correct acidosis. If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe metabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L
