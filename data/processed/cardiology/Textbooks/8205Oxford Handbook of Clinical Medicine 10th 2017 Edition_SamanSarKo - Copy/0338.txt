(fi g 3.28), aiding diagnosis and management. AVN blockade can be achieved by: 1 Vagal manoeuvres: carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre (eg blowing into a syringe). 2 IV adenosine: see p806. • In some cases, narrow complex tachyarrhythmias cause symptomatic episodes of suffi cient severity and frequency to warrant more invasive treatment, eg ablation therapy for accessory pathways. Fig 3.28 This patient was given adenosine for tachycardia thought to be due to AVRT or AVNRT. The adenosine has slowed the ventricular rate, revealing fl utter waves (sawtooth appearance), disproving an AVRT/AVNRT diagnosis. Image courtesy of Dr Ed Burns, www.lifeinthefastlane.com. Holiday heart syndrome Binge drinking in a person without any clinical evidence of heart disease may result in acute cardiac rhythm and/or conduction disturbances, which is called holiday heart syndrome (note that recreational use of marijuana may have similar eff ects). The most common rhythm disorders are supraventricular tachyarrhyth- mia and AF (consider this diagnosis in patients without structural heart disease who present with new-onset AF). The prognosis is excellent, especially in young patients without structural heart disease. As holiday heart syndrome resolves rapidly by abstinence from alcohol use, advise all patients against the excessive use of alcohol in future. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb
