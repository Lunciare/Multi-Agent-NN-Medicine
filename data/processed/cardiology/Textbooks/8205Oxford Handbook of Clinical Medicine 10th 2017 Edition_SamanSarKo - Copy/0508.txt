adenopathy (rare). Lung function tests: Reversible restrictive defect; reduced gas transfer during acute attacks. Chronic: Blood tests: serum anti- bodies. CXR: upper-zone fi brosis; honeycomb lung. CT chest: nodules, ground glass ap- pearance, extensive fi brosis. Lung function tests: restrictive defect. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fl uid shows lymphocytes and mast cells. Management Acute: Remove allergen and give O2 (35–60%), PO prednisolone (40mg/24h PO), reducing course. Chronic: Allergen avoidance, or wear a facemask or +ve pressure helmet. Long-term steroids often achieve CXR and physiological im- provement. Compens ation (UK Industrial Injuries Act) may be payable. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 119988 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC 199 Fig 4.19 AP chest radiograph showing air-space shadowing in the left upper zone. Although this appearance often represents infection, it is non-specifi c. Diff erential diagnosis for this distribution of shadowing include lymphoma, alveolar cell carcinoma (both to be considered if not resolving in appearance on follow-up imaging), and haemorrhage.
