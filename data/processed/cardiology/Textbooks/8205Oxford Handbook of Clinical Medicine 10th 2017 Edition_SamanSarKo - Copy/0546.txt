Histology showed no discrete insulinoma, but diff use islet cell hyper plasia (nesidioblastosis). How much pancreas to resect? Too little and nothing is gained: too much spells pancreatic endocrine disaster. Luckily the surgeon guessed right, and the patient was cured by the procedure.16 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221155 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 216 Thyroid function tests (TFTs) Physiology Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH=thyro tropin), a glycoprotein, is produced from the anterior pituitary (fi g 5.12). The thyroid produces mainly T4, which is 5-fold less active than T3. 85% of T3 is formed from peripheral conversion of T4. Most T3 and T4 in plasma is protein bound, eg to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). The unbound por- tion is the active part. T3 and T4 cell metabolism, via nuclear receptors, and are thus vital for growth and mental development. They also catecholamine eff ects. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are usually due to problems in the thyroid gland itself, and rarely caused by the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary. TRH from the hypothalamus acts on the pituitary gland Fig 5.12 Pathways involved in thyroid function.
