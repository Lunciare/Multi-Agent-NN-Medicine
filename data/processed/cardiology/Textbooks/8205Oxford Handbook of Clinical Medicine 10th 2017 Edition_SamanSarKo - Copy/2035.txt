identify those in need of further treatment and prompt angiography (involve cardiologists).4 Assessment Brief history: (See p36.) Previous angina, relief with rest/nitrates, history of cardio- vascular disease, risk factors for IHD. Examination: (See p38.) Pulse, BP, JVP, cardiac murmurs, signs of heart failure, pe- ripheral pulses, scars from previous cardiac surgery. Investigations ECG: ST depression; fl at or inverted T-waves; or normal; FBC, U&E, tro- ponin, glucose, random cholesterol; CXR. Management See fi g 19.6 for acute management, but p796 if ST elevation. The aim of therapy is to control pain then initiate anti-ischaemic and antiplatelet therapy. Oral antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 300mg PO, followed by 75mg OD. For those with confi rmed ACS give a second antiplatelet agent, eg clopidogrel (300mg PO then 75mg OD PO). Ticagrelor (180mg then 90mg/12h PO) is a prefered alternative, particularly in higher risk groups5 (eg • ≥60yrs age •previous stroke, TIA, MI, or CABG •known coro- nary artery stenosis ≥50% in ≥2 vessels or carotid stenosis ≥50% •DM •peripheral arterial disease •chronic kidney disease). Prasugrel (60mg then 10mg/d PO) is an alternative to clopidogrel for those undergoing PCI. In practice, if the history is typi- cal but ECG changes are non-diagnostic and troponin results
