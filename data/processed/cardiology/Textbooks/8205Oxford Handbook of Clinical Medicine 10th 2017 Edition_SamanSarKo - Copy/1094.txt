until outbreak in Pacifi c Islands (2007–2013), and Brazil (2015). Estimated 1.5 million cases in Brazil by 2016. Zika detected in sperm and blood products so transmission not limited to vector. Up-to-date geo- graphic and clinical data available at: www.ecdc.europa.eu Presentation: Subclinical in ~80%. Mild illness in ~20%: fever, conjunctivitis, myalgia, rash. Severe acute illness and Guillian–Barré are rare. Zika and birth defects: Geographical and tem- poral relationship between infection and microcephaly. Zika detected in amniotic fl uid is evidence of placental transfer. Specifi c fetal syndrome: microcephaly, in- tracranial calcifi cation, eye pathology, redundant scalp skin. Small, uncontrolled studies show fetal abnormalities in up to 30% of pregnant women infected with Zika.13 Absolute and relative risks unknown (2016). Diagnosis: PCR of viral DNA in blood/body fl uid. Treatment: Vector control, avoid non-essential travel in preg- nancy, condoms to prevent sexual transmission. Vaccine trials ongoing (2016). Lymphatic fi lariasis (elephantiasis) >40 million aff ected and disfi gured. >1 billion at risk (80% in sub-Saharan Africa). Filarial parasites (nematodes) trans- mitted via mosquitoes which bite infected hosts and ingest microfi laria. These mature in the mosquito with infective larvae transferring to new hosts during feeding. Adult worms form nests in lymphatic
