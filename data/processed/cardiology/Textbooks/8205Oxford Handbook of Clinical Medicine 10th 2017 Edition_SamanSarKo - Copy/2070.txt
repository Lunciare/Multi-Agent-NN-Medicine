chest drain. • Aspiration of a pneumothorax, see p767. • Insertion and management of a chest drain, see p766. Use a small tube (10–14F) unless blood/pus is also present. Tubes may be removed 24h after the lung has re- expanded and air leak has stopped (ie the tube stops bubbling). This is done during expiration or a Valsalva manoeuvre. Surgical advice: Arrange if: bilateral pneumothoraces; lung fails to expand within 48h of intercostal drain insertion; persistent air leak; two or more previous pneumo- thoraces on the same side; or history of pneumothorax on the opposite side. Tension pneumothorax  This is a medical emergency. (See fi g 16.43, p749.) Essence Air drawn into the pleural space with each inspiration has no route of escape during expiration. The mediastinum is pushed over into the contralateral hemithorax, kinking and compressing the great veins. Unless the air is rapidly re- moved, cardiorespiratory arrest will occur. Signs Respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, trachea deviated away from side of pneumothorax. Increased percussion note, reduced air entry/breath sounds on the aff ected side. Treatment To remove the air, insert a large-bore (14–16G) needle with a syringe, partially fi lled with 0.9% saline, into the
