sources of infection. PET can be combined with CT or MRI to provide high-quality images combining anatomy with physiology. A range of alternative tracers are now entering clinical use with radiotracers conjugated to other tissue-specifi c substrates (eg 11C-labelled metomidate to detect tumors of adrenocortical origin, somatostatin tracers in neuroendocrine tumours, and amyloid tracers in Alzheimer’s disease). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) Similar to PET but rather than using positron emission, it uses a radioisotope-labelled molecule as per con- ventional nuclear imaging, but with two gamma cameras for detection. The images produced are of lower resolution than PET but the isotopes used are longer lived and more easily available. Examples include myocardial perfusion scanning (p741). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 773399 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 740 Cardiovascular imaging CT Cardiac CT: Modern CT scanners can acquire images with suffi cient speed and resolution to image coronary arteries and exclude signifi cant disease with a nega- tive predictive value of 97–99%. It can also visualize CABG patency, pro- vide coronary artery Ca2+ scoring (a risk factor for coronary artery disease, p117), demonstrate car- diac anatomy including congenital anomalies, and estimate ventricular function. Vascular CT: Has become routine in emergency assessment of suspected dissections, ruptured aneurysms,
