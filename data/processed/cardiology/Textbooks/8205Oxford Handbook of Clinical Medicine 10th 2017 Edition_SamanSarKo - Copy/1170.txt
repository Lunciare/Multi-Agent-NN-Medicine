quadriparesis/tetra plegia (all limbs) are sug- gested by fi nding a motor and refl ex level (power is unaff ected above the lesion, with LMN signs at the level of the lesion, and UMN signs below the lesion). A sensory level is the hallmark (albeit a rather unreliable one)—ie decreased sensation below the level of the lesion with normal sensation above. Hemi- cord lesions cause a Brown-Séquard picture (p696): dorsal column loss on the side of the lesion and contralateral spinothalamic loss. Dissociated sensory loss may occur, eg in cervi- cal cord lesions—loss of fi ne touch and proprioception without loss of pain and temperature (or vice versa, eg syringomyelia, p516; or cord tumours). Peripheral neuropathies: (p502.) Most cause distal weakness, eg foot-drop; weak hand (note: although Guillain–Barré syndrome typically presents as distal weakness that as- cends over time, some atypical forms of Guillain–Barré syndrome may present with proximal weakness due to nerve root involvement). Sensory loss is typically worse distally (may involve all sensory modalities or be selective, depending on nerve fi bre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs with trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p503); invol vement of several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg
