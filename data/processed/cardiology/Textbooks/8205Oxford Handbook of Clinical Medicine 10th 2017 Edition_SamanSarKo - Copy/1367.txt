radiation source being placed within or close to a tumour, allowing a high local radiation dose. Implants may be placed within a cavity (eg uterus, post-surgical space) or within tissue (eg prostate, breast). Radioisotope therapy uses tumour-seeking radionuclides to target specifi c tissues. For example, 131I (radioiodine) to ablate remaining thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. Interventional oncology Interventional oncology (IO) refers to interventional radiology procedures used in the treatment or palliation of patients with cancer. IO can be divided into disease- modifying and symptomatic procedures. Disease-modifying IO: Intended to modify cancer progression and/or to improve prognosis. Includes: • Image-guided ablation, eg radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, irreversible electroporation. • Embolization, eg transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, selective inter- nal radiation therapy. • Image-guided brachytherapy. • Isolated perfusion chemotherapy: uses occlusion techniques to protect normal tissue from high doses of chemotherapy. Symptomatic IO: Provides relief from cancer-related symptoms, but does not modify the underlying disease process. The techniques (table 11.2) can off er signifi cantly improved qual- ity of life, reduce admissions, and increase time spent outside of hospital.
