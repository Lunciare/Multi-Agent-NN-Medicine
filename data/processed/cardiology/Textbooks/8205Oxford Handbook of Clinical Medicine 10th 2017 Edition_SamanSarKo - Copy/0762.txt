cyst pathology, and renal infarct. • Visible haematuria: (VH, macroscopic.) Urological investigation is required to exclude renal tract malignancy. Nephrological causes include polycystic kidney disease and glomerular disease (IgA p311, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease p311, Alport syndrome p320). • Nephrotic syndrome: Proteinuria >3g/24 hours (=P:CR >300mg/mmol) with hypoalbuminaemia (<30g/L) and peripheral oedema. Renal biopsy is usually indicated in adults (p310). • Symptomatic chronic kidney disease: Dyspnoea, anorexia, weight loss, pruri- tus, bone pain, sexual dysfunction, cognitive decline (pp302–5). 3 A systemic disorder with renal involvement • DM: (p314.) • Metabolic: Sickle cell disease (p315), tuberous sclerosis (p320), Fabry disease (p320), cystinosis (p321). • Auto-immune: ANCA-associated vasculitis (p314, 556), SLE (p314), Henoch– Schonlein purpura (p311), systemic sclerosis (p315), sarcoid (p318), Sjögren’s syndrome (p318, 710). • Infection: Sepsis is a common cause of AKI. Specifi c renal involvement may oc- cur with TB (p392), malaria, chronic hepatitis (p278), HIV (pp398–403). • Malignancy: Obstruction, hypercalcaemia, direct toxicity, eg myeloma (p314). • Pregnancy: Pre-eclampsia, obstruction. • Drugs used in systemic disorders: NSAIDS, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides, chemo- therapy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 229933 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 294 Urine Perform dipstick urinalysis whenever you suspect renal disease.
