for close contacts of infected patients: Hand hygiene, avoid shared utensils and face-to-face contact, wear high-effi ciency masks and eye protection. Start empirical antiviral treatment (oseltamivir within 48 hours of exposure and zanamivir within 36 hours). Monitor for fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, or other systemic symptoms developing. Coronaviruses: SARS and MERS Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS15) is caused by SARS-COV virus—a corona virus. Major features are persistent fever (>38°C), chills, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, headache, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea—with an abnormal CXR and WCC. Respiratory failure is a complicating feature: ~20% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation. 16 Mortality is 1–50%, depend- ing on age, but no cases since 2004. Close contacts, or travel to an area with known cases should raise suspicion. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV is human–human. Management: seek expert help. Largely supportive with good infection control measures. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) and was fi rst identifi ed in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal upset. Incubation period 14 days. Human-to-human transmission has been reported in most cases, but camels play a pivotal
