Intra-epidermal spread of an intraduct cancer, which can look just like eczema. Any red, scaly lesion at the nipple (see fi g 15.13) must suggest PDB: do a biopsy. : Breast-conserving surgery + radiotherapy. Sentinel node biopsy should be performed. Sir James Paget, 1814–1899 (British surgeon) Pancoast’s syndrome Apical lung ca invades the sympathetic plexus in the neck (ipsi lateral Horner’s, p702) ± brachial plexus (arm pain ± weakness) ± recurrent laryngeal nerve (hoarse voice/bovine cough).

Henry Parinaud, 1844–1905 (French neuro-ophthalmologist) Peutz–Jeghers’ syndrome Dominant germline mutations of tumour suppressor gene STK11 (in 66–94%) cause mucocutaneous dark freckles on lips (fi g 15.14), oral mucosa, palms and soles, + multiple GI polyps (hamartomas), causing obstruction, intussusception, or bleeds. There is a 15-fold risk of developing GI cancer perform colonoscopy (from age 18yrs) and OGD (from age 25yrs) every 3yrs. NB: hamartomas are excessive focal overgrowths of normal cells in an organ composed of the same cell type.
