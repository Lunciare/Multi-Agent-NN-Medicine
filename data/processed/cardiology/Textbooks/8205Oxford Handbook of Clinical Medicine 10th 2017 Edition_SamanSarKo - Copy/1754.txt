furosemide is contentious, as supporting RCT evidence is scant.9,10 It helps to promote renal excretion of Ca2+, but can exacerbate hypercalcaemia by worsening dehydration. Thus it should only be used once fully rehydrated, and with concomitant IV fl uids (eg 0.9% saline 1L/4–6h). Avoid thiazides.

Signs and symptoms See BOX.11 Mild: cramps, perioral numbness/paraesthesiae. Severe: carpopedal spasm (especially if brachial artery compressed, Trousseau’s sign; see fi g 14.6), laryngos pasm, seizures. Neuromuscular excitability may also be demonstrated by tapping over parotid (facial nerve) causing facial muscles to twitch (Chvostek’s sign; see fi g 14.7). Cataract if chronic hypocalcaemia. ECG: Long QT interval. Causes With PO43Ω With  or PO43Ω • Chronic kidney disease (p302). • Vitamin D defi ciency. • Hypoparathyroidism (incl thyroid • Osteomalacia (ALP). or parathyroid surgery, p222). • Acute pancreatitis. • Pseudohypoparathyroidism (p222). • Over-hydration. • Acute rhabdomyolysis. • Respiratory alkalosis (total Ca2+ • Hypomagnesaemia. is normal, but ionized Ca2+ due to pH  symptomatic).
