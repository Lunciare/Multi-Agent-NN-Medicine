until blood is available. Children: Use glucose with sodium chloride for fl uid maintenance: 100mL/kg for the fi rst 10kg, 50mL/kg for the next 10kg, and 20mL/kg thereafter—all per 24h. Elderly: May be more prone to fl uid overload, so use IV fl uids with care (smaller fl uid bolus). GI losses: (Diarrhoea, vomiting, NG tubes, etc.) Replace lost K+ as well as lost fl uid volume. Heart failure: Use IV fl uids with care to avoid fl uid overload (p134). Liver failure: Patients often have a raised total body sodium, so use salt-poor albumin or blood for resuscitation, and avoid 0.9% saline for maintenance. Acute pancreatitis: Aggressive fl uid resuscitation is required due to large amounts of sequestered ‘third-space’ fl uid (p636). Poor urine output: Aim for >1 mL/kg/h; the minimum is >0. 5mL/kg/h. Give a fl uid challenge, eg 500mL 0.9% saline over 1h (or half this volume in heart failure or the elderly), and recheck the urine output. If not catheterized, exclude retention; if catheterized, ensure the catheter is not blocked! Post-operative: Check the operation notes for intraoperative losses, and ensure you chart and replace added losses from drains, etc. Shock: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline
