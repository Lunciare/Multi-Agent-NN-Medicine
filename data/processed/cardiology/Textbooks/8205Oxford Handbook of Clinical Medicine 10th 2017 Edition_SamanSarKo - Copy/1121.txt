Live vaccine  delay vaccination if in utero biological agents with active transfer across placenta (eg infl iximab, adalimumab). Enterotoxigenic E. coli: Gram Ωve anaerobe. Disease due to heat-stable or heat- labile toxin which stimulates Na+, Cl- and water effl ux into gut lumen. ~20% of all infective diarrhoea, ~80% of traveller’s diarrhoea. Presentation: incubation 1–3d. Watery diarrhoea, cramps. Lasts ~3–4d. Diagnosis: clinical, identifi cation of toxin from stool culture. Treatment: supportive. See Traveller’s diarrhoea p429.

Presentation: sudden-onset diarrhoea, cramps, usually lasts <24h. Diagnosis: stool toxin, quantifi cation of faecal bacteria. Treatment: supportive. -toxin of C. perfringens type C can cause a necrotizing enteritis with fulminant dis- ease, pain, bloody diarrhoea, septic shock. -toxin is sensitive to trypsin proteolysis so  risk with trypsin inhibition by sweet potatoes, ascaris infection  occurs in New Guinea (’pigbel’), central/south
