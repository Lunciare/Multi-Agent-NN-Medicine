can help monitor fl uid resuscitation (normal is 0–5cmH2O relative to sternal angle). Hypovolaemia may also be caused by haem- orrhage so review wounds, drains, and abdomen. If unstable, return to theatre for haemostasis. Beware cardiogenic and neurogenic causes and look for evidence of MI or PE. Consider sepsis and anaphylaxis. Management: p790. BP may be from pain, urinary retention, idiopathic hypertension (eg missed medi- cation), or inotropic drugs. Oral cardiac medications (including antihypertensives) should be continued throughout the perioperative period even if NBM. Treat the cause, consider increasing the regular medication, or if not absorbing orally try 50mg labetalol IV over 1min (see p140). Urine output (oliguria) Aim for output of >30mL/h in adults (or >0.5mL/kg/h). Anuria may refl ect a blocked or malsited catheter (see p763) rather than AKI. Flush or replace catheter. Oliguria is usually due to too little replacement of lost fl uid. Treat by increasing fl uid input. Acute kidney injury may follow shock, drugs, transfusion, pancreatitis, or trauma (see p300 for classifi cation and management of AKI). • Review fl uid chart and examine for signs of volume depletion. • Urinary retention is also common, so examine for a palpable bladder. • Establish normovolaemia
