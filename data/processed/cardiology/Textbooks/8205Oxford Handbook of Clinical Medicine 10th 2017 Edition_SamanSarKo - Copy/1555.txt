Culture all biopsied lymph nodes for TB. Diagnosis (See fi g 13.19.) First, ask how long the lump has been present. If <3wks, self-limiting infection is the likely cause and extensive investigation is unwise. Next ask yourself where the lump is. Is it intradermal—eg sebaceous cyst with a central punc- tum (p594)? Is it a lipoma (p594)? If the lump is not intradermal, and is not of recent onset, you are about to start a diagnostic hunt over complicated terrain. 85% of neck swellings are lymph nodes (examine areas which they serve).
