allows you to confi rm the early fi nding, but also attempt to ‘get below the lump’. If there is a distinct inferior border under which you can place your hand with the entire lump above it then the goitre is unlikely to have retrosternal extension. Examining for ‘spread’ to the lymph nodes is particularly important if you suspect a thyroid malignancy (p600). Complete palpation by assessing if the presence of the lump has caused the trachea to deviate from the midline. 5 Percussion A retrosternal goitre will produce a dull percussion note when the sternum is percussed. 6 Auscultation A bruit in a smooth thyroid goitre is suggestive of Graves’ disease (p218). The next stages of the exam are to examine the systemic signs of thyroid status. 7 Hands Clubbing (‘thyroid acropachy’) is seen in Graves’ disease. Palmar erythe- ma and a fi ne tremor are also signs of thyrotoxicosis. Assess temperature (warm peripheries if hyperthyroid) and the radial pulse; tachycardia and atrial fi brilla- tion are seen in hyperthyroidism, while bradycardia is seen in hypothyroidism. 8 Eyes The ‘normal’ upper eyelid should always cover the upper eye such that the white sclera is not visible between the lid
