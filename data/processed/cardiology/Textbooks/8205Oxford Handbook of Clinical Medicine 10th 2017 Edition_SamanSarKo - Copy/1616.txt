surgery and its aftermath Indications for gastric surgery include gastric cancer (p619) and perforated/ haemorrhaging peptic ulcers. Medical therapy (p252) for peptic ulcers has made elective surgery exceedingly rare/redundant. Emergency surgery may be needed for haemorrhage or perforation. Haemorr hage is usually treated by under-running the bleeding ulcer base or excision of the ulcer. If the former is done, then a biopsy should be taken to exclude malignancy. Perforation is usually managed by excision of the hole for histology, then closure. Gastric carcinoma Localized disease may be treated by curative gastrectomy. Le- sions in the proximal third or extensive infi ltrative disease require total gastrectomy, while lesions in the distal two-thirds can be treated with a partial gastrectomy. Lapa- roscopic surgery may be as eff ective and safe as open surgery in specialist centres. Surgery: Billroth I: Partial gastrectomy with simple gastroduodenal re-anastomosis. Billroth II (AKA Polya) gastrectomy: (fi g 13.37) Partial gastrectomy with gastroje- junal anastomosis. The duodenal stump is oversewn (leaving a blind aff erent loop), and anastomosis is achieved by a longitud inal incision into the proximal jejunum. Roux-en-Y: (fi g 13.38) Following total or subtotal gastrectomy, the proximal duodenal stump is oversewn, the proximal jejunum is
