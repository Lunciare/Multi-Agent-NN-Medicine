atrium. Ventricular rate often 150bpm (2:1 block). • Atrial tachycardia: abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS. • Multifocal atrial tachycardia: ≥3 P-wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes. • Junctional tachycardia: AV node is part of the pathway. P wave either buried in QRS complex or occurring after QRS complex. • AV nodal re-entry tachycardia. • AV re-entry tachycardia, includes an accessory pathway, eg WPW (p133). Management Be guided by patient status,6 see fi g 19.10.6 If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion. • Otherwise, identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly. The most impor- tant thing is to decide whether the rhythm is regular or not (irregular is likely AF). • Vagal manoeuvres (carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre) transiently in- crease AV block, and may unmask an underlying atrial rhythm. • If unsuccessful, give adenosine, which causes transient AV block. It has a short half- life (10–15s) and works by: 1 transiently slowing ventricles to show the underlying atrial rhythm; 2 cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Adenosine: Consult BNF if on dipyridamole or has had a heart transplant. Give 6mg IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline fl ush, while recording a rhythm strip.
