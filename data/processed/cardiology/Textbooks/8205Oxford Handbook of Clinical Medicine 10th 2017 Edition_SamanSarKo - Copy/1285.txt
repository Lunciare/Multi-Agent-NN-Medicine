(eg abdominal surgery, gastroenteritis). Levodopa: Dopamine precursor, given combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibi- tor in co-beneldopa or co-careldopa. SES: dyskinesia, painful dystonia. Non-motor SES: psychosis; visual hallucinations, nausea and vomiting (give domperidone). Modifi ed-release preparations should only be used in late disease. Dopamine agonists (DAS): Ropinirole and pramipexole monotherapy can delay starting levodopa in early stages of PD, and allow lower doses of levodopa as PD progresses. Rotigotine transdermal patches are available as mono- or additive. SES: drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations, compulsive behaviour (gambling, hyper- sexuality, p449). Ergot-derived DA-agonists (b romocriptine, pergolide, cabergo- line) can cause fi brotic reactions, and are not favoured. Amantadine (weak DA) is used for drug-induced dyskinesias in late PD. Apomorphine: Potent DA agonist used with continuous SC infusion to even out end- of-dose eff ects, or as a rescue-pen for sudden ‘off ’ freezing. SE: injection-site ulcers. Anticholinergics: (Eg benzhexol, orphenadrine.) Cause confusion in the elderly and have multiple SES—limit to younger patients (but not 1st line). MAO-B inhibitors: (Eg rasagiline, selegiline.) An alternative to dopamine agonists in early PD. SEs include postural hypotension and atrial fi brillation. COMT inhibitors: (Eg entacapone, tolcapone.) May help motor complications in late disease.
