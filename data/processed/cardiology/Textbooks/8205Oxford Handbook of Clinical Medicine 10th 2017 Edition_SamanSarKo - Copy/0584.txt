The approach to investigation remains controversial, but the simplest is to look for a suppressed renin and aldosterone (may be normal if there is severe hy- pokalaemia). CT or MRI of the adrenals is done to localize the cause. This should be done after hyperaldosteronism is proven, due to the high number of adrenal incident alomas. If imaging shows a unilateral adenoma, adrenal vein sampling may be done (venous blood is sampled from both adrenals). If one side reveals increased aldosterone:cortisol ratio compared with the other (>3-fold diff erence), an adenoma is likely, and surgical excision is indicated. If no nodules or bilateral nodules are seen, think about adrenal hyperplasia or GRA. NB: renal artery stenosis is a more common cause of refractory
