infection. Includes: • scalded skin syndrome—bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins (no mucosal disease, skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis) • preformed toxin in food—sudden D&V (p428) • toxic shock—fever, confusion, rash, diarrhoea, BP, AKI, multiorgan dysfunction. Tampon associated or occurs with (minor) local infection. 2 Local tissue destruction: impetigo, cellulitis, mastitis, septic arthritis, osteomy- elitis, abscess, pneumonia, UTI. 3 Haematogenous spread: bacteraemia, endocarditis, ‘metastatic’ seeding. Diagnosis: positive culture from relevant site of infection. Treatment: Sepsis, see p792. Drain infected foci, antibiotic (topical/oral/IV) based on illness severity and risk factors. Consider local epidemiology of resistance. If systemic treatment indicated, use -lactam whenever possible (may need to cover resistant strains until sensitiv- ity available). Preformed toxin in food: supportive, antibiotics not usually indicated. Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: MRSA, VISA, VRSA Staph. aureus which produces -lactamase, or an altered enzyme responsible for cell wall formation, will be resistant to -lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cepha- losporins, carbapenems, see p385). Resistance is usually defi ned by stability to meticillin, ie meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin resistance also exists and is classifi ed according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit bacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomy- cin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA).
