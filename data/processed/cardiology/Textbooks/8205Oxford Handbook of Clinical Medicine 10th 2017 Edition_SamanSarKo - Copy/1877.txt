outside the lumen You must explain any gas outside the lumen of the gut. It could be: 1 Pneumoperitoneum; signs on the supine AXR include: gas on both sides of the bowel wall (Rigler’s sign), a triangle of gas in the RUQ trapped beneath the falci- form ligament, and a circle of gas beneath the anterior abdominal wall. Seen with bowel perforation but also after laparoscopic surgery. 2 Gas in the urinary tract—eg in the bladder from a fi stula. 3 Gas in the biliary tree (see next paragraph), or rarely 4 Intramural gas, found in bowel necrosis. Biliary tree Any stones: ~10% visible on plain AXR. Any gas: (Pneumobilia.) Caused by: •post-ERCP/sphincterotomy •post-surgery (eg Whipple’s) •recent stone passage •anaerobic cholangitis (rare) •gallbladder–bowel fi stula: gallstone migrates directly into the bowel (Rigler’s triad is seen in 25%: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, an ectopic gallstone). Calcifi cation: (‘Porcelain gallbladder’.) Chronic infl ammation from gallstones (associated with gallbladder cancer). Urinary tract Check for calculi (visible in 90% of cases)1 and normal anatomy: Kidneys: Length equivalent to 2½–3½ vertebral bodies, slope inferolaterally. Right is lower than the left (‘pushed down’ by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding layer
