positive: Myoglobin triggers same dipstick reaction—check microscopy. Management: VH, SNVH, and aNVH >40yr should undergo urological assessment, im- aging, and cystoscopy to exclude renal tract malignancy and calculi. A renal aetiology should be considered, and renal referral made, for NVH with: • eGFR <60 • coexistent proteinuria (A:CR >30 or P:CR >50) • hypertension >140/90mmHg • family history of renal disease. A cause is not established in 19–68% of patients with NVH. These patients should be monitored via BP, eGFR, and repeat A:CR/P:CR every 6 months–1 year. Increasing pro- teinuria and deteriorating eGFR warrant repeat referral and investigation. Others Glucose: DM, pregnancy, sepsis, proximal renal tubular pathology (p316). Ketones: Starvation, ketoa cidosis. Leucocytes: UTI (p296), vaginal discharge. Nitrites: UTI (enteric GramΩve organism). Bilirubin: Haemolysis. Urobilinogen: Liver disease, haemolysis. Specifi c gravity: Normal range: 1.005–1.030, limited surrogate for urine osmolality, aff ected by proteinuria. pH: NR: 4.5–9, usually acidic with meat containing diet (acid–base balance: p670, renal tubular acidosis pp316–7). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 229944 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Urine microscopy 295 Cells: Red blood cells: • >2 red cells/mm3 is abnormal. • Can come from anywhere in the urinary tract. Isomorphic red cells are similar to circulating red cells and may suggest bleeding
