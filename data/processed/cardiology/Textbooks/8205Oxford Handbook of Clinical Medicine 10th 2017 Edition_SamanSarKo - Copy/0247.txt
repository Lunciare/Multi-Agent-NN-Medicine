fort and frustration with malformed words, eg ‘spoot’ for ‘spoon’ (or ‘that thing’). Reading and writing are impaired but comprehension is relatively intact. Patients understand questions and attempt to convey meaningful answers. Site of lesion: in- fero-lateral dominant frontal lobe (see BOX ‘Problems with classifying dysphasias’). • Wernicke’s (receptive) posterior dysphasia—empty, fl uent speech, like talk- ing ragtime with phonemic (‘fl ush’ for ‘brush’) and semantic (‘comb’ for ‘brush’) paraphasias/neologisms (may be mistaken for psychotic speech). The patient is oblivious of errors. Reading, writing, and comprehension are impaired (replies are inappropriate). Site of lesion: posterior superior dominant temporal lobe. • Conduction aphasia—(traffi c between Broca’s and Wernicke’s area is interrupt- ed.) Repetition is impaired; comprehension and fl uency less so. • Nominal dysphasia—naming is aff ected in all dysphasias, but in nominal dyspha- sia, objects cannot be named but other aspects of speech are normal. This occurs with posterior dominant temporoparietal lesions. Mixed dysphasias are common. Discriminating features take time to emerge after an acute brain injury. Speech therapy is important, but may not help. Dysarthria Diffi culty with articulation due to incoordination or weakness of the musculature of speech. Language is normal (see earlier in topic). • Assessment: Ask
