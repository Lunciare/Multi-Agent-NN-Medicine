lymphadenopathy; ascites. Tests Blood: Cholestatic jaundice. CA 19–9 (p531) is non-specifi c, but helps assess prognosis. Imaging: US or CT can show a pancreatic mass ± dilated biliary tree ± hepatic metastases. They can guide biopsy and help staging prior to surgery/stent insertion. ERCP/MRCP (p742) show biliary tree anatomy and may localize the site of obstruction. EUS (endoscopic sonography) is an emerging adjunct for diagnosis and staging. : Most ductal cancers present with metastatic disease; <20% are suitable for radical surgery. Surgery: Resection (pancreato duodenectomy: Whip p le’s, p271, fi g 6.23) is a major undertaking best considered only where no distant metastases and where vascular invasion is still at a minimum. Post-op morbidity is high (mortal- ity <5%); non-curative resection confers no survival benefi t. Laparoscopic excision: Tail lesions are easiest. Post-op chemotherapy: Delays disease progression. Pal- liation of jaundice: Endoscopic or percutaneous stent insertion may help jaundice and anorexia. Rarely, palliative bypass surgery is done for duodenal obstruction or unsuccessful ERCP. Pain: Disabling pain may need big doses of opiates (p575), or radi- otherapy. Coeliac plexus infi ltration with alcohol may be done at the time of surgery, or percutaneously. Referral to a palliative care team is essential.
