important, but may not help. Dysarthria Diffi culty with articulation due to incoordination or weakness of the musculature of speech. Language is normal (see earlier in topic). • Assessment: Ask to repeat ‘British Constitution’ or ‘baby hippopotamus’. • Cerebellar disease: Ataxia speech muscles cause slurring (as if drunk) and speech irregular in volume and staccato in quality. • Extrapyramidal disease: Soft, indistinct, and monotonous speech. • Pseudobulbar palsy: (p507) Spastic dysarthria (upper motor neuron). Speech is slow, indistinct, nasal and eff ortful (‘hot potato’ voice from bilateral hemispheric lesions, MND (p506), or severe MS). • Bulbar palsy: Lower motor neuron (eg facial nerve palsy, Guillain–Barré, MND, p506)—any associated palatal paralysis gives speech a nasal character. Dysphonia Diffi culty with speech volume due to weakness of respiratory muscles or vocal cords (myasthenia, p512; Guillain–Barré syndrome, p702). It may be precipi- tated in myasthenia by asking the patient to count to 100. Parkinson’s gives a mixed picture of dysarthria and dysphonia. Dyspraxia Poor performance of complex movements despite ability to do each in- dividual component. Test by asking the patient to copy unfamiliar hand positions, or mime an object’s use, eg a comb. The term ‘dyspraxia’ is used in three other ways:
