(p822). Send CSF for viral PCR including HSV. • EEG: Urgent EEG showing diff use abnormalities may help confi rm a diagnosis of encephalitis, but does not indicate a cause. Management Mortality in untreated viral encephalitis is ~70%. Aim to start aciclovir within 30min of the patient arriving (10mg/kg/8h IV over 1h) for 14d as empirical treat- ment for HSV (21d if immunosuppressed). Specifi c therapies also exist for CMV and toxoplasmosis (p425). • Supportive therapy, in high-dependency unit or ICU environment if necessary. • Symptomatic treatment: eg phenytoin for seizures (p826). Cerebral abscess Suspect this in any patient with ICP, especially if there is fever or WCC. It may follow ear, sinus, dental, or periodontal infection; skull fracture; congenital heart disease; endocarditis; bronchiectasis. It may also occur in the absence of systemic signs of infl ammation. Signs Seizures, fever, localizing signs, or signs of ICP. Coma. Signs of sepsis else- where (eg teeth, ears, lungs, endocarditis). Investigations CT/MRI p746 (eg ‘ring-enhancing’ lesion); WCC, ESR; biopsy. Treatment Urgent neurosurgical referral; treat ICP (p830). If frontal sinuses or teeth are the source, the likely organism will be Strep. milleri (microaerophilic), or oropharyngeal anaerobes. In ear abscesses, B. fragilis or other anaerobes
