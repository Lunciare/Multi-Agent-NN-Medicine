you should know the likely diagnosis, so assess neurological func- tion looking at power, function, and sen- sation: • Wrist and forearm: Extension (prayer position) and fl exion (reverse prayer), supination and pronation. Look at the elbows. • Small muscles: Pincer grip, power grip (squeeze my two fi ngers), abduction of the thumb, abduction (spread your fi n- gers), and adduction (grip this piece of paper between your fi ngers) of the fi n- gers. NB Froment's sign = fl exion of the Fig 2.39 Sclerosis. thumb during grip as ulnar nerve lesion prevents adduction (p453). • Function: Write a sentence, undo a but- ton, pick up a coin. • Sensation: Test little fi nger (ulnar), index fi nger (median), and anatomi- cal snuff box (radial) using light touch/ pinprick. When you have clinched the diagnosis and functional status, examine each joint, palpating for tenderness, eff usions, and crepitus. Test sensation (see p67) and ex- amine the elbows. Consider examination of upper limbs and face. Top tips • Cross your fi ngers before the patient grips them, it hurts less! • Don’t forget to palpate the radial pulse. • Don’t forget to look at the elbows for plaques of psoriasis
