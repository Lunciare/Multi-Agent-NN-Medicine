Local effects of neurofi bromas: nerve root compression (weakness, pain, paraesthesiae); GI—bleeds, obstruction; bone—cystic lesions, scoliosis, pseudarth rosis. BP from renal artery ste- nosis or phaeochromo cytoma. Plexiform neurofi bromas (large, subcutaneous swell- ings). Malignancy (5% patients with NF1): optic glioma, sarcomatous change in a neurofi broma. Epilepsy risk (slight). Rare association: carcinoid syndrome (p271). Management: Multidisciplinary team with geneticist, neuro logist, surgeon, and physiotherapist, orchestrated by a GP. Yearly cutaneous survey and measurement of BP. Dermal neurofi bromas are unsightly, and catch on clothing; if troublesome, excise, but removing all lesions is unrealistic. Genetic counselling is vital (OHCS p154). Type 2 neurofi bromatosis (NF2) Autosomal dominant inheritance, though 50% are de novo, with mosaicism in some (NF2 gene locus is 22q11). Rarer than NF1 with a prevalence of only 1 in 35 000. Signs: Café-au-lait spots are fewer than in NF1. Bilateral vestibular Schwannomas (= acoustic neuromas; p462) are characteristic, becoming symptomatic by ~20yrs old when sensorineural hearing loss is the 1st sign. There may be tinnitus and vertigo. The rate of tumour growth is unpredictable and variable. The tumours are benign but cause problems by pressing on local structures and by ICP. They may be absent in mosaic
