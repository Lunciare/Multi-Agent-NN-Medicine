VT) or if one or more branches of the bundles of His are blocked—bundle branch blocks —meaning depolarization is initiated in one ventricle but not the other, so it has to travel the long (in time and space) path from one ventricle to the other. Ventricular depolarization also takes longer if all conduction is slowed. This may happen in some electrolyte imbalances, eg hyperkalaemia. Right bundle branch block: (p102, fi g 3.8) QRS >0.12s, ‘RSR’ pattern in V1; dominant R in V1; inverted T waves in V1–V3 or V4; wide, slurred S wave in V6. Causes: normal variant (isolated RBBB), pulmonary embolism, cor pulmonale. Left bundle branch block: (p101, fi g 3.7) QRS >0.12s, ‘M’ pattern in V5, dominant S in V1, inverted T waves in I, aVL, V5–V6. Causes: IHD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, idi- opathic fi brosis. NB: if there is LBBB, no comment can be made on the ST segment or T wave. New LBBB may represent a STEMI, see p798. Bifascicular block: The combination of RBBB and left bundle hemiblock, manifest as an axis deviation, eg left axis deviation in the case of left anterior hemiblock. Trifascicular block: Bifascicular block plus 1st-degree HB. May need pacing (p132). Suspect
