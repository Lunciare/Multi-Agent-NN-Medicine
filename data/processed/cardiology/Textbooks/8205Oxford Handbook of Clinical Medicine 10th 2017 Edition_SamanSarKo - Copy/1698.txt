(‘run-off ’).  1 Risk factor modifi cation: Quit smoking (vital). Treat hypertension and high choles- terol. Prescribe an antiplatelet agent (unless contraindicated), to prevent progression and to reduce cardiovascular risk. Clopidogrel is recommended as 1st-line. 2 Management of claudication: •Supervised exercise programmes reduce symp- toms by improving collateral blood fl ow (2h per wk for 3 months). Encourage patients to excercise to the point of maximal pain. •Vasoactive drugs, eg naftidrofuryl oxa- late, off er modest benefi t and are recommended only in those who do not wish to undergo revascularization and if exercise fails to improve symptoms. If conservative measures have failed and PAD is severely aff ecting a patient’s life- style or becoming limb-threatening, intervention is required. • Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is used for disease limited to a sin- gle arterial segment (a balloon is infl ated in the narrowed segment). 5-year paten- cy is 79% (iliac) and 55% (femoral). Stents can be used to maintain artery patency. • Surgical reconstruction: If atheromatous disease is extensive but distal run-off is good (ie distal arteries fi lled by collateral vessels), consider arterial reconstruction with a bypass graft (fi g 13.54). Procedures include femoral–popliteal bypass, femo- ral–femoral crossover,
