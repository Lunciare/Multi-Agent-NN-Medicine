family, your seniors, and ICU early in making a decision. Oxygen therapy • The greatest danger is hypoxia, which probably accounts for more deaths than hypercapnia. Don’t leave patients severely hypoxic. • However, in some patients, who rely on their hypoxic drive to breathe, too much oxygen may lead to a reduced respiratory rate and hypercapnia, with a consequent fall in conscious level. Always prescribe O2 as if it were a drug. • Care is always required with O2, especially if there is evidence of CO2 retention. Start with 24–28% O2 in such patients.  Whenever you initiate or change oxygen therapy, do consider an ABG within 1h. • Monitor the patient carefully. Aim to raise the PaO2 above 8.0kPa with a rise in PaCO2 <1.5kPa. • In patients without evidence of retention at baseline use 28–40% O2, but still monitor and repeat ABG. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 881122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of acute COPD 813 Nebulized bronchodilators: Salbutamol 5mg/4h and ipratropium 500mcg/6h Investigate: CXR, ABG Controlled oxygen therapy if SaO2 <88% or PaO2 <7 kPa: Start at 24–28%, aim sats 88–92% Adjust according to ABG, aim PaO2 >8.0kPa with a rise in PaCO2 <1.5kPa Steroids: IV hydrocortisone 200mg and oral
