~2.5mg/12h. SE: nausea, depression, postural hypotension (mini- mize by giving at night). If pregnancy is planned, use barrier contraception until 2 periods have occurred. If subsequent pregnancy occurs, stop bromocriptine after the 1st missed period. An alternative dopamine agonist is cabergoline: more eff ec- tive and fewer SE, but there are fewer data on safety in pregnancy. NB: ergot alkaloids (bromocriptine and cabergoline) can cause fi brosis (eg echocardiograms are need- ed). Trans-sphenoidal surgery may be considered if intolerant of dopamine agonists. It has a high success rate, but there are risks of permanent hormone defi ciency and prolactinoma recurrence, and so it is usually reserved as a 2nd-line treatment. Macroprolactinomas: A tumour >10mm diameter on MRI. As they are near the optic chiasm, there may be acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, visual-fi eld loss, and op- tic atrophy. Treat initially with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine if fertility is the goal). Surgery is rarely needed , but consider if visual symptoms or pressure eff ects which fail to respond to medical treatment. Bromocriptine, and in some cases radia- tion therapy, may be required post-op as complete surgical resection is uncommon. If pregnant, monitor closely ideally in a combined endocrine/antenatal clinic as there
