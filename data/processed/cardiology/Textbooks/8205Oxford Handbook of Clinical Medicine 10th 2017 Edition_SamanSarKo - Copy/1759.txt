to gout. Sometimes the relationship of cause and eff ect is reversed so that it is the hyperuricaemia that causes the renal failure. This can occur following cytotoxic treatment (tumour lysis syndrome, p529), and in muscle necrosis. How urate causes renal failure: Urate is poorly soluble in water, so over-excretion can lead to crystal precipitation. Renal failure occurs most commonly because urate precipitates in the renal tubules. This may occur at plasma levels ≥1 . 19mmol/L. In some instances, ureteric obstruction from urate crystals may occur. This responds to retrograde ureteric catheterization and lavage. Prevention of renal failure: Before starting chemotherapy, ensure good hydration and initiate allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase), which prevent a sharp rise in urate following chemotherapy (see p528). There is a remote risk of inducing xanthine nephropathy. Treatment of hyperuricaemic acute kidney injury: Exclude bilateral ureteric ob- struction, then give prompt rehydration ± loop diuretic to wash uric acid crystals out of the renal tubules, and correct electrolyte abnormalities. Once oliguria is es- tablished, haemodialysis is required (in preference to peritoneal dialysis). There is no evidence for either preventing (see previous paragraph) or treating hyperuricaemic renal failure. Gout See p548. Urate renal
