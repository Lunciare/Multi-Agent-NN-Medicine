with structural defects, eg valve defects, congenital heart diseases, and some muscle disorders (eg hypertrophic cardiomyo- pathy (HCM)). Whilst clues to these can sometimes be found on history, examination, and ECG, it is imaging that gives the diagnosis. Imaging is also helpful for conditions that are not primarily due to deformities but which aff ect the way the heart func- tions. For example, after an MI the aff ected territory may be hypokinetic. Stress techniques allow us to observe the heart at rest and then under stress, comparing the perfusion and function in the two states. Cardiac MRI is a rapidly expanding area although not yet available in all major hospitals. Chest X-ray The humble chest X-ray provides just a snapshot of the heart and little detail but can be an important source of information and is often the only immedi- ately accessible imaging modality for a new or newly unwell patient. An enlarged heart (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5) suggests congestive heart failure; signs of pulmo- nary oedema suggest decompensated heart failure (see fi g 3.38); a globular heart may indicate pericardial eff usion (fi g 3.14); metal wires and valves will show up, evidencing previous cardiothoracic surgery; dextrocardia may explain
