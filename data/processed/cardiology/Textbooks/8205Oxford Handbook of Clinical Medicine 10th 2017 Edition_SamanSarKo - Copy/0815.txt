disorder. • Primary renal disease: Minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy (may be associated with underlying infl ammation/malignancy), focal segmental glo- merulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative GN. • Secondary causes: DM, lupus nephritis, myeloma, amyloid, pre-eclampsia. Pathophysiology The fi ltration barrier of the kidney is formed by podocytes, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and endothelial cells. Proteinuria results from podocyte pathology: abnormal function in minimal change disease, immune- mediated damage in membranous nephropathy, and podocyte injury/death in FSGS; or pathology in the GBM/endothelial cell: membranoproliferative GN. Presentation Generalized, pitting oedema, which can be rapid and severe. Look in dependent areas (ankles if mobile, sacral pad/elbows if bed-bound) and areas of low tissue resistance, eg periorbitally. History: Ask about systemic symptoms, eg joint, skin. Consider malignancy and chronic infection. : CCF (JVP, pulmonary oedema), liver disease (albumin). Management 1 Reduce oedema Fluid (1L/day) and salt restriction. Diuresis with loop diuretics, eg furosemide. If gut oedema aff ects oral absorption of diuretics, give IV. Use daily weights to guide. Aim 0.5–1kg weight loss per day to avoid intravascular volume depletion and secondary AKI. Thiazide diuretics can be added if oedema remains resistant to high-dose loop diuretics. Albumin infusion increases proteinuria and remains controversial with no
