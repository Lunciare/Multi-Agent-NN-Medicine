on the outer membrane of Gram- negative bacteria. Can elicit an infl ammatory response. Activates complement via the alternative pathway. Enterotoxin: Exotoxin that targets the gut, eg Clostridium diffi cile toxin (p411). Exotoxin: Toxins secreted by bacteria acting at a site distant from bacterial growth. Production of an exotoxin can determine virulence, eg botulinum, tetanus, diphtheria, shiga toxins. Flagella: A tail-like appendage that moves to propel the bacterium, eg Helico- bacter pylori. Nosocomial: Acquired in a hospital/healthcare setting (pp410–1). Obligate intracellular: Bacteria that can only survive in host cells  induce a cell- mediated immune response and will not grow on standard culture media. Ziehl–Neelsen stain: Mycolic acid in the cell wall of mycobacteria resists Gram staining but will appear red with acid-fast techniques (= acid-fast stain). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 338822 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Antibiotics: action and resistance 383 The antibiotic revolution began in 1928 when a extraordinary series of fortuitous events (including a cancelled holiday and an unpredictable British summer) led to Alexander Fleming’s observation that a contaminating Penicillium colony caused lysis of staphylococci. Mass production and the ‘golden age’ of antibiotics fol- lowed, with the introduction of a variety of drugs selectively toxic to bacterial, but not mammalian cells.
