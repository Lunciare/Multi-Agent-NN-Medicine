Signs Central obesity; plethoric, moon face; buff alo hump; supraclavicular fat distri- bution; skin & muscle atrophy; bruises; purple abdominal striae (fi g 5.20); osteoporo- sis; BP; glucose; infection-prone; poor healing. Signs of the cause (eg abdo mass). Tests Random plasma cortisols may mislead, as illness, time of day, and stress (eg vene puncture) infl uence results. Also, don’t rely on imaging to localize the cause: non- functioning ‘incidentalomas’ occur in ~5% on adrenal CT and ~10% on pituitary MRI. MRI detects only ~70% of pituitary tumours causing Cushing’s (many are too small). Treatment Depends on the cause. • Iatrogenic: Stop medications if possible. • Cushing’s disease: Selective removal of pituitary adenoma (trans -sphenoidally). Bilateral adrenalectomy if source unlocatable, or recurrence post-op (complica- tion: Nelson’s syndrome: skin pigmentation due to ACTH from an enlarging pituitary tumour, as adrenalectomy removes Ωve feedback; responds to pituitary radiation). • Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma: Adrenalectomy: ‘cures’ adenomas but rarely cures cancer. Radiotherapy & adrenolytic drugs (mitotane) follow if carcinoma. • Ectopic ACTH: Surgery if tumour is located and hasn’t spread. Metyrapone, ketocon-
