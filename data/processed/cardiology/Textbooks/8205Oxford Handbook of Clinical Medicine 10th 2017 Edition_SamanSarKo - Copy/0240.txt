What is the patient’s thyroid sta- tus? Inspect the neck; the normal thyroid is usually neither visible nor palpable. A midline swelling should raise your suspicion of thyroid pathology. Look for scars (eg collar incision from previous thyroid surgery). Examine the face for signs of hypothyroidism (puffi ness, pallor, dry fl aky skin, xanthelasma, corneal arcus, balding, loss of lateral third of eyebrow) as well as overall body habitus. Assess the patient’s demeanour; do they appear anxious, nervous, agitated, fi dgety (hy- perthyroid)? Or slow and lethargic (hypothyroid)? 2 Swallow test Only
