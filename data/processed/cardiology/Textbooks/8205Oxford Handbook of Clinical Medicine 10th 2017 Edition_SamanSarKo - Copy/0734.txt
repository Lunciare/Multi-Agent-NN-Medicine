test) medical knowledge may promote these antibody panels to a position as the fi nal arbiter of disease diagnosis which, with their varying sensitivities and spe- cifi cities, they are quite unfi t to assume. Indeed, often just such a work-up shows strange overlap conditions between apparently diff erent diseases: strange until we realize that these markers are just surrogates for processes that we lack a complete aetiological explanation for and in which the antibodies themselves may just be bystanders. Process that we lack the tools to visualize, as cells of the immune system continue their onslaught against their perceived enemies, driven by reasons that none present seem willing to reveal to our crude probing with blood tests, X-rays and biopsies. While the body knows no diseases, only pain and death, our minds attempt to impose a unitary disease on unsuspecting and sometimes innocent cells. For example, clinically we observe that autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) frequently overlaps with PSC and IBD. A battery of antibody tests may sometimes help understand the dominant process, but equally may mystify matters still further if we attempt to apply our inadequate classifi ers (‘But why is the ANCA not positive?’ cries the student, enraged at
