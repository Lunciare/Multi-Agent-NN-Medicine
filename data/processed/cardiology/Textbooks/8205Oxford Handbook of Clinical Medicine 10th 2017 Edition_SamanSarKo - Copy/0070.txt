no diff erence (ie new treatment has no benefi t). This is the null hypothesis. A p-value measures the strength of evidence in relation to the null hypothesis: • Low p-value: data unlikely if null hypothesis is true. • High p-value: data likely is null hypothesis is true. A p-value is not the probability that your results occurred by chance, and it can- not tell you how good a study is. There will be many assumptions in the statistical model. Look at the details: have confounding or bias aff ected the result? Do not consider p <0.05 as ‘statistically signifi cant’: a small p-value just fl ags the data as unusual.26 You need to question why and decide if this is clinically important. Confi dence intervals (CI) give a guide to the eff ect size and direction (eg benefi t/ harm). They give a margin of error that indicates the amount of uncertainty in the statistical estimate. Assessing validity The validity of a test which dichotomizes study participants can be assessed by examining the results from the test against a standard reference (or outcome: did the participant actually have the disease?) (see table 1.6). Sensitivity TP/(TP + FN) = of
