Total lung capacity (TLC) and re- sidual volume (RV) are useful in distinguishing obstructive and restrictive diseases (see fi g 4.4). TLC and RV are increased in obstructive airways disease and reduced in restrictive lung diseases and musculoskeletal abnormalities. The gas transfer coef- fi cient (KCO) represents the carbon monoxide diff using capacity (DLCO) corrected for alveolar volume. It is calculated by measuring carbon monoxide uptake from a single inspiration in a standard time (usually 10s) and lung volume by helium dilution. Low in emphysema and interstitial lung disease, high in alveolar haemorrhage. 1 Flow– volume loop (see fi g 4.5) measures fl ow at various lung volumes. Characteristic pat- terns are seen with intra-thoracic airways obstruction (asthma, emphysema) and extra-thoracic airways obstruction (tracheal stenosis). Radiology Chest x-ray: See p722. Ultrasound: Used in diagnosing and guiding drainage of pleural eff usions (particularly loculated eff usions) and empyema. Ra- dionuclide scans: Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q, p738) scans are occasionally used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), eg in pregnancy (unmatched perfusion defects are seen). Bone scans are used to diagnose
