tion in the non-sedated patient. Indications for pacing via the transcutaneous route are as p776, plus if transvenous pacing (or someone able to perform it) is unavailable or will be delayed in an emergency situation. • Give sedation and analgesia, eg midazolam + morphine IV titrated to eff ect. • Clipping chest hair may help improve electrical contact; don’t shave the skin, as nicks can predispose to electrical burns. Ensure the skin is dry. • Almost all modern transcutaneous devices can function through defi brillation ‘hands-free’ pads, and so these can be applied as for defi brillation (see p770). If necessary, the pads can be placed in an AP position: anteriorly over the V2–V3 electrode position and posteriorly at the same level, just below the scapula. • Select ‘demand’ mode, (which synchronizes the stimulus with the R wave, so avoiding pacing on the T wave—which can provoke VF or VT) and adjust the ECG gain so that QRS complexes can be seen. • Select an appropriate pacing rate: eg 60–90bpm in an adult. • Set the pacing current at the lowest setting and turn on the pacemaker. • Increase the pacing current until electrical capture occurs (normally from 50– 100mA),
