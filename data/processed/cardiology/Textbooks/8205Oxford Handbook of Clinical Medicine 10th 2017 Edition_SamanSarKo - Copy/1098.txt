Diagnosis: Clinical: erythema migrans with known exposure or evidence of infection. Borrelia culture (sensitivity: 40–70% for erythema migrans, <20% for CSF), PCR.4 Two- tier serology due to false-positive reaction with other spirochaete infection: enzyme immunoassay/immunofl uorescence + immunoblot. Sensitivity  due to slow serocon- version: IgM 1–2wks (and may persist), IgG 4–6wks and background positivity 3–15%. Treatment: Erythema migrans: doxycycline 100mg BD PO for 10–21d (CI <8y, pregnant). Alternatives: amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, azithromycin. Neuroborreliosis: cef- triaxone or IV benzylpenicillin or doxycycline for 10–30d. Arthritis/carditis: doxycyline or amoxicillin or ceftriaxone for 14–30d.15 Prevention: Keep limbs covered; use insect re- pellent (DEET); inspect skin and remove ticks (use tweezers, hold close to head/mouth).
