Reed–Sternberg cells (fi gs 8.58–8.60). Incidence Two peaks: young adults (HL is the commonest malignancy in 15–24yr olds) and elderly. : ≈ 2:1. Risk factors: An aff ected sibling; EBV (p405); SLE; post-transplantation . Symptoms Often presents with enlarged, non-tender, ‘rubbery’ superfi cial lymph nodes (60–70% cervical, fi g 8.61, also axillary or inguinal). Node size may fl uctuate, and they can become matted. 25% have constitutional upset, eg fever, weight loss, night sweats, pruritus, and lethargy. There may be alcohol-induced lymph node pain. Mediastinal lymph node involvement can cause mass eff ect, eg bronchial or SVC ob- struction (p528), or direct extension, eg causing pleural eff usions. Signs Lymphadenopathy. Also, cachexia, anaemia, spleno- or hepatomegaly. Tests Tissue diagnosis: Lymph node excision biopsy if possible. Image-guided nee- dle biopsy, laparotomy, or mediastinoscopy may be needed. Bloods: FBC, fi lm, ESR, LFT, LDH, urate, Ca2+. ESR or Hb indicate a worse prognosis. LDH  as it is released during cell turnover. Imaging: CXR, CT/PET of thorax, abdo, and pelvis. Staging (Ann Arbor system.) Infl uences treatment and prognosis. Done by imaging ± marrow biopsy if B symptoms, or stage III–IV disease. I Confi ned to single lymph node region. II Involvement
