weak- ness—often less severe—suggests a cervical cord lesion, see p508) a sensory level ± preceding back pain (see p542). Bladder (and anal) sphincter involvement is late and manifests as hesitancy, frequency, and, later, as painless retention. Signs: Look for a motor, refl ex, and sensory level, with normal fi ndings above the level of the lesion, LMN signs at the level (especially in cervical lesions), and UMN signs below the level (but remember tone and refl exes are usually reduced in acute cord compression; OHCS p756). Causes: Secondary malignancy (breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney) in the spine is commonest. Rarer: infection (epidural abscess), cervical disc prolapse, haematoma (warfarin), intrinsic cord tumour, atlanto–axial subluxation, myeloma.  : Transverse myelitis, MS, carcinomatous meningitis, cord vasculitis (PAN, syphilis), spinal artery thrombosis or aneurysm, trauma, Guillain–Barré syndrome (p702). In- vestigations: Do not delay imaging at any cost. Spinal x-rays are unreliable; MRI is the defi nitive modality. Biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to identify the nature of any mass. Do a CXR (primary lung malignancy, lung secondaries, TB). Bloods: FBC, ESR, B12, syphilis serology, U&E, LFT, PSA, serum electrophoresis. Treatment: Give urgent dexamethasone in malignancy (p528) while considering more specifi c thera-
