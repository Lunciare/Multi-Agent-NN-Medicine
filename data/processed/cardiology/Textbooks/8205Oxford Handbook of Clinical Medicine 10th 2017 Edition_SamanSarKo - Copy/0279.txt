The axis lies at 90° to the di- rection of the lead in which the isoelectric (equally +ve and Ωve) QRS complex is found. For example, if the QRS is isoelectric in lead II (+60°), the axis is either: +60° Ω 90° = Ω30°, or +60° + 90° = +150°. If the QRS is more positive than negative in lead I (0°) Fig 3.4 The planes represented by the limb ‘leads’. then the axis must be Ω30°, and vice versa. In practice, the exact axis matters little; what you need to be able to recognize is whether the axis is normal (Ω30° to +90°), left-deviated (<Ω30°), or right deviated (>+90°). There are many ways of doing this. If the QRS in lead I (0°) is predomi- nantly positive (the R wave is taller than the S wave is deep), the axis must be be- tween Ω90° and +90°. If lead II (+60°) is mostly positive, the axis must be between Ω30°
