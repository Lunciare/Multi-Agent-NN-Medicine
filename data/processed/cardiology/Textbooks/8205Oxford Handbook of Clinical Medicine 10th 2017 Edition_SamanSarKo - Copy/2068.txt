kg is ideal body weight. Do not give a loading dose to patients on maintenance methylxanthines (theophyllines/ aminophylline; see p811). Check plasma levels if given for >24h. ECG monitoring is required. †This may alone serve as a rescue therapy, be an intermittent step before ventilation, or be considered as a ‘ceiling of therapy’ for those deemed not suitable for mechanical ventilation.

Clinical features Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic (especially in fi t young people with small pneu- mothoraces) or sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Patients with asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically ventilated patients can suddenly develop hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures. Signs: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the aff ected side. With
