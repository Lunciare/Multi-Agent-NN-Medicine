paradoxus (pulse fades on inspiration). Echocardiography may be diagnostic. CXR: globular heart; left heart border convex or straight; right cardio- phrenic angle <90°. ECG: electrical alternans (p154). Management: This can be very diffi cult. Everything is against you: time, physiology, and your own confi dence, as the patient may be too ill to give a history, and signs may be equivocal—but bitter experience has taught us not to equivocate for long. Request the presence of your senior at the bedside (do not make do with telephone advice). With luck, prompt pericardiocentesis (p773) brings swift relief. While await- ing this, give O2, monitor ECG, and set up IVI. Take blood for group & save. NB: there may be a role for cardiothoracic surgery (eg CABG, ventricular repair, or pericardial window) as a defi nitive solution to some causes. 3 Eg Pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO) or lithium dilution cardiac output (LIDCO). Both use injection (PICCO = cold water, LIDCO = lithium) to estimate fi lling pressure, extravascular water (ie pulmonary oedema) and cardiac output. The time from injection via a central vein to detection via an arterial line, plus dilution, gives estimates of cardiac output and volume status and can guide
