nephrotoxic). Streak artefact Remember that the CT slice image is a matrix representation of the attenuation produced by rotating around the patient. High-attenuation items such as metal fi llings, clips, and prostheses (and even bone) can cause interference. CT combined with PET (See p739.) Combines the anatomical detail of CT with the metabolic information of PET, to aid assessment of, eg neoplastic lesions. Radiation doses are much higher than CT alone. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 773300 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 731 Fig 16.10 The Hounsfi eld scale. Courtesy of Dr T Turmezei.
