should be treated as if not diabetic (and do not need to be fi rst on the list). Check capillary blood glucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases blood glucose levels. Peri-operative morbidity and mortality Diabetes mellitus is classed as an inter- mediate risk factor for increased peri-operative cardiovascular risk by the American Heart Association, so screen for the presence of asymptomatic cardiac and renal disease (p567) and be aware of possible ‘silent’ myocardial ischaemia. Long-term post-op survival has been found to be poorer for patients with diabetes; however, peri-operative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were only increased in the presence of congestive heart failure and haemodialysis—ie not diabetes alone. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 558888 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS How to write up a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) 589 Variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) is more accurate a term than the previously used ‘sliding scale’. Prescribe 50 units of short-acting insulin in 50mL of 0.9% saline to infuse at the rate shown in table 13.7 (according to blood glucose levels). NB: this is a guide only—infusions may vary between institutions and no one infusion rate is suitable for all patients. Table 13.7 Guide to VRIII according to blood glucose levels
