compartment, ⅓ is intravascu- lar, ie blood (5L). Diff erent types of IV fl uid will equilibrate with the diff erent fl uid compartments depending on the osmotic content of the given fl uid. 5% glucose: (=Dextrose.) Isotonic, but contains only a small amount of glucose (50g/L) and so provides little energy (~10% daily energy per litre). The liver rapidly metabolizes all the glucose leaving only water, which rapidly equilibrates throughout all fl uid compartments. It is, therefore, useless for fl uid resuscitation (only 1/9 will remain in the intravascular space), but suitable for maintaining hydration. Excess 5% glucose IV may lead to water overload and hyponatraemia (p672). 0.9% saline: (‘Normal saline.’) Has about the same Na+ content as plasma (150mmol/L) and is isotonic with plasma. 0.9% saline will equilibrate rapidly throughout the extra- cellular compartment only, and takes longer to reach the intracellular compartment than 5% glucose. It is, therefore, appropriate for fl uid resuscitation, as it will remain predominantly in the extracellular space (and thus ⅓ of the given volume in the intravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic saline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only. Colloids: (eg Gelofusine®.) Have
