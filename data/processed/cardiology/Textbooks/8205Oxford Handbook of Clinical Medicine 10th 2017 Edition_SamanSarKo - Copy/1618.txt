Metabolic complications • Dumping syndrome: Fainting and sweating after eating due to food of high os- motic potential being dumped in the jejunum, causing oligaemia from rapid fl uid shifts. ‘Late dumping’ is due to rebound hypoglycaemia and occurs 1–3h after meals. Both tend to improve with time but may be helped by eating less sugar, and more guar gum and pectin (slows glucose absorption). Acarbose may also help to reduce the early hyperglycaemic stimulus to insulin secretion. • Weight loss: Often due to poor calorie intake. • Bacterial overgrowth ± malabsorption (blind loop syndrome) may occur. • Anaemia: Usually from lack of iron, hypochlorhydria, and stomach resection. B12 levels are frequently low but megaloblastic anaemia is rare. • Osteomalacia: There may be pseudofractures which look like metastases. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 662222 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 623 Oesophagus Stomach Bile duct Duodenum Bile Gastrojejunostomy (stomach joined to jejunum) Jejunum Fig 13.37 Billroth II.
