Graham Steell murmur if associated with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension). Cardiac surgery Cardiac surgery has come on a long way since 1923 when Dr Henry Souttar58,59 used his fi nger to open a stenosed mitral valve in a beating heart.6 Cardiac bypass allows prolonged access to the open, static heart, during which complex and high-precision repair and replacement of valves and aortic roots can occur. Transcatheter proce- dures are playing an increasing role in the management of cardiovascular disease. Key open heart procedures include: Valve replacements Mechanical valves may be of the ball-cage (Starr–Edwards), tilting disc (Bjork–Shiley), or double tilting disc (St Jude) type. These valves are very durable but the risk of thromboembolism is high; patients require lifelong anticoagu- lation. Xenografts are made from porcine valves or pericardium. These valves are less durable and may require replacement at 8–10yrs but have the advantage of not necessitating anticoagulation. Homografts are cadaveric valves. They are particu- larly useful in young patients and in the replacement of infected valves. Complica- tions of prosthetic valves: systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, haemolysis, structural valve failure, arrhythmias. CABG See p123.
