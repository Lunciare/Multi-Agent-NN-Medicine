may not be needed if a blood sample is al- ready in the lab, with group determined, without any atypical antibodies (ie G&S). Products2 Whole blood: The only option for the fi rst 250 years of transfusion history, but now rarely used. Red cells: (Packed to make haematocrit ~70%.) Use to correct anaemia or blood loss. 1U Hb by 10–15g/L. In anaemia, transfuse until Hb ~80g/L. Platelets: (p364.) Usually only needed if bleeding or count is <20 ≈ 109/L. 1U should platelet count by >20 ≈ 109/L. Failure to do so suggests refractory cause: discuss with haematologist. If surgery is planned, get advice if count is <100 ≈ 109/L. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Use to correct clotting defects: eg DIC (p352); warfarin overdosage where vitamin K would be too slow; liver disease; thrombotic thrombo- cytopenic purpura (p315). It is expensive and carries all the risks of blood transfu- sion. Do not use as a simple volume expander. Human albumin solution is produced as 4.5% or 20% protein solution and is used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be used temporarily in the hypoproteina emic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who is fl uid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load.
