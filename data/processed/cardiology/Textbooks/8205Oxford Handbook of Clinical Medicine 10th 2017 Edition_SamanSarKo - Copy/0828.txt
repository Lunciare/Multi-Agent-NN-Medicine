Table 7.8 Summary table of tubular disorders and diuretic action (RTA = renal tubular acidosis) Nephron segment Solute movement Tubular pathlogy Diuretic Proximal tubule Reabsorption: Na+, Fanconi syndrome Mannitol HCO3-, phosphate, Proximal (type Carbonic anhydrase sugars, amino acids 2) RTA inhibitor Thick ascending loop Reabsorption: Na+, Bartter syndromes Loop K+, ClΩ Distal tubule Reabsorption: Gitelman syndrome Thiazide Na+, ClΩ Cortical collecting Excretion: K+, H+ Distal (type 1) RTA K+-sparing duct Type 4 RTA Collecting duct Excretion: water Diabetes insipidus V2 antagonists (p240) (‘vaptan’) (p320) Proximal tubule Physiology Reabsorbs Na+ (~70%), bicarbonate, phosphate, amino acids, sugars, uric acid. Pathology Fanconi syndrome: Generalized impairment of proximal tubular function lead- ing to glycosuria (in a non-diabetic), phosphaturia, uricosuria, aminoaciduria, and tubular-proteinuria (negative dipstick but positive urine P:CR p294). Phosphaturia leads to phosphate loss from bone, demineralization, and growth impairment. Treatment: replace phosphate. Proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Failure of bicarbonate reabsorption. Distal reabsorption intact so serum bicarbo- nate usually ≥ 12mmol/L. Accompanied by Fanconi syndrome unless rare familial cause. Aetiology: light chain disease, drugs (eg tenofovir), heavy metals. Diagnosis: IV bicarbonate increases bicarbonate loss in urine and causes rapid rise in urine pH to ~7.5. Treatment: bicarbonate and potassium replacement. Diuretics
