They can also cause infectious disease. This produces a diagnostic challenge: are the detected organisms causing infection or a contaminating commensal? The answer may lie in the pres- ence or absence of coagulase, an enzyme which coagulates plasma. Coagulase-negative staphylococci: eg Staphylococcus epidermidis are less viru- lent. Pathogenicity is likely only if there is underlying immune system dysfunction or foreign material (prosthetic valve/joint, IV line, PD catheter, pacemaker). Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase positive. Presentation: 1 Toxin release causes disease distant from infection. Includes: • scalded skin syndrome—bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins (no mucosal disease, skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis) • preformed toxin in food—sudden D&V (p428) •
