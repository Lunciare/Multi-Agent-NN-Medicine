exposure to ionizing radiation The very nature of ionizing radiation that gives us vision into the human body also gives it lethal properties. In considering the decision to expose patients to radia- tion, the clinical benefi ts should outweigh the risks of genetic mutation and cancer induction. These risks can be hard to quantify (and estimates vary wildly—extrapo- lation of eff ects from doses associated with nuclear explosions are likely unreli- able) but even with strict guidelines we still have a tendency to over-exposure in medical practice. Perhaps the best advice is to be certain of the importance of every dose of radiation that you sanction, and mindful of the comparative doses involved (see table 16.1). The responsibility lies with us not to rely too heavily on radiology. Don’t request examinations to comfort patients (or appease their consultants), to replace im- ages already acquired elsewhere (or lost) simply to avoid medico-legal issues, or when the result will not aff ect management. To give an idea of relative doses, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis gives a typical eff ective dose of 500 times as much radiation as a CXR. This important factor also tells us about the preference of
