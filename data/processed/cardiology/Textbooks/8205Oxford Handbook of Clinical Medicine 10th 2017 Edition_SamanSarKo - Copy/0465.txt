33–50% predicted. Life-threatening attack: Silent chest; confusion; exhaustion; cyanosis (PaO2 <8kPa but PaCO2 4.6–6.0, SpO2 <92%); bradyc ardia; PEF <33% predicted. Near fatal: PaCO2. Tests Initial diagnosis: See fi gs 4.10, 4.11. Acute attack: PEF, sputum culture, FBC, U&E, CRP, blood cultures. ABG analysis usually shows a normal or slightly PaO2 but PaCO2 (hyperventilation). If PaO2 is normal but the patient is hyperventilating, watch carefully and repeat the ABG a little later. If PaCO2 is normal or raised, transfer to high-dependency unit or ITU for ventilation, as this signifi es failing respiratory eff ort. CXR (to exclude infection or pneumothorax). Chronic asthma: PEF monitoring (p162): a diurnal variation of >20% on ≥3d a wk for 2wks. Spirometry: obstructive defect (FEV1/FVC, RV p162); usually ≥15% improvement in FEV1 following 2 agonists or steroid trial. CXR: hyperinfl ation. Skin-prick tests may help to identify allergens. Histamine or methacholine challenge. Aspergillus serology. Diff erential diagnosis Pulmonary oedema (‘cardiac asthma’); COPD (may co-exist); large airway obstruction (eg foreign body, tumour); SVC obstruction (wheeze/dys- pnoea not episodic); pneumothorax; PE; bronchiectasis; obliterative bronchiolitis (suspect in elderly). Treatment Chronic asthma (p182). Emergency treatment (p810). Associated diseases Acid refl ux; polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, p556); Churg–Strauss syndrome (p696); ABPA
