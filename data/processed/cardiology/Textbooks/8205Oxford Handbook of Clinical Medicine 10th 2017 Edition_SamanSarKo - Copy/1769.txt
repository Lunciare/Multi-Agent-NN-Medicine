Ca2+, initially weekly, and if nausea/vomiting. Vitamin D-resistant rickets Exists in two forms. Type I has low renal 1-hydroxy- lase activity, and type II has end-organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, due to a point mutation in the receptor. Both are treated with large doses of calcitriol. X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets Dominantly inherited—due to a defect in renal phosphate handling (due to mutations in the PEX or PHEX genes which encode an endopeptidase). Rickets develops in early childhood and is associated with poor growth. Plasma PO43Ω is low, ALP is high, and there is phosphaturia. Treatm ent is with high doses of oral phosphate, and calcitriol. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668844 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Metabolic bone diseases: Paget’s disease of bone 685 Also called osteitis deformans, there is increased bone turnover associated with increased numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts with resultant remodelling, bone enlargement, deformity, and weakness. Rare in the under-40s. Incidence rises with age (3% over 55yrs old). Commoner in temperate climates, and in Anglo-Saxons. Clinical features Asymptomatic in ~70%. Deep, boring pain, and bony deformity and enlargement—typically of the pelvis, lumbar spine, skull, femur, and tibia (clas- sically a bowed sabre tibia; fi g 14.11).
