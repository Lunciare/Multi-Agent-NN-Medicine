wash with soap, Test immediately. • Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO. • Severe (WCC >15≈109/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5oC): vancomycin PO (injection preparation can be given orally and is cheaper than capsules) or fidax- omicin (cost). • Non-responders: high-dose vancomycin+IV metronidazole, fidaxomicin, IV immu- noglubulin (no RCT data). • Recurrence: (weaning) vancomycin, fi daxomicin, faecal transplantation. Management of healthcare-associated infection Identify: Screening (eg hospital admissions for MRSA) allows isolation and decoloni- zation before harm. Be alert to new infections. Protect: Isolate multi-antibiotic-resistant microbes (eg MRSA), highly transmissi- ble infections (eg norovirus), and high-risk groups including reverse barrier nurs- ing (avoids transmission to, rather than from, patients, eg neutropenia). Patients with high-risk infections may need negative-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially infected air leaving the room), or in severe immunosuppression, positive-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially infected air entering the room). When many patients have the same nosocomial infection (eg norovirus) they may be barrier nursed to- gether in dedicated bays. Treat: Refer to local guidelines, seek expert help. Initial antibiotic choice may diff er for healthcare-associated infection. Prevent: Modify risk factors, eg nutrition, post-operative incentive spirometry to reduce pneumonia risk. Use/convert to narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever pos- sible. Remove catheters, intravascular access
