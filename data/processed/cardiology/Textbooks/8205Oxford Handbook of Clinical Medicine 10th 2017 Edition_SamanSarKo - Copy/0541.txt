important to minimize risk of infection and balance catabolic response to surgery. Type 1 diabetics should ideally be fi rst on the list and BMS should have been stabilized 1–2 days pre major surgery. Consult local policy for how to manage insulin-treated/ non-insulin-treated patients on morning of surgery (eg setting up glucose/insulin infusion). Acute illness: Diabetics are prone to hyperglycaemia during periods of illness, in spite of reduced oral intake. Avoid stopping insulin in periods of acute illness. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221133 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 214 Hypoglycaemia Hypoglycaemia Commonest endocrine emergency—see p834. Prompt diagnosis and treatment essential—brain damage & death can occur if severe or prolonged. Defi nition Plasma glucose 3mmol/L. Threshold for symptoms varies. See BOX. Symptoms Autonomic: Sweating, anxiety, hunger, tremor, palpitations, dizziness. Neuroglycopenic: Confusion, drowsiness, visual trouble, seizures, coma. Rarely fo- cal symptoms, eg transient hemiplegia. Mutism, personality change, restlessness, and incoherence may lead to misdiagnosis of alcohol intoxication or even psychosis. Fasting hypoglycaemia Causes: The chief cause is insulin or sulfonylurea treatment in a diabetic, eg activity, missed meal, accidental or non-accidental overdose (check for ciculating oral hypoglycaemics). In non-diabetics you must EXPLAIN mechanism: Exogenous drugs, eg insulin, oral hypoglycaemics (p208)? access through diabetic in the family? Body-builders
