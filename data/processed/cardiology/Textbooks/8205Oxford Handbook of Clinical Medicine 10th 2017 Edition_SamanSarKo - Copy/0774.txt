is a syndrome of decreased renal function, measured by serum creatinine or urine output, occurring over hours–days. It includes diff erent aetiologies and may be multifactorial. Diff erent defi nitions of AKI exist. In 2012, there was an attempt to amalgamate diff erent diagnostic criteria into a single defi nition and staging system. The Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines2 defi ne AKI as: • rise in creatinine >26μmol/L within 48h. • rise in creatinine >1.5 ≈ baseline (ie before the AKI) within 7 days. • urine output <0.5mL/kg/h for >6 consecutive hours. The severity of AKI is then staged according to the highest creatinine rise or longest period/severity of oliguria (table 7.3). Table 7.3 KDIGO staging system for AKI Stage Serum creatinine Urine output 1 >26.5μmol/L (0.3mg/dL) or <0.5mL/kg/h for 6–12h 1.5–1.9 ≈ baseline 2 2.0–2.9 ≈ baseline <0.5mL/kg/h for >12h 3 >353.6μmol/L (4.0mg/dL) or <0.3mL/kg/h for >24h or >3.0 ≈ baseline or anuria for >12h renal replacement therapy Although there are limitations to the use of serum creatinine, including the eff ects of muscle mass and dilution, no other biomarker has been able to supersede it (yet). The clinical approach to AKI is shown in fi g
