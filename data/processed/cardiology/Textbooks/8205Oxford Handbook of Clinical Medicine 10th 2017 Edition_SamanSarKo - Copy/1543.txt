Minimally invasive surgery is also used for thyroidectomy and par- athyroidectomy. As a rule of thumb, whatever can be done by laparotomy can also be done with the laparoscope. This does not mean that it should be done, but if the surgeon is adequately trained, and the patient feels better sooner, has less post-operative pain, can return to work earlier, and has fewer complications, then there are obvious advantages. Pre-procedure counselling should always discuss the complications of laparoscopic surgery (eg accidental damage to other intra-abdominal organs) as well as the risk of conversion to an open procedure. Challenges of minimal access surgery The 2-dimensional visual representation and diff erent surgical approach alters the normal appearance of familiar anatomy. Palpation is impossible and it may be harder to locate lesions prior to resection. As a result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be learned and taught. Day-case surgery Advances in surgical techniques as well
