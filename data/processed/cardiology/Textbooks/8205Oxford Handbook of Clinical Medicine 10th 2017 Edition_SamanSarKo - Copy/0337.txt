focal atrial tachycardia but there are multiple groups of atrial cells taking it in turns to initiate a cardiac cycle. P-wave morphol- ogy and P-P intervals vary. Usually associated with COPD. Principles of management See p807. If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion (p770). • Identify and treat the underlying rhythm: eg treating sinus tachycardia secondary to dehydration with IV fl uids; treating multifocal sinus tachycardia secondary to COPD by correcting hypoxia and hypercapnia; treating focal atrial tachycardia sec- ondary to digoxin toxicity with digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments; treating AVRT secondary to WPW with fl ecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone; for atrial fi brilla- tion (AF) and fl utter see p130. • If AVNRT or AVRT are suspected, consider transiently blocking the AVN. This should break the circuit of an atrio-ventricular re-entry rhythm, allowing sinus rhythm to re-establish. If the underlying rhythm is actually atrial in origin (eg fl utter or atrial tachycardia), AVN blockade will not treat the rhythm but the paused ventricular activity will unmask the atrial rhythm (fi g 3.28), aiding diagnosis and management. AVN blockade can be achieved by: 1 Vagal manoeuvres: carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre (eg blowing into a syringe). 2 IV adenosine: see
