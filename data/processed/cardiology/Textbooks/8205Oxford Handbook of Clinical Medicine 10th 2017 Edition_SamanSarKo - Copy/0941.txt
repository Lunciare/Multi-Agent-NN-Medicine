characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy; fi gs 8.64, 8.65), lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL), diff use large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment Huge range of options, depending on disease subtype. Low grade: If symptomless, none may be needed. Radiotherapy may be curative in localized disease. Chlorambucil is used in diff use disease. Remission may be maintained by using interferon alfa or rituximab (see later in paragraph). Bendamustine is eff ec- tive both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients. High grade: (eg large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), ‘R-CHOP’ regimen: Rituximab, Cy- clophosphamide, Hydroxy daunorubicin, vincristine (Oncovin®) and Prednisolone. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) help neutropenia—eg fi lgrastim or lenograstim (at low doses it may be cost-eff ective). Survival Histology is important. Prognosis is worse if, at presentation: • Age >60yrs. • Systemic symptoms. • Bulky disease (abdominal mass >10cm). • LDH. • Dissem- inated disease. Typical 5yr survival for treated patients: ~30% for high-grade and >50% for low-grade lymphomas, but the picture is very variable. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336622 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 363 (a) (b) Fig 8.62 Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, which has caused severe eryt hroderma (Sézary syn- drome) in a Caucasian woman.
