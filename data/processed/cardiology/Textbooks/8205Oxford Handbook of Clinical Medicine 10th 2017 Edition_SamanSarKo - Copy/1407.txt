The most important investigation in any monoarthritic pres- entation (table 12.2, see also OHCS p706). Send synovial fl uid for urgent white cell count, Gram stain, polarized light microscopy (for crystals, p548), and culture. The risk of inducing septic arthritis, using sterile precautions, is <1:10 000. 2 Look for blood,3 pus, and crystals (gout or CPPD crystal arthropathy; p548). Do not at- tempt joint aspiration through infl amed and potentially infected skin (eg through a psoriatic plaque or overlying cellulitis).

Blood tests: FBC, ESR, urate, U&E, CRP. Blood culture for septic arthritis. Consider rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ANA, other auto antibodies (p553), and HLA B27 (p551) —as guided by presentation. Consider causes of reactive arthritis (p551), eg viral serology, urine chlamydia PCR, hepatitis and HIV serology if risk factors are present. Radiology: Look for erosions, calcifi cation,
