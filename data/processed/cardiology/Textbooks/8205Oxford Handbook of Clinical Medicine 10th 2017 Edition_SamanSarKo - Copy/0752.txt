and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to better-absorbed Fe2+. Absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, though very small amounts are ab- sorbed in the stomach and ileum. Iron requirements are greater for women (men- strual loss), when growing, in pregnancy, and in chronic infection. Hepcidin, a peptide synthesized in hepatocytes, secreted in plasma, is a negative regulator of gut iron absorption and haeme iron recycling by macrophages. Hepcidin synthesis is stimulated by iron and repressed by iron defi ciency and by  marrow erythropoiesis (eg in anaemia, bleeding, haemolysis, dyserythropoiesis, or erythropoietin injections). Defects in the normal triggering of hepcidin by iron excess is a rare cause of haemochromatosis unrelated to HFE mutations, whereas a defect in hepcidin repression is responsible for an iron refractory iron defi ciency anaemia. In HH, the total body iron is up to 10-fold that of a normal person, with load- ing found particularly in the liver and pancreas (≈100). Hepatic disease classically starts with fi brosis, progressing to cirrhosis as a late feature.
