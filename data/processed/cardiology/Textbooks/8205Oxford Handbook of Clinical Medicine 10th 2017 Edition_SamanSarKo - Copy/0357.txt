associated with LQTS include Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (p702) and Romano–Ward syndrome (p710). ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.) RV myocardium is re- placed with fi bro-fatty material. Symptoms: palpitations and syncope during ex- ercise. ECG changes include epsilon wave; T inversion and broad QRS in V1–V3. Brugada Sodium channelopathy. Diagnosis: classic coved ST elevation in V1–V3 plus suggestive clinical history. ECG changes and arrhythmias can be precipitated by fever, medications (www.brugadadrugs.org), electrolyte imbalances, and ischaemia. Many of these patients can be treated medically or conservatively but those at high risk may require an implantable cardiac defi brillator (ICD). Screening family members is important for picking up undiagnosed cases. Fig 3.37 This patient has Wolff -Parkinson-White syndrome as they have delta waves (slurred QRS upstrokes) in beats 1 and 4 of this rhythm strip. The delta wave both broadens the ventricular complex and shortens the PR interval. If a patient with WPW has AF, avoid AV node blockers such as diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin—but fl ecainide may be used. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113333 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 134 Heart failure—basic concepts Defi nition Cardiac output is inadequate for the body’s requirements.33 Prevalence 1–3% of the general population; ~10% among elderly patients. 34 Key
