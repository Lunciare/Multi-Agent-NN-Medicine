If in the 1950s, Gajdusek and Zigas had not been intrigued as to why kuru aff ected women and children more than men (their strange neural diet was the culprit), the discovery of vCJD would have been delayed, as no surveillance would have been in place. Neural tissue might still be in our food chain, with dreadful consequences. But further than this, the notion of ‘protein-misfolding diseases’2 would have been delayed by decades. So this is the lesson: let curiosity fl ourish. This is Liberski’s imperative.27 So now let’s scan our horizon for other intriguing clouds. 1 Der Vogel kämpft sich aus dem Ei. Das Ei ist die Welt.
