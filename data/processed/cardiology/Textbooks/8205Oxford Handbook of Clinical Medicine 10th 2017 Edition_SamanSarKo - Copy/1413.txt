Signs and symptoms Localized disease (often knee or hip): Pain and crepitus on movement, with background ache at rest. Worse with prolonged activity. Joints may ‘gel’ (brief stiff ness after rest, usually 10–15 minutes or so). Joints may feel unstable, with a perceived lack of power due to pain. Generalized disease: ‘Nodal OA’ (typi- cally DIP, PIP, CMC joints, and knees in post-menopausal females). There may be joint tenderness, derangement and bony swelling (Heberden’s at DIP and Bouchard’s at PIP), reduced range of movement and mild synovitis.
