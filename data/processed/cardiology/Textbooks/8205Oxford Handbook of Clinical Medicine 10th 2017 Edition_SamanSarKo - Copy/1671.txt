are decided by analysing histology from two separate areas of tumour specimen, and adding them to get the total Gleason score for the tumour, from 2 to 10. Scores 8–10 suggest an aggressive tumour; 5–7: intermediate; 2–4: indolent. Benign diseases of the penis Balanitis Acute infl ammation of the foreskin and glans. Associated with strep and staph infections. More common in diabetics. Often seen in young children with tight foreskins : Antibiotics, circumcision, hygiene advice. Phimosis The foreskin occludes the meatus. In young boys this causes recurrent balanitis and ballooning, but time (+ trials of gentle retraction) may obviate the need for circumcision. In adulthood presents with painful intercourse, infection, ulceration, and is associated with balanitis xerotica obliterans. Paraphimosis Occurs when a tight foreskin is retracted and becomes irreplace- able, preventing venous return leading to oedema and even ischaemia of the glans. Can occur if the foreskin is not replaced after catheterization. : Ask patient to squeeze glans. Try applying a 50% glucose-soaked swab (oedema may follow osmotic gradient). Ice packs and lidocaine gel may also help. May require aspira- tion/dorsal slit/circumcision. Prostatitis May be acute or chronic. Usually those >35yrs. Acute prostatitis is caused mostly by S. faecalis and
