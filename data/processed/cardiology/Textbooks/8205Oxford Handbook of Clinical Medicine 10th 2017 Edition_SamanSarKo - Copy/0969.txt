FBC, fi lm, clotting (PT, thrombin time, APTT, fi brinogen) ± APC resistance test, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and assays for antithrombin and proteins C & S defi ciency (± DNA analysis by PCR for the factor V Leiden mutation if APC resistance test is +ve, and for prothrombin gene mutation). These tests should ideally be done when the patient is well, not pregnant, and off anticoagulation for 1 month. Who? Test those with: • arterial thrombosis or MI at <50yrs old (eg for APL) • unprovoked VTE (ie at <40yrs with no risk factors) • VTE with oral contraceptives/ pregnancy • unexplained recurrent VTE • unusual site, eg mesenteric or portal vein thrombosis • recurrent fetal loss (≥3) • neonatal thrombosis. Who not? Those already on lifelong anticoagulation, 1st-degree relatives of peo- ple with a history of DVT/PE or thrombophilia except in special circumstances. There is often no benefi t to testing (ie no change to management), it is expensive and may cause signifi cant worry to patients: be sparing in requesting these tests. Treatment Anticoagulate acute thrombosis (p350). If recurrence occurs with no other risk factors, consider lifelong anticoagulation. Recurrence whilst on treat- ment should be treated
