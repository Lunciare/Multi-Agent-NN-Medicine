Primary prevention mentioned above): there is a considerable advantage from lowering blood pressure and cholesterol (even if not particularly raised). Antiplatelet agents after stroke: (See BOX ‘Antiplatelets’.) If no primary haemorrhage on CT, give 2 weeks of aspirin 300mg, then switch to long-term clopidogrel monother- apy. If this is CI or not tolerated then give low dose aspirin plus slow-release dipyrida- mole. Anticoagulation after stroke from AF: See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’. Tests (See p470 for imaging.) Investigate promptly to identify risk factors for fur- ther strokes, but consider whether results will aff ect management. Look for: • Hypertension. Look for retinopathy (p560), nephropathy, or cardiomegaly on CXR. • Cardiac source of emboli. (See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’.) 24h ECG to look for AF (p130). CXR may show an enlarged left atrium. Echocardiogram may reveal mural thrombus due to AF or a hypokinetic segment of cardiac muscle post-MI. It may also show valvular lesions in infective endocarditis or rheumatic heart disease. Transo esophageal echo is more sensitive than transthoracic. • Carotid artery stenosis. Do carotid Doppler US ± CT/MRI angiography. Benefi ts and risks of revascularization should be individualized by an expert but generally most with ≥ 70%
