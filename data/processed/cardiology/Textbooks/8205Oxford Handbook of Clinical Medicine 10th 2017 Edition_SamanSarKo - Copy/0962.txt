Caveats •ESR  with age. The Westergren method is a rough guide to calculate the upper limit of normal in older patients: : ESR=age ÷ 2; : ESR=(age + 10) ÷ 2. •Some conditions lower the ESR, eg poly- cythaemia (due to red cell concentration), microcytosis, and sickle-cell anaemia. Even a slightly raised ESR in these patients should prompt one to ask: ‘What else is the mat- Fig 8.76 Hyperviscosity syndrome. ter?’ Management •In those with a slightly raised ESR, the best plan is probably to wait a month and repeat the test. •If the ESR is markedly raised (>100mm/h), this can have a 90% predictive value for disease, so such patients should be thoroughly in- vestigated, even in the presence of non-specifi c symptoms. Take a full history, ex- amine carefully and consider these tests: FBC, plasma electrophoresis, U&E, PSA, chest and abdominal imaging, ± biopsy of bone marrow or temporal artery. Plasma viscosity (PV) Normal range: 1.50–1.72mPa/s. In many labs, this has replaced the ESR, as it is less aff ected by anaemia and simpler to automate. PV is aff ected by the concentration of large plasma proteins and  in the same conditions as the ESR—both PV
