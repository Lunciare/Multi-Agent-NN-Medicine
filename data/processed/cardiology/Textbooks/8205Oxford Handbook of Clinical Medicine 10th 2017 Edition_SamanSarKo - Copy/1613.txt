(~35%), mesenteric vein thrombosis (~5%; younger patients with hypercoagulable states—tends to aff ect smaller lengths of bowel), or non-occlusive disease (~20%; occurs in low-fl ow states and usually refl ects poor cardiac output, though there may be other factors such as recent cardiac surgery or renal failure). Other causes include trauma, vasculitis (p556), radiotherapy, or strangulation (volvulus or hernia, p612). Presentation is a classical clinical triad: acute severe abdominal pain; no/minimal abdominal signs; rapid hypovolaemiashock. Pain tends to be constant, central, or around the RIF. The degree of illness is often far out of proportion with clinical signs. Tests: There may be Hb (due to plasma loss), WCC, modestly raised plasma am- ylase, and a persistent metabolic acidosis (high lactate). Early on, the abdominal x-ray shows a ‘gasless’ abdomen. CT/MR may show evidence of ischaemia with CT/MR angiography or formal arteriography if doubt remains. Often the diganosis is made on fi nding a nasty, necrotic bowel at laparotomy. Treatment: The main life-threatening complications secondary to acute mesenteric ischaemia are 1 septic peritonitis and 2 progression of a systemic infl ammatory re- sponse syndrome (SIRS) to multi-organ failure, mediated by bacterial translocation across the dying gut wall.
