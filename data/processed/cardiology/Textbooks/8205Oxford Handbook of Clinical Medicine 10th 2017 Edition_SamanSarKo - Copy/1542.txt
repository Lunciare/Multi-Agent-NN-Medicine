>5mg/d of prednisolone (or equivalent) for more than 2 weeks or any patient who has had their long-term steroid reduced in the last 2–4 weeks. There is also potential for HPA suppression in patients taking long-term, high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids. A guide to supplementation follows. Patients should take their normal morning steroid dose. • Minor procedures under local anaesthetic: No supplementation required. • Moderate procedures: (Eg joint replacement.) Give 50mg hydrocortisone before induction and 25mg every 8h for 24h. Resume normal dose thereafter. • Major surgery: Give 100mg hydrocortisone before induction and 50mg every 8h for 24h. After 24h, halve this dose each day until the level of maintenance. Patients with primary adrenal insuffi ciency will need extra cover—discuss with an endocrinologist. The major risk with adrenal insuffi ciency is hypotension, so if this is encountered without an obvious cause, consider a stat dose of hydrocortisone. See p836 for treatment of Addisonian crisis and BNF section 6.3 for steroid dose equivalents. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 559900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 591 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 559911 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 592 Minimally invasive and day case surgery Laparoscopy was developed within gynaecology and is now in widespread use for diagnostic purposes and surgical procedures such as appendicectomy,
