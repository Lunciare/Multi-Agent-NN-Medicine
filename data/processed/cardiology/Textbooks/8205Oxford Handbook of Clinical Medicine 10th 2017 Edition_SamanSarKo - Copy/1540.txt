(check local policy). Renal failure Risk post-op due to intestinal absorption of endotoxin (normally lim- ited by the detergent eff ect of bile). This causes renal vasoconstriction and acute tubular necrosis (see p298). The use of lactulose or bile salts pre-op may help. Ensure adequate IV fl uids pre- and post-operatively to maintain good urine output. Monitor urine output every 2h. Consider central line, inotropes, and furosemide if output poor despite adequate hydration. Measure and correct U&E daily. Surgery in those on anticoagulants Inform the surgeon and anaesthetist. Risks and benefi ts must be individualized. Warfarin Minor surgery can be undertaken without stopping (if INR <3.5 it may be safe to proceed). In major surgery, stop for 3–5d pre-op. Vitamin K ± FFP or Beriplex® may be needed for emergency reversal of INR. One elective option is conversion to heparin (stop 6h prior to surgery, and monitor APTT perioperatively). When re-war- farinizing, give LMWH until INR is therapeutic, as warfarin is initially prothrombotic. DOACS Decision to stop will be based upon the patient’s risk of having a thromboem- bolic event and bleeding risk associated with the procedure.4 Where procedure has no clinically important bleeding risk it can be performed just
