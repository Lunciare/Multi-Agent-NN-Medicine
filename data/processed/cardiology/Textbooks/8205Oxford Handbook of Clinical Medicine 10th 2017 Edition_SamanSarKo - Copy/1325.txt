Both B and T cells are implicated. Presentation Slowly increasing or relapsing muscular fatigue. Muscle groups af- fected, in order: extra ocular; bulbar (swallowing, chewi ng); face; neck; limb girdle; trunk. Signs: Ptosis, diplopia, myasthenic snarl on smiling, ‘peek sign’ of orbicularis fatigability (eyelids begin to separate after manual opposition to sustained closure). On counting to 50, the voice fades (dysphonia is a rare presentation). Tendon refl exes are normal. Symptoms exacerbated by: Pregnancy, K+, infection, over-treatment, change of climate, emotion, exercise, gentamicin, opiates, tetracycline, quinine, -blockers. Diff erentials Polymyositis/other myopathies (p510); SLE; Takayasu’s arteritis (fati- gability of the extremities); botulism
