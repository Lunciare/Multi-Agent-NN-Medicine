~70%). Unlike UC, there is unaff ected bowel between areas of active disease (skip lesions). Cause As with UC an inappropriate immune response against the (?abnor- mal) gut fl ora in a genetically susceptible individual.19 Prevalence 100–200/100 000. Incidence 10–20/100 000/yr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. Associations Smoking risk ≈3–4; NSAIDS may exacerbate disease. Symptoms Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss/failure to thrive. Systemic symptoms: fatigue, fever, malaise, anorexia. Signs Bowel ulceration (fi g 6.22); abdominal tenderness/mass; perianal abscess/ fi stulae/skin tags; anal strictures. Beyond the gut: (fi g 6.21) Clubbing, skin, joint, & eye problems. Complications Small bowel obstruction; toxic dilatation (colonic diameter >6cm, toxic dilatation is rarer than in UC); abscess formation (abdominal, pelvic, or peri- anal); fi stulae (present in ~10%), eg entero-enteric, colovesical (bladder), colovagi- nal, perianal, enterocutaneous; perforation; colon cancer; PSC (p282), malnutrition. Tests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, INR, ferritin, TIBC, B12, folate. Stool: MC&S and CDT (p258) to exclude eg C. diffi cile, Campylobacter, E. coli; faecal calprotectin is a sim- ple, non-invasive test for GI infl ammation with high sensitivity. Colonoscopy + bi- opsy: Even if mucosa looks normal. Small bowel: To detect isolated proximal disease by eg capsule endoscopy (p248, use dummy patency
