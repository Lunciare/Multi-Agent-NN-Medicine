may develop if dissection moves proximally. Type A (70%) dissections involve the ascending aorta, irrespective of site of the tear, while if the ascending aorta is not involved it is called type B (30%). All patients with type A thoracic dissection should be considered for surgery: get urgent cardio- thoracic advice. Defi nitive treatment for type B is less clear and may be managed medically, with surgery reserved for distal dissections that are leaking, ruptured, or compromising vital organs. Management: •Crossmatch 10U blood. •ECG & CXR (exp- anded mediast inum is rare). •CT or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Take to ITU; hypotensives: keep systolic at ~100–110mmHg: labetalol (p140) or esmolol (t½ is ultra-short) by IVI is helpful here (calcium-channel blockers may be used if -blockers contraindicated). Acute operative mortality: <25%. Fig 13.52 Stenting: not an open or closed case … this is a digital subtraction angiogram showing correct positioning of an endovas- cular stent at the end of the procedure. Al- though less invasive than open repair, some are unsuited to this method, owing to the anatomy of their aneurysm. Lifelong moni- toring is needed: stents may leak and the an- eurysm progress (the risk can be reduced by coiling the
