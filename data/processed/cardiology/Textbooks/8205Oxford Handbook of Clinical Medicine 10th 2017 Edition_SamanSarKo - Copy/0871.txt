autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis leads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 there- fore remains unbound and conseqeuently cannot be absorbed by the terminal ileum. Incidence: 1:1000; :≈1.6:1; usually >40yrs; higher incidence if blood group A. Associations: Other autoimmune diseases (p553): thyroid disease (~25%), vitiligo, Addison’s disease, hypoparathyroidism. Carcinoma of stomach is ~3-fold more common in pernicious anaemia, so have a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy. Tests: • Hb. • MCV. • WCC and platelets if severe. • Serum B124. • Reticulocytes may be  as production impaired. • Hypersegmented neutrophils (p332). • Megaloblasts in the marrow. • Specifi c tests for PA: 1 Parietal cell antibodies: found in 90% with PA, but also in 3–10% without. 2 IF antibodies: specifi c for PA, but lower sensitivity. Treatment: Treat the cause if possible. If due to malabsorption, give hydroxoco- balamin (B12) 1mg IM alternate days for 2wks (or, if CNS signs, until improvement stops), then 1mg IM every 3 months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12 can be given after the initial IM course (50–150mcg/daily, between meals). Im- provement is indicated by a transient marked
