anti- body ELISA, PCR. (NB: not pneumonic so sputum cultures are Ωve). Treatment: Qui- nolone/doxycycline. Two agents if systemic disease, eg ciprofl oxacin+clindamycin or linezolid (then narrow according to sensitivity). Consider anti-anthrax monoclonal antibody/immunoglobulin as adjunct in inhalational disease. Bartonella • B. henselae (cat-scratch disease): from infected cat fl eas. Low-grade fever, re- gional lymphadenopathy. Encephalitis rare. Skin lesions mimic Kaposi’s sarcoma. • B. quintana (trench fever): from human body louse. Fever, headache, bone pain. • B. bacilliformis (bartonellosis): from infected sandfl ies in Andes mountains. Oroya fever = fever, headache, myalgia, haemolysis. Later nodularvascular skin lesions. Diagnosis: Clinical, blood culture (fastiduous  needs prolonged culture), serology. Treatment: Cat-scratch disease often self-limiting. Azithromycin, aminoglycoside. Brucellosis Most common zoonosis worldwide: 500 000 cases/yr. Gram Ωve infection of cattle, swine, goats, sheep, dogs. Human infection via ingestion of infected meat/unpas- teurized milk/cheese; or through inhalational/mucosal contact with animal body fl u- ids (eg farmers, slaughterhouse workers, meat packers, hunters). Risk in countries without animal health programmes. Presentation: Acute (<1 month), sub-acute (1–6 months), or chronic (>6 months). Non-specifi c: fever, anorexia, sweats, weight loss, malaise ( TB). Localized infection: septic arthritis, spondylitis, meningitis, endo- carditis, orchitis, abscess. Diagnosis: Culture with prolonged incubation
