which deposit in the kidney and activate complement. An underlying cause can be found in most adult cases, eg infection, cryoglobulinaemia, mono- clonal gammopathy, autoimmunity • C3 glomerulopathy: due to a genetic or acquired defect in the alternative comple- ment pathway, eg C3 nephritic factor. Progressive kidney dysfunction is common. Diagnosis: A proliferative glomerulonephritis with electron dense deposits. Im- munoglobulin deposition distinguishes immune-complex-associated disease from C3 glomerulopathy. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Underlying cause in im- mune-complex disease. Trial of immunosuppression if no underlying cause found and progressive decline in renal function. Treatments to block or modify C3 activa- tion are awaited. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331133 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 314 Renal manifestations of systemic disease Diabetic nephropathy DM nephropathy10 is the commonest cause of end-stage renal failure: ~30–40% of patients requiring renal replacement.
