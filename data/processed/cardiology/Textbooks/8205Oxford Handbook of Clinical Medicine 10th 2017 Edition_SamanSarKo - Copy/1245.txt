in anatomically challenging aneurysms. Complications Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death, and occurs in 20%, often in the 1st few days. Cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm may cause a perma- nent CNS defi cit, and is the commonest cause of morbidity. If this happens, surgery is not helpful at the time but may be so later.

Unruptured aneurysms: ‘the time-bomb in my head’ Bear in mind the old adage: ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fi x it’—usually, risks of pre- ventive intervention outweigh any benefi ts, except perhaps in •young patients (more years at risk, and surgery is twice as hazardous if >45yrs old) who have •aneurysms >7mm in diameter, especially if located at the
