Only perform if diagnosis equivocal—do not delay surgical exploration. Treatment: Ask consent for possible orchidectomy + bilateral fi xation (orchi- dopexy)—see p568. At surgery expose and untwist the testis. If its colour looks good, return it to the scrotum and fi x both testes to the scrotum. Undescended testes Incidence About 3% of boys are born with at least one undescended testis (30% of premature boys) but this drops to 1% after the fi rst year of life. Unilateral is four times more common than bilateral. (If bilateral then should have genetic testing.) • Cryptorchidism: Complete absence of the testis from the scrotum (anorchism is absence of both testes). • Retractile testis: The genitalia are normally developed but there is an excessive cremasteric refl ex. The testis is often found at the external inguinal ring. : reassur- ance (examining while in a warm bath, for example, may help to distinguish from maldescended/ectopic testes). • Maldescended testis: May be found anywhere along the normal path of descent from abdomen to
