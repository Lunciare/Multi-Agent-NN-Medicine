septic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: DM, malignancy, chronic dis- ease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol. • Streptococcus milleri: if found in blood culture look for an abscess—mouth, liver, lung, brain. Treatment: penicillin. • Streptococcus pneumoniae: pneumonia (pp166–8), otitis media, meningitis, septi- caemia. Treatment: penicillin. Vaccination: childhood, hyposplenism, >65y (p407). • Viridans streptococci: commonest cause of oral/dental origin endocarditis (p150). • Streptococcus bovis: bacteraemiaendocarditis. Look for colon/liver disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 338888 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Enterococci: 389 Gut commensal. Resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones leads to nosocomial colonization and infection. Most common is Enterococcus faecalis: if found in blood culture, assume endocarditis until proven otherwise. Treatment: intrinsic and acquired resistance including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Seek expert help. Gram-positive bacilli Listeria: Caused by Listeria monocytogenes which lives in soil. Able to multiply at low temperatures. Found in pâté, raw vegetables/salad, unpasteurized milk/cheese. Presentation: most asymptomatic, or mild fl u-like illness. In immunosuppressed (including elderly): gastroenteritis, local infection (abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, pneumonia), meningoencephalitis, life-threatening septi- caemia. Listeria in pregnancy may cause mild disease in mother but transplacental infectionplacentitis, amnionitis, preterm delivery, neonatal sepsis, intrauterine death. Diagnosis: culture: blood, placenta, amniotic fl uid, CSF. PCR. Serology is non- specifi c. Treatment:
