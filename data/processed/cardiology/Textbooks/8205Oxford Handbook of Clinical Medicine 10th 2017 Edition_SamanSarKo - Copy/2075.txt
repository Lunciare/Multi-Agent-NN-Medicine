fl ow to lungs. The source is often occult. Risk factors • Malignancy; myeloproliferative disorder; antiphospholipid syndrome. • Surgery—especially pelvic and lower limb (much lower if prophylaxis used). • Immobility; active infl ammation (eg infection, IBD). • Pregnancy; combined OCP; HRT. • Previous thromboembolism and inherited thrombophilia, see p374. Signs and symptoms • Acute dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, and syncope. • Hypotension, tachycardia, gallop rhythm, JVP, loud P2, right ventricular heave, pleural rub, tachypnoea, cyanosis, AF. With thromboprophylaxis, PE following surgery is far less common, but PE may oc- cur after any period of immobility, or with no predisposing factors. Breathlessness may be the only sign. Multiple small emboli may present less dramatically with pleuritic pain, haemoptysis, and gradually increasing breathlessness. Look for a source of emboli—especially DVT (is a leg swollen?). Investigations Risk stratify based upon clinical features (use 2-level Wells’ score for PE—p191). A Ωve D-dimer in a low-probability patient eff ective excludes PE.11 • U&E, FBC, baseline clotting. • ECG: commonly normal or sinus tachycardia; right ventricular strain pattern V1–V3 (p98), right axis deviation, RBBB, AF, may be deep S waves in I, Q waves in III, in- verted T waves in III (‘SI QIII TIII’).
