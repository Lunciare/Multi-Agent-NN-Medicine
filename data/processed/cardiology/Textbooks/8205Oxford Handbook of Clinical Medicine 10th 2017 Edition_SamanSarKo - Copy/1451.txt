It may be associated with hepatitis B, and is rare in the UK. Symptoms: See BOX. Systemic features, skin (rash, ‘punched out’ ulcers, nodules), renal (main cause of death, renal artery narrowing, glomerular ischaemia, insuffi ciency, HTN), cardiac, GI, GU, neuro involvement. Usually spares lungs. Coronary aneurysms occur in Kawasaki disease (OHCS p646). Tests: Often WCC, mild eosinop hilia (in 30%), anaemia, ESR, CRP, ANCA Ωve. Renal or mesenteric angiography (see fi g 12.16), or renal biopsy can be diagnostic. Treatment: Control BP and refer. Steroids for mild cases and steroid-sparing agents if more severe. Hepatitis B should be treated (p278) after initial treatment with steroids.52 Microscopic polyangiitis A necrotizing vasculitis aff ecting small- and medium- sized vessels. Symptoms: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis usually features; pulmonary haemorrhage occurs in up to 30%; other features are rare. Tests: pANCA (MPO) +ve (p553).
