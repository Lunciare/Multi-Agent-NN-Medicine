admit. Otherwise, before discharge patients must have: • been stable on discharge medication for 24h • had inhaler technique checked • peak fl ow rate >75% predicted or best with diurnal variability <25% • steroid (inhaled and oral) and bronchodilator therapy • their own PEF meter and have written management plan • GP appointment within 2d • respiratory clinic appointment within 4wks. Drugs used in acute asthma Salbutamol (2-agonist). SE: tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, K+. Hydrocortisone and prednisolone (steroid; reduces infl ammation). Aminophylline is used much less frequently and is not routinely recommended in current BTS guidelines, but may be initiated by respiratory team or ICU. It inhibits phosphodiesterase; [cAMP]. SE: pulse, arrhythmias, nausea, seizures. The amount of IVI aminophylline may need altering according to the individual patient: al- ways check the BNF. Monitor ECG. Aim for plasma concentration of 10–20mcg/mL (55–110μmol/L). Serious toxi city (BP arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) can occur at con- centrations ≥25mcg/mL. Measure plasma K+: theophyllines may cause K+. Don’t load patients already on oral preparations. Stick with one brand (bioavailability varies). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 881100 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of acute asthma 811 Assess severity of attack: PEF, ability to speak, RR, pulse rate, O2 sats Warn ICU
