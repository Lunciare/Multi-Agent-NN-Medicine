Does the eGFR refl ect the true GFR (p669)? Is the eGFR corrected for ethnicity/drugs (eg trimethoprim alters creatinine con- centration but not GFR)? Evidence of chronicity, ie >3 months—is there a previous creatinine on record? • Possible cause: Ask about previous UTI, lower urinary tract symptoms, PMH of BP, DM, IHD, systemic disorder, renal colic. Check drug history including when medications started. Family history including renal disease and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Systems review: look out for more than is immediately obvious, consider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive of systemic disorder (‘When did you last feel well?’)
