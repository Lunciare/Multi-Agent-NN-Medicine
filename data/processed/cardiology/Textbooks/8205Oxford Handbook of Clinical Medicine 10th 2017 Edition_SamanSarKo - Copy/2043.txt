If systolic BP <100mmHg, treat as cardiogenic shock (p802) and refer to ICU *Avoid supplemental oxygen if not hypoxaemic since may cause vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac out- put. If known COPD, hypoxaemia still needs correcting; give high-fl ow oxygen but monitor closely for CO2 retention (check serial ABG if needed) and reduce fl ow as soon as possible.

Cardiogenic shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion primarily due to cardiac dysfunction. It may occur suddenly, or after progressively worsening heart failure. Causes • Myocardial infarction (pp796–9). • Arrhythmias (pp124–31). • Pulmonary embolus (p818). • Tension pneumothorax (p814). • Cardiac tamponade (p154 and later in topic). • Myocarditis; myocardial depression (drugs, hypoxia, acidosis, sepsis) (p152). • Valve destruction (endocarditis—p150). • Aortic dissection (p655). Management See fi g 19.8. If the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital (see p796). • Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU. • Investigation and treatment may need to be done concurrently.
