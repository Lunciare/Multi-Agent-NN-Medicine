If in doubt over a high Ca2+, take blood specimens uncuff ed (remove tourniquet after needle in vein, but before taking blood sample), and with the patient fasted. Hypercalcaemia Signs and symptoms ‘Bones, stones, groans, and psychic moans.’ Abdominal pain; vomiting; constipation; polyuria; polydipsia; depression; anorexia; weight loss; tired- ness; weakness; hypertension, confusion; pyrexia; renal stones; renal failure; ectopic calcifi cation (eg cornea—see BOX); cardiac arrest. ECG: QT interval. Causes (See fi g 14.5.) Most commonly malignancy (eg from bone metastases, mye- loma, PTHrP) or primary hyperparathyroidism. Others include sarcoidosis, vit D intoxi- cation, thyrotoxicosis, lithium, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome, and familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (rare; defect in calcium-sensing receptor). HIV can cause both  & Ca2+ (perhaps from PTH-related bone remodelling).6 Investigations The main distinction is malignancy vs 1° hyperparathyroidism. Pointers to malignancy are albumin, ClΩ, alkal osis, K+, PO43Ω, ALP. PTH indicates hyperparathyroidism. Also FBC, protein electrophoresis, CXR, isotope bone scan, 24h urinary Ca2+ excretion (for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia). Causes of metastatic (ectopic) calcifi cation ‘PARATTHORMONE’ Parathormone (PTH) (p222) and other causes of Ca2+, eg sarcoidosis; Amyloidosis; Renal failure (relates to PO43Ω); Addison’s disease (adrenal calcifi cation); TB nodes; Toxoplasmosis (CNS); Histoplasmosis (eg in lung); Overdose of vitamin
