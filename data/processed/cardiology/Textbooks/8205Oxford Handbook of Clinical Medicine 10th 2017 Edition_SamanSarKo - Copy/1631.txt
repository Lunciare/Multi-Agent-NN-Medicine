nodes suggest a complicating factor (eg immunosuppression/HIV). : 5% lidocaine ointment + GTN ointment (0.2–0.4%) or topical diltiazem (2%) ; dietary fi bre, fl uids, stool softener, and hygiene advice. Botu- linum toxin injection (2nd line) and topical diltiazem (2%) are at least as eff ective as GTN with fewer side-eff ects. If conservative measures fail, surgical options include lateral partial internal sphincterotomy. Fistula-in-ano A track communicates between the skin and anal canal/rectum. Blockage of deep intramuscular gland ducts is thought to predispose to the forma- tion of abscesses, which discharge to form the fi stula. Goodsall’s rule determines the path of the fi stula track: if anterior, the track is in a straight line (radial); if poste- rior, the internal opening is always at the 6 o’clock position, taking a tortuous course. Causes: perianal sepsis, abscesses (see later in topic), Crohn’s disease, TB, diverticu- lar disease, rectal carcinoma, immunocompromise. Tests: MRI; endoanal US scan. : Fistulot omy + excision. High fi stulae (involving continence muscles of anus) require ‘seton suture’ tightened over time to maintain continence; low fi stulae are ‘laid open’ to heal by secondary intention—division of sphincters poses no risk to continence. Anorectal abscesses Usually caused by
