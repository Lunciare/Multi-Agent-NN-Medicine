It accounts for 15% of leukaemias. It is a myeloproliferative disorder (p366) having features in common with these diseases, eg splenomegaly. It occurs most often between 40–60yrs, with a slight male predominance, and is rare in childhood. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Present in >80% of those with CML. It is a hybrid chromosome comprising reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromo- some 9 and the long arm of chromosome 22—t(9;22)—forming a fusion gene BCR/ ABL on chromosome 22, which has tyrosine kinase activity. Those without Ph have a worse prognosis. Some patients have a masked translocation—cytogenetics do not show the Ph, but the rearrangement is detectable by molecular techniques. Symptoms Mostly chronic and insidious: weight, tiredness, fever, sweats. There may be features of gout (due to purine breakdown), bleeding (platelet dysfunction), and abdominal discomfort (splenic enlargement). ~30% are detected by chance. Signs Splenomegaly (>75%)—often massive. Hepatomegaly, anaemia, bruising (fi g 8.55). Tests WBC (often >100≈109/L) with whole spectrum of myeloid cells, ie neutro- phils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils. Hb or , platelets variable. Urate, B12. Bone
