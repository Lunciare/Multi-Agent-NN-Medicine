and thyroid hormones. 10% are part of MEN-1 syndrome (p223); 10% occur with other neuroendocrine tumours. Carcinoid syndrome Occurs in ~5% and implies hepatic involvement. Symptoms and signs: Bronchoconstriction; paroxysmal fl ushing especially in upper body (± migrating weals); diarrhoea; CCF (tricuspid incompetence and pulmonary stenosis from 5HT–induced fi brosis). Carcinoid crisis: See BOX ‘Carcinoid crisis’. Tests 24h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA, a 5HT metabolite; levels change with drugs and diet: discuss with lab). CXR + chest/pelvis MRI/CT help locate primary tumours. Plasma chromogranin A (refl ects tumour mass); 111Indium octreotide scin- tigraphy (octreoscan) and positron emission tomography (p739) also have a role. Echocardiography and BNP (p137) can be used to investigate carcinoid heart disease. Treatment Carcinoid syndrome: Octreotide (somatostatin analogue) blocks release of tumour mediators and counters peripheral eff ects. Long-acting alternative: lanreotide. Loperamide for diarrhoea. Tumour therapy: Resection is the only cure for carcinoid tumours so it is vital to fi nd the primary site. At surgery, tumours are an intense yellow. Procedures depend on site, eg rectal carcinoid tumours <1cm can be resected endoscopically. Debulking (eg enucleating), embolization, or radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastases can  symptoms. Give octreotide cover to avoid precipitating a massive carcinoid crisis.
