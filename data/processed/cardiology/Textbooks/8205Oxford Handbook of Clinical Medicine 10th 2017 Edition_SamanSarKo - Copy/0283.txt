ECGs fi gs 3.9, 3.10) • Within hours, the T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise. • Within 24h, the T wave inverts. ST elevation rarely persists, unless a left ventricular aneurysm develops. T-wave inversion may or may not persist. • Within a few days, pathological Q waves begin to form. Q waves usually persist, but may resolve in 10% of patients. • The location of these changes indicates the ischaemic area location, see table 3.2. Pulmonary embolism (fi g 3.11) ECG fi ndings may include: sinus tachycardia (com- monest), RBBB (p100), right ventricular strain pattern (R-axis deviation, dominant R wave and T-wave inversion/ST depression in V1 and V2,). Rarely, the ‘SIQIIITIII’ pattern occurs: deep S waves in I, pathological Q waves in III, inverted T waves in III. Metabolic abnormalities Digoxin effect: Down-sloping ST depression and inverted T wave in V5–V6 (‘reversed tick’, see fi g 3.19). In digoxin toxicity, any arrhythmia may occur (ventricular ectopics and nodal bradycardia are common). Hyperkalaemia: Tall, tented T wave, widened QRS, absent P waves, ‘sine wave’ appearance (see fi g 14.4, p675). Hypokal aemia: Small T waves, prominent U waves, peaked P waves. Hypercal- caemia: Short QT
