tendon refl exes. •No paraesthesiae or bladder problems. •No fasciculation (suggests anterior horn cell or root disease). Rapid onset suggests a toxic, drug, or metabolic myopathy (or a neuropathy). Excess fatigability (weakness with exercise) suggests myasthenia (p512). Sponta- neous pain at rest and local tenderness occurs in infl ammatory myopathies. Pain on exercise suggests ischaemia or metabolic myopathy (eg McArdle’s disease). Oddly fi rm muscles (due to infi ltrati ons with fat or connective tissue) suggest pseudo- hyper trop hic muscular dystrophi es (eg Duchenne’s). Tests ESR, CK, AST, and LDH may be raised. Do EMG and tests relevant to systemic causes (eg TSH, p216). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing may help reach a diagnosis. Muscular dystrophies A group of genetic diseases (see table 10.12) with progres- sive degeneration and weakness of specifi c muscle groups. The primary abnormal- ity may be in the muscle membrane. There may be unusually fi rm muscles due to infi ltrati on by fat or connective tissue, and marked variation in size of individual muscle fi bres on histology. • Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy: The commonest (3/1000 male live births). Presents at ~4yrs old with clumsy walking, then diffi - culty in standing, and respiratory
