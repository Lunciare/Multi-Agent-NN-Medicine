It is dependent (distributed by gravity), which is why legs are aff ected early, but severe oedema extends above the legs. In the bed-bound, fl uid moves to the new dependent area, causing a sacral pad. The exception is the local increase in venous pressure occurring in IVC obstruction: the swelling neither extends above the legs nor redistributes. Causes: •Right heart failure (p134). •Albumin (p686, eg renal or liver failure). •Venous insuffi ciency: acute, eg prolonged sitting, or chronic, with haemosiderin-pigmented, itchy, eczematous skin ± ulcers. •Vaso dilators, eg nifedipine, amlodipine. •Pelvic mass (p57, p604). •Pregnancy—if BP +
