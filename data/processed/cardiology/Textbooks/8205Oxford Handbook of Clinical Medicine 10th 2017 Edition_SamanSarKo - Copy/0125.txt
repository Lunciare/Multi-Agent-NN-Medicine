radio-femoral delay (coarctation of the aorta) and radio- radial delay (eg from aortic arch aneurysm). Blood pressure (see BOX ‘An unusual BP measurement’) Systolic BP is the pressure at which the pulse is fi rst heard as on cuff defl ation (Korotkoff sounds); the diastolic is when the heart sounds disappear or become muffl ed (eg in the young). The pulse pressure is the diff erence between systolic and diastolic pressures. It is narrow in aortic stenosis and hypovolaemia, and wide in aortic regurgitation, arteriosclerosis, and septic shock. Defi n- ing hypertension: see p138. Examine the fundi for hypertensive changes (p138). Shock may occur if systolic <90mmHg (p790). Postural hypotension is defi ned as a drop in systolic >20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg on standing for 3–5 min (see BOX ‘Postural hypotension’). Carotid pulse (See p42.) Jugular venous pressure (See p43.) Face Is there corneal arcus (fi g 2.7, p39) or xanthelasma (fi g 2.29, p60, signifying dyslipidaemia, p690)? Is there a malar fl ush (mitral stenosis, low cardiac output)? Are there signs of Graves’ disease, eg bulging eyes (exophthalmos) or goitre—p218)? Is the face dysmorphic, eg Down’s syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome (p706)—or Turner’s, Noonan’s, or Williams syndromes (p149)? Praecordium Palpate the
