in: suspected delirium, frontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check autoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic). Subtypes • Alzheimer’s disease (AD): See p488. • Vascular dementia: (~25%.) Cu- mulative eff ect of many small strokes: sudden onset and stepwise deterioration is characteristic (but often hard to recognize). Look for evidence of arteriopathy (BP, past strokes, focal CNS signs). Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or me- mantine in these patients. • Lewy body dementia: (15–25%.) Fluctuating cognitive impairment, det ailed visual hallucinations, and later, parkinsonism (p494). Histol- ogy is characterized by Lewy bodies (eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies) in brainstem and neocortex. Avoid using antipsychotics in Lewy body dementia (risk of SE, see p489). • Fronto-temporal dementia: Frontal and temporal atrophy with loss of >70% of spindle neurons. Patients display executive impairment; be- havioural/personality change; disinhibition; hyperorality, stereotyped behaviour, and emotional unconcern. Episodic memory and spatial orientation are preserved until later stages. Pick’s disease refers to the few fronto-temporal dementia patients who have Pick inclusion bodies on histology (spherical clusters of tau-laden neurons). Other causes Alcohol/drug abuse; repeated head trauma; pellagra (p268), Whip- ple’s disease (p716); Huntington’s (p702); CJD (p696); Parkinson’s
