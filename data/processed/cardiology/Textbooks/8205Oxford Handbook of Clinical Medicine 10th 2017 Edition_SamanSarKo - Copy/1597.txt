Appears above and medial to the pubic tubercle. •If no lump is visible, feel for a cough impulse. •Repeat the examination with the patient standing.

The best way is to reduce the hernia and occlude the deep (internal) ring with two fi ngers. Ask the patient to cough or stand—if the hernia is restrained, it is indirect; if not, it is direct. The ‘gold standard’ for determining the type of inguinal hernia is at surgery: direct hernias arise medial to the inferior epigastric vessels; indirect hernias are lateral.
