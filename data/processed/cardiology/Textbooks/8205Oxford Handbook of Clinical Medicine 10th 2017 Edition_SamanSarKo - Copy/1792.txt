(British surgeon) Brugada syndrome Note right bundle branch block and the unusual morphology of the raised ST segments in V1–V3 (fi g 15.2; there are three ECG variants of this pattern). This predominently autosomal domi- nant condition causing faulty sodium channels predis poses to fatal arrhythmias (eg vent ricular fi br illation), typically in young males (eg trig- gered by a fever).10 It is preventable by implant- ing a defi br il lator. Consider primary electrical cardiac disease in all with unexplained syn- cope. Programm ed electrical stimula tion may be needed. Relatives of those with sudden unex pl ained death may undergo unmaski ng of arrhythmias by IV ajmaline tests—but some re- sults are false +ve. Use judgement in subjecting those with ST abnormalities but no symptoms to electrophysiolo gical tests, right ventric- ular myocardial biopsy, and MRI. Mutations in the SCN5A gene (encodes the cardiac voltage- gated Na1.5 channel) are found in 15–20%. v Other mutations have also been described.11 Pedro & Josep Brugada, described 1992 (Spanish cardiologists).
