For example: • Bleeding in pregnancy or the puerperium. • GI bleeding in a jaundiced patient (ie coagulation factors already depleted). • Bleeding in someone who is already anaemic (esp if other comorbidities). 2 Why is the patient bleeding? Is bleeding normal, given the circumstances (eg surgery, trauma, parturition), or does the patient have a bleeding disorder (BOX ‘Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding?’)? • Is there a secondary cause, eg drugs (warfarin), alcohol, liver disease, sepsis? • Is there unexplained bleeding, bruising, or purpura? • Past or family history of excess bleeding, eg during trauma, dentistry, surgery? • Is the pattern of bleeding indicative of vascular, platelet, or coagulation prob- lems (p344)? Are old venepuncture or cannula sites bleeding (DIC, p352)? Look for
