Submandibular triangle (Bordered by the mental process, mandible, and the line between the two angles of the mandible.) •If <20yrs, self-limiting lymphadenopathy is likely. If >20yrs, exclude malignant lymphadenopathy (eg fi rm and non-tender). Is TB likely? •If it is not a node, think of submandibular salivary stone, sialadenitis, or tumour (see BOX for Salivary gland pathology). Anterior triangle (Between midline, anterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and the line between the two angles of the mandible.) •Branchial cysts emerge under the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid where the upper third meets the mid- dle third (age <20yrs). Due to non-disappearance of the cervical sinus (where 2nd branchial arch grows down over 3rd and 4th). Lined by squamous epithelium, their fl uid contains cholesterol crystals. Treat by excision. There may be communication with the pharynx in the form of a fi stula. •If lump in the supero-posterior area of the anterior triangle, is it a parotid tumour (more likely if >40yrs)? •Laryngoceles are an uncommon cause of anterior triangle lumps. They are painless and may be made worse by blowing. These cysts are classifi ed as external, internal, or mixed, and may be
