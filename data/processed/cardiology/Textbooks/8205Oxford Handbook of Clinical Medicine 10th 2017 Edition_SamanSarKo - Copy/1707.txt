Radical debride- ment ± amputation; IV antibiotics, eg benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. Skin ulcers Ulcers are abnormal breaks in an epithelial surface. Leg ulcers aff ect ~2% in devel- oped countries. Causes May be multiple. For leg ulcers, venous disease accounts for 70%, mixed arterial and venous disease for 15%, and arterial disease alone for 2%. Other contrib- utory factors include neuropathy (eg in DM), lymphoedema, vasculitis, malignancy (p596), infection (eg TB, syphilis), trauma (eg pressure sores: see fi g 10.16, p473), pyo- derma gangrenosum, drugs (eg nicorandil, hydroxyurea). History Ask about number, pain, trauma. Explore comorbidities—eg VVS, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, vasculitis. Length of history? Is the patient taking steroids? Are self-induced ulcers, dermatitis artefacta, a possibility? Has a biopsy been taken? Examination Note features such as site, number, surface area, depth, edge, base, dis- charge, lymphadeno pathy, sensation, and healing (see BOX). If in the legs, note features of venous insuffi ciency or arterial disease and, if possible, apply a BP cuff to perform ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI). Tests Skin and ulcer biopsy may be necessary—eg to assess for vasculitis (will need immunohistopathology) or malignant change in an established ulcer (Mar- jolin’s ulcer = SCC presenting in chronic wound).
