some bronch- dilator reversibility. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) +ve; diastase-re- sistant globules. Phenotyping: By isoelectric focusing requires expertise to distinguish SZ and ZZ phenotypes. Phenotyping can miss null phenotypes. Prenatal diagnosis: Pos- sible by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples obtained at 11–13wks’ gestation. Management Smoki ng cessation. Prompt treatment/preventative vaccination for lung infections. Giving IV A1AT pooled from human plasma is expensive but COPD ex- acerbations may be prevented (no good randomized trials). Liver transplantation: Needed in decompensated cirrhosis. Lung transplantation: Improves survival and has a comparable survival to transplantation in non-A1AT-defi cient COPD. Inhaled A1AT: Has been tried in lung disease. Prognosis Some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas others remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. Worse prognosis if male, a smoker, or obese. Emphysema is the cause of death in most, liver disease in ~5%. In adults, cirrhosis ± HCC aff ect 25% of A1AT-defi cient adults >50yrs. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 229900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Approaches to abnormal liver function tests (LFTS) 291 Abnormal LFTS can be found in ~17% of the asymptomatic general population. Also, remember that a normal LFT does not exclude liver disease. Tests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis Aminotransferases:
