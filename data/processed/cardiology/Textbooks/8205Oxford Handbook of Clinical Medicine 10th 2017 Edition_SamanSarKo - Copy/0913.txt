Aim for INR of 2–3; 3.5 if recurrent PE or DVT whilst anticoagulated. • Atrial fi brillation: for stroke prevention (p130). Target INR 2–3. • Prosthetic metallic heart valves: for stroke prevention. Target INR 2–3 if aortic valve or 2.5–3.5 if mitral valve. Duration of anticoagulation in DVT/PE: First episodes of DVT or PE require at least 3 months of anticoagulation. Consider extending this to 6 months in patients with more extensive, life-threatening clot at presentation, for those with transient but persistent risk factors (eg prolonged immobility) or if evidence of persistent clot at 3 months. For those with recurrent unprovoked emboli or underlying throm- bophilia (p374), consider bleeding risks against benefi ts of indefi nite treatment. Warfarin dosage and what to do when the INR is much too high Below is a rough guide to warfarin dosing for target INR of 2–3.
