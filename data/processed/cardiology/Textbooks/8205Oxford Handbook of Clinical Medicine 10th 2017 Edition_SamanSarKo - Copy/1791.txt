oesophageal adenocarcinoma). Diagnosis: Biopsy of endoscopically visible columnarization allows histological corroboration. The length should be recorded (using the Prague classifi cation). Management: Focus on detecting and preventing the most signifi cant associated morbidity: oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of progression is low (0.1–0.4% per patient per year, much lower than previously suggested). Risk factors for malignant trans- formation include age, , long segment of oesophagus involved, and evidence of dysplasia. Endoscopic surveillence for dysplasia is controversial and the evidence base is lacking. Current guidelines suggest that patients without dysplasia and in whom the length of involved oesophagus is <3cm should be considered for discharge from surveillance programmes, depending on the precise histology.8 For those with more extensive disease, endoscopic assessment every 2–3 years is appropriate. If high-grade dysplasia or intramural carcinoma is detected, endoscopic resection or mucosal radiofrequency abl ation (RFA) is recommended. If low-grade dysplasia is detected, it should be confi rmed by repeat examination after 6 months and by an independent pathologist, prior to RFA.9 Norman Rupert Barrett, 1903–1979 (British surgeon) Brugada syndrome Note right bundle branch block and the unusual morphology of the raised ST segments in V1–V3 (fi g 15.2; there are three ECG variants of this
