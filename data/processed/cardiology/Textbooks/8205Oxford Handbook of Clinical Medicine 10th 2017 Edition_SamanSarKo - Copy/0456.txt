4.3. Tests: CXR: peripheral nodule (fi g 4.8); hilar enlargement; consolidation; lung col- lapse; pleur al eff usion; bony secondaries. Cytology: sputum and pleural fl uid (send at least 20mL). Fine needle aspiration or biopsy (peripheral lesions/lymph nodes). CT to stage the tumour (p176) and guide bronchoscopy. Broncho scopy: to give histol- ogy and assess operability, ± endobronchial ultrasound for assessment and biopsy. 18F-deoxyglucose PET or PET/CT EBUS scan to help in staging. Radionuclide bone scan: if suspected metastases. Lung function tests: help assess suitability for lobectomy. Other lung tumours Bronchial adenoma: Rare, slow-growing. 90% are carcinoid tumours; 10% cylindromas. : surgery. Hamartoma: Rare, benign; CT: lobulated mass ± fl ecks of calcifi cation; ?excise to exclude malignancy. Malignant mesothelioma A tumour of mesothelial cells that usually occurs in the pleura, and rarely in the peritoneum or other organs. It is associated with occupa- tional exposure to asbestos but the relationship is complex. 23 90% report previous exposure to asbestos, but only 20% of patients have pulmonary asbestosis. The la- tent period between exposure and development of the tumour may be up to 45yrs. Compensation is often available. Clinical features: Chest pain, dyspnoea, weight loss, fi nger clubbing, recurrent pleu-
