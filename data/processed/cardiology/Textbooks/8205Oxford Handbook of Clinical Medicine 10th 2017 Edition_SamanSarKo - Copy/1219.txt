worse) on movement. Causes: benign essential tremor (autosomal dominant; improves with alcohol), thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, -agonists. • Re-emergent tremor: Postural tremor developing after a delay of ~10s. Causes: Parkinson’s disease (don’t mistake for essential tremor). Chorea Non-rhythmic, jerky, purposeless movements fl itting from one place to another—eg facial grimacing, raising the shoulders, fl exing/extending the fi ngers. Causes: Huntington’s disease, Syden ham’s chorea (rare complication of group A streptococcal infection). Worsened by levodopa. Hemiballismus Large-amplitude, fl inging hemichorea (aff ects proximal muscles) contralateral to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (often elderly diabet- ics). Recovers spontaneously over months. Athetosis Slow, sinuous, confl uent, purposeless movements (especially digits, hands, face, tongue), often diffi cult to distinguish from chorea. Causes: Common- est is cerebral palsy (OHCS p214). Most other ‘athetoid’ patterns may now be better classed as dystonias. Pseudoathetosis: Caused by severe proprioceptive loss. Tics Brief, repeated, stereotyped movements which patients may suppress for a while. Tics are common in children (and usually resolve). In Tourette’s syndrome (p700), motor and vocal tics occur. Consider psychological support, clonazepam or clonidine if tics are severe (haloperidol may help but risks tardive dyskinesia). Myoclonus Sudden involuntary focal or general jerks arising from cord, brainstem, or
