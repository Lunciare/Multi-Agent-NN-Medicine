the rest of the gland is suppressed. Ectopic thyroid tissue: Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, or struma ovarii: ovar- ian teratoma with thyroid tissue. Exogenous: Iodine excess, eg food contamination, contr ast media (thyroid storm, p834, if already hyperthyroid). Levothyroxine excess causes T4, T3, thyro globulin. Others: 1 Subacute de Quervain’s thyroiditis: self-limiting post-viral with painful goitre, T° ± ESR. Low isotope uptake on scan. : NSAIDS. 2 Drugs: amiodarone (p220), lithium (hypothyroidism more common). 3 Postpartum. 4 TB (rare). Treatment 1 Drugs: -blockers (eg propranolol 40mg/6h) for rapid control of symptoms. Anti- thyroid medication: two strategies (equally eff ective):17 A Titration, eg carbima zole 20–40mg/24h PO for 4wks, reduce according to TFTs every 1–2 months. B Block- replace: Give carbimazole + levothyroxine simultaneously (less risk of iatrogenic hypothyroidism). In Graves’, maintain on either regimen for 12–18 months then withdraw. ~50% will relapse, requiring radioiodine or surgery. Carbimazole SE: agranulocytosis (n eutrophils, can lead to dangerous sepsis; rare (0.03%)); warn to stop and get an urgent FBC if signs of infection, eg T°, sore throat/mouth ulcers. 2 Radioiodine ( 131I): Most become hypothyroid post-treatment. There is no evi- dence for cancer, birth defects, or infertility in women. CI: pregnancy, lactation. Caution
