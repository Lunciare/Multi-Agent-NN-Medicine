of fl uid containing roughly 70mmol Na+ and 70mmol K+ per 24h are required.1 Thus, a good regimen is 2–2.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20–30mmol of K+ per litre of fl uid. Alternative routes are via a central venous line or subcutaneously. However, remember that all cannulae carry a risk of MRSA infection: femoral > jugular > subclavian > peripheral, so always resume oral fl uid intake as soon as possible. In a sick patient, don’t forget to include additional sources of fl uid loss when calcu- lating daily fl uid requirements, such as drains, fevers, or diarrhoea (see BOX 'Special cases'). Daily weighing helps to monitor overall fl uid balance, as will fl uid balance charts. Examine patients regularly to assess fl uid balance (see BOX 'Assessing fl uid bal- ance'). Fluid compartments and types of IV fl uid For a 70kg man, total bodily fl uid is ~42L (60% body weight). Of this, ⅔ is intracellular (28L) and ⅓ is extracellular (14L). Of the extracellular compartment, ⅓ is intravascu- lar, ie blood (5L). Diff erent types of IV fl uid will equilibrate with the diff erent fl uid compartments depending on the osmotic content of
