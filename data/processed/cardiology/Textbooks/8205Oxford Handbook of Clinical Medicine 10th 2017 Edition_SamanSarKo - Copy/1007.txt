Capsular group B vaccine in UK infants since 2015: induces bacteriocidal antibodies, no population data, duration of protection unknown. Quadrivalent ACWY vaccine at age 14 and if high-risk travel. Additional B, C, ACWY doses if hyposplenism and complement defi ciency. Prophylaxis of contacts: ciprofl oxacin/ceftriaxone (single dose), or rifampicin 600mg BD for 48h. Neisseria gonorrhoea: see pp412–3. Moraxella catarrhalis: Colonizes upper respiratory tract in children ( in adults). Resembles Neisseria com- mensal so may be overlooked.
