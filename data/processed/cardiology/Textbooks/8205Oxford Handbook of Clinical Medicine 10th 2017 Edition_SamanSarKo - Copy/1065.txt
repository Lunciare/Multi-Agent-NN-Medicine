Staphylococcus aureus (p388), Streptococcus pyogenes (p388), and Enterobacteriaceae when surgery involves entry to hollow viscera (p391). Prevention methods include hand hygiene, strict asepsis, MRSA screening and decolonization, hair removal, peri-operative normo- thermia, minimally disturbed low adherence/transparent dressings. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 441100 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Clostridium diffi cile 411 Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus and most common healthcare-associated patho- gen. Part of colonic fl ora in 2–5% of healthy adults, and 20–40% of hospitalized adults. Disease occurs when it converts to a vegetative (growth) state with pro- duction of enterotoxins A and B, causing colitis. Typically happens when inhibition by competing colonic fl ora is lost due to antibiotic exposure. Presentation: Watery diarrhoea, mildfulminant colitis (pseudomembranes on endoscopy=‘pseudomembranous colitis’), ileus, toxic megacolon. Consider in all diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use, especially if marked neutrophilia. Diagnosis: Immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (common antigen) de- tects all strains of C. diffi cile. Detection of toxin (toxin immunoassay, toxin gene nucleic acid amplifi cation) distinguishes infection from carriage. Management: SIGHT: Suspect, Isolate within 2h, Gloves and aprons, Hand wash with soap, Test immediately. • Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO. • Severe (WCC >15≈109/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5oC): vancomycin PO (injection preparation can be given orally and is
