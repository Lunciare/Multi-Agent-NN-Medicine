Azathioprine (AZA) (2–2.5mg/kg/d PO) used if refractory to steroids, relapsing on steroid taper, or requiring ≥2 steroid courses/yr. Takes 6–10wks to work. 30% will develop SES requiring treatment cessation including abdominal pain, nausea, pancre- atitis, leucopenia, abnormal LFTS. Monitor FBC, U&E, LFT weekly for 4wks, then every 4wks for 3 months, then at least 3-monthly. Alternative immunomodulators include 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (CI:  of reproductive age). 5-ASA Unlike in UC, have no role in the management of Crohn’s. Biologics Anti-TNF: TNF plays an important role in pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease, therefore monoclonal antibodies to TNF, eg infl iximab and adalimumab, can disease activity. They counter neutrophil accumulation and granuloma formation and cause cytotoxicity to CD4+ T cells, thus clearing cells driving the immune response. These drugs play a vital role in both induction and maintenance therapy. CI: sepsis, active/ latent TB, LFT >3-fold above top end of normal. SE: rash. Avoid in people with known un- derlying malignancy. TB may reactivate when on infl iximab, so screen patients before starting the treatment (CXR, PPD, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)). Combined AZA and infl iximab can  effi cacy of  at 12 months, but there are long-term safety issues (eg
