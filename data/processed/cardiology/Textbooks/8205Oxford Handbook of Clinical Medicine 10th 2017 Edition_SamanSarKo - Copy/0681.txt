the treatment (CXR, PPD, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)). Combined AZA and infl iximab can  effi cacy of  at 12 months, but there are long-term safety issues (eg increased lymphoma risk). Anti-integrin: Monoclonal antibodies targeting adhesion molecules involved in gut lymphocyte traffi cking, eg vedolizumab, reduce disease activity and have a more gut-specifi c mechanism of activiy. Anti-IL12/23: Rep- resents a new cytokine target with an emerging role in treatment, eg ustekinumab. Nutrition Enteral is preferred (eg polymeric diet); consider TPN as a last resort. Elemental diets: (Eg E028®.) Contain amino acids and can give remission. Low residue diets: Help symptoms in those with active disease or strictures. Surgery 50–80% need ≥1 operation in their life. It never cures. Indications: drug failure (most common); GI obstruction from stricture; perforation; fi stulae; ab- scess. Surgical aims are: 1 resection of aff ected areas—but beware short bowel syndrome (p580) 2 to control perianal or fi stulizing disease 3 defunction (rest) distal disease eg with a temporary ileostomy. Pouch surgery is avoided in Crohn’s (  risk of recurrence). Poor prognosis Age <40yrs; steroids needed at 1st presentation; perianal disease; isolated terminal ileitis; smoking.
