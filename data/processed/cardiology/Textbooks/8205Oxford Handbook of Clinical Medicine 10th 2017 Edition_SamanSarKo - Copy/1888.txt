and is preferred over CT for musculoskeletal disorders and for many intracranial, head, and neck pa- thologies (fi gs 16.18–16.20). Multiplanar acquisition of images can provide multiple views and 3D reconstruction from one scan. MR angiography is also excellent for reconstructing vascular anatomy. This avoids the need for invasive angiography with femoral puncture or CT contrast in patients with renal impairment. Disadvantages Long acquisition times. Poor imaging of lung parenchyma. Claustro- phobic. Incompatible with some metal implants. High cost and specialized interpre- tation (=limited availability). Contraindications Absolute: •Pacemakers; other implanted electrical devices. •Metallic foreign bodies, eg intra-ocular (consider orbital X-ray to exclude), shrapnel. •Non-compatible surgical clips/coils/heart valves. Relative: •If unable to complete the pre-scan questionnaire. •Cochlear implants. NB: orthopaedic prostheses and ex- tracranial metallic clips are generally safe. If uncertain, ask a radiologist. Contrast: •Renal impairment (gadolinium can cause systemic fi brosis). •Allergy. •Pregnancy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 773344 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 735 Fig 16.18 T2-weighted sagittal MRI of the cervical spine.
