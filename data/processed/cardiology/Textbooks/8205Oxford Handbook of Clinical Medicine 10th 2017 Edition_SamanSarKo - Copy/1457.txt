achievable goals.57 Pharmacotherapy: Low-dose amitriptyline (eg 10–20mg at night) has been shown to help relieve pain and improve sleep. Pregabalin (150–300mg/12h PO) can be used if amitriptyline is ineff ective. Duloxetine or an SSRI can be used for fi bromyalgia with comorbid anxiety and depression. Steroids or NSAIDS are not recommended because there is no infl ammation (if it does respond, reconsider your diagnosis!). Chronic fatigue syndrome (AKA myalgic encephalomyelitis) Chronic fatigue syndrome58 is defi ned as persistent disabling fatigue lasting >6 months, aff ecting mental and physical function, present >50% of the time, plus ≥4 of: myalgia (~80%), polyarthralgia, memory, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue after exer- tion >24h, persistent sore throat, tender cervical/axillary lymph nodes. Management principles are similar to fi bromyalgia and include graded exercise and CBT. No phar- macological agents have yet been proved eff ective for chronic fatigue syndrome (see also OHCS p502). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 555588 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR Risk factors: yellow fl ags 559 Psychosocial risk factors for developing persisting chronic pain and long-term disability have been termed ‘yellow fl ags’: 59 Belief that pain and activity are harmful. Sickness behaviours such as extended rest. Social withdrawal. Emotional problems such as low mood, anxiety, or stress. Problems
