Then ask patient to follow one-, two-, and three-step commands ensuring these ‘cross the midline’, eg make a fi st with your right hand then extend your right index fi nger and touch your left ear. Problems with classifying dysphasias The classical model of language comprehension occurring in Wernicke’s area and language expression in Broca’s area is too simple. Functional MRI studies show old ideas that processing of abstract words is confi ned to the left hemisphere whereas concrete words are processed on the right are too simplistic. 7 It may be better to think of a mosaic of language centres in the brain with more or less specialized functions. There is evidence that tool-naming is handled diff erently and in a diff erent area to fruit-naming. There are also individual diff erences in the anatomy of these mosaics. This is depressing for those who want a rigid classifi cation of aphasia, but a source of hope to those who have had a stroke: recovery may be better
