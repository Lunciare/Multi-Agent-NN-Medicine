skin pigmentation, schwannomas, myxoma of skin, mucosa, or heart, especially atrial myxoma), and endo crine tumours: eg pituit ary adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and testicular tumour. MEN-1: • Parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma (~95%; most Ca2+). • Pancreas endocrine tumours (70%)—gastrin oma (p716) or insulinoma (p215), or, rarely, somatostatino ma (DM + steatorrhoea + gallstones/cholangitis), VIPoma (p258), or gluc agonomas (±glucagon syndrome: migrating rash; glossitis; cheili- tis, fi g 8.5 p327; ana emia; weight; plasma glucagon; glucose). • Pituitary prolactinoma (~50%) or GH secreting tumour (acromegaly:21 p239); also, adrenal and carcinoid tumours are associated. The MEN-1 gene is a tum our suppressor gene. Menin, its protein, alters transc ription activation. Many are sporadic, presenting in the 3rd–5th decades. MEN-2a: • Thyroid: medullary thyroid carcinoma (seen in ~100%, p600). • Adrenal: phaeochromocytoma (~50%, usually benign and bilateral). • Parathyroid hyperplasia (~80%, but less than 20% have Ca2+). MEN-2b: Has similar features to MEN-2a plus mucosal neuromas and Marfanoid appearance (p706), but no hyper parathyroidism. Mucosal neuromas consist of ‘bumps’ on: lips, cheeks, tongue, glottis, eyelids, and visi ble corneal nerves. The gene involved in MEN-2a and b is the ret proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Tests for ret mutations are revolu tion izing MEN-2 treatment
