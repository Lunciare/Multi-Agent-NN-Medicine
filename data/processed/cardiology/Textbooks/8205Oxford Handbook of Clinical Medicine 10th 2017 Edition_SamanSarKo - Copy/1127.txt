Presentation: • Asymptomatic passage of cysts in ~90% (‘luminal amoebiasis’). • Intestinal amoebiasis: dysentery (often insidious onset/relapsing), pain, colitis, ap- pendicitis, toxic megacolon. Amoeboma = infl ammatory abdominal mass, usually caecal/RIF ± obstruction. • Extra-intestinal (invasive) disease. Amoebic liver abscess
