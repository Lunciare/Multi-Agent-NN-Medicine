in the midbrain. Cerebellar tonsil herniation is caused by pressure in the posterior fossa forcing the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and upgoing plantar refl exes occur fi rst, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing, and apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and poor compliance in, the posterior fossa. Subfalcian (cingulate) herniation is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus (medial frontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the anterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke—eg contralateral leg weakness ± abulia (lack of decision-making). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 883300 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Immediate management plan for raised intracranial pressure 831 ABC Correct hypotension, maintain MAP >90mmHg and treat seizures Brief examination; history if available: Any clues, eg meningococcal rash, previous carcinoma Elevate the head of the bed to 30–40° If intubated, hyperventilate to PaCO2 (aim 3.5–4kPa): This causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP almost immediately. Maintain PaO2 >12kPa Osmotic agents (eg mannitol) can be useful but may lead to rebound ICP after prolonged use (~12–24h): Give 20% solution 0.25–0.5g/kg IV over 10–20min (eg 5mL/kg). Eff ect is seen after ~20min and
