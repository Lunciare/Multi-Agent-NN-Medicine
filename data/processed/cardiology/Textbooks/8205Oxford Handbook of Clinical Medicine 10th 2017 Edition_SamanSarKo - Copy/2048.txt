IV access. If haemodynamically unstable VT: Synchronized DC shock (see p894, fi g A3). • Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h, and 4mL 50% magnesium sulfate over 30min both via central line. • Follow with amiodarone 300mg IV over 10–20min (peripherally only in emergency). • For refractory cases consider procainamide or sotalol. If haemodynamically stable VT: Correct hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: as above. • Amiodarone 300mg IV over 20–60min (avoid if long QT) via central line. • If this fails, use synchronized DC shock. After correction of VT: Establish the cause (via the history and tests described above). • Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give IV amiodarone infusion for 12–24h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic: sotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function). • Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an implantable cardioverter defi brillator (ICD) may help. Ventricular fi brillation: (ECG p129, fi g 3.29) Use non-synchronized DC shock (there is no R wave to trigger defi brillation, p770): see p894, fi g A3. If SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine (see p806). Ventricular
