Diuretics (? from K+), domperidone, salbutamol/terbutaline IVI, ACE-i, telmisartan, celecoxib, lacidipine, ergot alkaloids, levothyroxine. Paraesthesiae ‘Pins and needles’, numbness/tingling, which can hurt or ‘burn’ (dysaest h esia). Causes: Metab olic, Ca2+ (perioral); PaCO2; myxoedema; neurotoxins (tick bite; sting). Vascular, arterial emboli; Raynaud’s; DVT; high plasma viscosity. Antib ody-mediated, paraneo- plastic; SLE; ITP. Infection, rare: Lyme; rabies. Drugs, ACE-i. Brain,thalamic/parietal le- sions. Cord, MS; myelitis/HIV; B12; lumbar fractu re. Plexopathy/monon europathy, see p502, cervical rib; carpal tunn el; sciatica. Peripheral neuropathy, glove & stocking, p504, eg DM; CKD. If paroxysmal, migraine; epilepsy; phaeochromocytoma. If wander- ing, take travel history, consider infection, eg strongyloides. Tremor Tremor is rhythmic oscillation of limbs, trunk, head, or tongue. Three types: 1 Resting tremor—worst at rest—eg from parkinsonism (±bradykinesia and rigidity; tremor is more resistant to treatment than other symptoms). It is usually a slow tremor (frequency of 3–5Hz), typically ‘pill-rolling’ of the thumb over a fi nger. 2 Postural tremor—worst if arms are outstretched. Typically rapid (8–12Hz). May be exaggerated physiological tremor (eg anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, drugs), due to brain damage (eg Wilson’s disease, syphilis) or benign essential tremor (BET). This is often familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of arms and head pre- senting at any
