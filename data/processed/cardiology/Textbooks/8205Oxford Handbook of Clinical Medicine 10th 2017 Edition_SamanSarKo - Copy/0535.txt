This opens the way to vicarious pleasure: a whole new world. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221111 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 212 Diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot care Refer early to foot services (podiatry, imaging, vascular surgery). Amputations are common (135/week)—and preventable: good care saves legs. Examine feet regularly. Distinguish between ischaemia (critical toes ± absent foot pulses and worse outcome) and peripheral neuropathy (injury or infection over pres- sure points, eg the metatarsal heads).

Neuropathy Sensation in ‘stocking’ distribution: test sensation with a 10g mono- fi lament fi bre (sensory loss is patchy so examine all areas), absent ankle jerks, neuro- pathic deformity (Charcot joint, fi g 5.11): pes cavus, claw toes, loss of transverse arch, rocker-bottom sole. Caused by loss of pain sensation, leading to mech anical stress and repeated joint injury. Swelling, instability, and deformity. Early recognition is vital
