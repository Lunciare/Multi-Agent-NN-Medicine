of metabolic acidosis. Anion gap: (Na+ + K+) Ω (ClΩ + HCOΩ) 3 See p670 for causes of raised anion gap (normal 10–18mmol/L). Administering oxygen Oxygen should be prescribed. Titrate the amount guided by the patient’s SaO2 and clinical condition. Humidifi cation is only required for longer-term delivery of O2 at high fl ow rates and tracheostomies, but may  expectoration in bronchiectasis. Nasal cannulae: Preferred by patients, but O2 delivery is relatively imprecise and may cause nasal soreness. The fl ow rate (1–4L/min) roughly defi nes the concentra- tion of O2 (24–40%). May be used to maintain SaO2 when nebulizers need to be run using air, eg COPD. Simple face mask: Delivers a variable amount of O2 depending on the rate of infl ow. Less precise than venturi masks—so don’t use if hypercapnia or type II respiratory failure. Risk of CO2 accumulation (within the mask and so in inspired gas) if fl ow rate <5L/min. Be careful in those with COPD (p812). Venturi mask: Provides a precise percentage or fraction of O2 (FiO2) at high fl ow rates. Start at 24–28% in COPD. Colours of masks: BLUE = 24%, WHITE = 28%, YELLOW = 35%, RED = 40%, GREEN
