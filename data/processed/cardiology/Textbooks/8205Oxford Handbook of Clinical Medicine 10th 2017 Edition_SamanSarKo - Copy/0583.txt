familial. Re- cent data suggest higher preponderance in patients with genetic mutations aff ecting several genes including SDH (succinyl dehydrogenase). Thus, family his- tory is crucial and referral for genetic screening (particularly <50 years old). A dangerous but treatable cause of hypertension (in <0.1%). Associations ~90% are sporadic; 10% are part of hereditary cancer syndromes (p215), eg thyroid, MEN-2A and 2B, neurofi bromatosis, von Hippel–Lindau syndrome (SDH mutations). Classic triad Episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia (± , , or BP, see BOX ‘Features of phaeochromocytoma’). Tests •Biochemical: 24h urine for metanephrines/metadrenaline (better than cat- echolamines and vanillylmandelic acid25), WCC. •Localization: Abdominal CT/MRI, or meta-iodob enzylguanidine (chromaffi n-seeking isotope) scan (can fi nd extra- adrenal tumours, p738). Treatment Surgery: -blockade pre-op: pheno xybenzamine (-blocker) is used before -blocker to avoid crisis from unopposed -adrenergic stimulation, -block too if heart disease or tachycardic. Consult the anaesthe- tist. Post-op: Do 24h urine metanephrine 2wks post-op, monitor BP (risk of BP). Emergency  : p837. If malignant, chemotherapy or therapeutic radiolabelled MIBG may be used. Follow-up: Lifelong: malignant recurrence may present late, genetic screening. 5 Tumours from the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, or zona reticularis associate with syndromes of  mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, or androgens
