mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin translocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a sys- temic infl ammatory response—even when the gut is not the primary source of pathology. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 558866 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Refeeding syndrome 587 This is a life-threatening metabolic complication of refeeding via any route after a prolonged period of starvation. At-risk patients include those initiating artifi cial feeding (enteral or parenteral) after prolonged starvation, or with malignancy, anorexia nervosa, or alcoholism. As the body turns to fat and protein metabolism in the starved state, there is a drop in the level of circulating insulin (because of the paucity of dietary carbohydrates). The catabolic state also depletes intracellular stores of phosphate, although serum levels may remain normal (0.85–1.45mmol/L). When refeeding begins, the level of insulin rises in response to the carbohydrate load, and one of the consequences is to increase cellular uptake of phosphate. A hypophosphataemic state (<0.50mmol/L) normally develops within 4d and is mostly responsible for the features of ‘refeeding syndrome’, which include: rhab- domyolysis; red and white cell dysfunction; respiratory insuffi ciency; arrhythmias; cardiogenic shock; seizures; sudden death. Prevention Give high-dose Pabrinex ® during re-feeding window.
