Handbook of Clinical medicine

gastro-oesophageal junction remains in the abdomen but a bulge of stomach herniates up into the chest alongside the oesophagus—see fi gs 6.18, 6.19. As the gastro-oesophageal junction remains intact, GORD is less common. Clinical features Common: 30% of patients >50yrs, especially obese women. Al- though most small hernias are asymptomatic, patients with large hernias may develop GORD. Imaging Upper GI endoscopy vis ualizes the mucosa (?oesophagitis) but cannot reliably exclude a hiatus hernia. Treatment Lose weight. Treat GORD. Surgery indications: intractable symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy, complications (see p254). Although paraoe- sophageal hernias may strangulate the risk of this drops dramatically after 65 yrs. Prophylactic repair is only undertaken in those considered at high risk, due to operative mortality (≈1–2%).
