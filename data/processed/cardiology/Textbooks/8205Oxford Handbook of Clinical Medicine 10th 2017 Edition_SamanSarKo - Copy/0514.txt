a way to image the gland. NB: non-functioning tumours or ‘incidentalomas’ may be found in health, see p224. Imaging alone does not make the diagnosis. • Aim to halt disease progression; diet and exercise can stop progression of im- paired fasting glucose to frank diabetes. 1, 2 For other glands, halting progression will depend on understanding autoimmunity, and the interaction of genes and environment. In thyroid autoimmunity (an archetypal autoimmune disease), it is possible to track interactions between genes and environment (eg smoking and stress) via expression of immuno logically active molecules (HLA class I and II, adhesion molecules, cytokines, CD40, and complement regulatory proteins). 3 Endocrinologists love this reductionist approach, but have been less successful at understanding emergent phenomena—those properties and performances of ours that cannot be predicted from full knowledge of our perturbed parts. We understand the diurnal nature of cortisol secretion, for example, but the science of relating this to dreams, the consolidation of memory, and the psychopathology of families and other groups (such as the endocrinology ward round you may be about to join) is in its infancy. But as doctors we are steeped in the hormonal lives of patients (as they are in ours)—and we
