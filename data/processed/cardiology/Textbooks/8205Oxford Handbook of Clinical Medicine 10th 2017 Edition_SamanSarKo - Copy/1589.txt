bowel obstruction can be managed conserva- tively, at least initially. • Immediate action: ‘Drip and suck’—NGT and IV fl uids to rehydrate and correct electrolyte imbalance (p668). Being NBM does not give adequate rest for the bowel because it can produce up to 9L of fl uid/d. Also: analgesia, blood tests (inc. amylase, FBC, U&E), AXR, erect CXR, catheterize to monitor fl uid status. • Further imaging: CT to establish the cause of obstruction (may show dilated, fl uid- fi lled bowel and a transition zone at the site of obstruction—fi gs 13.29, 13.30). Oral Gastrografi n® prior to CT can help identify level of obstruction and may have mild therapeutic action against mechanical obstruction. Consider investigating the cause of large bowel obstruction by colonoscopy but beware risk of perforation. • Surgery: Strangulation needs emergency surgery. Closed loop obstruction may be managed with surgery or endoscopic decompression attempted. Endoscopic stenting may be used for obstructing large bowel malignancies either in palliation or as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction (p616). Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions should rarely lead to surgery—see BOX, p581. 9 Fermentation of the intestinal contents in established obstruction causes ‘faeculent’ vomiti ng. True ‘fae- cal’
