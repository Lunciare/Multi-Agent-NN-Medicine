myocyte death varies, and signifi cant necrosis can occur without ST elevation. Risk factors Non-modifi able: age,  gender, family history of IHD (MI in 1st-degree relative <55yrs). Modifi able: smoking, hypertension, DM, hyperlipida emia, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, cocaine use. Controversial risk factors include: stress, type A personality, LVH, fi brinogen, hyperinsulinaemia, homocysteine levels, ACE genotype. Incidence 5/1000 per annum (UK) for ST-segment elevation (declining in UK & USA). Diagnosis An increase in cardiac biomarkers (eg troponin) and either: symptoms of ischaemia, ECG changes of new ischaemia, development of pathological Q waves, new loss of myocardium, or regional wall motion abnormalities on imaging. Symptoms Acute central chest pain, lasting >20min, often associated with nausea, sweatiness, dyspnoea, palpitations. ACS without chest pain is called ‘silent’; mostly seen in elderly and diabetic patients. Silent MIs may present with: syncope, pulmo- nary oedema, epigastric pain and vomiting, post-operative hypotension or oliguria, acute confusional state, stroke, and diabetic hyperglycaemic states. Signs Distress, anxiety, pallor, sweatiness, pulse  or , BP  or , 4th heart sound. There may be signs of heart failure (JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal crepitations) or a pansystolic murmur (papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD). Low-grade fever may be present. Later, a
