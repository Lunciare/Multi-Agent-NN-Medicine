Increased in (ie neutrophilia): • Bacterial infections. • Infl ammation, eg myocardial infarction, polyarteritis nodosa. • Myeloproliferative disorders. • Drugs (steroids). • Disseminated malignancy. • Stress, eg trauma, surgery, burns, haemorrhage, seizure. Decreased in (ie neutropenia—see p352): • Viral infections. • Drugs: post-chemotherapy, cytotoxic agents, carbimazole, sulfonamides. • Severe sepsis. • Neutrophil antibodies (SLE, haemolytic anaemia)—destruction. • Hypersplenism (p373), eg Felty’s syndrome (p698). • Bone marrow failure—production (p364). Other neutrophil responses to infection: These include: • vacuoles in the cytoplasm (the most specifi c sign of bacterial infection); • Döhle bodies: inconspicuous grey-blue areas of cytoplasm (residual ribosomes). Up to 17% of neutrophils from females show a drumstick-shaped Barr body (arrow, fi g 8.20d). It is the inactivated X chromosome. Lymphocytes (fi g 8.21) 1 . 5–4 . 5 ≈ 109/L (20–45%). Increased in (ie lymphocytosis): • Acute viral infections. • Chronic infections, eg TB, brucellosis, hepatitis, syphilis. • Leukaemias and lymphomas, especially chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
