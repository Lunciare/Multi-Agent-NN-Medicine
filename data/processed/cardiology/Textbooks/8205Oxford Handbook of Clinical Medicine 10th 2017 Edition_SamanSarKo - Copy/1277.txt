lifestyle, and patient preference: • Focal (partial) seizures: 1st line: carbamazepine or lamotrigine. 2nd line: leveti- racetam, oxcarbazepine, or sodium valproate.13 • Generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or lamotrigine. 2nd line: carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, or topiramate. • Absence seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or ethosuximide. 2nd line: lamotrigine. • Myoclonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate.13 2nd line: levetiracetam, or topira- mate (but SE). Avoid carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine—may worsen seizures. • Tonic or atonic seizures: Sodium valproate13 or lamotrigine. Treat with one drug and with one doctor in charge only. Slowly build up doses over 2–3 months (see BOX ‘Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDS)’) until seizures are controlled or maximum dosage is reached. If ineff ective or not tolerated, switch to the next most appropriate drug. To switch drugs, introduce the new drug slowly, and only with- draw the 1st drug once established on the 2nd. Dual (adjunct) therapy is necessary in <10% of patients—consider if all appropriate drugs have been tried singly at the optimum dose. Stopping AEDS: May be done under specialist supervision if the patient has been seizure-free for >2yrs and after assessing risks and benefi ts for the individual (eg the need to drive). The dose must
