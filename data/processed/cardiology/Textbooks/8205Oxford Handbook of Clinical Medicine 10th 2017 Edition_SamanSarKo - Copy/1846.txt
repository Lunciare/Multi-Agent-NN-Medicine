2 ataxia and 3 ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus, lateral rectus, or conjugate gaze palsies). There is inadequate dietary intake, GI absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine resulting in focal areas of brain damage, including periaqueductal punctate haemorrhages (mechanism unclear). Always consider this diagnosis in alcoholics: it may also present with memory disturbance, hypotension, hypothermia, or reduced consciousness.67 Recognized causes: Chronic alcoholism, eating disorders, malnutrition, prolonged vomiting, eg with chemotherapy, GI malig- nancy, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Diagnosis: Primarily clinical. Red cell transketo- lase activity is decreased (rarely done). Treatment: Urgent replacement to prevent irreversible Korsakoff ’s syndrome (p704). Give thiamine (Pabrinex®), 2 pairs of high- potency ampoules IV/IM/8h over 30min for 2d, then 1 pair OD for a further 5d. Oral supplementation (100mg OD) should continue until no longer ‘at risk’ (+ give other B vitamins). Anaphylaxis is rare. If there is coexisting hypoglycaemia (often the case in this group of patients), make sure thiamine is given before glucose, as Wernicke’s can be precipitated by glucose administration to a thiamine-defi cient patient. Prognosis: Untreated, death occurs in 20%, and Korsakoff ’s psychosis occurs in 85%—a quarter of whom will require long-term institutional care.
