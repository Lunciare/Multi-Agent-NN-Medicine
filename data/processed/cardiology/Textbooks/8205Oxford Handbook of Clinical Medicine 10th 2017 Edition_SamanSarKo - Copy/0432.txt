empyema. Ra- dionuclide scans: Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q, p738) scans are occasionally used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), eg in pregnancy (unmatched perfusion defects are seen). Bone scans are used to diagnose bone metastases. PET scans to assess cancer and infl ammation. Computed tomography: (CT, p730) Used for diagnosing and staging lung cancer, imaging the hila, mediastinum, and pleura, and guiding biopsies. Thin (1–1.5mm) section high-resolution CT (HRCT) is used in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and bronchiectasis. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used in the diagnosis of PE. Pulmonary angiography: Now rarely used for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy Performed under local anaesthetic via the nose or mouth. Diagnostic indications: Suspected lung carcinoma, slowly resolving pneu- monia, pneumonia in the immunosuppressed, interstitial lung disease. Bronchoal- veolar lavage fl uid may be sent to the lab for microscopy, culture, and cytology. Mucosal abnormalities may be brushed (cytology) and biopsied (histopathology). Therapeutic indications: Aspiration of mucus plugs causing lobar collapse, removal of foreign bodies, stenting or treating tumours, eg laser. Pre-procedure investiga- tions: FBC, coagulation, CXR, CT, spirometry, pulse oximetry, and ABG (if indicated). Complications: Hypoxia, bleeding, pneumo thorax (fi g 16.43, p749). Diagnostic sensi- tivity for cancer 50–90%, depends on
